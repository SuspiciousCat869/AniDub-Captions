[LOWELLMINA laughs]

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.964 position:50% align:center
So, when will you be
heading home? Soon?

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.717 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
Yes. It's been a lovely trip.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.218 position:50% align:center
Such a shame, though.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.263 position:50% align:center
I had my heart set on us taking
over the empire together.

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.015 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you won't
change your mind?

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:23.101 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Come on, give it up.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.562 position:50% align:center
Let's talk about
your real agenda.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.605 position:50% align:center
You've such a
suspicious nature.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.899 position:50% align:center
What could I possibly be up to?

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.694 position:50% align:center
A secret mission to
catch up with old friends?

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.237 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] If you won't come clean
on your own,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.781 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to draw you out.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:39.409 position:50% align:center
Well, here's what it
looks like to me.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.661 position:50% align:center
When spring comes,
the former allied kingdoms

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.706 position:50% align:center
are going to rise up and
revolt against the empire.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.542 position:50% align:center
Your goal is to stop it
from happening.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] My goodness.
And what makes you say that?

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.548 position:50% align:center
I investigated some
suspicious weapons

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.633 position:50% align:center
that've been
floating around Natra.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:59.054 position:50% align:center
I found out they
originated in the west.

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:02.057 position:50% align:center
And Natra's merely a transit
point. They're headed east.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50% align:center
The empire's stockpiling
weapons in case of a civil war.

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:06.895 position:50% align:center
The empire makes
the best weapons

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
anywhere in the world.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.856 position:50% align:center
But with three factions
vying for power,

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
there's just not
enough to go around.

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50% align:center
What's so strange about bringing
in weapons from the west?

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:19.657 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] The way they're being
divided up and distributed. See?

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
What's that?

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50% align:center
One thing about weapons is,

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center
it's almost impossible
to move this many

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
and not leave behind
a paper trail.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
Review the ledgers of
the arms dealers that work

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
with the Empire and
it's clear the weapons

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
are being equally allotted
among all three factions.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
Ensuring that the groups
remain evenly matched

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.760 position:50% align:center
and that the princes'
power struggle continues.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.596 position:50% align:center
Keeping the empire divided and
creating the perfect conditions

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
for a rebellion... You're trying
to thwart that scheme, right?

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50% align:center
If I really knew that
all of this was happening,

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center
wouldn't I just go to my
brothers and tell them?

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.690 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
You already did.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.858 position:50% align:center
And they ignored your
warning, didn't they?

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.235 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.945 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] The sad reality is,
as the youngest sibling,

00:03:57.028 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
and a woman, you wield
little political influence.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.700 position:50% align:center
When your brothers were no help,

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
you decided to go all in
on a roll of the dice.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
If you could goad one of the
rebel factions into making

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
an early move
against the empire,

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.459 position:50% align:center
your brothers would be forced
to take the matter seriously.

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.837 position:50% align:center
And you figured that
your best bet would be...

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] In Natra, or more
precisely, its neighbor, Gairan.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
Home to the stronghold
of Marquess Antgadull.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear. You've figured me out.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
Everything you've
said is correct.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
I learned what was going on

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
but couldn't get my brothers
to take it seriously.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
I knew the situation
was far beyond

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
what I could handle on my own,

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
so I devised a plan
to use myself as bait

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.986 position:50% align:center
in order to set the necessary
events in motion.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
Yourself, huh?

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.240 position:50% align:center
Meaning your place along the
imperial line of succession.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA grunts]

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:44.909 position:50% align:center
If the rebellion succeeds,

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
it's quite likely your older
siblings will be executed.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.789 position:50% align:center
If one of the factions
captures you,

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
they'll have a claim
to the imperial legacy.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
They may even credibly dub
their nation "the new empire."

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
I gave a lot of thought
to who among the rebels

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
would likely be enticed
by the prospect.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:03.094 position:50% align:center
I finally settled on
Marques Antgadull.

00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:06.056 position:50% align:center
Given his family's history
of betraying the alliance,

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
he can't count on much
support from the rebels.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.603 position:50% align:center
He'd stand to gain the most
from having me as a pawn.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
So I came here to make it
as easy as possible

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
for him to capture me.

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
And if he tries to do that then

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
you're counting on me
to put up a fight for you.

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
But have you considered
the possibility

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
that I'll simply hand
you over to him?

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
There's no way
you'd ever do that.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
Because of Ninym, of course.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
If you handed me over,

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
and the rebellion
was successful...

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
Have you thought about
what the result would be?

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
The balance of power
across the continent

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center
would shift in
favor of the west.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:41.424 position:50% align:center
In the west, Flahm like Ninym
are treated as slaves,

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
so you'd never take action
that would allow

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
their influence to grow.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
That explains it.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
It warms my heart to know

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.267 position:50% align:center
that Wein still has you,
right by his side.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
I couldn't quite figure out
what you were getting at.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
But now it makes perfect sense.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
Now I've told you everything.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
And if I've played
my cards right,

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
Marquess Antgadull's
forces should be

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
arriving shortly
to carry me away.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:07.909 position:50% align:center
All you have to do is stop them
and then I can save the empire.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
I hope I haven't let you down.
Calling myself your friend,

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
only to turn around and take
advantage of you like this.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
Oh, please.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
I'd expect nothing less from
the Lowa Felbis I know.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
I wonder, though.
Are you really sure

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
the marquess will be
sending his army here?

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
Uh! Don't tell me you've
made a move of your own.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
No. I just sent the marquess

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.515 position:50% align:center
a nice letter to
keep him in the loop.

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
A letter?

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Indeed.
I wanted to let him know

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.354 position:50% align:center
about a certain high-profile
visitor in Natra.

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:38.064 position:50% align:center
That her time here
was nearly at an end

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center
and she'd be making her way
to his manor. That's all.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I can't believe...

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.197 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Of course, you understand
what this means, don't you?

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
If the marquess believes
you're already coming to him,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center
then there's no reason
for him to attack.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Lowa. Guess you're
gonna have to figure out

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
another way to save the day.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.166 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA grunts]

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
Ah-hem. I see.
But just so you know,

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.297 position:50% align:center
there's a part of me
that still feels like

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
any second now Ninym's
gonna burst through that door

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
and deliver the news
you're being invaded.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
Think so, huh?
Care to make a bet?

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:13.099 position:50% align:center
Because I'm absolutely certain
that's not gonna happen!

00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.142 position:50% align:center
Your Highness!

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.310 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
I'm terribly sorry
for interrupting you.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
However, you're gonna
want to hear about this!

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:20.982 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
Uh...

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.904 position:50% align:center
[GERALT] So, you must be this
Crown Prince Wein of Natra

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
I keep hearing about.

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:30.617 position:50% align:center
In case you were wondering,
I'm Geralt Antgadull,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
son of Grinahae Antgadull.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
What a pleasant surprise
it is to have you

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
grace us with your presence.
I bid you welcome.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
Pretty modest reception,
I must say.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
[NINYM grunts]

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid your sudden arrival
caught us off guard.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.677 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what brings you here?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
What, now? You must know.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.931 position:50% align:center
I've come to claim
the love of my life,

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
my bride-to-be,
Princess Lowellmina!

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.769 position:50% align:center
After all this time,
that beautiful flower

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
has decided to let me pluck her!

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
That is what you were getting
at when you sent that letter.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.109 position:50% align:center
Isn't it, kiddo?

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Kiddo?

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.779 position:50% align:center
But of course, I should have
realized it immediately.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
The burning passion in
your heart is quite evident.

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
Right. How come I don't see
the princess anywhere?

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
You better not be playing
some kind of game!

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
She'll be just a moment.

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
We've prepared a room for you,
if you'd like to relax for now.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.877 position:50% align:center
Give her some time to make
herself lovely for you,

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
and I think, when
all's said and done,

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
it will be more
than worth the wait.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:28.466 position:50% align:center
[GERALT]
Hmph. I guess you're right.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
And then. Tonight,
there shall be a banquet--

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
in honor of our lovebirds.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.017 position:50% align:center
Somebody show me
to my room already.

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
[GRINAHAE]
My son is such a fool.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
He didn't even give me
a chance to stop him.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
But you know, Owl,
in the unlikely event

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
that he truly has won
the princess's favor,

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
all this business about
rising up against the empire

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
may suddenly be rendered
quite needless.

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:59.372 position:50% align:center
Please. I beg your pardon,

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
but the rebellion plot is
already well underway, my lord.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
With that in mind, prudent
judgment is called for.

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
Yes, I realize that!

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
So, we'll see how the
situation develops in Natra.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
[OWL] All the groundwork
that's been laid for civil war,

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
just to have him interfere.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center
Damn you, Wein Salema Arbalest!

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.310 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the thing is,

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.188 position:50% align:center
"burning passion" and all
that notwithstanding.

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
Why'd that big oaf
have to come here?

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
Seriously! He wasn't
even invited!

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
He's gotta be crazy to
just randomly show up

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:33.823 position:50% align:center
at the palace without an
invitation, right, Ninym--?

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center
The way he treated you
was unacceptable.

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:40.038 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. I get it,
though, I mean,

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
he is next in line
to become the marques.

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:43.458 position:50% align:center
I guess he's not so--

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
He irritates me,
absolutely irritates me.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Same here. Definitely.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
But maybe we shouldn't
let ourselves get

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
so angry over stuff like this.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
When you think about it,
anger usually ends up

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
causing things
to get out of hand.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50% align:center
Let's just think happy
thoughts instead, huh?

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.558 position:50% align:center
What kind of happy thoughts?

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
Hm... Well, just think about me!

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.650 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey, Ninym?

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center
Don't mind me.

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
[laughs nervously] But...

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
So, your letter did manage
to prevent an invasion.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
I'd have thought they'd
at least be mobilizing

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
their troops by then.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center
Well, Grinahae Antgadull
isn't known for bold leadership.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.417 position:50% align:center
If he had sent troops here,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
I think it's safe to say
he wouldn't have made

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.920 position:50% align:center
the call until the
last possible minute.

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:30.380 position:50% align:center
And what about Lowa?

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
Any idea what she might be
planning for her next move?

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
The banquet--you think maybe

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center
she'll try to sabotage
it in some way?

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh. As of this moment,

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
pursuing things with
Geralt is her best bet.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.101 position:50% align:center
As his adoring bride-to-be,

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
she'll manipulate him
into telling her

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
everything about the rebellion.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
Surely she's not really
gonna marry that pig!

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
Don't underestimate how far
Lowa's willing to go to achieve

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
her ends. Especially since
there's still more to her plan.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.032 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
The way she sees it,

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
she's already got Natra
firmly on her side,

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
which gives her a real shot
at taking the imperial throne.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
Taking the throne?

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
But I thought Lowa's objective
was preventing the rebellion.

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
Yes, and she still
means to do that.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.088 position:50% align:center
And when the empire's
been saved,

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
if she can seize the throne,
she means to do that, too.

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
Our Lowa's keeping
her eyes on both

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
of these goals at the same time.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Wait, though. You said
Lowa was counting on Natra

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
to help her take the throne.
But are we strong enough?

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] It isn't a matter of
military strength. No.

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
She wants to be seen as having
political support outside

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.608 position:50% align:center
the empire, while demonstrating
her acumen and strength

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
by being the one to save it.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
Put those qualities together,
and suddenly people back home

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
might see her as someone
they'd trust to lead them.

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.408 position:50% align:center
So that's it, then.

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
Our backing helps her
build up credibility. Uh!

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
But how's she gonna set
all this in motion now?

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.500 position:50% align:center
If she cozies up to Geralt,

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.878 position:50% align:center
then the marquess has no call
to make a move against Natra.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
You're right. In which case,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.590 position:50% align:center
she'll have to
turn things around.

00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.968 position:50% align:center
In other words...

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
You intend to have Geralt put an
end to his father's rebellion?

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'll break it down for you.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center
Geralt visits a neighboring
kingdom to meet his beloved.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
As the two of them grow
closer, he tells her

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center
of his father's plans to
rebel against her empire.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
They decide to join forces
and quash the father's

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
wicked rebellion themselves.
Pretty good, don't you think?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
But Your Highness...
Even combined, your retainers

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
along with Lord Geralt's
number very few.

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:28.123 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you can stand
against the marquess?

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
Then we'll need more troops.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
I guess we're just gonna have
to borrow some from Natra.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.588 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's definitely what
she's planning on, all right.

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
Well, tough luck! I'm not
letting the Natran army

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
get dragged into the middle
of an imperial succession war!

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center
So, what we have
to do is simple--

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
help Lowa out as much as
we can in dealing with Geralt,

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
but without getting suckered
into giving her any troops.

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for Wein,
getting the better of me

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:54.357 position:50% align:center
isn't going to be as
simple as he thinks.

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:56.860 position:50% align:center
His top priority will be doing
his best to ensure Geralt

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
and I get together,
since he sees that

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
as his way of extricating
himself from things.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
So, while all his attention
is focused on getting

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
what he wants out of Geralt,

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
I'll strike and have him
handing over his troops

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
before he knows it.

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
Honestly, Lowa's gotten us into
some sticky situations before.

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
But this one's a real doozy.
She's something.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.049 position:50% align:center
I thought I had Wein
exactly where I wanted him.

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.925 position:50% align:center
He's so full of surprises.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.802 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Just watch, the one laughing

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
when all this is
done will be me!

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.478 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Wise words indeed, Lord Geralt!

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.897 position:50% align:center
Your insight is
truly unparalleled!

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] That one so astute
as yourself has not already

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
taken center stage--

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.236 position:50% align:center
it is the empire's loss,
that much is certain.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.616 position:50% align:center
Keep praising me like this,
and I'm gonna start blushing.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:47.410 position:50% align:center
I'm hardly the type to
engage in idle flattery.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
I'm simply stating the facts
as I see them, nothing more.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
I guess that's okay.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.170 position:50% align:center
You're a lucky woman, Princess.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
Your wedding to Lord Geralt's
sure to be as momentous

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
an occasion as the empire's
seen in all its days.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
I believe you should announce
your engagement at once.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.471 position:50% align:center
The sooner the better, yes?

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.972 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Would you just
pair up with this lout

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.183 position:50% align:center
and go crush the
rebellion already?

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
You couldn't be
more right, Prince.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
Of course, you'll accompany us
to the empire, won't you?

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
I want everyone to see
that it was you who brought

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
Lord Geralt and me together.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.610 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Yeah, right.
More like I want 'em to see

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:22.862 position:50% align:center
that I've got Natra
backing me up!

00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
You know, for some reason,

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
I feel like you two
are well-acquainted.

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact,

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.372 position:50% align:center
we met when I was studying
abroad in the empire.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.874 position:50% align:center
Really? Studying abroad,
were you?

00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
And tell me, just
what kinds of things

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
did you get up to
in those days, huh?

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center
There was so much to learn,

00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
I spent most of
my time studying,

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
though I did do a little
fencing to break things up.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see. So, you can
handle a blade, then?

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
I suppose so,
in a manner of speaking.

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
As it happens, I'm an
experienced swordsman myself!

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:55.103 position:50% align:center
Isn't this surprising?

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
More like ridiculous!

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
So, what do you say?

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
Shall we dazzle
Princess Lowellmina

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.278 position:50% align:center
with a display of our
expert swordsmanship?

00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:05.321 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Seriously?!

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.866 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Come on,
humor the poor slob a little.

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] This won't be easy.
Maybe I can get out of it!

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:12.829 position:50% align:center
Good luck! Ah! Can't wait!

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Damn you!

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:19.586 position:50% align:center
[hiccups]

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:22.547 position:50% align:center
Okay now, so, what
are the rules here?

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
The first one to knock the
sword out of the other's hand

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
is the winner.

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
[GERALT hiccups]

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] They're not anywhere
near evenly matched, but...

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center
[GERALT] Hey, Wein, you're
abo--out to make me look

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
so good in front
of Lowellmi--ina.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:42.776 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
He seems to think he can win!

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:46.071 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] I can't allow Geralt to
make a fool of himself here.

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:49.032 position:50% align:center
And yet... I can't
roll over for him.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:51.201 position:50% align:center
I've got my own reputation
to think about.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
I gotta play this just right.

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.080 position:50% align:center
I'll begin by crossing
blades with him.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:56.164 position:50% align:center
When he starts getting winded,

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.415 position:50% align:center
I'll knock the sword
out of his hand,

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:59.000 position:50% align:center
and drop mine, too.

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
Then we can end in a draw!

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
[GERALT yelling]

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Now!

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:11.596 position:50% align:center
[WEIN yells]

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
[LIEGEMAN A]
Well done, Prince!

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
[hiccups]

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.992 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
I won! This is awful!

00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
Why in the world would you
go and do a thing like that?

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] If I drop my sword now,
maybe I can still avoid a win.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.043 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
Look out!

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.507 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
No way. You are kidding me!

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.509 position:50% align:center
You've already shown yourself
to be a bumbling idiot,

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
and now you want to add
dirty cheat to the list?

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:54.848 position:50% align:center
If I block or parry, he'll
have no room to save face!

00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.058 position:50% align:center
My only choice is to dodge!

00:16:57.142 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
But I have to do it so
casually that it looks like

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
I didn't see the attack!

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Damn, I'm good.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
[GERALT gasping]

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
[GERALT]
Ahh...

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:16.911 position:50% align:center
[hiccups]

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
[NOBLES murmuring]

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:24.044 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
Lord Geralt?

00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
[NINYM grunts]

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:30.425 position:50% align:center
Ninym! Is he badly injured?

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
Well, no. I wouldn't say that.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
I don't quite know how
to tell you this, but...

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
...Lord Geralt is dead.

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA gasps]

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
This can't be. Geralt's dead?

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.858 position:50% align:center
He fell from a balcony
while in Natra.

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
His squire just arrived to
deliver the terrible news.

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
--I'm sorry.
--I don't believe it!

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
There must be some
kind of mistake!

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:56.034 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER A]
His squire was carrying this.

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
His dagger, no.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
And then the rest of his men
were taken captive by Natra

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
and are being held
there as we speak.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
Only the squire managed
to get away from them.

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
Where is this squire now?

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
He collapsed from exhaustion.
We're letting him rest.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
Well, as soon as he wakes up,

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
find out exactly
how this happened.

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER A]
Yes, sir.

00:18:23.061 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
What fate befell that boy?
Illness? Accident?

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
Or is it possible this
was a case of foul play?

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
That must be it!
My son was assassinated!

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
This not only gives us
cause to invade Natra,

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
it makes doing so unavoidable.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center
And what's the princess's
role in all this?

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.206 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
why would the prince of
Natra send us a letter,

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
detailing the imperial
princess's travel plans?

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
If he did so with her
knowledge and consent,

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
that suggests the two of
them are working together,

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.593 position:50% align:center
which would mean that
Princess Lowellmina

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
was in on the assassination
plot as well!

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
But why? Could she have
somehow gotten wind

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
of our plans to rebel
against the empire?

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
This couldn't possibly
come at a worse time.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
If Antgadull attacks Natra,
he'll draw attention.

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
And at this delicate
stage we're in,

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:14.863 position:50% align:center
it's imperative that
we do whatever it takes

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
to avoid any scrutiny.

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:18.992 position:50% align:center
We'll have to reassess!

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
Gather our sources within
the manor at once!

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:22.704 position:50% align:center
[SPY A]
Yes, sir!

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
[FYSHE] I don't want to
overstep, but I think the time

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
has come to consider returning
home, Your Highness.

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
What do you mean?

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:33.256 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry things
turned out this way.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
I've seen how devoted you are to
the goal of saving the empire

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
and ascending to the throne.

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:40.680 position:50% align:center
However, I'm afraid
it's not safe for you

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
to stay here any longer.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.810 position:50% align:center
Fyshe, I...

00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:47.187 position:50% align:center
Fyshe!

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
Uh? Wait. Highness?
Uh. I'm afraid I don't quite...

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
You don't know what
this means to me.

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
I've always dreamed of having
someone I could really trust.

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
Someone so loyal they'd
have to confront me

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
with the truth,
no matter how difficult.

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:03.244 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't be silly.

00:20:03.328 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
Please, think about it.

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
I already have.

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50% align:center
What you said is true.

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:12.045 position:50% align:center
There's not a single word
of it that I can argue with.

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:16.091 position:50% align:center
If I continue to stay in Natra,
I'll be putting my life at risk.

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:18.593 position:50% align:center
But still. There are certain
things in this world

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:20.595 position:50% align:center
far more important than my life.

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
[FYSHE gasps]

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:25.934 position:50% align:center
Fyshe. As things stand right
now, I've no path to the throne.

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
Therefore, as a princess
who loves her empire dearly,

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
all that I desire is to
help bring about peace.

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
Hey, theoretical question.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
Say a noble's son got lured
to a neighboring kingdom

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
by a letter that once
seemed like a good idea.

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:42.992 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
And while he's there,
he kicks the bucket.

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
Whaddya suppose
people would think?

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
They'd think that
he'd been assassinated.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
That's exactly
what they'd think!

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
Come on, Geralt, why'd you have
to go and die on me, huh?

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.381 position:50% align:center
You just had to
challenge me to a duel,

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:57.465 position:50% align:center
and then when you messed it up,

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
you charged at me
like a big baby,

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
but of course you
messed that up too by

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.303 position:50% align:center
stumbling through a window
and falling to your death!

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
What the hell?!

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
It was a rather unpredictable
move, that's for sure.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
Forget about the marquess,
the way my luck's been going,

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.812 position:50% align:center
we'll probably end up at war
with the whole empire!

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
All I ever wanted was to help
bring Geralt and Lowa together

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.316 position:50% align:center
in the bonds of matrimony
so they'd go away

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
and get out of my hair!

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:17.819 position:50% align:center
All right, calm down.

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:19.571 position:50% align:center
The important thing
now is to preempt

00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
whatever move the marques
might be planning.

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're right. At this
point, everything's a mess.

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
Our goals are all tangled up.

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
But within the confusion
lies an opportunity.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
Whoever's able to
seize the initiative

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
in this moment gains
the advantage!

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.129 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN OFFICIAL A]
Pardon me, Your Highness.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.214 position:50% align:center
Princess Lowellmina has
requested a meeting

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
with you as soon as
it can be arranged.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
What would you
like me to tell her?

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:42.802 position:50% align:center
Show her in.

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:44.721 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN OFFICIAL A]
Of course.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
There goes the initiative.

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:48.641 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! I don't have
the slightest idea

00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
what Lowa's next
move is gonna be!

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
Perhaps she'll
protest Geralt's death

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.356 position:50% align:center
on behalf of the
empire, you think?

00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:56.399 position:50% align:center
If that's it, then you
can be sure she's

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:58.651 position:50% align:center
already got some sort
of demand in mind.

00:21:58.735 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.654 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN OFFICIAL A]
Right this way, Princess.

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:04.532 position:50% align:center
Would it have killed you
to take your time a little?

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.618 position:50% align:center
Well, here you are.

00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
I appreciate your
making time for me

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:10.288 position:50% align:center
on such short notice,
Prince Wein.

00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:12.582 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Please. I assure you,
every door in Natra,

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:15.669 position:50% align:center
including this one,
is always open to you.

00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:18.797 position:50% align:center
Heh. I'll make this brief.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.048 position:50% align:center
I give up.

00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:21.424 position:50% align:center
You wha--?

00:22:21.508 --> 00:22:23.176 position:50% align:center
It was foolish of me
to push my luck

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:24.928 position:50% align:center
against you in the first place.

00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:27.972 position:50% align:center
As of now, I'm giving up
on exploiting the situation

00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:29.641 position:50% align:center
for personal advancement.

00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:31.559 position:50% align:center
I've decided to put
all of my focus

00:22:31.643 --> 00:22:34.145 position:50% align:center
on crushing the rebellion.

00:22:34.229 --> 00:22:38.024 position:50% align:center
Now then, will you help me
figure out how to do that?

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:42.654 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Antgadull can muster
4,000 troops, at most.

00:22:42.737 --> 00:22:45.532 position:50% align:center
The province of Gairan as a
whole, maybe twice that many.

00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:47.325 position:50% align:center
I'd say that should be
a pretty fair picture

00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:48.827 position:50% align:center
of what you're looking at here.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.705 position:50% align:center
And we know they're using
weapons and armor from the west.

00:22:51.788 --> 00:22:53.832 position:50% align:center
Luckily, they have
few commanders.

00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:55.291 position:50% align:center
None of whom are any good.

00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:56.376 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:22:56.459 --> 00:22:58.169 position:50% align:center
They haven't got
enough horses, either.

00:22:58.253 --> 00:22:59.587 position:50% align:center
Which means if it comes to war,

00:22:59.671 --> 00:23:01.923 position:50% align:center
their army will
primarily be on foot.

00:23:02.007 --> 00:23:03.842 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
If it comes to war, yes.

00:23:03.925 --> 00:23:05.093 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
What was that, Wein?

00:23:05.176 --> 00:23:07.095 position:50% align:center
You sound like you're
getting soft on me.

00:23:07.178 --> 00:23:09.806 position:50% align:center
It's nothing like that! If you
really must know why

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:12.225 position:50% align:center
I'd prefer to avoid war
if at all possible...

00:23:12.308 --> 00:23:13.935 position:50% align:center
It's 'cause we're broke!

00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:14.853 position:50% align:center
Broke?

00:23:14.936 --> 00:23:16.187 position:50% align:center
Based on our current budget,

00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:18.648 position:50% align:center
we can only muster
about 500 troops.

00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:20.150 position:50% align:center
Are you putting me on?

00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:21.985 position:50% align:center
I can assure you that I'm not.

00:23:22.068 --> 00:23:24.904 position:50% align:center
We still have yet to recover
from our war against Marden.

00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:26.322 position:50% align:center
Right, Ninym?

00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:29.325 position:50% align:center
Yes, if we tried to muster
any more troops than that,

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:31.077 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid it would
have a dire effect

00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:32.495 position:50% align:center
on our political situation.

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:34.622 position:50% align:center
And I have no desire
to take on an army

00:23:34.706 --> 00:23:37.208 position:50% align:center
of 4,000 troops with just 500.

00:23:37.292 --> 00:23:39.169 position:50% align:center
Well, now. In that case,

00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:41.588 position:50% align:center
I can see why you'd
want to avoid a war.

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:44.257 position:50% align:center
But if a military solution
is off the table,

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:46.551 position:50% align:center
what sort of resolution
were you planning on?

00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:48.928 position:50% align:center
You seem to be forgetting
that military victory

00:23:49.012 --> 00:23:51.014 position:50% align:center
over the Marquess
isn't the goal.

00:23:51.097 --> 00:23:54.309 position:50% align:center
What we need is to expose his
involvement in the rebellion

00:23:54.392 --> 00:23:57.896 position:50% align:center
so that we can prevent an
empire from being overthrown.

00:23:57.979 --> 00:23:59.439 position:50% align:center
It sounds impossible.

00:23:59.522 --> 00:24:01.608 position:50% align:center
Guess it's a good thing that
pulling off the impossible

00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:03.234 position:50% align:center
happens to be our specialty.

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:05.278 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:24:05.362 --> 00:24:08.907 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] So, what do you say?
You ready to start schemin'?
