[exhales]

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.804 position:50% align:center
Wein. It's morning.
Time to get up.

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.396 position:50% align:center
Nice...

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.608 position:50% align:center
Dreaming about something nice,
huh? Wouldn't be me, would it?

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:11.279 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Her boobs are nice and big.

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:13.740 position:50% align:center
And I wanna squeeze 'em.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.871 position:50% align:center
Will you wake the
hell up, already?

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.373 position:50% align:center
[WEIN grunting]

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] I kept hoping our army
might show a little restraint.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.471 position:50% align:center
But no, they fought with gusto.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.473 position:50% align:center
And before I had a chance
to do anything about it,

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
they took the gold mine.
Well, it's done now.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
All we can do is make
the best of the situation.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Are you sure?
That would mean...

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:14.486 position:50% align:center
Yes, I realize what it means.
Another battle with Marden.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM]
Pardon me.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50% align:center
Highness. I've brought
your guest.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
I understand you're the head
miner. Pelynt, was it?

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to meet
you, Your Highness.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
I have some documents here.
I think you're going

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:35.799 position:50% align:center
to want to take a look
at what these have to say.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50% align:center
Say, Pelynt, can you confirm
this information is reliable?

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:45.433 position:50% align:center
[PELYNT]
Yes.

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
Ah. I see.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
Then it's safe to say
the Jilaat Gold Mine...

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid it's almost
totally depleted.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
Well, well, you don't say.
Oh, wow. Now, that is funny.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
[FYSHTARRE]
You can't possibly be serious!

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
The Jilaat Gold Mine's
been stolen away from me

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
by those wretched little
peasants of Natra?

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
If I may, sire--your anger
is more than justified.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.044 position:50% align:center
An outrageous affront
as this requires

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.088 position:50% align:center
a swift and decisive response.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
I believe if we'd had stronger
leadership in Polta,

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.719 position:50% align:center
the mine wouldn't have been
vulnerable to begin with.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50% align:center
Accordingly, I recommend
placing the matter

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center
in the reliable hands
of General Draghwood,

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
along with, shall we say,
30,000 troops.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
Holonyeh, slow down!

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
Assembling a force of
that size would require

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
pulling troops away
from our borders!

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
The mine will be back
in our hands before

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
any neighboring
kingdom could hope

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
to raise its army against us.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.906 position:50% align:center
Yes. Give it a week.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.743 position:50% align:center
That'll be more than
enough time, I'd say.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
[WEIN groans]

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
You still feeling
sorry for yourself?

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
Snap out of it--
there's work to do.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.168 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Give me a break.

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
After everything we
went through with Marden,

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.755 position:50% align:center
all we have to show
for it is a gold mine

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
that just happens to be
running out of gold.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center
I'm depressed, okay?

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
Yes, exactly why you can't
sit around moping like this.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
You must make a decision
about what to do next.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] What to do next, huh?
Well, the least painful option

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
would be to just
get out of there.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
Would you like me
to make arrangements

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
for an immediate withdrawal?

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.151 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
No. It's not gonna work at all.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:20.528 position:50% align:center
We can't abandon
the mine this quickly.

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:21.905 position:50% align:center
An unprovoked surrender would be

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
a massive black
mark on our honor.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
Wait! Suppose we find a way

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
to get ourselves into a
stalemate with Marden.

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
In that case, we'll be
able to sue for peace

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
and we can sell them
their mine back!

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
According to
Pelynt's information,

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
when Marden held the mine,

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.380 position:50% align:center
it was overseen by
this guy Holonyeh.

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he has
no clue that it's spent.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
And if he doesn't know,
it's a safe bet that

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
no one else in
Marden does, either.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
So, you're going to sell a mine
you secretly know is worthless.

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
Look, this is getting to be
a costly little escapade.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
If I can squeeze
some cash from it,

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50% align:center
then squeeze I shall!

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
All right, if that's how
you want to handle it.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
Let's see. We'd better get
right to work fortifying

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.611 position:50% align:center
the mine's defenses, and I'm
guessing we'll also want

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.531 position:50% align:center
to keep a close eye
on Marden's movements?

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.157 position:50% align:center
Probably for the best.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
Odds are, they're gonna send
a lot of troops our way.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center
[HAGAL]
Marden's host numbers 30,000.

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:32.350 position:50% align:center
And we have but 5,000.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
[HAGAL]
You were right, Your Highness.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
Marden's numbers are great,

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
greater than we're currently
equipped to handle.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
If we don't pull out now,
I'm afraid it'll only be

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
a matter of time until
their forces prevail.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
I wonder how long
they can afford

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:48.283 position:50% align:center
to maintain such a
large presence here.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.703 position:50% align:center
I'd guess a month's
time at most.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
If we can hold out long enough,
we may be able to drive them

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
to withdraw, allowing our
army to retain its honor,

00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
and proving to Marden
that retaking this mine

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
isn't gonna be
so easy after all.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.675 position:50% align:center
Thus, creating the opportunity
for a peace agreement!

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
[ANGLYRU] In the face
of a superior force,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
they would dig in
rather than flee?

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
How remarkably foolish.

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
I doubt those Natran barbarians

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
share our capacity
to think strategically.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
Still though,
we've got to be cautious.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
We cannot risk repeating
Urgio's tactical blunders.

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
Surely, you're not worried about
that, General Draghwood.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.073 position:50% align:center
Under your leadership,
our tactical prowess

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
far exceeds that of
Urgio on his best day.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
I hope the enemy doesn't
think his performance

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.121 position:50% align:center
reflects Marden's
true capabilities.

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center
That would be
unfortunate for them.

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:39.334 position:50% align:center
Ha! Don't say such things.

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
I'm only speaking the truth,
nothing more.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
The time has come, men.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
Our one month in the
quagmire begins today!

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:52.472 position:50% align:center
[MARDEN SOLDIERS yelling]

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN SOLDIER A]
Halt Marden's advance!

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.852 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN SOLDIER B]
Sweep them off the path!

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD]
Looks like we're right on track.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.403 position:50% align:center
Soon we'll take the
mountain's third station.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
What is this? How can Natra
still have the upper hand?

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:17.706 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIUS] Now then, Princess
Falanya, have you an answer?

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] Let me see.
So, what you're asking is:

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50% align:center
What would be the most
important strategic

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.171 position:50% align:center
consideration in
the current battle?

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.382 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIUS]
Hm?

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA gasps] I know!
It's the terrain, isn't it?

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
Well done, Princess!

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
The paths leading up the
mountain are quite narrow.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
It would be impossible
to effectively array

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
30,000 troops in such
a cramped environment.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
Because of this, only
several hundred soldiers

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:46.443 position:50% align:center
from each side are able to
do battle at any one time.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.403 position:50% align:center
But what if Marden
scales the mountain?

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.489 position:50% align:center
Couldn't they attack the
mine from the other side?

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center
[CLAUDIUS] If I know Prince Wein
like I think I do,

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.411 position:50% align:center
he'll have already had
the miners shave down

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
the mountainside to
preclude that possibility.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
But couldn't they build a
new path up the mountain?

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center
That would be
theoretically possible,

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:04.836 position:50% align:center
but it's rather unlikely.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
There are three different paths
up the mountain as it is.

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
Given that--

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:09.424 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see!

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
Building another path
isn't worth it to Marden!

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
And we want them to believe

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.555 position:50% align:center
taking the mine back by
force is the easiest way!

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
Exactly, yes! And what's more...

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
My strategy rests on making sure
they continue thinking that.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50% align:center
Well, now. It's your
move, Draghwood.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
Whatever you do,

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50% align:center
you'll be stepping right
into the palm of my hand.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.032 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD]
Thirty thousand against 5,000.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
And yet somehow,
despite that advantage,

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
you still can't take
that mountain?

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:41.039 position:50% align:center
Those damn barbarians!

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
[MESSENGER A] Excuse me, sir!
I bring word from our scouts.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.877 position:50% align:center
They've made an
interesting discovery.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
During their investigation,

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
they came upon an old mine
shaft, which seems to lead

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
into the heart
of the Natran camp.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:54.678 position:50% align:center
[ANGLYRU grunts]

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.225 position:50% align:center
Yes, we can use this.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
We'll be able to catch
those beasts unawares!

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
[ANGLYRU]
Light the torches!

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN SOLDIER C]
It's an ambush! Retreat!

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
[ANGLYRU] Come on!
Don't let them get away!

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.911 position:50% align:center
It's just like General
Draghwood said!

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD] This mine shaft
is a versatile asset.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center
They could use it
as an escape route

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.584 position:50% align:center
if the fighting gets too rough,
or as a secret passage

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.503 position:50% align:center
if they want to
get the drop on us.

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
I imagine they've
been holding on to it

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
as their secret trump card.
But now we know.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.760 position:50% align:center
And that knowledge has
turned their advantage

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
into their greatest weakness.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
Once we remove their
terrain advantage,

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
the Natrans will pose
no threat to us.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
Crush them with a
single mighty blow!

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.563 position:50% align:center
[MARDEN SOLDIERS panting]

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
[ANGLYRU] This armor makes it
difficult to run. Wait...

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
[ANGLYRU] Why don't they
have armor or weapons?

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
[ANGLYRU]
Can it be...?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
Oh no! It's a trap!

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
And that's that.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
I think I'm starting to get it
now. You're after their general.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50% align:center
You want to undermine
his confidence.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.221 position:50% align:center
Five thousand troops
against 30,000

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
are odds I can't overcome.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:25.685 position:50% align:center
But if I narrow my focus to
the commander of those 30,000...

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
Him, I can handle.

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
As Draghwood's confidence
is shaken,

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
his judgment will suffer.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
He's gonna start
making mistakes.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
And slowly but surely,

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:38.239 position:50% align:center
the tide of battle will
turn in our favor.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
You're so diabolical,

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
not that I didn't already
know that about you.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
Yes, truth be told,
I'm rather proud of it.

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD] Damn it, damn it,
damn it, damn it!

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
Those miserable Natran dogs.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
Do they think they can make a
fool of me and get away with it?

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:56.758 position:50% align:center
[COMMANDER A]
Please, General!

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
It's true, losing Anglyru
is a painful setback.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50% align:center
But when that shaft caved in,
Natra lost their means

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:04.099 position:50% align:center
of covert movement
through the area.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
That's a win for us.

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
I suppose you're right.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:13.566 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD] Celebrate while
you can, you scum.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
I'm going to destroy
every last one of you!

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:28.123 position:50% align:center
We've taken it, General!
The fort near the first station!

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.291 position:50% align:center
Excellent news!

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.135 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's light 'em up!

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM] Highness! All right!
Follow my lead, soldiers!

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
[NATRA SOLDIERS yell]

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center

[MARDEN SOLDIERS scream]

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
[MARDENIAN SOLDIER B]
General! We're under attack!

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.606 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50% align:center
[MARDEN SOLDIERS chattering]

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
General! I've received
multiple reports

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
of Natran troops setting
our camps ablaze!

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
How many?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
[COMMANDER B]
Don't know, exactly.

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:05.744 position:50% align:center
Could be a hundred cavalry,
or several hundred.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
Damn! They'll pay for this!
Where are they now?

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.498 position:50% align:center
[COMMANDER B]
We don't know that, either!

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD]
What's happening?

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center
It can't be.

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
Is their whole army
charging down here?

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
What are they thinking?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
We're 30,000 strong!

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.513 position:50% align:center
A mere 5,000 can't
stand against us!

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
So, what is it, then?

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
Perhaps they're planning
a targeted strike

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
against my headquarters.

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
Or maybe they mean to take
advantage of the confusion

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50% align:center
to storm through and claim
the heads of our commanders!

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
That could be it!

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
Gather all nearby troops
here at headquarters!

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:43.573 position:50% align:center
Have them form
a line of defense.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.867 position:50% align:center
Direct the other
camps to stand by!

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.577 position:50% align:center
[COMMANDER B]
Yes, sir!

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD] Wretched savages.
You underestimate me.

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
You will not claim
my head so easily!

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:01.299 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD]
Boulders and logs?

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
Then all that commotion
was just a ploy

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:06.304 position:50% align:center
to make us think they were
moving in on our headquarters?

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
But why? I just don't
understand it!

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.685 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I see now.

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center
They were creating
an opportunity

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
to retake the
first station fort!

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD]
Damn you!

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Wow! I must say,
this is going better

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
than I could have hoped for!

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:30.995 position:50% align:center
We're okay on food.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.580 position:50% align:center
Our other supplies
are dwindling,

00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:33.998 position:50% align:center
but we're fine for now.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:36.209 position:50% align:center
And troop morale
remains quite high,

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
which is no surprise,

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
considering how well
things are going.

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:41.756 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, the
Mardenian offensive

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
seems to have fallen
off considerably.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
Perhaps we can expect
them to withdraw soon.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
Ha! No. They're not ready
to cut their losses

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
just yet, 'cause they've
got nothing to show for them.

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:53.643 position:50% align:center
And if I had to guess.

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
We're looking at
a couple more weeks

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.313 position:50% align:center
before we can kiss
this place goodbye.

00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
That day can't come soon enough.
The view from this mountain

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:03.570 position:50% align:center
is turning into an eyesore.
And then more importantly.

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
I could really use a bath,
but the hot water's too scarce.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,
you have been keeping

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.287 position:50% align:center
your distance from me lately.
You must smell--

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
Don't even think about
finishing that sentence.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center
[WEIN groans]
You won't defeat me that easily!

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
I wasn't trying to defeat you.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM]
Pardon me. Your Highness.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:25.258 position:50% align:center
An envoy from Marden
is asking to see you.

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
[LOGAN] First, let's make
one thing clear.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:31.765 position:50% align:center
General Draghwood has
authorized me to negotiate

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
on his behalf, so take my
words as coming from him.

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
Well, now, Prince Wein,
what your dogs

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:41.066 position:50% align:center
have accomplished--
it's impressive.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
Or should I say,

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:44.152 position:50% align:center
what you have
accomplished through them.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center
You may be interested
to know that the general

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.697 position:50% align:center
thinks quite highly of you.

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN SOLDIER E growls]

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
Commander Logan.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
Might I politely request
that you get to the point?

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
Surely you haven't come
here to waste our time

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
with passive-aggressive
provocations.

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
[LOGAN] Hmph.
Yes, let's get to it then.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
Marden wants to propose
a peace agreement.

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Hm?

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
[LOGAN] The terms we seek
are quite simple.

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
We ask that you withdraw
from the mine immediately,

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:10.970 position:50% align:center
surrender your weapons,

00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
and free the mining
town's residents.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
And last but not least,
we would have to insist

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
you offer us restitution,

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
to compensate for your
unjust occupation.

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Quite a list of demands.

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center
So, what do you say
to that, Prince Wein?

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] You're not proposing
a peace treaty.

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:29.239 position:50% align:center
You're demanding
unconditional surrender.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.574 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, we won't
be able to agree

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
to the terms you've proposed.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
What a shame. Then again,

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
I suppose this is what
comes of lying with dogs.

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
If you'll permit me to offer you
a word of friendly advice--

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.045 position:50% align:center
I suggest you keep
someone by your side

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:47.215 position:50% align:center
who's willing to question your
judgment when necessary.

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:51.136 position:50% align:center
[LOGAN]
At the very least.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
Find yourself someone
more appropriate

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:55.306 position:50% align:center
than that filthy Flahm
you've got there.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
To keep one of such
low birth on your side.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
Surely it isn't lost
on you how poorly

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:01.813 position:50% align:center
it reflects on
your noble lineage.

00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Commander Logan.
Shortly after you arrived,

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center
you told me I should
take your words

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
as coming from
General Draghwood.

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
Did you not?

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.
What about it?

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.709 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
It's nothing.

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:26.379 position:50% align:center
When you see the general,
please let him know

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:29.799 position:50% align:center
that Prince Wein sends
his very best wishes.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD]
It's been three long weeks.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.640 position:50% align:center
But this disgrace
is finally at an end.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
I swear before you all
that when this day is over,

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
Natran blood will flow through
every crevice of that mountain.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD] Hmph. Nothing but
a matter of time at this point.

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
--[SOLDIER] General!
--[horse whinnies]

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
I must see General Draghwood
as soon as possible!

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.419 position:50% align:center
I have an urgent message
from Commander Logan!

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.797 position:50% align:center
Deliver it, then!
Be quick about it.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER]
Yes, sir. Here!

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
Logan!

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
He says he'll see you in hell!

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD grunts]

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:18.807 position:50% align:center
General!

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
[COMMANDER D groans]

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
[COMMANDER C groans]

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No, is it really you?

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
I don't believe
that I've officially

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:36.074 position:50% align:center
had the pleasure,
General Draghwood.

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
What do you want, Wein?
Why have you come here?

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
It's quite simple, really, I've
come here to take your head.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
Help! Someone!

00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
It's no use.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
Right now, every soldier
in your command

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
is fighting to take
back the mountain.

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.631 position:50% align:center
Their headquarters is the last
thing they're thinking about.

00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
Surely somebody
must have noticed

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.552 position:50% align:center
as you were making your
way down the mountain.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
Any minute, word will reach
one of the officers,

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
and then you'll be--

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
Only thing is, we didn't
come down the mountain.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
You remember the mine shaft?
We came through there.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
But that's impossible.

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
All that rubble would take
months to clear out.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:10.400 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Not that mine shaft.

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
I was referring to the
one right beside it.

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
The one I had the miners
build before you got here.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center
It stretches from the
interior of the mine

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
all the way to the
entrance of the cave.

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you telling me...?

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
That's right. The real
reason behind the shaft

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
collapse was that we
wanted you to believe

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
the cave wasn't
a factor anymore.

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD gasps]

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
The rest was simple.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
Dig one last connecting
shaft and then

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
make our entrance
disguised in your armor.

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
We marched right in,

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
your men never looked
twice at us. Funny, huh?

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD exhales]
So, this whole time

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
you had me right in
the palm of your hand.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:50.398 position:50% align:center
[DRAGHWOOD yelling]

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:54.652 position:50% align:center
Now, I really hadn't planned on
getting so directly involved.

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.696 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.284 position:50% align:center
[groaning]

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.287 position:50% align:center
But it so happens that
Ninym is my heart.

00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
And anyone who dares
to wound my heart...

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
...shall forfeit
their life at my hand.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
[FYSHE]
I don't believe it.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:19.052 position:50% align:center
Crown Prince Wein
actually attended

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
the empire's military academy?

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
No. It isn't possible.

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:24.974 position:50% align:center
If this were true,
then it would've shown up

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
in my research.

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
That explains it.

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
Why else would all these
top grades be redacted.

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:34.484 position:50% align:center
Unless the empire
was concealing evidence

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
that its own cadets
were far outperformed

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
by a royal from another kingdom.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
If all this is true, we've
only ourselves to blame.

00:20:44.035 --> 00:20:46.996 position:50% align:center
The empire supported
the growth of the fangs

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
that it now finds poised
to sink into its neck.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
Wein Salema Arbalest,
you are a truly terrifying man.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN OFFICIAL A]
Now then. Let's raise

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
our glasses shall we? To Natra!

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
[NATRA OFFICIALS]
To Natra!

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:04.222 position:50% align:center
The prince regent
is a marvel indeed.

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.599 position:50% align:center
Who else could have achieved
such a stunning victory?

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:08.143 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN COMMANDER A]
Prince Wein was amazing.

00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
I wish you could have
seen him for yourself!

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
He possesses a valiance
that stirs the heart!

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Your Highness.

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
May I have a moment
of your time, please?

00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
So, what did you want
to discuss with me?

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.326 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] We've gotten word
from one of our spies

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
stationed in Marden's capital.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd want
to know right away.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:29.622 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:21:29.706 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
Apparently,
the city was invaded.

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
Invaded...

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you kidding me?

00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:38.173 position:50% align:center
Invaded by whom?

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:39.924 position:50% align:center
One of the neighbor
kingdoms, Cahvarin...

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
With so many troops
dispatched to the mine,

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.054 position:50% align:center
the city was unable
to defend itself,

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
and thus fell quickly.

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
King Fyshtarre has
perished, as well.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:51.436 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] It's not fair, Ninym.
The whole point of all this

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:55.231 position:50% align:center
was to get into peace
negotiations with Marden.

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:56.816 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.320 position:50% align:center
But it's hard to negotiate peace
with a kingdom that's fallen.

00:22:00.403 --> 00:22:03.573 position:50% align:center
It's all over with now.
Finished. Done.

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:07.702 position:50% align:center
I didn't even get the
chance to sell the mine!

00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:08.745 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Speaking of which...

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.747 position:50% align:center
I have a report
from Pelynt as well.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.249 position:50% align:center
Huh? "We have found
a new gold vein."

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:15.001 position:50% align:center
Wha-- What the...?

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:16.252 position:50% align:center
Just what it says.

00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:18.463 position:50% align:center
It won't be as productive
as its glory days,

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:20.173 position:50% align:center
but at least it's
got some value.

00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:24.010 position:50% align:center
[WEIN laughs] I was not looking
forward to telling the military

00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:26.054 position:50% align:center
the mine they fought so
hard for was worthless.

00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:27.055 position:50% align:center
And now, because of this,

00:22:27.138 --> 00:22:29.683 position:50% align:center
I'm never, ever
going to have to!

00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:32.811 position:50% align:center
All right! I've finally got
myself a little breathing room.

00:22:32.894 --> 00:22:35.939 position:50% align:center
Man. Things sure have
been busy lately.

00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:37.857 position:50% align:center
But now I'll have a chance
to take some time off and--

00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:41.528 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Actually, you have ambassadors

00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:43.321 position:50% align:center
from western nations
who've been waiting

00:22:43.405 --> 00:22:45.115 position:50% align:center
to meet with you.
There are numerous

00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:47.367 position:50% align:center
budgetary matters
requiring your attention.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.119 position:50% align:center
You'll need to catch up
on town inspections

00:22:49.202 --> 00:22:50.704 position:50% align:center
postponed by the war.

00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:53.915 position:50% align:center
And your sister, the princess,
has been missing you terribly.

00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:55.542 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid with
all this work to do,

00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:57.961 position:50% align:center
you won't have any time to rest.

00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:05.552 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to sell
this kingdom!
