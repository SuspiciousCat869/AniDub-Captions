WEBVTT

00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:02.350
[WEIN]
Thanks to your help,

00:00:02.393 --> 00:00:04.917
we were able to evacuate
the city of Mealtars

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:08.225
and its citizens are now
safe and unharmed.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.055
On their behalf, and mine,
please accept our gratitude.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.666
Well, the Teachings of
Levetia command us to help

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.191
the oppressed, so we
were happy to do it.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:21.151
Now all those people are safe
from the tyranny of the empire.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:23.806
So how did you end up as
Mealtars' representative

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.416
in all this?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.724
Actually, I'm afraid that's a
long and complicated story.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:30.943
Suffice it to say this
gentleman is the mayor,

00:00:30.987 --> 00:00:33.033
and I have his approval.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.255
[WEIN] And now I have a
question for you, if I may,

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.736
after so graciously
offering us your protection,

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:42.738
what will you and
your army do now?

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:45.567
Why drive back the princes
and free the city, of course.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.135
That would be the
obvious next move.

00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:49.875
Right, King Gruyere?

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.487
Indeed, that was the plan.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.011
That is most generous
of you, but in helping

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.666
all those people escape
the city without injury,

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:00.495
you've already done much more
than we could ever repay.

00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:02.975
We couldn't possibly
impose on your compassion

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.108
any further than
we have already.

00:01:05.152 --> 00:01:08.198
Right, and after you've removed
yourselves from our protection,

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:09.547
what will you do?

00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:12.246
We're going to retake
the city on our own.

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.684
And to that end, we'd be willing
to buy whatever surplus weapons

00:01:15.727 --> 00:01:18.817
and food you may have for
triple the going price.

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:24.954
[WEIN] All right,
let's see what they say.

00:02:55.392 --> 00:02:59.222
[CALDMELLIA] You wish to
purchase our excess supplies?

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.224
Please don't misunderstand me.

00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:03.966
I realize that mere money
could never sway you,

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:05.794
motivated as you
are by the desire

00:03:05.837 --> 00:03:07.926
to serve God's divine will.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.712
However, in a mercantile
city like Mealtars,

00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:13.410
the coin is the ultimate
symbol of good faith.

00:03:13.454 --> 00:03:17.371
Please, accept our
payment in that spirit.

00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:20.156
And after we recapture
the city, we shall erect

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.247
a large temple as well as
a monument in your honor.

00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:26.554
[gulps]

00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:29.383
[WEIN]
Having taken in 30,000 refugees,

00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:32.386
the Levetians' options
will be rather limited.

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:33.604
My guess is they'd like to

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:37.826
return home if they can,
although...

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.481
So, if we do give you supplies
and take our leave,

00:03:40.524 --> 00:03:43.701
then you'll repay us
in money and reverence?

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.836
[CALDMELLIA] He's amazing.
There's no doubt about it,

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.405
that move was far beyond
all my expectations.

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:54.625
And for that reason,
Prince Wein,

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.541
I'll simply have to refuse you.

00:03:57.585 --> 00:03:59.195
[WEIN]
Heh.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.720
[CALDMELLIA] I can't help it, I
want to play with him some more.

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.548
To injure him with a denial,

00:04:04.592 --> 00:04:06.594
and then poke and
prod at the wound.

00:04:06.637 --> 00:04:09.292
Just to find out how
he'll react and then--

00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:10.641
[GRUYERE]
We accept.

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:14.428
[gasps] Uh, King Gruyere,
what did you just say?

00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:17.300
What I said, Director Caldmellia
of the Bureau of Teachings,

00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:19.650
is that we would
accept his proposal.

00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:23.175
I believe that this matter
falls under my responsibility.

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:26.483
But the military falls under
mine, and as such, I have spoken

00:04:26.527 --> 00:04:30.270
my piece. We should
go along with this.

00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:35.927
He'll most likely turn
the refugees into a militia.

00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:38.278
He hopes the princes
will wear each other down,

00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:40.367
making them more
open to negotiate.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.890
The alternative would be to have

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:44.327
the people of Mealtars
fight alongside us,

00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:48.288
but I have no intention of
getting caught up in your whims.

00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:50.986
Fine, we'll sell you
our surplus supplies.

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.510
But until we confirm
you've retaken the city,

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:55.556
our army stays put.

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.384
No objections here.

00:04:57.427 --> 00:05:02.214
I thank you both heartily
for your kind cooperation.

00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:04.216
[MESSENGER A] I have a
report for His Highness!

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.219
You say the people of
Mealtars took up arms?

00:05:07.263 --> 00:05:10.266
Indeed. They're marching
down the hill even now!

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.182
[BARDLOCHE gasping]

00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:14.792
[LOWELLMINA] The people
have been organized into

00:05:14.836 --> 00:05:16.881
an impressive-looking militia.

00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:19.014
But will they be able to
drive off my brothers?

00:05:19.057 --> 00:05:21.495
[WEIN] The princes recognize
that the value of Mealtars

00:05:21.538 --> 00:05:22.974
is in its people.

00:05:23.018 --> 00:05:24.585
They won't want to fight
because the more they kill,

00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:26.587
the less they have to gain.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.589
Besides, they're well aware that

00:05:28.632 --> 00:05:31.896
the Levetian army is
waiting in the wings.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.725
Send a message to
Manfred immediately!

00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.686
[WEIN]
Now, just one thing left to do.

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.906
Lowa, please invite
the princes to a meeting.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.647
Wait, not that old trick.

00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:47.956
Of course, at times like these,
it's my go-to move!

00:05:50.437 --> 00:05:53.396
Wait, you know who's behind
the assassination attempt?

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.484
[WEIN grunts]

00:05:54.528 --> 00:05:56.094
Just what are you suggesting?

00:05:56.138 --> 00:05:59.402
Certainly, you're not implying
that we're responsible.

00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:02.579
I kept coming back
to the same question.

00:06:02.623 --> 00:06:05.800
How was the assassin able
to achieve such a thing?

00:06:05.843 --> 00:06:07.541
What do you mean by that?

00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:10.065
[WEIN] Security across
the city was airtight.

00:06:10.108 --> 00:06:14.156
Specifically, there were private
guards placed at each compound.

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.766
Which would make
pulling off an attack

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.986
of this nature extremely tricky.

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:22.643
But there is somebody who
could have made it happen.

00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:26.255
And that person is not
presently with us in this room.

00:06:26.298 --> 00:06:27.517
You mean.,,

00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:29.345
That's right!
The perpetrator here

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.609
is none other than
Prince Demetrio himself!

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.613
And with that, the truth
has been revealed.

00:06:36.657 --> 00:06:39.311
That's absurd!
Why would he harm himself?

00:06:39.355 --> 00:06:41.879
Mealtars' reputation has
suffered greatly due to

00:06:41.923 --> 00:06:45.579
this incident, and both of
your forces have taken a hit.

00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:48.625
If Demetrio were to
return now with an army...

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:51.802
Just think, he'd be able
to take both Mealtars

00:06:51.846 --> 00:06:55.806
and the imperial throne
all for himself.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.069
I'm beginning to see it
quite clearly now.

00:06:58.113 --> 00:07:01.203
Demetrio never wanted
the summit to succeed.

00:07:01.246 --> 00:07:03.597
He merely pressed
his claim to the throne

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.338
and shut down all other
avenues of discussion.

00:07:06.382 --> 00:07:08.950
[MANFRED] They're really
planning to make Demetrio...

00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:11.692
[BARDLOCHE] ...take the fall
for the whole situation.

00:07:11.735 --> 00:07:13.258
[BARDLOCHE, MANFRED grunt]

00:07:13.302 --> 00:07:16.044
[WEIN] Yes. The failed summit,
the assassination attempt,

00:07:16.087 --> 00:07:18.263
the armed conflict,
the bad weather,

00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:20.309
and anything else
we can think of.

00:07:20.352 --> 00:07:23.617
We're going to pin every
last bit of it on Demetrio!

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.879
[LOWELLMINA]
And there it is,

00:07:24.922 --> 00:07:27.098
his old "trial in
absentia" trick.

00:07:27.142 --> 00:07:29.666
On behalf of Mealtars,
we are fully prepared

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.842
to offer you compensation
for any losses

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:34.758
that you may have incurred
in this unnecessary fight.

00:07:34.802 --> 00:07:38.240
Of course, we shall also refrain
from engaging in any relations

00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:40.721
with Prince Demetrio
from this day forward.

00:07:40.764 --> 00:07:42.592
[BARDLOCHE]
If I reject their proposal,

00:07:42.636 --> 00:07:45.465
I can be sure Manfred
will agree to it.

00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:47.510
[MANFRED] Even if I turn them
down and Bardloche and I

00:07:47.554 --> 00:07:49.512
manage to take Mealtars,

00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:51.906
we'll still have to
fight for the throne.

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:54.386
And going after each other
would only help Demetrio,

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.955
he'd swoop in and claim victory.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:07:59.348
All right, then.

00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:01.481
I think that we can consider
the matter settled.

00:08:01.524 --> 00:08:03.091
I knew I could count
on the two of you

00:08:03.134 --> 00:08:05.180
to understand the situation.

00:08:05.223 --> 00:08:06.224
[laughs]

00:08:07.574 --> 00:08:08.966
[COSIMO]
I'm afraid we've caused you

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.578
a great deal of
needless trouble.

00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:12.796
As far as I'm concerned,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.494
this has been a
welcome opportunity

00:08:14.537 --> 00:08:18.498
to build a meaningful
relationship with Mealtars.

00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:20.021
[LOWELLMINA]
Making Demetrio the scapegoat

00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:21.979
has taken him
out of the equation.

00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:25.896
The same goes for my brothers'
forces surrounding the city.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.380
As a result, Mealtars is now
firmly aligned with my faction.

00:08:31.423 --> 00:08:35.732
Even so, I fully recognize
that the hearts of your people

00:08:35.776 --> 00:08:38.343
lie with you, not me.

00:08:38.387 --> 00:08:40.955
[LOWELLMINA] I've come to
an important realization,

00:08:40.998 --> 00:08:46.656
the measure of a sovereign
goes far beyond mere strength.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.311
You know, when Prince Wein
and I were preparing

00:08:49.354 --> 00:08:51.052
to have our meeting
with King Gruyere

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:54.142
and Lady Caldmellia,
I took the opportunity to ask

00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:57.188
why he was so enthusiastic
about working with Mealtars.

00:08:57.232 --> 00:08:59.060
What did he say?

00:08:59.103 --> 00:09:02.193
Falanya seems to have taken
a shine to this city.

00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:03.717
As her big brother,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.937
I want to do everything I
possibly can to support her.

00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:08.460
[gasps]

00:09:08.504 --> 00:09:10.593
[COSIMO] It's extraordinary,
don't you think?

00:09:10.637 --> 00:09:12.726
He was willing to
wager his own fate,

00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:14.684
along with that
of our entire city,

00:09:14.728 --> 00:09:18.035
for the sake of his
little sister's happiness.

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:22.910
[laughing]

00:09:22.953 --> 00:09:24.607
[coughing]

00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:26.130
That was rough.

00:09:26.174 --> 00:09:29.090
I guess my body's not used
to laughing that hard.

00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:30.395
Why don't we give that--

00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:32.049
[NINYM]
Give it a rest.

00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:35.096
Why are you straining your vocal
cords for something so stupid?

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:37.707
Hey, chances like this
don't come along too often,

00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:40.797
so how 'bout you just ease up
and let me enjoy the moment?

00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:42.799
Well, you do have good
reason to celebrate.

00:09:42.843 --> 00:09:44.975
And that's thanks to
our booming exports.

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:47.456
Natra's economy is
really thriving.

00:09:47.499 --> 00:09:49.980
Our prosperity will cause
both the people's happiness

00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:51.547
and our budget to grow.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.768
And the kingdom will just
keep increasing in value.

00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:56.987
I am sittin' pretty now!

00:09:57.031 --> 00:10:00.512
Nothing but princely blue
skies ahead for this guy!

00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:02.427
You know, I could have sworn
you told me that you

00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:04.647
were going to sell off
the kingdom and retire.

00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:06.736
Who, me? No way!

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.347
You must be thinking
of some other prince.

00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:12.263
There's no way I'd give this up.
I'll milk my position

00:10:12.307 --> 00:10:14.962
for everything
it's worth! Oh, yeah!

00:10:15.005 --> 00:10:17.617
Just look at this, revenue
from the Marden region

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.270
is up significantly.

00:10:19.314 --> 00:10:22.665
True! All thanks
to my brilliant plan!

00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:25.886
By swearing allegiance to Natra,
Marden has gained access

00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:28.584
to an abundance of
goods from the east.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.456
But the western nations don't
really have any interest

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.371
in importing those goods.

00:10:33.415 --> 00:10:35.896
Well, in the Levetians'
view, the eastern half

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:38.681
of the continent is
barbarian territory.

00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:41.553
They'd never accept anything
that comes from the east.

00:10:41.597 --> 00:10:43.686
And that's why we're
working with Marden

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.255
on a joint operation to conceal
the origin of the products

00:10:47.298 --> 00:10:50.693
they export! It's just
so fiendishly clever!

00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:53.740
This partnership between our
nations has been a huge success,

00:10:53.783 --> 00:10:55.742
greatly enriching
Marden's coffers.

00:10:55.785 --> 00:11:00.355
What a genius I am!
It's almost a burden.

00:11:00.398 --> 00:11:02.662
Of course, at this rate,
Marden's economy

00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:04.794
will rival ours in
less than a decade.

00:11:04.838 --> 00:11:06.709
Then they could
declare independence.

00:11:06.753 --> 00:11:10.800
Well, we certainly can't afford
to have that happening.

00:11:10.844 --> 00:11:12.846
[NINYM] The smartest move
may be to find ourselves

00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:14.499
another major trading partner.

00:11:14.543 --> 00:11:15.675
[knocking]

00:11:15.718 --> 00:11:17.067
Yes? Come in.

00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:18.242
[door opens]

00:11:18.286 --> 00:11:19.853
[LIEGEMAN A]
Excuse me, Your Highness.

00:11:19.896 --> 00:11:23.334
An envoy has recently arrived
from the Kingdom of Soljest.

00:11:23.378 --> 00:11:25.597
Soljest, you say?

00:11:25.641 --> 00:11:27.077
[NINYM grunts]

00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.471
Escort them to the
audience chamber please.

00:11:29.514 --> 00:11:31.038
[LIEGEMAN A]
Of course.

00:11:32.648 --> 00:11:37.609
[NINYM] Soljest? Any idea what
King Gruyere might want?

00:11:37.653 --> 00:11:39.829
--[WEIN laughs]
--Huh?

00:11:39.873 --> 00:11:42.397
I just thought of
a great new plan.

00:11:44.181 --> 00:11:46.923
[ZENOVIA] Prince Wein is
planning to visit Marden?

00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:50.318
Yes, it seems His Highness was
invited to attend a ceremony

00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:52.407
in the Kingdom of Soljest
and he would like

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.583
to stop in for a visit
here on his way.

00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:56.019
I think we can safely assume

00:11:56.063 --> 00:11:57.542
that the prince is
mostly concerned

00:11:57.586 --> 00:12:00.676
about the future of Marden
as a vassal state of Natra.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.766
Very well, then. Let us
demonstrate our allegiance

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.768
and put His Highness at ease.

00:12:05.812 --> 00:12:08.031
Yes, Marden is at an
advantageous position

00:12:08.075 --> 00:12:10.904
at present. This may be a
good opportunity to redress

00:12:10.947 --> 00:12:12.775
the disparities
in our relationship

00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:16.561
and perhaps even extract a
few concessions from Natra.

00:12:17.562 --> 00:12:20.565
Concessions you say,
and tell me, Jiva.

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:22.567
Just what did you have in mind?

00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:24.874
Marriage between
His Highness, Prince Wein,

00:12:24.918 --> 00:12:26.223
and yourself, Lady Zenovia.

00:12:26.267 --> 00:12:27.834
[gasps]

00:12:27.877 --> 00:12:29.574
Since negotiations with Soljest

00:12:29.618 --> 00:12:31.228
will be at the
forefront of his mind,

00:12:31.272 --> 00:12:34.144
we can expect that he'll try to
avoid giving us a clear answer,

00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:36.016
but it would be in our
best interests to extract

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.018
a commitment from him
while he is still here.

00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:41.064
[ZENOVIA] Such a marriage would
boost Marden's standing in Natra

00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:44.938
tremendously and greatly
expand our influence.

00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:48.506
I wonder, could it
really be possible?

00:12:53.555 --> 00:12:55.600
What are you getting
so worked up about now?

00:12:55.644 --> 00:12:58.168
All I wanna do is
tousle it a little bit.

00:12:58.212 --> 00:13:01.171
I already told you, if you do
that, you'll mess up the color.

00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:03.043
Please! Please! Please!

00:13:03.086 --> 00:13:07.047
I'm sorry, no. Back to
what you were saying,

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.093
is it really your intention
to marry Zenovia?

00:13:10.137 --> 00:13:11.529
[WEIN]
No way,

00:13:11.573 --> 00:13:13.531
I'd prefer to remain unattached
for the time being.

00:13:13.575 --> 00:13:14.837
Really? Why is that?

00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:17.013
Well because! Then I can
sit back and enjoy

00:13:17.057 --> 00:13:20.712
a bevy of beauties
fighting over me-- Ow!

00:13:20.756 --> 00:13:22.062
No, not really!

00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:23.715
Be good, and I won't break it.

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:26.675
The title of queen consort is
a useful negotiating tool,

00:13:26.718 --> 00:13:28.938
so it's best to keep
it open. There!

00:13:28.982 --> 00:13:30.548
Good point.

00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:33.116
[WEIN] We need to get a sense of
exactly where Marden stands.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.989
If they intend to maintain a
cooperative relationship

00:13:36.032 --> 00:13:38.730
with Natra. That's our
primary purpose here.

00:13:38.774 --> 00:13:40.732
And if the answer is yes...

00:13:40.776 --> 00:13:44.084
Then chances are they're gonna
push for me to marry Zenovia,

00:13:44.127 --> 00:13:47.391
a subject I will do
everything I can to avoid.

00:13:47.435 --> 00:13:49.176
You are terrible.

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:53.920
I bid you most welcome,
Your Highness.

00:13:53.963 --> 00:13:57.140
How gracious of you,
great Marchioness.

00:13:57.184 --> 00:14:00.361
[ZENOVIA] Your Highness. I have
no need of such formalities.

00:14:00.404 --> 00:14:02.885
Please just address me
as Zenovia.

00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:07.585
Very well, if you prefer.
Heh. Zenovi-- Ah...

00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:09.674
Boobies! Boobies!
Boobies! Boo--

00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:13.200
[WEIN] Idiot! Concentrate
with everything you've got!

00:14:15.202 --> 00:14:18.596
[ZENOVIA] I must admit, the idea
did take me by surprise.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.251
How clever, to import
goods from the empire,

00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:23.340
and resell them as Natran-made.

00:14:23.384 --> 00:14:25.299
[WEIN] I'm just glad to know
the good people of the west

00:14:25.342 --> 00:14:26.996
have been able to profit by it.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.521
Sometimes, a creative solution
really does the trick.

00:14:30.565 --> 00:14:33.960
You know, Zenovia, rapid growth
can be awfully overwhelming.

00:14:34.003 --> 00:14:36.049
It would be my pleasure
to offer you counsel

00:14:36.092 --> 00:14:38.138
on anything that
might be troubling you.

00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:42.794
Oh, well. Actually,
we got a letter of protest

00:14:42.838 --> 00:14:45.797
from the Kingdom of Delunio,
on the subject of trade.

00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:48.235
Delunio, you say?

00:14:48.278 --> 00:14:50.977
I see. You too then, huh?

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.630
Then Natra got one as well?

00:14:52.674 --> 00:14:54.632
That's right. A letter
complaining about

00:14:54.676 --> 00:14:56.112
some goods we traded.

00:14:56.156 --> 00:14:59.811
Yes. They are a very
conservative kingdom.

00:14:59.855 --> 00:15:02.031
And their king happens
to be quite young,

00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:03.946
so political matters
are usually handled

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.558
by their prime minister,
Sirgis. He's patriotic,

00:15:07.602 --> 00:15:11.345
extremely so, and also a
dyed-in-the-wool Levetian.

00:15:11.388 --> 00:15:13.477
His kingdom's culture
is important to him.

00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:16.480
He doesn't want it corrupted
by foreign influences.

00:15:16.524 --> 00:15:20.571
It's safe to say he likely
resents the two of us.

00:15:20.615 --> 00:15:22.051
Well, just keep at it.

00:15:22.095 --> 00:15:24.575
What? Are you sure about that?

00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:27.187
Sending a letter isn't that
serious in the grand scheme

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.451
of things. Start worrying about
it when you've got a line

00:15:30.494 --> 00:15:33.671
of envoys protesting
outside your door.

00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:37.719
Well, all right, then.
That's exactly what I'll do.

00:15:37.762 --> 00:15:39.721
[ZENOVIA laughs]

00:15:42.158 --> 00:15:44.769
[WEIN] Huh? I-Is that
all she has to say?

00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:46.902
When I asked if she
had any concerns,

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.556
she was supposed to
bring up the disparities

00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:51.298
between our lands and
bring up the marriage thing.

00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:54.344
At least, that's how
I saw this going.

00:15:56.433 --> 00:15:58.479
[NINYM] They were going
to push for marriage,

00:15:58.522 --> 00:16:00.394
and you'd avoid the
subject at all costs.

00:16:00.437 --> 00:16:01.961
[WEIN grunts]

00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:04.050
I believe that's how you said
this would be working out.

00:16:04.093 --> 00:16:07.140
[WEIN screaming]

00:16:08.141 --> 00:16:09.838
She must be holding back for now

00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:11.753
so she can make her
big move tomorrow!

00:16:11.796 --> 00:16:15.017
Maybe while we're touring around
the city. Yeah, that's it!

00:16:15.061 --> 00:16:16.540
Let's just hope
they don't find out

00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:18.281
about your overinflated ego.

00:16:18.325 --> 00:16:20.153
[WEIN]
Yes, for the sake of my honor,

00:16:20.196 --> 00:16:22.938
that's one thing
we've got to avoid!

00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:31.468
It's an honor to once again be
in your company, Prince Wein.

00:16:33.296 --> 00:16:36.473
So, Zeno. How do you
serve the marchioness?

00:16:36.517 --> 00:16:38.693
As one of milady's
loyal attendants.

00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:42.436
I watch the city, and handle
other affairs as needed.

00:16:42.479 --> 00:16:44.829
Today's task is that I have
the pleasure of showing you

00:16:44.873 --> 00:16:46.788
around the city
on milady's behalf.

00:16:46.831 --> 00:16:49.095
[WEIN] Sure enough.
She's gonna use the tour

00:16:49.138 --> 00:16:51.227
as her opportunity to strike.

00:16:51.271 --> 00:16:53.316
Well, shall we?

00:17:03.587 --> 00:17:06.547
[ZENOVIA] The bronze statues in
our central plaza were erected

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:10.551
as a symbol of Marden's desire
for peace and prosperity.

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:13.336
At the moment, our land is still
in the process of recovering

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.903
from the recent war.

00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:19.038
But we hope that a lasting peace
has finally been achieved.

00:17:19.081 --> 00:17:21.344
[WEIN] You needn't worry,
as long as your economy

00:17:21.388 --> 00:17:24.782
remains strong, Marden
will continue to thrive.

00:17:24.826 --> 00:17:27.524
Your economic strength
is quite a powerful ward

00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:29.483
against outside interference.

00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:31.789
And so, after you've
grown strong enough,

00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:34.270
you can ultimately
seek your independence.

00:17:34.314 --> 00:17:37.491
That must be your goal
in the long term, yes?

00:17:37.534 --> 00:17:39.362
Well, not exactly.

00:17:39.406 --> 00:17:43.062
Lady Zenovia and her vassals
feel that being a part of Natra

00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:45.803
is the best way to ensure
that Marden's prosperity

00:17:45.847 --> 00:17:48.023
continues for
future generations.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.633
That's wonderful to hear.

00:17:49.677 --> 00:17:51.287
[WEIN]
So she intends to maintain

00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:55.074
a cooperative relationship with
Natra after all. Which means...

00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:58.729
Well then, let's take a break.
There's a bench nearby.

00:17:58.773 --> 00:18:00.514
[WEIN]
All right, here it comes!

00:18:00.557 --> 00:18:03.212
She's about to broach
the marriage issue!

00:18:05.171 --> 00:18:07.260
So, what do you think?
Impressed?

00:18:07.303 --> 00:18:10.350
The people's energy and the
sights are something to behold.

00:18:10.393 --> 00:18:12.134
And seeing all this firsthand,

00:18:12.178 --> 00:18:14.832
it's clear how much they
count on their leader.

00:18:14.876 --> 00:18:16.486
[ZENOVIA]
You're correct.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.576
Her support continues to grow as
a result of the economic boom.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.101
[WEIN] It's nice to have a sense
of goodwill between rulers

00:18:22.144 --> 00:18:26.061
and their people.
But you can never rest easy.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.802
There's something
I've wanted to ask you

00:18:27.845 --> 00:18:29.325
for a long while now.

00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:32.023
Why is it that Your Highness
has such a wary relationship

00:18:32.067 --> 00:18:34.025
with your own people?

00:18:34.069 --> 00:18:35.157
Wary?

00:18:35.201 --> 00:18:36.941
Oh, well, perhaps "wary"

00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:39.379
isn't exactly the word
I'm looking for.

00:18:39.422 --> 00:18:41.685
Maybe it's more like "distant"?

00:18:41.729 --> 00:18:45.907
Ah, I see...
Let me ask you this, then,

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.301
is a noble bloodline
considered venerable?

00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:50.825
Huh? Of course, it is!

00:18:50.868 --> 00:18:52.348
That's something
that's simply accepted

00:18:52.392 --> 00:18:54.742
as common knowledge
by everyone.

00:18:54.785 --> 00:18:56.787
[WEIN]
All right, next question.

00:18:56.831 --> 00:19:01.183
At what point exactly does
this venerability take effect?

00:19:01.227 --> 00:19:04.491
At what point does
it take effect?

00:19:04.534 --> 00:19:07.015
[WEIN] Let's consider me,
a Natran royal.

00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:09.539
If I'm venerable by virtue
of my bloodline,

00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.846
then when did I become so?

00:19:11.889 --> 00:19:15.719
[ZENOVIA]
Mm... When you were born, right?

00:19:15.763 --> 00:19:18.940
Indeed. If my blood
carries a certain virtue,

00:19:18.983 --> 00:19:21.812
then I'd be imbued
with it automatically.

00:19:21.856 --> 00:19:24.206
So then, when did my
father become that way?

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.383
[ZENOVIA] When he was born, just
the same as Your Highness.

00:19:27.427 --> 00:19:30.517
Precisely. The same goes
for his father before him,

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.171
and his father as well.

00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:35.435
It keeps on passing down from
one generation to the next.

00:19:35.478 --> 00:19:37.437
It's just simple logic.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.136
Now, Ninym, if we trace my
bloodline far back enough,

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.007
where would we finally end up?

00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:45.706
It extends back to
chief disciple Caleus,

00:19:45.749 --> 00:19:48.230
the founder of the
Levetian religion.

00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:49.536
[WEIN]
That's correct.

00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:52.147
And before he was
Levetia's disciple,

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:56.020
Caleus was a humble farmer,
and his parents, too.

00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:59.372
Now, answer me this,
just when did the bloodline

00:19:59.415 --> 00:20:01.461
of Caleus become venerable?

00:20:01.504 --> 00:20:04.551
When he began following Levetia

00:20:04.594 --> 00:20:07.945
and started to accomplish
great things. Is that correct?

00:20:07.989 --> 00:20:09.947
That's absolutely correct.

00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:12.472
By relying on their
intelligence, their strength,

00:20:12.515 --> 00:20:15.388
or even just plain good luck,
commoners can

00:20:15.431 --> 00:20:18.173
distinguish themselves
and gain renown.

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:21.002
If you trace a noble bloodline
back far enough,

00:20:21.045 --> 00:20:23.265
you will eventually
find a commoner.

00:20:23.309 --> 00:20:24.875
I'm confused.

00:20:24.919 --> 00:20:27.443
What exactly does any of that
have to do with my question?

00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:28.705
[WEIN]
Think about it.

00:20:28.749 --> 00:20:30.925
If even the haughtiest
of nobles and royals

00:20:30.968 --> 00:20:33.754
can be traced back to
a commoner's bloodline,

00:20:33.797 --> 00:20:36.800
then even those looked down
upon as commoners today

00:20:36.844 --> 00:20:39.020
could one day
become noble or royal.

00:20:39.063 --> 00:20:40.630
[ZENOVIA gasps]

00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:46.723
--[bell tolls]
-[PEOPLE chattering]

00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:50.379
Now getting back
to your question.

00:20:50.423 --> 00:20:52.903
You ask me why I'm
wary of the people.

00:20:52.947 --> 00:20:55.863
Natra has 800,000 citizens.

00:20:55.906 --> 00:20:58.648
Every last one of them
is a potential royal.

00:20:58.692 --> 00:21:02.870
All of them watching me,
wherever I go, whatever I do.

00:21:02.913 --> 00:21:07.396
Is it any wonder
I'm wary of them?

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.790
When you think about it,
I guess that's the reason why

00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:11.792
so many royals make a
point of establishing

00:21:11.835 --> 00:21:14.447
a mythology surrounding
their families.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.970
Zeno? What's wrong?

00:21:16.013 --> 00:21:19.016
Nothing. It's just that,
once again, I find myself

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.281
overwhelmed by what an
incredibly great man you are.

00:21:22.324 --> 00:21:23.630
I'll be fine.

00:21:23.673 --> 00:21:25.806
What? An incredibly great man?

00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:28.852
Well, that's awfully kind of
you to say, but as it happens,

00:21:28.896 --> 00:21:31.986
I'm not feeling so great
at this very moment.

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:33.509
Why is that?

00:21:33.553 --> 00:21:36.207
Well, the fact is, I was
expecting a marriage proposal

00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:38.514
that never came to pass,
and somehow,

00:21:38.558 --> 00:21:42.170
I got the idea that maybe
I had an overinflated ego.

00:21:42.213 --> 00:21:47.262
Ah. Of course I'm not too sure
what you're talking about.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:50.178
However, if you mean
a certain Mardenian,

00:21:50.221 --> 00:21:52.789
she may be too busy
with affairs of state

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:55.662
to consider the idea of
marriage at the present time.

00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:58.578
Wait! Hasn't she considered the
fact that if she marries me,

00:21:58.621 --> 00:22:01.842
she won't have to worry about
those affairs of state anymore?

00:22:01.885 --> 00:22:04.105
You have a very
good point there.

00:22:04.148 --> 00:22:08.327
Perhaps, she has a shallower
reason for avoiding marriage.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.937
What are you talking about?

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.289
Maybe she simply doesn't find
Your Highness attractive.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:15.246
You know?

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.465
[gasps]

00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:17.988
[laughs]

00:22:18.032 --> 00:22:21.383
But of course, I'm only kidding.

00:22:21.427 --> 00:22:23.994
Well, in any event.
It's probably about time

00:22:24.038 --> 00:22:25.344
we start heading
back to the palace,

00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:26.432
wouldn't you say?

00:22:26.475 --> 00:22:28.347
Under the light at
this time of day,

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.263
the city has a whole
different feel to it.

00:22:32.307 --> 00:22:35.005
[WEIN]
Doesn't find me attractive...

00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:38.531
Curse my overinflated ego!

00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:41.316
You realize the
only reason she said

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.927
that was to throw
you off, don't you?

00:22:43.971 --> 00:22:46.277
[WEIN] If you need me,
I'll be hibernating.

00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:48.105
Oh, really.

00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:49.977
Forgive me, Jiva.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:54.329
Prince Wein broached the subject
of marriage, but I held back.

00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:58.681
He feels distant,
even intimidating.

00:22:58.725 --> 00:23:01.423
The way you're describing it
makes it sound like Prince Wein

00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:04.078
is something of a hero
to you, Lady Zenovia.

00:23:04.121 --> 00:23:07.560
It's true, and it's painfully
apparent when I speak with him.

00:23:07.603 --> 00:23:09.170
I might as well admit it.

00:23:09.213 --> 00:23:12.434
I couldn't possibly be a
queen to such a great man,

00:23:12.478 --> 00:23:14.436
and yet, it's clear
that marriage

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.656
would have been
the right move here.

00:23:16.699 --> 00:23:19.180
I'm afraid I've failed
as a leader.

00:23:19.223 --> 00:23:21.965
If it is not your wish to marry
His Highness, rest assured

00:23:22.009 --> 00:23:23.924
we would never
pressure you to do so.

00:23:23.967 --> 00:23:26.230
Your vassals shall help
you find the way forward

00:23:26.274 --> 00:23:29.103
that is best for you.
