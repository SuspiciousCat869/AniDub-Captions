00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.117 position:50% align:center
Brother, you're here! But why?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.661 position:50% align:center
Well, as it turned out, I didn't
have as much work to do

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.956 position:50% align:center
as I thought. So, I took off
on the fastest horse I have,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
to try and make it here
in time for the ceremony.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.545 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] After suddenly
bursting into the room,

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:48.590 position:50% align:center
it's hard to get
a read on things.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
Ninym, help me out.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
But I'm interrupting.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:55.180 position:50% align:center
It appears my sister
and Prince Demetrio

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.474 position:50% align:center
are discussing the
possibility of marriage.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.393 position:50% align:center
That being the case,
I suppose I...

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Marriage? Huh?

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.489 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Hold on.
Are you serious? Marriage?

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
What's the big idea, asking
my sister a thing like that?

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:43.121 position:50% align:center
But why-- Oh, I get it,
Falanya must have told him

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:46.416 position:50% align:center
I'd have to approve, and that
maneuver successfully prevented

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50% align:center
the discussion from
proceeding any further.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.796 position:50% align:center
My timing couldn't
have been worse!

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
Well, Prince Wein.
Your arrival here

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
is an unexpected but
most pleasant surprise.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:02.682 position:50% align:center
This would seem to solve our
problem, Princess Falanya.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:06.811 position:50% align:center
After all, you are leaving this
decision to your brother, right?

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.773 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's correct.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
Then let's get to it.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
Prince Wein, please do
enlighten us with your thoughts.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:18.490 position:50% align:center
Certainly, you have no
grounds to object?

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.746 position:50% align:center
You're right! You have
my full blessing!

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.081 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50% align:center
This beautiful union will
ensure that the bonds

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
between Natra and the empire
grow even stronger!

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
It shall serve as the
cornerstone for a new era

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.508 position:50% align:center
of unity! How exciting
for you, my dear sister!

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center
Yes. This is a cause
for celebration.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
Not one, but two marriages
between the imperials

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center
of Earthwold and the
royal family of Natra.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Feel the same,
Princess Lowellmina?

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.775 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, most definitely.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
After all, talk of our own
marriage has been on hold

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
ever since the failed
uprising against the empire.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
And now, we have the perfect
opportunity to resume

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.868 position:50% align:center
the conversation.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
If I marry Prince Wein and you,
brother, marry Princess Falanya,

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
we can expect Natra to
become more influential

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
within the empire
than ever before.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
The idea of both of us
joining the imperial family

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
sure is enticing. If the
two of you aren't careful,

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:25.432 position:50% align:center
I may end up letting my
ambitions get the better of me.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
Prince Wein, your sense
of humor is too much!

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
And yet, truly, you are
an extraordinary man

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:33.440 position:50% align:center
with many accomplishments
to speak of.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
We can be sure the
people of Earthwold

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
will appreciate
having you to rely on.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.866 position:50% align:center
You think you can just
decide this on your own?

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
Why shouldn't I?

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
Authority over imperial
marriages lies with the emperor.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
Considering the fact that we
currently have no emperor,

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center
why shouldn't I decide
this for myself?

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
What was it you said
to me earlier?

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
I think it was something like,
"Mind your own business."

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.343 position:50% align:center
This doesn't really have
anything to do with you,

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:02.177 position:50% align:center
does it?

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.845 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:05.472 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
What do you say, brother?

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
Are you really going to allow
Natra to further expand

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
their reach with a pair
of imperial marriages?

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] To see Natra make such
strides as a result of your

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
own actions has to be
the last thing you want.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.780 position:50% align:center
Your Highness, if I may.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
Remember, Natra has long
forbidden its royals

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
from being married
into the same family.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, I had failed to
take that into consideration.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Because she made
it up right this second.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
Way to improvise, Ninym!

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center
Well, then, Prince Demetrio.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:40.090 position:50% align:center
Why don't we give this
some more thought,

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
and then reconvene tomorrow so
we can continue the discussion?

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
Well, if you say so.
For my part, I'm prepared

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
to keep going right here
and now. But if you require

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
a bit more time,
then I'm happy to defer.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
Very accommodating of you,
Prince Demetrio. Thank you.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50% align:center
Certainly, so until next time.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
And with that, I'm afraid
I must excuse myself.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
[NINYM gasps]

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:11.579 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] What a wonderful
surprise, brother!

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you showed up!

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.167 position:50% align:center
You're my hero!

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50% align:center
I was so worried, I had
to come check on you,

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.172 position:50% align:center
but it seems there was no need.

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
You've done well,
I'm proud of you.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA laughs]

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
But brother, what will you do

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
about Prince
Demetrio's proposal?

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
Falanya, we're a royal family.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.982 position:50% align:center
Political marriages have
to be taken seriously.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] In other words, our
partners must be chosen with

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
great care. I have absolutely
no intention of letting you

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
marry a man like that.

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:50.827 position:50% align:center
If he wants to take you
as his bride,

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.205 position:50% align:center
then he's going to have to
unify the continent first.

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.166 position:50% align:center
With a qualification like that,

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
it sounds like I'm never
going to be married.

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.714 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Are you sure
that it was a good idea

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
for you to come here?

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] I've done everything that
needs to be done, for now.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
They can get by
without me back home.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'm a bit more
worried about the Levetians.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.559 position:50% align:center
The Levetians?

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
That's right. I'm not sure
what it is they're up to,

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:21.608 position:50% align:center
but they're ramping up their
activity on multiple fronts.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
At this point, with everything
that's going on in Mealtars,

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.322 position:50% align:center
it only stands to reason
that they'll try--

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:29.783 position:50% align:center
[NINYM gasps]
Are you all right?

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
I think I've been
overdoing it lately.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:37.457 position:50% align:center
Haven't been getting much sleep.
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
So tell me, any problems
on your end?

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:44.422 position:50% align:center
Oh, here. Got something for you.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:45.757 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.386 position:50% align:center
A message from Lowa.
She'd like to meet with you.

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center
All right, so what is it
you wanted to talk about?

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.608 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] I'm not sure "talk"
is the word for what I want

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
to do. More like "consult"
or "complain."

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:09.239 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50% align:center
Well, I think I have some
idea what this is about.

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
You were hoping your brothers
would come to a decision.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
About the next emperor.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
Where did you get that idea?

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
Please. The summit was never
really meant to decide that.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.382 position:50% align:center
In fact, the true
reason behind it

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
was to gather the empire's
allies together

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
in order to show
off our influence

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
and strengthen our factions.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
I'd have thought
that much was obvious.

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
Fair point. That's certainly
true for your brothers.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.478 position:50% align:center
Bardloche, Manfred, and Demetrio

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:42.605 position:50% align:center
never thought they'd
reach a decision.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
All along, you've
been hoping you might

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
have a chance to
outmaneuver them.

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.319 position:50% align:center
But you're not seen
as a viable option

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.113 position:50% align:center
since you haven't
openly expressed

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
your designs on the throne.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.285 position:50% align:center
I've been clumsy, haven't I?

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] It seems I've had no
reason to be worried.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
The empire's subjects
are growing weary

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.917 position:50% align:center
of the three squabbling princes.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
Given enough time, they'd
ultimately rally around Lowa,

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
and she'd become empress.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.008 position:50% align:center
A lot of them are feeling
unsettled in the absence

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
of clear leadership.

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
All things considered, she chose
to take a different path.

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
After agonizing over the
situation, she finally decided

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:25.106 position:50% align:center
to place her hopes in
the Summit of Heirs.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
So, you have any words
of encouragement, Wein?

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
Uh. Sorry.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.113 position:50% align:center
Fine, then.

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
Answer me honestly, what
are you thinking right now?

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
That you've been pretty
dumb about this.

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
Hey. You big jerk.

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
But don't worry about it.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
You have had a lot
on your plate recently.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:46.878 position:50% align:center
And you know, I think I might
be willing to lend you a hand.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center
I guess we should
be heading back.

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't want anybody
to notice that we're gone.

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center
Hey, Wein?

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what?

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
In the end, I will get you mixed
up in this epic tale of mine,

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:08.149 position:50% align:center
just watch. And I'll win, too.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
[MANFRED] I see. So, Prince
Wein is here in Mealtars.

00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
Yes. Apparently,
he'll be meeting

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
with Prince Demetrio tomorrow.

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
What is your impression
of him, Your Highness?

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
Well, he's exceptionally bright.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:25.250 position:50% align:center
So much so, that his grades
were actually deleted

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
from the record books
at the academy.

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
He's been leading Natra
well in the role of regent,

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:33.383 position:50% align:center
and seems to be a truly
great man in all respects.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
Then...

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
We're going to kill him.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50% align:center
I want Prince Wein eliminated

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
during his meeting
with Demetrio.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
[SUBORDINATE A]
Right!

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
If I'm to become the emperor,
then I'm going to have

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
to make short work of everyone
who stands against me.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.115 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Wein!

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.492 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I'm all right now.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:02.078 position:50% align:center
Wein, if you're too tired--

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
No. I told you, I'm all right.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
If I can just make it
through the meeting today,

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.836 position:50% align:center
I should be able to
take it easy for a bit.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.671 position:50% align:center
I hope that's the case.

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. Where's Falanya
right now, anyway?

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.677 position:50% align:center
Where else? At the assembly.

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:19.846 position:50% align:center
[CHAIRMAN A] Moving along.
I would like to open the floor

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.599 position:50% align:center
for a debate on the
allocation of tax funds.

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
You want to hear more?

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA grunts]

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.937 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN A] Here you are,
Your Highness.

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
We couldn't help but
notice how intently

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
you've been listening to the
proceedings in these chambers.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center
Your Highness. You'd be welcome
to join the deliberations,

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:37.781 position:50% align:center
if you like.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:42.118 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, yes! I'd love to!

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
[DEMETRIO] Thank you for
joining me, Prince Wein.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
I've had this venue
especially prepared.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to a
productive exchange. Come!

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
I believe we both have
good reason to have

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.256 position:50% align:center
high expectations,
so let's begin.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Either he wants to smooth
things over to maintain

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
a positive relationship
with Natra,

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
or he has a plan to convince me

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
to go along with his
marriage proposal.

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
Now, which one is it?

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
Wait! Stay where you are.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
Is there something else
I might do for you?

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
Did you prepare
this tea yourself?

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.326 position:50% align:center
I did, Your Highness.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.411 position:50% align:center
Then drink it.

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.121 position:50% align:center
What? Drink the tea?

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
But you see, that tea
is of the finest quality.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
It's reserved exclusively for
those of high social standing.

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
So how could I?
It wouldn't be right--

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
I told you to drink the tea.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A gasps]

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:41.344 position:50% align:center
[GUARDS grunt]

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:44.764 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Please,
tell me you're joking.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.017 position:50% align:center
You actually think
the tea's poisoned?

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.728 position:50% align:center
How ridiculous.

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
That really is an outrageous
suggestion to make,

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.150 position:50% align:center
simply because you're
afraid to drink your tea.

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.277 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it's hilarious.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
Why in the world is
everybody so impressed

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
with a coward like you?

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
No, wait!

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:09.039 position:50% align:center
Well, Prince Wein, I hope that
puts your mind at ease a bit.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
If this tea were
poisoned, then...

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
I...

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Highness!

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.714 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A gasps]

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:20.050 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Ninym! Find him
a doctor! Quickly!

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
I'm on it.

00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
So, just to make sure I've got
it, let me review everything

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center
that happened while I was
being held for questioning.

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.987 position:50% align:center
After barely managing to
survive being poisoned,

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:44.074 position:50% align:center
Demetrio was rushed home
so he could convalesce.

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
Princes Bardloche and Manfred,
denounced the poisoning

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.079 position:50% align:center
as an assassination
attempt by Mealtars,

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.414 position:50% align:center
and surrounded the city
with their troops.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
Lowa and Falanya worked
with Cosimo to try

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
and find a way to
calm things down.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
All while I was being detained
as a suspect in the poisoning,

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.841 position:50% align:center
until my release earlier today.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
So then, what shall we do now?

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:05.637 position:50% align:center
Go straight home.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
Guess that's all we can do.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center
We'd better plan
to get out of here

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
as fast as we can
while we're at it.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
The last thing we need is for
something else to happen and--

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.689 position:50% align:center
Your Highness!

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
Even when traveling, entering
unannounced is still rude.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Your Highness,

00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:22.237 position:50% align:center
but I have an urgent
report for you!

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.571 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
Did the princes' armies
start attacking the city?

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
No, your Highness.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center
An army's been spotted
approaching from the west,

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.246 position:50% align:center
flying the Levetians' banner.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
And they're heading
toward Mealtars!

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What?!

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:42.757 position:50% align:center
Mealtars is soon to be freed

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
from the oppression
of the empire.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:48.096 position:50% align:center
At last, it seems the time
of holy war is upon us.

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:53.643 position:50% align:center
I just hope Prince Wein finds
it an enjoyable diversion.

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] There's way too
much going on for you

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center
to be showing your
face right now!

00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.399 position:50% align:center
Seriously, and I mean seriously!

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
I'm supposed to be figuring
out how to get out of here!

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:05.530 position:50% align:center
I don't have time to be
dealing with this! Seriously!

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:08.700 position:50% align:center
Caldmellia!

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.326 position:50% align:center
Wein. Please calm down.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
And how would you
suggest I do that?!

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the princes' siege
on the city's supply lines,

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
the people of Mealtars are under

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
an enormous amount
of stress already.

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
Add an army of Levetians
on top of all of that,

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
and it won't be too long

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:24.174 position:50% align:center
before riots start breaking out
everywhere across the city.

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
The population of Mealtars
numbers 30,000.

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.679 position:50% align:center
If they riot, the city guard

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
won't be able to
keep things peaceful.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.059 position:50% align:center
In that case, it's quite
likely the army

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
will intervene and
then things'll get bad.

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.439 position:50% align:center
We have to get out
of here before then.

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.150 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:46.821 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.
Wow, I don't feel good.

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should lie down.

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:52.285 position:50% align:center
Hey! Wein! Wein!

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] At this point,
if riots break out, then...

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:11.012 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering, screaming]

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] That would be awful!
Brother, what would you do?

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Uh. Princess?
Where are you going?

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
To the assembly.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Crowds are a
huge risk right now!

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
I know. But...

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN C] Let's rise up
against the empire's tyranny,

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:34.369 position:50% align:center
and throw in our lot
with the west!

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.705 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN D] You really think
we can trust the Levetians?

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
It's obvious they're only
here to plunder our riches!

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.836 position:50% align:center
We've no choice but to
bow to the empire!

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN F] If we do that,
we'll be giving up

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:46.506 position:50% align:center
our right of self-rule!

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
Fool!

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
Mayor Cosimo.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
The esteemed Mealtars
Citizen's Assembly

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
has devolved into chaos.

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
[CITIZENS shouting]

00:16:58.268 --> 00:16:59.436 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN C]
Enough of this!

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
What point is there in
arguing about this now?

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
I agree! It's every man
for himself, you hear me?

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
[CITIZENS shouting]

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
[shouting continues]

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:19.497 position:50% align:center
Be careful, all right? [gasps]

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
[inhales] Hear me,
this city is in dire straits!

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
Falanya...

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
As it stands now, Mealtars
cannot survive a battle against

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.521 position:50% align:center
the empire. However, does
that mean all hope is lost?

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
It doesn't. You have
another way forward.

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
You are the great
merchants of Mealtars.

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.746 position:50% align:center
Remember what that means.

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
Merchants put what
they've learned

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:05.710 position:50% align:center
to use in building
a better future.

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
If all the merchants in this
city work together to confront

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
a problem, there's nothing
you cannot overcome.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
This assembly is proof of that.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.680 position:50% align:center
What you need now is solidarity!

00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
You possess some of the
brightest minds in all the land!

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
Your combined brilliance
will easily be enough

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
to light the path forward!

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:44.916 position:50% align:center
Ninym, how goes it?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.419 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wein!

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
You're awake.
This is wonderful!

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:53.883 position:50% align:center
But that tackle of yours almost
knocked me right back out again.

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:18:55.385 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
Oh, Wein. I'm so sorry.
I knew you were tired, but I...

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
I don't know what I would have
done if you hadn't woken up.

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
Come on, don't cry.
That's not fair.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
When you get like this,

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
I don't really know
what I'm supposed to do.

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Then don't overdo it again.

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
Well, you know.
Under the circumstances,

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:22.829 position:50% align:center
that's kind of a difficult
promise to make.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
[groans] All right, then.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
I'll take better care of
myself from now on,

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
so cut me a little slack here.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.254 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Please, let's
stay like this for now.

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
Wein! Thank goodness,
I was so worried about you!

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
Sorry I put you through that,
but everything is fine now.

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way,
Ninym was telling me

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
what a great job you did
while I was unconscious.

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:55.320 position:50% align:center
Compared to everything
you've accomplished,

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:57.530 position:50% align:center
it was nothing, really.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center
So, tell me, is there
something else I can do?

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
There is.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's something
only you can do.

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.046 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
What is Mealtars?

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
Is it merely a highway through
the center of the continent?

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.676 position:50% align:center
No, it is not.

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:21.721 position:50% align:center
Then is it a city that happens
to be located upon that highway?

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
No, that's not it, either.

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
Mealtars is you, its citizenry!

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
After all, if it
weren't for you,

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
a city of merchants
would not be possible.

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
So this is no evacuation,
it's a march toward victory.

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:39.531 position:50% align:center
Cast off the past and look ahead

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:42.033 position:50% align:center
to a time of new glory
that awaits you!

00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
Together we march on!

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:46.496 position:50% align:center
[CITIZENS]
We march!

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN I]
To victory!

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN J]
To our new glory!

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN K]
Together!

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:51.710 position:50% align:center
[CITIZEN L]
Together!

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Wein, this could work.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
Yes, now it's up to us
to see it through.

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] We'll take advantage
of this momentum,

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.566 position:50% align:center
to evacuate everyone
from the city.

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
A wave of 30,000 people!

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
[MANFRED]
What is this?

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.370 position:50% align:center
[BARDLOCHE]
What's going on here?

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:29.497 position:50% align:center
[MANFRED]
Princess Falanya?

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
[BARDLOCHE] What does she
think she's doing?

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
The entire population of
Mealtars, some 30,000 people,

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
are all heading this way
seeking our protection!

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:57.609 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:02.030 position:50% align:center
We have nothing to fear!

00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:03.865 position:50% align:center
Let us proceed onward
in the knowledge

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:06.326 position:50% align:center
that a new road shall
open up before us!

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:08.495 position:50% align:center
You're an even more
remarkable woman

00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
than I realized,
Princess Falanya.

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:13.625 position:50% align:center
[GRUYERE]
A pleasant surprise.

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:16.836 position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact,
almost too pleasant.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.713 position:50% align:center
Well, what shall we do now?

00:22:18.797 --> 00:22:21.216 position:50% align:center
We're in no position to
take in 30,000 people,

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:22.967 position:50% align:center
are we, Caldmellia?

00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:28.515 position:50% align:center
Good King Gruyere. This may
be a bit of a quandary.

00:22:28.598 --> 00:22:30.684 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] If there is
something troubling you,

00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:33.311 position:50% align:center
perhaps I might
be of assistance.

00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:37.899 position:50% align:center
Lady Caldmellia,
King Gruyere. How are you?
