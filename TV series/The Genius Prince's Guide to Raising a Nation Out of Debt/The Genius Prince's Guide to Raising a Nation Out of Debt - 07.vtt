[CLAUDIUS]
Now then, let us stop here

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
for a moment and take a break.
shall we, Your Highness?

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
I wonder how my
brother's doing.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
He may be meeting with
King Ordalasse right now.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Claudius.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.922 position:50% align:center
What do you know
about King Ordalasse?

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
He is a member
of the Holy Elites

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.719 position:50% align:center
and wields tremendous authority
within the Levetian religion.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:56.556 position:50% align:center
As such, he is widely revered
all throughout Cavarin.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center
Of course, there are
those who object

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.020 position:50% align:center
to his strict policy
of jus sanguinis.

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:03.355 position:50% align:center
Jus sanguinis?

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:06.483 position:50% align:center
Mm... The rule of Determination
by right of blood,

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
which in Cavarin has
unfortunately led to

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.445 position:50% align:center
an abundance of
ineffectual vassals

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:13.406 position:50% align:center
who were born
into the right family.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.034 position:50% align:center
It's also resulted in
unequal treatment.

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:18.411 position:50% align:center
Policies tend to be lenient
toward the freeborn,

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.955 position:50% align:center
but quite severe for others,
such as paupers,

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.000 position:50% align:center
slaves, and other
oppressed groups.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.877 position:50% align:center
The discrepancy is so extreme,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.964 position:50% align:center
there are even cases of slaves
being hunted for sport.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Hm... Levert and
Holonyeh met in secret?

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.150 position:50% align:center
I wasn't able to make out
everything they were saying,

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:15.862 position:50% align:center
so I'm not quite certain.
But I believe they plan--

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.366 position:50% align:center
To attack us here,
so they can assassinate me.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Yes.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.869 position:50% align:center
So then. That's what
Levert's up to,

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
and as for Ordalasse,
think I've got him figured out.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
It's basically like this.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.378 position:50% align:center
His extremist policy of
jus sanguinis is starting

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
to cost him support
among his subjects.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
So, he decided to appease them,

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
by seizing the Jilaat
Gold Mine from Marden.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.638 position:50% align:center
He quietly laid the groundwork,
promising loans

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.057 position:50% align:center
to the Holy Elites to
head off any criticism.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
Then, while Marden was busy
fighting us, he invaded.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
He thought he could swoop in

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
and grab the spoils
while no one was looking.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
However, his plan fell through.
Against all odds, we defeated

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:59.823 position:50% align:center
Marden and took possession
of the gold mine ourselves.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
At that point, King Ordalasse
set his sights on me,

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
the crown prince of Natra.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:07.914 position:50% align:center
[gasps] By nominating you,
he both indebts you to him

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
and strengthens his faction.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:12.752 position:50% align:center
[ZENO]
Excuse me.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind,

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
I have a favor I must
ask of you, Prince Wein.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Go ahead.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.305 position:50% align:center
I ask that you please allow me

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.392 position:50% align:center
to join your audience
with King Ordalasse.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
Do you have a
clear-eyed understanding

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
of your current situation?

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.109 position:50% align:center
I know I cannot look to
the Holy Elites to help us,

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.945 position:50% align:center
Natra and Cavarin are
headed for an alliance.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
The fate of my freedom forces,

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
and my very life itself,
are hanging by a thread.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
If you realize that much,
then surely you're aware

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.831 position:50% align:center
that I couldn't possibly
take you with me.

00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
I can't let you assassinate
King Ordalasse.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center
You misunderstand me.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
I have no intention
to do such a thing.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:59.966 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Oh? Then what do you
hope to gain by coming?

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
An alliance of Natra and
the Free Mardenian Forces.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center
[NINYM, RAKLUM gasp]

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
And why would that be
a beneficial arrangement

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
for Natra?

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
[inhales, exhales]

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.147 position:50% align:center
I don't know!

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
Not yet, but I do
know going with you

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
is my best chance
to figure it out!

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
The Gathering of the
Chosen doesn't start

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:21.905 position:50% align:center
until tomorrow! Just wait.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
I will do everything in my power

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
to answer your question
by that time!

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
Your spirit is admirable.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
And yet, that alone is no
reason to bring you along

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
and I'm not seeing another.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
The bottom line is that I
don't see how I can trust you.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
You don't see how you can
trust me, Is that right?

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.051 position:50% align:center
That's right. You tell me,

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
is there a reason why I
should give you my trust?

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
[ZENO] No. Honestly, I'm afraid
I can't think of a single one.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
However, was it not you yourself
who said we value trust

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
precisely because the potential
for treachery exists?

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
Prince Wein, I beg you
to take a chance on me!

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
All right, you may come.

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:06.991 position:50% align:center
[ZENO gasps]

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] If you promise
not to kill the king.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.328 position:50% align:center
You have my word.

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
Hmph. Well, I'm very
glad to hear that.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
Only a barbarian would take
up arms during a meeting.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.965 position:50% align:center
[ORDALASSE laughs]
Prince Wein, right on time!

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
Considering the subject,
it seemed best

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:26.344 position:50% align:center
to meet where we couldn't
be easily overheard.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
You understand that, I'm sure.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
Most certainly, although...

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
An honor to make
your acquaintance,

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
Prince Regent Wein. I am
Holonyeh, Your Highness.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
A new arrival to my court,

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
but he's been a great
help to me already.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
I've found him to
be extremely adept

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.031 position:50% align:center
and most attentive.

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.700 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? You don't say.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] The king's popularity
is supposedly

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
waning due to his
overemphasis on lineage.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
So if he's relying on an
outsider to this extent,

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50% align:center
it could mean he's even
losing the hereditary vassals.

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
All right. Down to business.
Please tell me,

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.595 position:50% align:center
how did your meetings with
the other Holy Elites go?

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
There are some
conditions I must meet

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
before they'll approve of me.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
But overall, I was
fairly well received.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.269 position:50% align:center
If I do say so myself.

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Outstanding!

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
You're a credit to the
bloodline of Caleus,

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
disciple of the
legendary Levetia.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
Ah. 'Tis a shame, though.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
If only I had a daughter
of marrying age,

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.949 position:50% align:center
I would gladly
offer you her hand.

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
I'm a little confused,
King Ordalasse.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
I thought there was a
princess here in Cavarin.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:39.751 position:50% align:center
No. Regrettably,
that child was not mine.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.128 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, Highness?

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:44.214 position:50% align:center
I spared no expense
to provide her with

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
the very finest of tutors
and yet she never

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
showed any promise whatsoever.

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
That's when I learned
the horrible truth

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.973 position:50% align:center
that I wasn't her real father.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. All of that's
in the past now.

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
Please rest assured,
that unfaithful wife of mine

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.189 position:50% align:center
has long since been executed,

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
and you're in no danger
of being subjected to her

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
detestable presence.
So don't you worry.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:09.531 position:50% align:center
So, you had evidence of
her infidelity, then?

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:13.743 position:50% align:center
Evidence? Of all
the silly questions.

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
As I've already told you,
the child showed no promise,

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.915 position:50% align:center
which stands as incontrovertible
evidence that she

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.333 position:50% align:center
couldn't possibly have descended

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:23.044 position:50% align:center
from a chief disciple
of Levetia.

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:24.546 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
What a fool.

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
His obsession with
heredity is so far gone,

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:32.220 position:50% align:center
he's convinced his children
are predestined to be prodigies.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
Now I understand
why his vassals

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.140 position:50% align:center
want nothing to do with him.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
Because, at this point,
neither do I.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
So, what do I do now?

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
Well! I seem to have gotten
slightly off-track there.

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Of course. Think nothing of it.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
I'm just a hothead.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
Every so often, it gets the
better of me, you know?

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, almost
forgot, entirely.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.911 position:50% align:center
I was hoping I might ask a small
favor of you, Prince Wein.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
Oh, and what might that be?
I'm all ears.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.917 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] A favor? No doubt
something to do with

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
the gold mine. I'll sit here
politely and hear him out,

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
then I'll come up with some
excuse to turn him down

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
and get out of here--

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you'd give me
some of those lowly Flahm

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.720 position:50% align:center
you're holding on
to back in Natra.

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
And why were you hoping that?

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
[ORDALASSE]
Why else?

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.934 position:50% align:center
So I can hunt them
for sport, of course.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
[WEIN grunting]

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.188 position:50% align:center
In my youth, I got
a bit carried away

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
and hunted all the
Flahm in this area.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
How I long to revisit
the profound feeling

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:30.570 position:50% align:center
of satisfaction it brought me!

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.197 position:50% align:center
You must have them
bred them in Natra

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
so you never run out, I suppose.
I've heard you often have

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
a particularly fine
specimen at your side.

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
I have an idea!

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:42.624 position:50% align:center
How about the two of us go out
on a Flahm hunt together?

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:45.085 position:50% align:center
I may be a little rusty
but I'm confident

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
the old skills will
come back in no time.

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
Prince Wein?
Is something the matter?

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.968 position:50% align:center
I was just making
a quick calculation.

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:55.387 position:50% align:center
Calculation?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50% align:center
Yes, but don't worry,

00:09:57.055 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
I've already finished,
it was quite simple.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
So, King Ordalasse.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.270 position:50% align:center
Shall I give myself some
more time to consider

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
this matter or would you
like my answer now?

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
No need to fret over
so trivial a matter.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
Go on, let me
hear your decision.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
All right. In that case...
good riddance, Ordalasse!

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:19.786 position:50% align:center
[ORDALASSE groans]

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.664 position:50% align:center
Wha--

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center
Your Highness, is everything--

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
[ORDALASSE groaning]

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.003 position:50% align:center
[HOLONYEH groans]

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
Yes, well. Just be quick.
I'll be right outside.

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I'll be done in a jiffy.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
[coughs] You...
I don't understand,

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.100 position:50% align:center
why are you doing this to me?

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I can see why
you're confused,

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
as this is a total
etiquette violation

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:48.064 position:50% align:center
in every way imaginable.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
What's gotten into you?

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:52.944 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] However, you wanted
a decision now, remember?

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.071 position:50% align:center
So, allow me to give you one.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
Wait! Wait just one second!
You appear to be forgetting that

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
I'm one of the Holy Elites!
That the blood of a chief

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.247 position:50% align:center
disciple is flowing
within my veins!

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.125 position:50% align:center
Don't-- Don't you know
what that makes me?!

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50% align:center
History.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
[ORDALASSE groans]

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Zeno.

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you
actually just did that.

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.933 position:50% align:center
Here, now. What shall
we do with him?

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
[HOLONYEH whimpering]

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] If you'd like to finish
him off yourself, be my guest.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
No, wait. Please, don't!

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center
No one shall ever know
what transpired here,

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
I give you my word! So please.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.572 position:50% align:center
Couldn't you possibly
spare my life?

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but... No.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
Not after you conspired
to kill me with Levert.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
[HOLONYEH] No. Please!
It wasn't like that at all!

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
The whole thing was
General Levert's idea,

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:49.751 position:50% align:center
he threatened me and
forced me to go along with it!

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
[ZENO] You disgust me,
you filthy traitor!

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
[HOLONYEH groaning, gasping]

00:11:57.217 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
You... I know who you are.
Why didn't I see it...?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center
To sell out your kingdom
and get away with it,

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
you gotta have a
proper exit strategy.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:15.068 position:50% align:center
Thank you for the
lesson, Holonyeh.

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
So in the end,
I suppose you could say

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:26.371 position:50% align:center
I handled the situation with
a touch of bold improvisation.

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
Of course you did.
I understand now.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Impressed?

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'm appalled!

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:36.047 position:50% align:center
Killing a Holy Elite...
of all the dumb moves.

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
Seriously.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
Well, I wouldn't worry
over it too much, Ninym.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
What's done is done, and there's
no point in dwelling on it.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
The important thing
is to figure out

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
what we should do next.
Don't you think?

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear that.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:53.231 position:50% align:center
[sighs] You think
they'll come after us?

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:56.985 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm absolutely
certain of it. However...

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
[LEVERT gasping]

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] I stirred up as
much trouble as I could

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
before departing. I'm pretty
sure I bought us some time.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.039 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
So? What happens now?

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
We make a deal with Zeno.

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
I just killed Ordalasse.
War with Cavarin is inevitable.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
And we're gonna need some help,
so our best move is an alliance

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
with the Free Mardenian Forces.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
Can't believe this
has gotten so messy.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I know.

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:27.974 position:50% align:center
Why do these things
keep on happening to me?

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:30.310 position:50% align:center
Ow! No kicking!

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
Tell me. Did you decide to
ally with the Mardenians

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:35.774 position:50% align:center
before or after killing
Ordalasse? The truth.

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
Obviously it was before!

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.110 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't have gone
and killed the guy

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center
if I didn't have any
kind of plan in mind!

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:43.698 position:50% align:center
Just how reckless
do you think I am?

00:13:43.782 --> 00:13:46.868 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Hm...?
So, you didn't kill him first

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50% align:center
and then cook up this
scheme out of necessity?

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
Look me in the eyes.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
The point of having a plan

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.837 position:50% align:center
is so you never have to
murder people recklessly.

00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:00.507 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM] Your Highness.
Is everything all right?

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.510 position:50% align:center
Yes. And how did
things go on your end?

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
Fine. You were right, our
search turned up evidence

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.556 position:50% align:center
that Levert was plotting
against King Ordalasse.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
I have delivered it
just as you instructed.

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
[RIOTER A]
Filthy traitor!

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
[RIOTERS yelling]

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
[CALDMELLIA] To think
that such a dull affair

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
could turn out so compellingly.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
I must remember to express
my gratitude to Prince Wein.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
[GUARD B] We've got fires in
other districts, too, General!

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center
What are your Orders?

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
Get to work on putting them out!

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
Sir! There's a problem!

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
What is it now?

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
[GUARD C] Well, a terribly
disturbing rumor is going

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:43.174 position:50% align:center
around town. We're getting
reports that it set off a riot.

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
A rumor? What's it say?

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
[GUARD C]
Forgive me, sir.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
But it claims you've been
plotting against King Ordalasse,

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
with the intention of
seizing power for yourself.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:57.605 position:50% align:center
[growling] But how?!

00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, my lady.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
But aren't you just playing
right into that prince's hands?

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:04.237 position:50% align:center
What else could I possibly do?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
In the wake of
King Ordalasse's death,

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
evidence of General
Levert's treason

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
has fallen conveniently
into my lap.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
With such a precious
gift at our disposal,

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
it would be a waste
if we didn't do

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
all we could to fan the flames.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
The only shame is,
after engineering

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
such beautiful chaos,
you're unable to join the fun.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
However, other than that,
it worked out perfectly.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
Please accept this gift as
a token of my gratitude.

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
Huh? A message from the palace.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
Ninym? What does it say?

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
Natran renegades
have risen in revolt.

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:48.823 position:50% align:center
They've sealed the border,

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:51.409 position:50% align:center
and when they get the chance,
they intend to claim your head.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center
What was it I read
in that report?

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
In Hagal's absence,
the nobles grow restless.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
Guess it was true, after all.

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
I see...

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center
Highness, I have some bad news.

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:08.343 position:50% align:center
There's been an avalanche
along the mountain pass

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
and now our path is blocked.

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
When will it be cleared?

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM]
If I had to guess,

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center
I'd say it would take at least
ten days to clear the way.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center
Raklum, let's move.
Break time is over.

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:24.859 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Prepare for immediate departure.

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:26.027 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM]
Right.

00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Ninym. Would you
bring Zeno to me?

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center
We need to speak.

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
Yes. But Wein, what now?

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:36.246 position:50% align:center
Why, I'll take advantage
of the uncertainty.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center
[LEVERT]
Hurry up, will you?

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.668 position:50% align:center
We still have a chance
to catch them!

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:44.921 position:50% align:center
[KUSTAVI] General! Good news,
our advance party is back.

00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
And did they have any
luck figuring out

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
which way those
Natran devils headed?

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
Yes! The supplies they discarded

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:53.805 position:50% align:center
along the highway
was a clear tipoff.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:55.974 position:50% align:center
Why didn't they take
the mountain pass?

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
That would've been
the shortest route.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make sense.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
[KUSTAVI] Apparently, there was
an avalanche at the mountain

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:03.898 position:50% align:center
pass and they weren't
able to get through.

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Divine retribution for
that Natran prince's wickedness.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.613 position:50% align:center
All troops, to the highway!

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
No, wait! I think we're
falling for a ruse!

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
A ruse?

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
Yes! That prince is smart--

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
he's trying to lure
us onto the highway.

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
He's hoping we'll race down

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.543 position:50% align:center
the wrong path in
pursuit of a mirage,

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
while they take the byway
and avoid us entirely.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
What a sneaky little trick.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
Let's go! Those scoundrels
must've gone this way!

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
[LEVERT gasps]
Hold on! Soldiers, halt!

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
Who are these guys?

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
[KUSTAVI]
I don't see the Natran banner,

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
and they're all
dressed differently.

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
Are they brigands?

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:54.407 position:50% align:center
[LEVERT] I doubt brigands would
make such a formation.

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:55.992 position:50% align:center
But what kind of army?

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
We're under attack!

00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:59.120 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:00.038 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER B]
Where'd they come from?

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:00.997 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER C]
Enemy attack!

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER D]
We're outnumbered?

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER E]
There's too many!

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:04.584 position:50% align:center
[NOBLE A]
What the...?

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
[NOBLE B] Just stay calm!
Don't make a move to attack.

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:10.840 position:50% align:center
Our only objective is
to capture Prince Wein!

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
Charge! Full speed ahead!

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
We'll smash right through
their formation!

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
[NOBLE A] The enemy is charging
our line! Hold fast, men!

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
[IBIS growls]
Damn.

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
How did Levert get there
before the prince did?

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:30.443 position:50% align:center
Uh! Yes, that must be it.

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
Well done, Prince Wein.
You win this round.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:37.409 position:50% align:center
Levert's cavalry
passed right by us

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
and clashed with
the Natran rebels.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
Your Highness,
your plan was perfect.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
One of the oldest tricks in
the book, but hey, it worked.

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
Although it never would have
gone as well as it did

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
if not for the Free
Mardenian Forces.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
Because they agreed to meet
up with us at the byway,

00:18:57.178 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center
we were able to attack
the Cavarinians from behind.

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.142 position:50% align:center
In the chaos,
they were pushed forward--

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
directly into a fight
with the Natran renegades.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:09.065 position:50% align:center
Shall we slip past them now
and cross the border?

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
No. We're gonna take this chance

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
to crush the Cavarinians
and the rebels.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
But our current numbers...

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center
[WEIN gasps]

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Right on time.

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Thanks, Hagal.

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What is Hagal
doing here?

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
But I thought General Hagal had
retired. Did you plan all this?

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:43.141 position:50% align:center
I thought it might
not be a bad idea

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:47.062 position:50% align:center
to lure the renegades
out and get rid of 'em.

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
But I never dreamed it
would end up like this.

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
Sorry you got dragged
into it, General Levert.

00:19:56.321 --> 00:20:00.867 position:50% align:center
General Hagal, yes?
Your reputation proceeds you.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
As for me!

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
[HAGAL] I'm sorry.
But I don't need to know

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
the name of a worthless
corpse like you.

00:20:11.336 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
[HAGAL]
The enemy general has fallen!

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN SOLDIERS cheer]

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:22.430 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
His Highness, Prince Helmut,

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
Second Prince of Marden,
is here to see you.

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
Fine. Show him in.

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
Prince Helmut, nice to meet you!

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.649 position:50% align:center
Actually, I guess I
shouldn't say that,

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:35.193 position:50% align:center
considering I've met you before.

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
Under a different name, I think?

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
I am the Crown Princess of
Marden, the name's Zenovia.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
Hello again, Prince Wein,
good to see you.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
You don't seem to be
very surprised.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.342 position:50% align:center
Could it be you knew who
I was the whole time?

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
Well, what really surprised me--

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
[grunting] Ow!

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
[NINYM grunts]

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:07.726 position:50% align:center
When our capital was
attacked by Cavarin,

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
I was fortunately
able to escape,

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
thanks to an astute retainer.

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
I knew that we'd need
to regroup the army

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:17.110 position:50% align:center
if we were to have any chance
of retaking the city.

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
A difficult task for a woman,
but after all the other members

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
of the royal family
were executed,

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
there was no one else left.

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.662 position:50% align:center
So, I became the
prince's aide, Zeno.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:29.539 position:50% align:center
The only reason why it worked

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
is so few of our vassals
knew my face.

00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
In a way, you could call it
a blessing in disguise.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center
Though, the truth
of the matter is,

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
my father disapproved of me.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
And so, he kept me
locked away in a villa.

00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:47.098 position:50% align:center
Funny, huh? That's the
reason I was the only royal

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:49.059 position:50% align:center
to escape the slaughter.

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
[CALDMELLIA] So Natra helped
the Mardenian forces

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:58.276 position:50% align:center
retake their capital
from Cavarin?

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
Heh. Interesting, very much so.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.367 position:50% align:center
It's my fault. I failed
to complete my task.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.787 position:50% align:center
Prince Wein outsmarted both
the renegades and myself.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.622 position:50% align:center
I let you down, my lady.

00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:13.041 position:50% align:center
[CALDMELLIA laughs]
Please don't be

00:22:13.124 --> 00:22:15.251 position:50% align:center
so hard on yourself.

00:22:15.335 --> 00:22:18.755 position:50% align:center
You are my precious children,
each and every one of you.

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.716 position:50% align:center
What would I be without you,
but an old woman

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.719 position:50% align:center
who simply can't help herself
from making mischief?

00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:26.930 position:50% align:center
Lady Caldmellia.

00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:28.973 position:50% align:center
[CALDMELLIA]
Now, lift up your head.

00:22:29.057 --> 00:22:30.141 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:30.225 --> 00:22:32.352 position:50% align:center
Working together,
we shall develop a plan

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:35.480 position:50% align:center
to bring great ruin
upon this continent.

00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:38.400 position:50% align:center
[IBIS]
Yes, Lady Caldmellia.

00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:45.990 position:50% align:center
[ZENOVIA] If Your Highness
is willing to hear it,

00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:47.909 position:50% align:center
I'd like to make a request.

00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:49.452 position:50% align:center
By all means.

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:51.705 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
This worked out perfectly!

00:22:51.788 --> 00:22:52.914 position:50% align:center
From this day forward,

00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:55.500 position:50% align:center
Marden will serve as our
bulwark in the west.

00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:57.877 position:50% align:center
I did a pretty
good job this time!

00:22:57.961 --> 00:23:00.714 position:50% align:center
The land of Marden would like

00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:05.510 position:50% align:center
to swear total allegiance to
Natra and become a vassal state.

00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:08.304 position:50% align:center
[WEIN grunts]
Vassal?

00:23:08.388 --> 00:23:11.599 position:50% align:center
[ZENOVIA] Yes. Although
I am Mardenian royalty,

00:23:11.683 --> 00:23:13.935 position:50% align:center
I know that a woman like me

00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:17.605 position:50% align:center
cannot possibly have what
it takes to rule a kingdom.

00:23:17.689 --> 00:23:21.443 position:50% align:center
The only hope Marden has now
is to rely upon Your Highness,

00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:24.988 position:50% align:center
and to allow your genius and
mercy to carry us forward.

00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:29.242 position:50% align:center
So please, allow us a seat
at the end of Natra's table.

00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:30.744 position:50% align:center
Well, I, uh...

00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:32.245 position:50% align:center
[LIEGEMAN A]
Your Highness.

00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:34.330 position:50% align:center
While it's true that we once
crossed swords with Marden,

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:37.042 position:50% align:center
they are now our trusty
comrades-in-arms.

00:23:37.125 --> 00:23:38.835 position:50% align:center
Let us accept their offer, yes?

00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:40.295 position:50% align:center
Huh? No.

00:23:40.378 --> 00:23:43.214 position:50% align:center
Two hundred years after our
founding and at long last,

00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:45.175 position:50% align:center
Natra's making great strides!

00:23:45.258 --> 00:23:47.177 position:50% align:center
No, wait!

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.888 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Ninym, help!

00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:50.889 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Good luck!

00:23:50.972 --> 00:23:54.184 position:50% align:center
[WEIN grunts, chuckles]

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:58.897 position:50% align:center
[ZENOVIA] Sorry, but you said
it yourself. We value trust,

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.359 position:50% align:center
precisely because the potential
for treachery exists.

00:24:02.442 --> 00:24:03.234 position:50% align:center
[ZENOVIA giggles]

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:06.446 position:50% align:center
[WEIN chuckles nervously]

00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:10.575 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
What did I do to deserve this?!
