00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Excellent.
I'd say our invitations

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.745 position:50% align:center
have been well received,
Mayor Cosimo.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
Yes. With the date in
question close at hand,

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
it seems all of the most
important guests

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:42.834 position:50% align:center
have already arrived.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.794 position:50% align:center
The empire's influence
over its lands

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.921 position:50% align:center
appears to be
stronger than ever.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
Lovely, how goes it with
our three guests of honor?

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
[COSIMO] They patiently
await the proceedings

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.636 position:50% align:center
and have shown no
signs of animosity.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.764 position:50% align:center
I've been so worried
that they'd lose control

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
of themselves and ruin things
before they even begin.

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.269 position:50% align:center
However, it looks
like we should be able

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:03.438 position:50% align:center
to proceed without incident.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.190 position:50% align:center
The four of us with
claims to the throne

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:08.401 position:50% align:center
will convene at the Summit
of Imperial Heirs.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.695 position:50% align:center
And discuss the succession.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.365 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:15.367 position:50% align:center
[FYSHE] Please rest, Your
Highness. You must be tired.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.660 position:50% align:center
Believe me, that's
putting it mildly.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.829 position:50% align:center
Can't let my guard
down with that mayor.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:23.124 position:50% align:center
The city of Mealtars has long
managed to operate autonomously,

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.293 position:50% align:center
without interference
from the Empire.

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:27.337 position:50% align:center
And Mayor Cosimo has
been running things

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.922 position:50% align:center
for many years now.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:32.092 position:50% align:center
Still, I have to admit, he's
helping us out a lot here.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:36.805 position:50% align:center
Agreeing to let us hold the
summit in Mealtars and all.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:39.432 position:50% align:center
[FYSHE] It appears the Natran
delegation has arrived.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:42.102 position:50% align:center
Then we must go
welcome them at once!

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.020 position:50% align:center
[FYSHE] Are you certain
this is appropriate?

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.231 position:50% align:center
Natra is a rather small kingdom.

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:48.274 position:50% align:center
Some might suggest that
receiving them personally

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:49.776 position:50% align:center
is beneath Your Highness.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.903 position:50% align:center
These are dignitaries
from a friendly kingdom

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:53.697 position:50% align:center
who've come at my invitation.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.490 position:50% align:center
Not giving them
a proper greeting

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.951 position:50% align:center
would reflect poorly
on the empire.

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:01.329 position:50% align:center
Indeed. Better that I offer
them a personal welcome,

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:05.250 position:50% align:center
to demonstrate how greatly
I value our alliance.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.751 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:10.088 position:50% align:center
I failed to appreciate how
deeply you'd considered this.

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:12.048 position:50% align:center
Though, the truth
of the matter is,

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.633 position:50% align:center
more than anything else,
I'm looking forward

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:16.386 position:50% align:center
to savoring the surly
look on Wein's face.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.595 position:50% align:center
[FYSHE laughs]

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.098 position:50% align:center
Heh! It's gonna be perfect.

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:22.517 position:50% align:center
When he approaches me and
everyone sees us together,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.520 position:50% align:center
it will promote the impression
that I have close ties to Natra.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:27.772 position:50% align:center
That's the last thing he wants,
but since I'm the one

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center
who invited him, he won't
be able to avoid it!

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.152 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.696 position:50% align:center
Wein's face is gonna
be contorted in agony,

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.406 position:50% align:center
just wait and see.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA gasps, laughs]

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.454 position:50% align:center
You have my gratitude for
traveling all the way

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:45.540 position:50% align:center
to Mealtars. On behalf
of the Earthwold Empire,

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
please allow me to
offer a most sincere--

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:52.797 position:50% align:center
Welcome to-- huh?

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:56.259 position:50% align:center
Your gracious invitation
is deeply appreciated.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.345 position:50% align:center
My brother was unable to attend,

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.472 position:50% align:center
so I'll be meeting
with you instead.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:04.476 position:50% align:center
My name is Falanya Elk
Arbalest, Your Highness.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA grunts]

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.314 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
I'm freaking out!

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50% align:center
I mean, Falanya's got both
Ninym and Nanaki by her side,

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:16.321 position:50% align:center
so she should be fine,
but I still can't help worrying!

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.324 position:50% align:center
She really caught me
off guard with that one.

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:22.160 position:50% align:center
Now then, our kingdom has
received an invitation

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:24.037 position:50% align:center
to an upcoming
commemorative ceremony

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.373 position:50% align:center
being planned by
the Earthwold Empire,

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
to be held in the
city of Mealtars.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
While they're in the city,
the imperial princes and the

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
princess will also be holding
a Summit of Imperial Heirs.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
Normally I'd accept the
invitation but our kingdom

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
is busy dealing with the
aftermath of war at the moment.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:42.722 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
Mm.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
I'd like to hear your opinions
on how we ought to proceed.

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
Key figures from across
the empire will be there.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
And your absence
may allow cracks

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
to begin forming
in the alliance.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
Still, there's much to
be done after the war.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
I fear that if Your Highness
were to leave now,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
it would be counterproductive.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:03:59.948 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Mm...

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Seems like I have a real shot

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
at getting out of this thing!

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.370 position:50% align:center
If I show up there, Lowa's
definitely gonna try to rope me

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
into her faction by
any means necessary.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
No thanks! Talk about
a headache I don't need!

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
Heh. I can picture the
frustration on her face

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
when she realizes I've
outsmarted her again.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Hm?

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.969 position:50% align:center
Look at Falanya, she's probably
thinking if I stay home,

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:23.596 position:50% align:center
I'll have more time
to spend with her.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, little sis.
You'll get your way on this one.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN OFFICIAL A] Surely
we can handle such matters

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
in His Highness' absence,
can we not?

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me that head
sitting on your shoulders

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:35.608 position:50% align:center
is just for show.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
How dare you say that!

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN OFFICIAL C] This is an
opportunity we cannot afford

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
to miss. Your Highness'
presence will reinforce

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
the bonds of our alliance,
ensuring that we'll be able to--

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:45.994 position:50% align:center
Allow me to go!

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
Wha...?

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center
It would be my pleasure
to attend the ceremony

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
on your behalf.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] All right, Princess.
Let us review what we discussed.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
Due to her role in helping
avert civil war in the empire,

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
Princess Lowellmina has gained
a groundswell of support.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
She now has a faction to
rival those of her brothers.

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
She could have taken advantage
of that momentum

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.355 position:50% align:center
to lay claim to
the throne and--

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.106 position:50% align:center
But she didn't, right?

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
Right. She probably reasoned
that if she did so,

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
she'd be seen as
contributing to the chaos

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:23.031 position:50% align:center
and her newfound
support would evaporate.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:26.368 position:50% align:center
Instead, she made her
faction a patriotic one.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] And the nobles
invested in the empire's future

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
backed her up.

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
What her faction is lacking,

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.209 position:50% align:center
unlike those of her brothers,
is military support.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
But the princess is turning
that into an advantage.

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center
With no military backing, she
can credibly position herself

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
as the party prioritizing
peace in the empire.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
So, if the other factions
try to go after her...

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.305 position:50% align:center
They're only gonna end up

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50% align:center
making themselves
look like the villains.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA laughs]

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
She's terrifyingly devious!

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.526 position:50% align:center
[GUEST A] What an adorable
child, where did she come from?

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
[GUEST B]
I've not seen her before.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
However, she certainly
does have a noble bearing.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.950 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
Uh. Princess Falanya.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.578 position:50% align:center
Thank you for coming and
when you've only just arrived,

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
at that. I appreciate it.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
Ah, so that's Princess
Falanya of Natra.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.919 position:50% align:center
Yes, you know, her
brother, Prince Wein,

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
was in talks to marry
Princess Lowellmina.

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.048 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
Please accept my thanks
for your gracious invitation.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
If you'll come with me,
I'd be more than happy

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
to introduce you to
the guests of honor.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
Uh, wait.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Not good. By "guests of honor,"

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
she must mean the princes. If
Lowa introduces Falanya to them,

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center
it will create the
impression that Natra

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
is backing her as
heir to the throne.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:45.989 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA]
My dear brothers,

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.033 position:50% align:center
may I have a moment
of your time?

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
Do you need something,
Lowellmina?

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center
I would like to introduce
you to someone.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.539 position:50% align:center
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.958 position:50% align:center
I am Princess
Falanya Elk Arbalest,

00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
visiting from the
Kingdom of Natra.

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
Well, just look at this.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
Certainly, I've heard of you,
Princess Falanya,

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
but I had no idea
of your beauty.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry the two of us
couldn't have met sooner.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
You're very kind,
Prince Manfred.

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to meet you.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.810 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] My brother told me
about him before I left.

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:17.771 position:50% align:center
Prince Manfred,
the youngest of the three,

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50% align:center
is extraordinarily cunning.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
His public posture is
that his succession

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
is a foregone conclusion.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
And his means of lining up
support is the promise of favors

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
upon his inevitable coronation.

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'd heard Prince Wein
would be unable to join us

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:34.162 position:50% align:center
and that you'd be gracing us
with your presence instead.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.915 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Next, the middle brother,
Prince Bardloche.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
The heart of his support
lies with the military.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.753 position:50% align:center
He received the finest training
from an early age

00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
and is now a celebrated warrior.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.507 position:50% align:center
He sends his apologies.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.093 position:50% align:center
Right now, he's occupied with
the aftermath of the war.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
I'd been looking forward
to speaking with him,

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
but I understand the situation.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.181 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.308 position:50% align:center
How good of you to travel
such a long way

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
to be here for this occasion.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] And finally, the eldest,
Prince Demetrio.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
He has some support solely on
the basis of being the eldest,

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
but he hasn't got much in the
way of ability or character--

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
just your typical
ne'er-do-well rich kid.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.200 position:50% align:center
Like Lord Geralt, who had
that unhappy accident.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
Hard to imagine he could
possibly be that bad, isn't it?

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
[DEMETRIO] So, Natra sent
their young princess here

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
to represent them.
Is that right?

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
Shall we take this as a sign of
Natra's contempt for the empire?

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
Uh. No, Your Highness.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.010 position:50% align:center
Really, of all the
things to say.

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
Princess Falanya
is our guest here.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
She came all this way to
represent Natra at our ceremony.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
I agree, it's too bad
Prince Wein isn't here.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
But treating the princess like
an unworthy replacement

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
is unconscionably rude
of you, I'm afraid.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree,
my dear Manfred?

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center
It would appear my brother
Demetrio is in one of his moods.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50% align:center
Let's leave him and go have
a private chat somewhere.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
Hold on now, I wish to speak
to the princess as well.

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
Oh, Bardloche.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.003 position:50% align:center
This isn't something a
warmongering brute...

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center
Highness. If we stay here,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
you'll just be dragged into
their squabble. Let us depart.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
...it seems only right that
my turn should come first.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:16.514 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm so flattered
by the both of you,

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
but as much as I appreciate
your kind invitations,

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:22.270 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I must respectfully
decline them for today.

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
Am I to understand you find
my company disagreeable?

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's not anything
like that. It's just...

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.238 position:50% align:center
I've got a previous engagement

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
to have a sit-down with
Princess Lowellmina.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course, I don't know how
it could have slipped my mind.

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50% align:center
My deepest apologies,
dear brothers.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
I can't argue with that.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:44.000 position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps another time.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:47.003 position:50% align:center
I suppose we'd better be on
our way, Princess Falanya.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:50.090 position:50% align:center
Yes. Please excuse us,
would you?

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:55.970 position:50% align:center
[DEMETRIO growls]

00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
[GUESTS chattering]

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
All right, then, Princess.
What would you like to do now?

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I would love
to have a sit-down,

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
if that's what you really want.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
Oh, well...

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
It's perfectly fine if you'd
just like to rest for a bit.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.658 position:50% align:center
We'll talk another time.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:20.286 position:50% align:center
[NINYM grunts]

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA sighs]

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
You're handling all this
very well, Your Highness.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
Uh? Uh, Ninym. Do you think...?

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
I really mean it--you've
been doing a magnificent job.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
Please, you shouldn't
look so worried.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:37.679 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
I know I can do more.

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
It's been on my mind.

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:42.308 position:50% align:center
My brother has been busy with
so many different things,

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
and I've tried to figure out
how I can be of help to him.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
Then he sensed my feelings
and responded to them.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
"You decide what to do."

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
That was his message to me,
no doubt about it.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
I think I would like to
rest for a bit after all.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
Yes, good idea.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:07.208 position:50% align:center
Princess, I apologize but I
must leave your side for now.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why?

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
No need to worry about it.
I'll be back shortly.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center
All right? Nanaki.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
Look after Her Highness.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:20.430 position:50% align:center
What is Ninym up
to do you suppose?

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
Um... I-- I dunno.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.100 position:50% align:center
What is that you're eating?

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
It's a pastry. I got it from
over there, it's pretty good.

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
It is? Then I'm gonna
go get one, too!

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:37.447 position:50% align:center
Oh? Hey, is that you
over there, Ninym?

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
Didn't think I'd run
into you so soon.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
Those obvious looks
you kept flashing me

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:43.870 position:50% align:center
would suggest otherwise.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.997 position:50% align:center
Sorry, just teasing.

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Whatever, let's make this quick.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
Tell me what you want
so I can get out of here

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.421 position:50% align:center
and back to Princess Falanya.

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
Don't say that!

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:57.550 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to think she's more
important to you than I am.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
No, really? How perceptive.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:03.556 position:50% align:center
Waa! Waa! You meanie!

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
Hey! Wait a second.
I'm just kidding.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
I am a busy woman, you know.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.939 position:50% align:center
Get to the point already,
or I'll tell Wein

00:12:11.022 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
everyone now calls
you Lard-wellmina

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
because of how much
weight you've gained.

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
Maybe I wasn't kidding
about how mean you are.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
Ahem.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center
I have a proposition
I'd like you to consider.

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
I believe we may be
able to make a deal.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:25.912 position:50% align:center
A deal?

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
I would find it most helpful
if Princess Falanya

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.668 position:50% align:center
would declare that I
have Natra's support.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
Could I ask you to put
in a good word for me?

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
She respects you greatly.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
If you told her it was
the right thing to do,

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she'd agree.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.552 position:50% align:center
So?

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] And in return?
You said a "deal,"

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:45.015 position:50% align:center
so you must have
something to offer.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
Well, of course I do,
you know me!

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
But what could it be?

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.520 position:50% align:center
Oh, just spill it.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
Aww. Fine, have it your way.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
It's about the summit.

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.116 position:50% align:center
[GUEST C]
Listen, everyone!

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.451 position:50% align:center
[NANAKI]
See the man speaking over there?

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:06.745 position:50% align:center
The short one? Just watch him.

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:08.705 position:50% align:center
Tall people naturally
attract attention,

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:09.748 position:50% align:center
but when you're short,

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.541 position:50% align:center
you have to work
harder to stand out.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] He's doing a great job
keeping everyone's attention.

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.796 position:50% align:center
He must be a truly
excellent speaker.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
[NANAKI]
It's not just that.

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
Have you noticed
his physicality?

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
His use of body language
and gestures

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
helps him hold their focus.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
Once you've captured two of
the five senses, you've won.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
Just take a glance down at their
feet and you'll see what I mean.

00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
Uh...

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
[NANAKI] Observe how
everyone's feet are pointed

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:34.105 position:50% align:center
in the direction of the speaker.

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:36.566 position:50% align:center
That's a clear indication
of their interest.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
Say, Nanaki, do you watch
people like this all the time?

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
It's a part of my job.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.491 position:50% align:center
So anyway, why are you
suddenly so interested

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
in observing people,
if I may ask you?

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
I didn't do so well earlier.

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50% align:center
And I think it's because
I let Princess Lowellmina

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.711 position:50% align:center
take the lead and dominate
the conversation.

00:13:56.795 --> 00:14:00.215 position:50% align:center
I thought that if I could learn
how to read people, I'd be able

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
to figure out how to take
control in situations like that.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
The reason that I'm here, is
because I want to find a way

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:10.350 position:50% align:center
to help my brother,
even if only a little.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] I'm prepared
to offer you information

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
about the Summit
of Imperial Heirs.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
Does that interest you?

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
My, the two of you really
are clever, goodness.

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
Stop, you're embarrassing me.
Uh. Wait, the two of us?

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.120 position:50% align:center
That would be you
and Wein, of course.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
He already told me
how to respond

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
if you tried to strike a deal.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
Oh? Well, what was his answer?

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
I believe the exact
way he put it was...

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
"No deal, so just
back off." Yeah.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
As far as Wein is concerned,
this fateful event

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
is nothing more than a
coming-out party for his sister.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
He doesn't care what
happens to the empire.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
If you want Wein to care,

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
then hurry up and crown
the next emperor.

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA growls]

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
Until then, nothing will change
no matter how much you carry on,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
Little Miss Imperial Heir.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA growls]

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.913 position:50% align:center
[inhales, exhales]

00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:16.708 position:50% align:center
Not what I was hoping for,
but that's fine.

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:19.377 position:50% align:center
I suppose there's nothing left
for me to do but figure out

00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
a way to advance my
scheme at the summit.

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:23.006 position:50% align:center
Well, good luck with that.

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
Wow. You're heartless,
aren't you?

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
Actually, no, it's simply
that my heart lies elsewhere.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Now, then, shall we
call this summit to order?

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.492 position:50% align:center
The future of the empire
is at stake, after all.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
[COSIMO] Look around you,
this is our central market,

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
indisputably the main
attraction of Mealtars.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
What an impressive selection

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
of goods there is on offer.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
[COSIMO] The variety of products
available and the volume

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
of activity bring us
great pride.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] I'm still surprised
the mayor offered

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:12.138 position:50% align:center
to give us a personal tour.

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:14.724 position:50% align:center
Perhaps he thinks that by
spending time with us,

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
he'll be able to get a sense
of Natra as a whole.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
[MERCHANT A]
This is a vitally important

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
public health issue as well!

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
There are much
better ways of utilizing

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
those funds than constructing
an aqueduct!

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
That's ridiculous!

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
What's more important
than a clean water supply?

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.076 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you, it will
enrich people's lives

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
in any number of ways!

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:38.331 position:50% align:center
You can't govern a merchant city

00:16:38.415 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
without the participation
of merchants.

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center
Or at least, that's the
way we believe things

00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
should be run here in Mealtars.

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
As such, we established
this forum where townsfolk

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
gather and debate public policy.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
We call it the
Citizens' Assembly.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center
Citizens' Assembly.
So, you're telling me

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
all the people congregated
here are commoners?

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:58.059 position:50% align:center
[COSIMO]
That they are,

00:16:58.143 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
and because the matters
they deliberate

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
are often brought before
the Parliamentary Assembly,

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
they are indispensable to
the legislative process.

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:07.444 position:50% align:center
So, by getting involved
in policy decisions,

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
the people are able
to take direct action

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
to improve their lives.

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:14.993 position:50% align:center
Now I understand why
they seem so earnest.

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:18.663 position:50% align:center
At the present moment,
it seems the topic being debated

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
is the construction
of an aqueduct.

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center
I apologize, Your Highness.

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
This may be quite tedious.

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:26.129 position:50% align:center
If you'd like, I'd be
happy to show you--

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:29.799 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'd like to stay.

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
If it's permissible for
a foreigner like myself

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
to listen in, that is.

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
[COSIMO]
By all means, be my guest.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
[COSIMO] She seems to have
been well educated.

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
At a glance, you might
see nothing more

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:44.147 position:50% align:center
than a provincial maiden
from a good family.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.816 position:50% align:center
But something tells me
there's more to this girl

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
than meets the eye.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
[DEMETRIO grunts]
Damn them!

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:55.241 position:50% align:center
Now those foolish brothers
of mine have gone too far!

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
Having the gall to lay
claim to the throne

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
when it's clearly mine!

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.372 position:50% align:center
Not even 10,000 deaths
would be enough

00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
to punish such
blatant disrespect!

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
Then there's Natra!

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
We're gathered here to
crown the next emperor,

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
and they send a little girl
to represent them!

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
Damn it, Wein, you're nothing
but a small-time prince

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:17.639 position:50% align:center
who finally pushed his run of
dumb luck one step too far!

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
Mark my words,
you're going to pay

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
for the crime of
disrespecting me!

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center
Ha. Yes, in fact, I think
you'll pay quite dearly indeed.

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
[NANAKI] She's exhausted
from the mental strain.

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:39.661 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] I've never seen Her
Highness like this before.

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
Will she be ready to face it
all again tomorrow? I wonder.

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
I say we leave it up to her.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
Don't want to stifle
her personal growth.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
Yes, I understand.

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.843 position:50% align:center
[LOWELLMINA] Of course.
I might have guessed

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:58.263 position:50% align:center
that she'd be sleeping, but
that's not really a problem.

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:01.016 position:50% align:center
The main reason I'm here
is so I can talk to you.

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:02.183 position:50% align:center
What about?

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, I thought you
might want to know

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
how the summit went.

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
You're curious about it,
aren't you?

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:09.190 position:50% align:center
Yes, why wouldn't you be?

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I can't
tell you about it!

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
Because you didn't take my deal!

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
If you had, I would
have loved to,

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
but you didn't,
so I can't, you see?

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
No! Hey, time out, okay!
That's no fair!

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.457 position:50% align:center
You know, Your Highness,
you wouldn't be in this position

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.126 position:50% align:center
if you'd simply practiced
a bit of friendly etiquette.

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
Yes, come in.

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
Sorry to interrupt, Lady Ninym!

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
Has anything happened?

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
Yes. It has. I'm afraid that...

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.015 position:50% align:center
Prince Demetrio, huh?

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
Is there some reason why
you're here, Lowellmina?

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
Certainly. To visit with
Princess Falanya

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.732 position:50% align:center
over a cup of tea.

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:52.442 position:50% align:center
And Prince Demetrio,

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
might I inquire why it is
you've come to see me?

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:58.073 position:50% align:center
The reason I'm here
is quite simple, really.

00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.658 position:50% align:center
I have a proposition for Natra.

00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
Oh, a proposition you say?
And what might that be?

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
I would like to take you as
my bride, Princess Falanya.

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.334 position:50% align:center
[NINYM, LOWELLMINA gasp]

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:14.714 position:50% align:center
You-- You want me...
t-to marry you?

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
[DEMETRIO]
Yes!

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
But why? This is all so sudden.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
During these troubled times of
ours, a close alliance between

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:25.767 position:50% align:center
the empire and Natra is
more important than ever.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
I wish to strengthen the
bond between our two lands,

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:32.357 position:50% align:center
and I believe that a marriage
will be the best way to do so.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.775 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
There's no way he doesn't have

00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
ulterior motives for this.

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.779 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] He's got ulterior
motives, for sure.

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
Definitely.

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
Prince Demetrio, thank you
for making me aware

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:44.744 position:50% align:center
of your intentions. Your desire
to strengthen the ties

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
between us is a feeling
I deeply share.

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
So?

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
I shall communicate
your proposition to Natra

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
at the earliest opportunity,
and as soon--

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.714 position:50% align:center
I expect you to give me
an answer right now!

00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:58.591 position:50% align:center
Dear brother, surely you can see
why that's an unreasonable--

00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
[DEMETRIO]
Mind your own business!

00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
It's quite obvious
that this marriage

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.514 position:50% align:center
would be to our mutual benefit.

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:08.351 position:50% align:center
There is no cause for debate,
don't you agree?

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
[DEMETRIO]
Once we're married,

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
she's going to
become my property.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.398 position:50% align:center
However I may torment her,

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
no one will be able
to say a thing.

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:18.778 position:50% align:center
I promise you, Wein, you'll
rue the day you ever let

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:21.239 position:50% align:center
this poor child
take your place here.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
[DEMETRIO]
Now then, Princess!

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:24.909 position:50% align:center
I'd say if you're capable
of filling in for your

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
absent brother, then you can
make this decision, too!

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
That's true.

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
Right now, I'm supposed to be
standing in for my brother.

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:37.047 position:50% align:center
If someone tried to
coerce him like this,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.090 position:50% align:center
how would he respond to it?

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
You have made your
position quite clear.

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
But a royal marriage has
serious political ramifications.

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
One so young and
inexperienced as myself

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
cannot possibly
decide such a thing.

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:53.938 position:50% align:center
Huh? What was that now?

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:57.609 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] There it is,
just like at the assembly.

00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:00.779 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
He has the same look

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:04.199 position:50% align:center
of confused impatience
I saw there.

00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
[DEMETRIO] Refuse to give me
an answer, will you?

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.663 position:50% align:center
Very well then! If that's the
way you wish to play this game,

00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:12.665 position:50% align:center
you can have it your way!

00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:16.002 position:50% align:center
Just wait till I become the next
emperor. I'm going to make your

00:22:16.086 --> 00:22:19.381 position:50% align:center
petty little kingdom of Natra
suffer in every way possible!

00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:21.591 position:50% align:center
[DEMETRIO laughing]
Regretting your decision?

00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:24.094 position:50% align:center
Well, it's too late!
No going back now!

00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:25.345 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:22:25.428 --> 00:22:28.306 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but if this conversation
involves Natra,

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.892 position:50% align:center
I think I'm entitled
to have a say.

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:33.937 position:50% align:center
Pleased to make your
acquaintance, Prince Demetrio!

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:39.025 position:50% align:center
Wein Salema Arbalest, the crown
prince of the kingdom of Natra!
