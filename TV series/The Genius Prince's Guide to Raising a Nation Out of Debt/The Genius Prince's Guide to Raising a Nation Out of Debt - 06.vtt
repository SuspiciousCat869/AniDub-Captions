00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.037 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] I don't want to do this.
I shouldn't have accepted

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center
the King of
Cavarin's invitation.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.623 position:50% align:center
This Festival of
the Spirit is gonna

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
mean trouble for us somehow.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.794 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Yeah, that's
a fair assumption.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
Assuming, of course,
that the two of us

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.299 position:50% align:center
actually make it
to Cavarin safely.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.093 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Again, a fair point,
remnants of Marden's army

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center
haunt the borderlands even now.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
[WEIN sighs]
I really was shocked, you know.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Shocked by what, exactly?

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Your hair?

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.692 position:50% align:center
Really, more like floored.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.861 position:50% align:center
It doesn't even look
like you dyed it.

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:12.989 position:50% align:center
It's a secret Flahm technique.
What do you think, Wein?

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.867 position:50% align:center
Of the two, which is your
preference--white or black?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.495 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Hey!
That's a trick question!

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.996 position:50% align:center
Because either way,
I know my answer

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.873 position:50% align:center
is gonna come back to haunt me!

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.917 position:50% align:center
The only thing that'll
come back to haunt you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.920 position:50% align:center
will be making light
of the question.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:29.673 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
White!

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.342 position:50% align:center
Oh, how unusually decisive.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.428 position:50% align:center
Come now, Ninym. You know
quite well I'm an honest prince

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:38.098 position:50% align:center
whose creed is to
always be decisive.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.725 position:50% align:center
Sure. White, then, very well.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:41.976 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.978 position:50% align:center
I must confess,
I was secretly hoping

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:47.524 position:50% align:center
you'd like my hair this way,
but no such luck.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:48.942 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's not fair!

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:51.111 position:50% align:center
This is exactly what I
was afraid you would do!

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.904 position:50% align:center
It's perfectly fair.

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:55.782 position:50% align:center
Any other woman would
react the same way.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:58.535 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] All right. If that's
the game you're playing.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.287 position:50% align:center
Now see here! You did ask
me about my preference

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.581 position:50% align:center
between white and black,
but you neglected to specify

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:06.459 position:50% align:center
that you were talking
about your hair. So...

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:07.585 position:50% align:center
So what?

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.921 position:50% align:center
I was talking about
your underwear.

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:11.339 position:50% align:center
--[smack]
--[WEIN yelps]

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:14.426 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose I was
partly to blame for that then.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.594 position:50% align:center
Let's make a truce, huh?

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.763 position:50% align:center
You would suggest that
after being the only one

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:20.306 position:50% align:center
to get a blow in.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.685 position:50% align:center
How's this, as an olive branch,
I'll let you stroke my hair.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
Oh. Not too hard,
though, or else

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50% align:center
there's a chance the
color might come off.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.609 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:36.072 position:50% align:center
Really. Well, at least
it isn't ruined.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.241 position:50% align:center
The last thing that a
Flahm needs in a place

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.910 position:50% align:center
like Cavarin is to stand
out from the crowd.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.245 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.711 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
I really don't want to do this.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:57.761 position:50% align:center
I think that should be just
about enough for today's lesson.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
Ah! By the way, Claudius.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
You must know about the
Festival of the Spirit, right?

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
Seeing as you are from the west.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.729 position:50% align:center
Indeed, I do. May I
presume Your Highness

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
is familiar with the
Teachings of Levetia?

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.942 position:50% align:center
It's a popular western
religion, isn't it?

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.861 position:50% align:center
Well, once a year,
in early spring,

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.447 position:50% align:center
the followers of that religion
observe a sacred ritual

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
called the Festival of
the Spirit to commemorate

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.951 position:50% align:center
a most significant
historical event.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50% align:center
The defeat of a malicious and
powerful demon by Levetia,

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
a devoted servant
of God, as well as

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
the religion's founder
and namesake.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center
The festival is a way of giving
thanks for this great deed.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:34.923 position:50% align:center
Ohhh...

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:38.551 position:50% align:center
If Cahvarin invited my brother
to such an important festival,

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center
maybe it means
they want to improve

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.472 position:50% align:center
their relations with Nahtra.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] All right, Wein.
I'm gonna say this once.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
When we get to Cavarin,
it's of the utmost importance

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
that you try your best
to behave yourself.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:51.648 position:50% align:center
Of course I will.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
Even if you don't agree with
their ideology or culture,

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
you still have to
keep your cool.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
What kind of an idiot do
you take me for anyway?

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.740 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Now, promise me.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center
Absolutely! And have
you ever known

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center
good old Wein to
break a promise?

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
Yeah, constantly.

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
Well, then. I hope I change!

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
You break this promise,
and I'm gonna fill

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
every orifice of your
body with potatoes.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
Do what you want, but
honestly, that sounds like

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.510 position:50% align:center
a pretty irresponsible
waste of food to me.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
Your Highness. I apologize
for the interruption.

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
But I just wanted to take
a moment to let you know

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
that we're going to arrive

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.435 position:50% align:center
at the Jilaat Gold
Mine very shortly.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
Great! Finally here!

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] It looks like the
facilities and tunnels

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
that were damaged during the war

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
have been almost
completely restored.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
Yes, and thanks to
our additional labor,

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
we're mining more
gold all the time.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
I'm also pleased to tell you
we've recently begun the process

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
of investigating new veins
of gold within the mine.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
New veins of gold.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center
Just hearing those words
makes my heart dance for joy!

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Wein, your face.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center
Hmph. [clears throat]

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
Just don't let your management
falter as things are ramping up.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.096 position:50% align:center
High turnover within
the mine may allow

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
unsavory characters
to slip through.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'll keep that in mind.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] We never had to
worry about such things

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
before General
Hagal became unwell.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.778 position:50% align:center
Such an unexpected retirement.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:24.532 position:50% align:center
During the recent war, he fought
magnificently, as always.

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
As he himself said to me,
"You can't fight off

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
old age forever."
I won't ask him to try.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
I do wonder what General
Hagal is doing now.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Probably enjoying
his retirement.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
Farming, and things like that.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
Farming, really?

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.717 position:50% align:center
If I'm being honest,
I wanted to stop him.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50% align:center
In the absence of the general,

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
the nobility are beginning
to grow rebellious.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.516 position:50% align:center
Or so the reports tell me.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center
Is this correct, Ibis?

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
Was Prince Wein
invited to attend

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
the Festival of the
Spirit in Cavarin?

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
It is true, beyond any doubt,
for those who make information

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.156 position:50% align:center
their trade, their very
lives depend on validity.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
Then let's move. With Hagal

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
and the prince both gone,
this is our chance to rise up!

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
The royal family is
nothing to fear now!

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
We shall erect a
new power structure

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center
in Natra with ourselves
as its center!

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:16.668 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN NOBLE D]
Call up the troops!

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
We shall deal a heavy blow
against the royal house!

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
Now is the time for us to act!

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50% align:center
May you travel safely upon your
chosen path, Prince Wein.

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
The enemy! To arms, everyone!

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS shouting]

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM]
Godspeed, Your Highness!

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.282 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Soldiers disguising
themselves as brigands.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
In all likelihood, they've
either been sent by Cavarin,

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.995 position:50% align:center
or they're holdovers
from Marden.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
At the moment,
it's impossible to say which.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.958 position:50% align:center
Nothing to do but roll the dice!

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.501 position:50% align:center
Wein! The area up ahead

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50% align:center
is controlled by
Mardenian remnants!

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
--Don't worry, just keep going!
--[NINYM] You sure?

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. If I'm reading
this correctly...

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
[KUSTAVI]
Heh.

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
Wein! I'll try to buy
you some time.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
That won't be necessary.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center
[KUSTAVI yelps]

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:22.859 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
All right, retreat!

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
They're Mardenians.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Yeah. Looks that way.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
My name is Wein Salema Arbalest.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.668 position:50% align:center
I am the crown prince of Natra.

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:40.960 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.796 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] I have come to meet
with Prince Helmut--

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:46.007 position:50% align:center
he who commands the
Free Mardenian Forces.

Please show me to him at once!

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:09.489 position:50% align:center
You are the crown prince
of Natra, correct?

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
I speak to you on His Highness,
Prince Helmut's behalf.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
My name is Zeno.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
The prince is
currently bedridden

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
and will be unable
to receive you.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.042 position:50% align:center
The prince is unwell?

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
After the collapse
of the capital,

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.630 position:50% align:center
the prince was
seized by Cavarin.

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
And the fiends put
a torch to his face.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
[PRINCE HELMUT screams]

[gasps]

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
Prince Wein, please tell me.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.849 position:50% align:center
What is it exactly that
you're doing here?

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
I would appreciate a
straightforward response.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
As it happens, I was just
now on my way to Cavarin

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:45.025 position:50% align:center
to attend the
Festival of the Spirit.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
[ZENO] Are you aware of
the implications of what

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50% align:center
you just said? I wonder,
Prince Wein,

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center
if you wouldn't
like to rethink that.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what I could
possibly "rethink."

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:56.202 position:50% align:center
Those are the facts
of the situation.

00:08:56.286 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
[ZENO] If that's how it is...
then I have no choice

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
but to cut you down
where you stand!

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
Say, Prince Wein,
I have a question for you.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
Well then, ask away.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
[RAKLUM] He turned an enemy
on the verge of killing him

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
into his partner in a
temporary alliance.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:24.064 position:50% align:center
Once again, I find myself in awe
of His Highness's audacity.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.315 position:50% align:center
I don't mind telling you

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
I really thought it
was all over this time.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center
[WEIN laughs]

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.697 position:50% align:center
Do I amuse you, Prince?

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, my apologies.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
I would like to ask
one question, though.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.373 position:50% align:center
What is it you're hoping
to accomplish by killing me?

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
I'll stop the alliance
of Natra and Cavarin.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.378 position:50% align:center
And then? Once I'm
out of the way,

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
do you think you and
your freedom fighters

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
will be capable of
defeating Cavarin?

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.257 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] They can muster an
army over 20,000 strong.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
What's the present
strength of your forces?

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.224 position:50% align:center
It couldn't be any
more than 2 or 3,000,

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:00.850 position:50% align:center
and that's a generous estimate.

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
[MARDENIAN SOLDIERS growl]

[WEIN] Once the winter season
has come to an end,

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
you're going to have the
full weight of Cavarin

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
bearing down on you. How will
the Free Mardenian Forces

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.569 position:50% align:center
deal with that outcome?

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
[NINYM chuckles softly]

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
[ZENO] What point is it
you're trying to make here?

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.744 position:50% align:center
That my people are
doomed no matter what,

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
so we might as well
let you go free?

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50% align:center
Not at all. I'd like
to offer you a proposal

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.669 position:50% align:center
that I think will be
to our mutual benefit.

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.464 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Quite so. Tell me. Zeno,

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
do you have anyone
in your command

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
that you would be willing to
send with us to Cavarin?

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
[ZENO]
I don't understand.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] The brigands that
attacked us on the road,

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
they were most likely Cavarinian
troops in disguise.

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.105 position:50% align:center
[ZENO]
That doesn't make sense.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
What reason would Cavarin
have to do something like that?

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure, and
that's why I'm offering

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
this proposal to you.

I will proceed with my journey
to Cavarin as planned.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.743 position:50% align:center
However, depending on what
exactly is awaiting me,

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:02.037 position:50% align:center
it may be to my advantage
to ally myself

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
with your Free Mardenian Forces.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
From that perspective,
I think it would be a good idea

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
to take one of you along
with me just to be prepared.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
Influential figures
from across the land

are convening in the
capital of Cavarin.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.261 position:50% align:center
Security around them
will be tight.

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
But for a member of a
diplomatic delegation,

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
it shouldn't be an issue.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
[ZENO gasps]

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
And perhaps, if we make
contact with them,

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
they might be willing
to offer us their help.

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
I'll admit, you've
made a proposal

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
that's worthy of consideration.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
In that case--

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
[ZENO] Nevertheless, I cannot
shake my uneasiness.

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center
Everything you've just
said could be an act,

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
a clever ruse to
escape our grasp.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
I have no idea if I
can really trust you.

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.249 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] So that's what
you're worried about.

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
But why is that a problem?

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.378 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:54.923 position:50% align:center
That's how trust is--
we value it precisely because

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
the potential for
treachery exists.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:01.346 position:50% align:center
Sometimes people lie. Sometimes
you're fooled by a trick.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
Recognizing that,
and choosing to trust

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
in spite of it is how we
reach each other's hearts!

[ZENO gasps]

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:10.814 position:50% align:center
Can you do it, then?

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:15.485 position:50% align:center
Set your doubts aside and
choose to offer me your trust?

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
Yes, I can.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:19.322 position:50% align:center
I will advise Prince Helmut
that, in my opinion,

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
you have shown yourself
worthy of our trust.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.493 position:50% align:center
If things go as I
believe they will,

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.412 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt there
will soon come a time

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
when the prince himself
reaches the same conclusion.

with King Ordalasse of Cavarin.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.782 position:50% align:center
For my personal guard,
I'll take Raklum

and a handful of others.
Whoever you'd like to bring.

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Ninym's team
will be tasked with

gathering information. Please
choose whomever you see fit.

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
Of course, Your Highness.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
And what about you, Zeno?
What will you do? Zeno?

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
Uh? Oh. Forgive me.

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
I thought that perhaps
my people and I

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
would do some information
gathering of our own.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
I see. Please coordinate with
Ninym if the need arises.

00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
Ah. Sir. The envoy
from Natra, yes?

quite an experience,

being from such a small kingdom.

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:02.676 position:50% align:center

[CAVARINIAN OFFICIAL A]
That's Levert.

He's served as a general in our

More importantly...
Look at that.

The man walking right
beside him, do you see?

When we fell victim to an
ambush during our travels,

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
the man calling out orders
took an arrow to the right arm.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
Interesting coincidence.

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
Do you think?

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
For the moment, there's
no way to be sure,

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
which means we'll have to
consider it an open possibility.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.421 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center

my wish that we could

sit down together
and exchange words.

And on this day, my wish
has come true at last.

Still, this is no place
for a conversation.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
[ZENO growls]

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center
[ZENO]
Where are we?

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.646 position:50% align:center
This is a hideout
used by our spies

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
when they're
stationed in this area.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.860 position:50% align:center
[ZENO] Are you sure it was a
good idea to bring me here?

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.737 position:50% align:center
No, actually, I'm not.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.324 position:50% align:center
However, I needed to have
a private chat with you.

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
The man that you were
about to assassinate.

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:55.705 position:50% align:center
I know he once served
the king of Marden.

00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
[ZENO]
Holonyeh.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
Did he betray Marden somehow?
Was he a defector to Cavarin?

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:04.547 position:50% align:center
He's to blame!

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:07.008 position:50% align:center
It's all because of
his cowardly betrayal.

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:08.259 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for that traitor,

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:10.178 position:50% align:center
my father never
would have been--

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] You lost your
father in the attack?

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:17.060 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yes. That's right.
My family got caught up in it.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:20.021 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about your loss,
but under the present

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
circumstances, I cannot
allow you to kill him.

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
Very well. Then I'll
move on to other matters

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
and put him off till later.

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.074 position:50% align:center
Thank you, I appreciate that.

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
Still, that man,
such a betrayal.

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:35.203 position:50% align:center
[ZENO]
What about it?

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm just wondering
how Prince Wein

00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:39.416 position:50% align:center
will react when he
finds out about it.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.042 position:50% align:center
[WEIN grunts]

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
Here we are now,
it's Prince Wein!

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Hold on.
Am I standing in front of...

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
These are the Holy Elites,

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.802 position:50% align:center
pillars of the
Levetian religion.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:53.304 position:50% align:center
They've traveled from far
and wide to assemble

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
in Cavarin for the
Gathering of the Chosen.

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
What is this?!

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.854 position:50% align:center
And why the hell was I
invited here for it?

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:04.607 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, King Ordalasse,
but I am puzzled.

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center
Why is it the prince
of Natra has joined us?

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Then... they're as
surprised as I am about this!

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
What's more, I have no
control over the situation!

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50% align:center
This isn't looking too good.

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.203 position:50% align:center
Honored Holy Elites.

00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
I ask that you please
consider what I have to say.

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
At this time, I would
like to nominate,

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:24.878 position:50% align:center
as the newest member
of your ranks,

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
Wein Salema Arbalest!

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
[WEIN screaming]

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.060 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Oh, come on!
I can't take it anymore!

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.728 position:50% align:center
Why do these things
keep happening?

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
When the hell am I ever
gonna catch a break?!

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:46.733 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Are you going to
tell me what happened?

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
King Ordalasse nominated me
to join the Holy Elites.

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
Are you joking?

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
No way. Serious. Dead serious.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center
To join the Holy Elites,
one must be a descendant

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
of either Levetia,
the religion's founder,

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
or one of Levetia's
chief disciples.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and I qualify.

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
You see my family tree
can be traced back

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center
to Caleus, a chief
disciple of Levetia.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
So, what will you do?

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:15.595 position:50% align:center
Are you really going
to become a Holy Elite?

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
Well, it does have
its advantages.

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
Indeed, it does.

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:22.519 position:50% align:center
The current Holy Elites are
individuals of consequence

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
hailing from all
across the west.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
It couldn't hurt to make
some connections, could it?

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
For starters, I'll do
a little legwork

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
and pay courtesy calls
on every last one of 'em.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:35.073 position:50% align:center
Hey, Wein.
On those courtesy calls,

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
I think that you should
ask Zeno to accompany you.

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] This is our chance
to meet with Holy Elites from

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
all over. Use the opportunity
as you see fit, Zeno.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:48.586 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll plead our case,

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
and hopefully we'll come
upon a sympathetic ear.

00:18:54.426 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
Our first stop,
the famous Caldmellia.

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Unfortunately,
the western lands are rife

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:03.727 position:50% align:center
with misogynistic sentiment.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50% align:center
And because the
Teachings of Levetia

00:19:05.562 --> 00:19:06.980 position:50% align:center
are interpreted literally,

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:09.858 position:50% align:center
women typically aren't accepted
in its highest positions.

00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
But you, Caldmellia,
flourished against all odds.

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:15.030 position:50% align:center
You've reached the
highest position available

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
to one not related to
Levetia or a disciple,

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
Director of the Bureau
of Teachings.

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:29.544 position:50% align:center
Your Highness's feelings have
come across with great clarity.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
With the full authority
granted me by His Holiness,

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
I'm prepared to confirm
your suitability

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.676 position:50% align:center
as a candidate for
the Holy Elites.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
Then--

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
And I ask but one
thing in return.

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
What do you require of me?

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.726 position:50% align:center
[CALDMELLIA]
According to King Ordalasse,

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.187 position:50% align:center
you went to war against
the kingdom of Marden,

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.772 position:50% align:center
that its people
might be released

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:51.524 position:50% align:center
from the cruel tyranny
of their king.

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:53.401 position:50% align:center
This noblest of deeds shows

00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
what a fine Holy
Elite you'd make.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] The war had nothing
to do with that, of course.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
Just a convenient fiction.

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
And so, I cannot
give your nomination

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
my support until their
salvation is completed.

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
What? "Until their
salvation is completed"?

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:13.004 position:50% align:center
Cavarin already took Marden's
capital, with Natra's help.

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
Yes, but what about
the remnants of the army?

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
[ZENO, WEIN grunt]

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
As long as those remnants
continue to defy us,

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
alas, the followers of Levetia

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
will live in fear of
being persecuted.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
That the hearts of the faithful
might once again know peace.

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:33.608 position:50% align:center
All of these remnants
must be slain, their corpses

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:37.612 position:50% align:center
publicly displayed and thrown
into the fires of damnation.

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
Am I wrong?

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
[WEIN grunts]

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
Say, you there,
is something the matter?

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
If you find yourself
suddenly feeling unwell

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.874 position:50% align:center
for any reason, please do
feel free to take a seat.

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.335 position:50% align:center
That won't be necessary,
but thank you.

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine right here.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] I see, now. So, this
is how it's going to be.

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:01.428 position:50% align:center
[CALDMELLIA laughs]

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
I really struck a nerve
there, didn't I?

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
Well, Owl, I hope that
was sufficient payback

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
for the arm he took from you.

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
You enjoy this far too
much, Lady Caldmellia.

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
Myself, I was afraid
that attendant of his

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
might get violent. That would
have been unfortunate.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
You really think so?

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
I would have found it
simply splendid.

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Ninym. I want you
to investigate Levert

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.539 position:50% align:center
and his inner circle tomorrow.

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
He may have been the
one behind our ambush.

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:35.670 position:50% align:center
Or if not, perhaps a
member of his faction.

00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:39.841 position:50% align:center
[NINYM grunts]
Holonyeh...

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:45.013 position:50% align:center
"As instructed"... "floor
plans"... "of the mansion."

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:47.349 position:50% align:center
"It's really going to happen."

00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
"The king's bloodline"...
"Your traitor will be"?

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:56.274 position:50% align:center
With the prince out
of the picture"...

00:21:56.358 --> 00:21:59.819 position:50% align:center
"We can take Natra"?

00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:06.701 position:50% align:center
You devils!

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.538 position:50% align:center
[IBIS laughs]

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.166 position:50% align:center
[OWL]
Are you really serious about

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:15.627 position:50% align:center
bringing the prince
into the Holy Elites?

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:20.382 position:50% align:center
Yes! I do hope he can eliminate
those leftovers from Marden.

00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:23.968 position:50% align:center
[OWL] Respectfully, my lady,
the prince is a serious threat.

00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:26.096 position:50% align:center
If he should gain
power in the west,

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:30.016 position:50% align:center
I can pretty much guarantee
he will become a bane to you.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.976 position:50% align:center
[CALDMELLIA] Wouldn't that
make things interesting?

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.353 position:50% align:center
[OWL grunts]

00:22:33.436 --> 00:22:35.772 position:50% align:center
[CALDMELLIA laughs]
May he find

00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:40.068 position:50% align:center
that all his valiant efforts
come just a little too late.
