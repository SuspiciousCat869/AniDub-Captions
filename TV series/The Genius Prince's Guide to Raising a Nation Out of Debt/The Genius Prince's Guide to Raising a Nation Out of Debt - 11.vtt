WEBVTT

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.742
[SIRGIS] I apologize for my
sudden and unexpected arrival,

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:06.876
Marchioness Zenovia.
I hope you'll forgive me.

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:08.573
Of course, Sir Sirgis.

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:10.967
But tell me, what is it
that brings you here?

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.361
I'm following up on
the letter I sent you.

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:16.016
Based on the evidence I've seen,
I have reason to believe

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.192
that Marden has been
fraudulently exporting

00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:20.020
imperial goods to Delunio.

00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:23.762
Terribly sorry, but I
must admit I don't have

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:26.200
any idea what you
could be referring to.

00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:29.725
[SIRGIS] And is that all you
intend to say on the matter?

00:00:29.768 --> 00:00:31.466
Then you leave me
no choice, it seems

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.470
I'm going to have to take up
my concerns with Natra.

00:00:35.513 --> 00:00:38.081
I understand the crown prince
of Natra is currently

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.431
visiting your land,
is that correct?

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:41.824
[ZENOVIA]
So that's it.

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:44.696
He showed up during Prince
Wein's visit on purpose.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.785
So that if he didn't get
what he wanted from me,

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.526
he could go over my head.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.660
Basically, he has no
respect for my position.

00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:53.618
I really want to kill him.

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:56.099
[WEIN]
You wish to speak with me?

00:00:56.143 --> 00:00:57.622
Huh?

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.277
[WEIN]
I am only too happy to oblige.

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:02.627
Wein Salema Arbalest.

00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.675
The crown prince of
the kingdom of Natra.

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:08.981
Well then, let's
get down to business.

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:11.375
You've got some kind of
complaint about our exports,

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:12.246
is that right?

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.030
[SIRGIS]
Indeed, I do.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.076
There's been a rash of
imperial-made goods

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.121
flowing into the west recently.

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:20.428
And you're the ones
sending them.

00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:23.170
The empire is a mortal enemy
to the Levetian religion,

00:01:23.213 --> 00:01:26.086
and as such, their goods
are considered anathema.

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:29.089
I realize that your kingdom has
longstanding ties with the east,

00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:31.569
however, I also know you
yourself are descended

00:01:31.613 --> 00:01:33.180
from the bloodline of Caleus.

00:01:33.223 --> 00:01:35.007
All I ask is that you
show some respect

00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:37.009
for the traditions
of your heritage.

00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:40.100
I see. Everything you
say is reasonable.

00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:43.190
It's just, our export goods
aren't made in the empire,

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:44.974
all of them are made in Natra.

00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:48.064
You think you can deny the truth
of the matter so easily?

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.458
Nonsense. Just take
those outlandish

00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:53.243
yellow garments the
young people so favor.

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:55.376
Although they were passed
off to us as Natran,

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:57.682
we have determined
conclusively that these garments

00:01:57.726 --> 00:01:59.858
were constructed in the empire.

00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:01.860
So then, what do you
have to say now?

00:02:01.904 --> 00:02:05.560
With all due respect,
that doesn't make any sense.

00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:09.172
The Levetians consider the east
to be a land of barbarians,

00:02:09.216 --> 00:02:10.826
do they not?

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.655
Do you really mean to suggest
that such barbarians are capable

00:02:13.698 --> 00:02:15.787
of producing goods that
would find favor among

00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:17.920
the refined people of Delunio?

00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:19.617
Surely you don't believe that.

00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:25.362
Well, I, uh... Let's move
on from that for now.

00:02:25.406 --> 00:02:28.757
Right. There's also the matter
of imperial goods being peddled

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.194
to pilgrims as they
pass through Marden.

00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:34.719
As a descendant of Caleus,
you must realize this is wrong.

00:02:34.763 --> 00:02:37.287
It is customary to allow
Levetian pilgrims to pass

00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:39.942
without interference
or harassment.

00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:42.205
To break with this tradition
is no less than a slap

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.252
in the face to the entirety
of the Levetian faith!

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:48.168
Well, you're certainly
entitled to your opinion

00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:50.735
on the situation, and I
thank you for sharing it.

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.129
However, as strong
as your faith may be,

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.566
you yourself are
not a Holy Elite.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.048
And for that reason, I'm afraid
you lack the proper authority

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:01.268
to speak on behalf
of the Levetians.

00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:02.182
[growls]

00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:03.270
[WEIN]
Was there anything else

00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:06.186
you wanted to
discuss, Sir Sirgis?

00:03:07.578 --> 00:03:09.972
I'm going to leave it there
for today and return home

00:03:10.015 --> 00:03:12.714
to give these matters
further consideration.

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:18.763
[SIRGIS] But before I go,
let me say this much.

00:03:18.807 --> 00:03:22.854
The time will come when I give
you cause to rue this day.

00:03:22.898 --> 00:03:24.508
Then I suppose I'll
just have to pray

00:03:24.552 --> 00:03:26.815
that time never comes to pass.

00:03:29.296 --> 00:03:31.950
[ZENOVIA]
I apologize for last night.

00:03:31.994 --> 00:03:35.040
As our guest, you shouldn't
have gotten dragged into that.

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:36.651
It's quite all right.

00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:39.828
I was able to learn a lot about
the prime minister of Delunio.

00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:43.875
Sadly, I fear we haven't
seen the last of Sir Sirgis.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.704
He's sure to keep up the
pressure however he can.

00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:48.663
Do stay on your guard,
won't you?

00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:51.405
Yes. Most definitely.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.148
[WEIN]
There it is, Phithcha,

00:03:56.192 --> 00:03:59.108
royal capital of the
Kingdom of Soljest.

00:03:59.151 --> 00:04:01.197
Seems they're doing quite well!

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.461
Like Natra, Soljest is
situated in the north.

00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:07.290
But even so, their port
is never icebound.

00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:10.641
[WEIN] Right. Meaning they can
conduct trade year-round.

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:12.469
Not to mention they do
business with a number

00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:14.079
--of foreign markets.
--So...

00:04:14.123 --> 00:04:16.256
If Marden can get in on
this maritime trade,

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.170
it'll open up even
more trade routes

00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:20.303
that they'll be able
to profit off of.

00:04:22.174 --> 00:04:23.306
[GRUYERE]
Good of you to grace us

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.526
with your presence,
young prince.

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.355
[WEIN] It was most kind of you
to extend the invitation,

00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:31.271
Your Majesty. I thank you.

00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:33.360
[GRUYERE] Please, you and I
joined forces to liberate

00:04:33.403 --> 00:04:35.840
the city of Mealtars,
did we not?

00:04:35.884 --> 00:04:38.539
It has long been my desire
for the two of us to sit down

00:04:38.582 --> 00:04:41.063
and exchange words man to man.

00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:43.674
Shall we, then?
To the great hall.

00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:45.110
[gasps]

00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:46.373
[GRUYERE] It is a tradition
of mine to hold talks

00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:49.245
with heads of state
over a delicious meal.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.295
[WEIN, NINYM gasping]

00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:58.646
With a physique like this,
walking around is quite a chore.

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.605
This palanquin is my
preferred means of transport.

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:03.738
[laughs]

00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:07.176
Being of noble blood enables one
to do things others cannot.

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.134
Using one one's own
legs to move about

00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:11.746
is an activity better
suited to a peasant.

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.965
For a man who lives a life
of wealth and prestige,

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.273
this is the only way
to travel, believe you me.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.144
Interesting perspective,
Your Majesty.

00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:22.626
Yes, well. It's also true
that one noble's calling

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.976
may not be the
same as another's.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.371
If you find that my chosen
lifestyle doesn't appeal to you,

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:32.201
perhaps that's because
your calling lies elsewhere.

00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:37.641
My calling, Your Majesty? Can't
imagine what that could be.

00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:39.948
[GRUYERE] In our youth, we are
pulled in many different

00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:43.734
directions and we fail
as often as we succeed.

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:47.390
Then, as the years go on by,
we make a discovery.

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:50.001
We become aware of
the beast within us

00:05:50.045 --> 00:05:53.918
and the desires that drive it.

00:05:53.962 --> 00:05:56.181
[WEIN]
If I had to guess, I'd say

00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.967
he's after a loose alliance
between our nations.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.013
Most likely, he wants to
prevent Natra from expanding

00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:04.712
further westward and he
may also be interested

00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:07.018
in working with Delunio,
whose prime minister

00:06:07.062 --> 00:06:09.891
currently has it out for me.

00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:12.328
When I arrived here
today, my goal

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.070
was to extract some
foreign trade from Soljest.

00:06:15.113 --> 00:06:17.942
But now I'm thinking,
if I play my cards right,

00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:20.336
perhaps there's a
scenario where Natra

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.861
and Soljest can join
forces against Delunio.

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:27.648
Natra is now able to mobilize
a considerable army.

00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:30.172
And if we had Gruyere at the
fore, we'd be able to rebuff

00:06:30.215 --> 00:06:32.348
any interference
from the Levetians.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.003
Then we could conquer
Delunio and divvy up its land,

00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:37.527
while also working
together on trade.

00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:41.401
Man, oh, man! I might
really be a genius after all!

00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:44.360
All right! Let's go!
Teamin' up with Gruyere!

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.971
Sorry, food, but I can't
afford to think about you.

00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:49.321
I gotta focus right now!

00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:54.370
Huh? And who do we have here?

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.417
So, you must be
Prince Wein, an honor.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.682
I'm King Gruyere's daughter,
Tolcheila. Pleased to meet you!

00:07:04.206 --> 00:07:06.034
I believe I asked you
quite clearly

00:07:06.077 --> 00:07:08.471
not to be a nuisance
to me and my guest.

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:10.081
But this isn't just any guest,

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:12.736
it's Prince Wein, the talk
of the whole continent!

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.999
If I missed the chance
to spend time with him,

00:07:15.043 --> 00:07:16.479
I don't know if I
could ever recover

00:07:16.523 --> 00:07:18.394
from the disappointment!

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.830
So please,
wouldn't it be all right

00:07:19.874 --> 00:07:22.050
if I joined the two
of you for dinner?

00:07:22.093 --> 00:07:23.355
[WEIN]
From the looks of it,

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.793
Gruyere and Tolcheila
get along pretty well.

00:07:25.836 --> 00:07:29.057
So, it would be in my best
interest to win her over.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.146
Well, I'd like that.

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:33.278
Lovely! Then please
allow me to offer

00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:35.890
a description of each dish
as it's served to you.

00:07:35.933 --> 00:07:38.153
I hope that it will
enhance your experience!

00:07:38.196 --> 00:07:39.763
[WEIN laughs]

00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:41.939
[WEIN] Just don't let those
descriptions drag on too long.

00:07:41.983 --> 00:07:43.245
Gotta get this part over with

00:07:43.288 --> 00:07:45.377
and talk Gruyere
into an alliance.

00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:48.598
That's the one and only path
to glory available to me here.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.561
We will be starting off with
a white fish and herb salad.

00:07:54.604 --> 00:07:57.041
The fish was caught
in our coastal waters.

00:07:57.085 --> 00:07:58.303
It's rather delicate,

00:07:58.347 --> 00:08:00.523
and keeping it fresh can
be a little tricky.

00:08:00.567 --> 00:08:03.918
But that freshly caught flavor
makes it all worthwhile!

00:08:03.961 --> 00:08:06.094
Please, enjoy it!

00:08:06.137 --> 00:08:08.792
[WEIN] Well, this does
look pretty tasty.

00:08:08.836 --> 00:08:11.316
Quite appetizing,
as a matter of fact.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.579
Still, the truth is,

00:08:12.622 --> 00:08:15.886
it isn't nearly as
fancy as I was expecting.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.192
It's a little disappointing.

00:08:17.235 --> 00:08:19.803
No, it's a lot disappointing.

00:08:21.413 --> 00:08:24.199
[screams]

00:08:24.242 --> 00:08:25.722
How can some
bug-eyed sea creature

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:27.028
possibly taste this good?

00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:30.118
What's your secret, huh?
Tell me, I gotta know!

00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:31.380
[WEIN grunts]

00:08:31.423 --> 00:08:33.295
May I take that to mean
it's to your liking?

00:08:33.338 --> 00:08:36.820
Yes. Very good, indeed.
I eagerly await the next--

00:08:36.864 --> 00:08:38.126
[WEIN]
Hold on there, Wein!

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.736
Don't forget,
your priority is forging

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.172
an alliance with Soljest.

00:08:41.216 --> 00:08:44.872
You can't let yourself get
distracted by the food!

00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:46.743
Why's it gotta look so good?

00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:48.615
This dish is served
in the husk of a fruit

00:08:48.658 --> 00:08:49.964
that's been hollowed out.

00:08:50.007 --> 00:08:52.140
It's filled with savory
mousse and topped with

00:08:52.183 --> 00:08:54.446
seafood, eggs, and more!

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.884
[WEIN] A feast for the eyes
as well as the mouth!

00:08:56.927 --> 00:08:58.407
A perfect score times two!

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.888
No, wait. Why am I
thinking like a food critic?

00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:03.281
I gotta get myself under--

00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:05.545
--[TOLCHEILA] Here we are!
--[GRUYERE] Yes, quite fine.

00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:11.681
[WEIN gasping]

00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:15.511
[WEIN] The flavor of the pork
is amazing enough,

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.470
but serving it on a sizzling
griddle just makes it better.

00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:20.385
And by starting off with
two subtler dishes,

00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:22.083
they set the stage
for this roast pig

00:09:22.126 --> 00:09:24.346
to make a huge impression.

00:09:27.088 --> 00:09:31.092
[WEIN] I never knew Soljest was
such a culinary wonderland!

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:34.748
Now that I do know, this is the
perfect opportunity to learn

00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:37.098
everything I possibly
can about their cooking!

00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:40.275
Then I'll return to Natra and
share my newfound knowledge!

00:09:40.318 --> 00:09:42.016
If this stuff catches
on back home,

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:44.714
this trip will have
been so worth it!

00:09:44.758 --> 00:09:47.674
You stupid idiot!
What's wrong with you?

00:09:47.717 --> 00:09:50.415
You're supposed to be working
on an alliance with Soljest!

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:52.243
So, snap out of it!

00:09:52.287 --> 00:09:54.898
All you have to do is talk
Gruyere into this and Natra

00:09:54.942 --> 00:09:57.945
will be sitting even
prettier than it is now!

00:09:57.988 --> 00:09:59.816
I don't care how much
tantalizing food

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.037
they throw at me,
I won't be defeated!

00:10:06.388 --> 00:10:07.998
They got me.

00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:11.088
You weren't able to think about
anything but the food, were you?

00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:13.613
My poor stummy.

00:10:13.656 --> 00:10:15.571
It's quite strange, though.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.922
Setting aside your getting
sidetracked by all that food,

00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:21.055
I'm surprised Gruyere
didn't have an agenda

00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:22.665
of his own to push.

00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:25.929
Well, I guess I'll just have
to meet with him again tomorrow.

00:10:25.973 --> 00:10:28.453
This ceremony of theirs
shouldn't take long.

00:10:28.497 --> 00:10:30.847
[NINYM] Right. There'll be
an opening ceremony

00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:33.633
and then a closing
ceremony two days later.

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:36.679
[JIVA] It appears
we've received a letter

00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:39.682
from Prime Minister
Sirgis of Delunio.

00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:41.292
Again?

00:10:41.336 --> 00:10:44.165
It says the Mardenian region
includes land the Kingdom

00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:45.993
of Delunio lent to
the Royal House

00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:47.864
of Marden in perpetuity.

00:10:47.908 --> 00:10:50.345
He's claiming that since the
Kingdom of Marden no longer

00:10:50.388 --> 00:10:52.913
exists, our rights to
the land are forfeit.

00:10:52.956 --> 00:10:55.698
And that control now
reverts back to Delunio.

00:10:55.742 --> 00:10:57.047
What do you think?

00:10:57.091 --> 00:11:00.442
[sighs] Back then,
we wanted to buy that land.

00:11:00.485 --> 00:11:03.488
But Delunio insisted it be
a loan and in the interest

00:11:03.532 --> 00:11:07.623
of maintaining positive
relations, we agreed.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.408
This is absurd. Tell them no.

00:11:10.452 --> 00:11:12.976
[JIVA] If we do that,
they may respond by

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.543
threatening to attack us.

00:11:14.586 --> 00:11:17.502
If need be, we'll
deploy our forces.

00:11:17.546 --> 00:11:20.027
But only as a show
of strength, of course.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:24.466
Yes. We don't want a war
and neither do they.

00:11:25.902 --> 00:11:30.559
And so, with that, our opening
ceremony is at an end!

00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:36.347
[WEIN]
King Gruyere. A word, please?

00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:39.437
Well, now. The young prince.

00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:41.744
It's just about time
for breakfast.

00:11:41.788 --> 00:11:43.615
Let us head to the great hall.

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:46.009
Today's main course is
a dish called an omelet,

00:11:46.053 --> 00:11:49.709
which is extremely popular among
the people of our kingdom!

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:51.493
It's prepared by
frying beaten eggs

00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:54.061
and folding them around
chopped vegetables.

00:11:54.104 --> 00:11:58.543
The combination of flavors make
it quite a delectable dish.

00:11:58.587 --> 00:12:01.503
It does sound delicious,
but before we eat, I--

00:12:01.546 --> 00:12:04.288
[GRUYERE] Oh, dear.
I'm afraid I must be going.

00:12:04.332 --> 00:12:07.552
Let us speak more later.

00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:13.863
[WEIN]
Huh? Wait. What? Hey!

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.780
Is something the matter,
Prince Wein?

00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:20.174
[WEIN] Well, I was hoping
you could tell me

00:12:20.217 --> 00:12:21.784
where I might find King Gruyere.

00:12:21.828 --> 00:12:24.787
Oh, dear. His body may be
heavier than a boulder,

00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:28.791
but that mind of his
is lighter than a feather.

00:12:28.835 --> 00:12:30.837
Who knows what he's up to?

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.055
[WEIN]
Huh?

00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:35.580
Pardon me.

00:12:43.632 --> 00:12:45.242
Oh, pardon me.

00:12:47.592 --> 00:12:51.031
[WEIN]
Pardon me. I-- I, uh...

00:12:52.641 --> 00:12:56.253
I don't get it. Things have
never been all that great

00:12:56.297 --> 00:12:58.473
between Soljest and Delunio.

00:12:58.516 --> 00:13:01.868
So then, a potential
Natra-Delunio alliance

00:13:01.911 --> 00:13:04.435
wouldn't be in
Soljest's interest.

00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:07.177
I figured that's why
Gruyere invited us here.

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:09.179
To preempt such a
possibility by forging

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:11.312
an alliance with us first.

00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:14.750
But in that case, he'd have no
reason to keep avoiding you.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.012
[WEIN grunts]

00:13:16.056 --> 00:13:18.667
It is quite odd. If he's
not after an alliance,

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:23.367
then why did he ask you here?
My best guess is...

00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:25.108
--[WEIN] Kill me.
--[NINYM] Kill you.

00:13:25.152 --> 00:13:28.155
It could be he sees
Natra's recent strides

00:13:28.198 --> 00:13:30.026
as a threat to Soljest.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.116
Therefore, he's plotting to
derail Natra's ascendance

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.902
by assassinating its leader.

00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:37.642
What do you think?

00:13:37.686 --> 00:13:40.732
[WEIN] Could be. But if
he means to do me harm,

00:13:40.776 --> 00:13:42.909
he's had plenty of
chances to do so.

00:13:42.952 --> 00:13:44.562
Why hasn't he acted by now?

00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:46.521
Wait. Maybe he intends

00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:48.784
to do something in
Natra while I'm here?

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:53.702
No, could whatever he's planning
already be in motion?

00:13:53.745 --> 00:13:56.400
Ninym! Prepare to return home!

00:13:56.444 --> 00:13:57.837
Get word to everyone.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.534
We need to be ready
to make our departure

00:13:59.577 --> 00:14:01.275
the moment I give the signal.

00:14:01.318 --> 00:14:02.798
--[NINYM] Right!
--[knocking]

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.234
[gasps]

00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:05.583
[SOLJEST MESSENGER A]
Please excuse the late hour,

00:14:05.627 --> 00:14:08.282
I come bearing a message
from His Majesty.

00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:09.805
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:18.814 --> 00:14:21.773
[GRUYERE]
If it isn't the young prince!

00:14:21.817 --> 00:14:24.776
I must apologize.
I realize you wanted

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.171
to discuss something
with me this afternoon.

00:14:28.215 --> 00:14:31.479
But I'm happy to chat
right now, if you like.

00:14:31.522 --> 00:14:32.915
Please.

00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:34.438
[WEIN]
Gruyere's up to something,

00:14:34.482 --> 00:14:36.179
I'm almost certain of it.

00:14:36.223 --> 00:14:39.139
I'm going to have to
proceed carefully here.

00:14:39.182 --> 00:14:42.403
I've got to nail down whether he
wants an alliance with Natra.

00:14:42.446 --> 00:14:46.973
If he does, everything will be
fine, and if he doesn't, then

00:14:47.016 --> 00:14:50.628
I'll have to take him
hostage and flee the city.

00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:57.505
There's another seat.

00:14:57.548 --> 00:15:01.335
Say, you there, young lady.
Please, sit down.

00:15:01.378 --> 00:15:04.207
Huh? I-- You mean me?

00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:06.688
Um. It's an honor
that you would consider

00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:08.211
my comfort, but--

00:15:08.255 --> 00:15:10.039
[GRUYERE] You're the Flahm
that's supposedly always

00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:12.650
by the prince's side,
isn't that right?

00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:17.873
Please, don't worry
about something so trivial.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.789
Well, then, I'll join you.

00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:29.319
[GRUYERE] Did I say something
to take you by surprise?

00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:31.974
Well, with all due
respect to Your Majesty...

00:15:32.018 --> 00:15:33.802
Yes, you did, in fact.

00:15:33.845 --> 00:15:34.934
[GRUYERE laughs]

00:15:34.977 --> 00:15:36.587
[WEIN]
According to Levetian scripture,

00:15:36.631 --> 00:15:40.243
the Flahm are the irredeemable
minions of the Devil himself.

00:15:40.287 --> 00:15:41.549
And you, Your Majesty,

00:15:41.592 --> 00:15:43.986
are one of that religion's
Holy Elites, so...

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.206
Is this not sacrilegious?

00:15:46.249 --> 00:15:49.165
Those scriptures are no more
than some scraps of paper!

00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:50.384
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:52.690
Does one walk down
a righteous path in life

00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:55.345
and behave in accordance
with the will of God?

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:57.130
These are the questions
we must all

00:15:57.173 --> 00:16:00.133
consider carefully and
answer for ourselves.

00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:03.049
It is no easy task,
that much is certain.

00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:07.053
And yet in a covenant with God,
there can be no shortcuts.

00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:10.186
Then are you telling me
you've come to the conclusion

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.580
that Flahm deserve
equal treatment?

00:16:12.623 --> 00:16:14.582
Yes, precisely.

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:19.326
I may be a king, but I think all
people are equally valuable.

00:16:19.369 --> 00:16:22.677
And what's so wrong with white
hair and red eyes, anyway?

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.419
[laughing]

00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:30.598
I see, but does God allow room
for such interpretation?

00:16:30.641 --> 00:16:34.994
[GRUYERE] If not, I suppose I'll
find out when the time comes.

00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:38.606
To rest in eternal peace
enveloped by God's love,

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:41.609
or to burn forever in
the fiery depths of hell.

00:16:41.652 --> 00:16:44.655
That we may only experience but
one of these in the afterlife

00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:47.832
makes the both of them
immeasurably precious.

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:50.052
And the one and only being
empowered to deliver

00:16:50.096 --> 00:16:53.925
the final judgment upon us
when we die is our God.

00:16:53.969 --> 00:16:55.666
All the scriptures and sermons

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.756
haven't got a thing
to do with it.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.978
[WEIN]
He sure is strong-willed.

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:06.677
You're a truly wise king,
and a most enlightened man.

00:17:06.721 --> 00:17:08.592
You fill me with certainty

00:17:08.636 --> 00:17:11.465
that forming an alliance
between our two kingdoms

00:17:11.508 --> 00:17:13.902
would be greatly beneficial.

00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:17.253
Sadly, I have to return
home immediately.

00:17:17.297 --> 00:17:19.908
But before I go,
I'd like to know whether

00:17:19.951 --> 00:17:21.910
it is your wish to forge a deep

00:17:21.953 --> 00:17:24.391
and lasting bond with Natra
that may carry us through

00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:26.480
the turbulent times we face.

00:17:26.523 --> 00:17:28.090
What say you?

00:17:29.091 --> 00:17:30.614
[GRUYERE]
Hmm...

00:17:30.658 --> 00:17:33.139
[NINYM grunts]

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.101
[GRUYERE] Very well.
I accept your proposal.

00:17:39.145 --> 00:17:40.276
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.843
[GRUYERE]
Why do you look so shocked?

00:17:41.886 --> 00:17:45.281
Well, the fact is,
I didn't think you'd agree.

00:17:45.325 --> 00:17:48.806
An alliance between
Soljest and Natra.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.113
I believe that it's a fine idea.

00:17:51.157 --> 00:17:52.897
[WEIN]
For real?!

00:17:52.941 --> 00:17:54.595
[GRUYERE] So, you were
saying something about

00:17:54.638 --> 00:17:56.292
having to hurry home?

00:17:56.336 --> 00:17:58.468
Oh. Uh. Yes.

00:17:58.512 --> 00:18:00.818
In that case, I won't
keep you any longer.

00:18:00.862 --> 00:18:03.430
I think we can safely leave
the details of our arrangement

00:18:03.473 --> 00:18:05.214
to our agents, don't you agree?

00:18:05.258 --> 00:18:06.781
Yes, right.

00:18:08.348 --> 00:18:12.265
We're grateful for your
hospitality, Your Majesty.

00:18:12.308 --> 00:18:16.095
Yes. Now farewell,
young Prince Wein.

00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:26.322
Well, then, I guess
all that's left

00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:29.020
is to see how my little
charade plays out.

00:18:29.064 --> 00:18:32.067
Should be interesting,
don't you think?

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.417
Sir Sirgis?

00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:40.510
[WEIN]
I don't get it.

00:18:40.554 --> 00:18:43.165
I was certain the king
was up to something.

00:18:43.209 --> 00:18:46.212
And yet, our fears that
Soljest would attack us

00:18:46.255 --> 00:18:49.040
on our way home
never came to pass.

00:18:49.084 --> 00:18:50.738
What's going on?

00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:51.913
[knocking]

00:18:51.956 --> 00:18:52.870
[OFFICIAL A]
Pardon me, Your Highness!

00:18:52.914 --> 00:18:55.090
I have urgent news for you!

00:18:56.439 --> 00:18:58.528
[NINYM]
It seems the Kingdom of Delunio

00:18:58.572 --> 00:19:01.183
has launched an attack
at Marden's border.

00:19:01.227 --> 00:19:02.489
And furthermore,

00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:05.231
Soljest is honoring its
alliance with Delunio

00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:08.625
and has commenced a military
campaign against Natra.

00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:11.150
Wein, I'm afraid.

00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:14.805
[WEIN] Soljest has just
declared war against us.

00:19:14.849 --> 00:19:16.938
[GRUYERE] Pursue life's
pleasures long enough,

00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:19.549
and in the end, only
the rarest will do.

00:19:19.593 --> 00:19:22.944
I take great pleasure in battle.

00:19:22.987 --> 00:19:24.815
And one thing I'm sure of,

00:19:24.859 --> 00:19:28.079
after the time I've spent
in his presence...

00:19:28.123 --> 00:19:30.560
...that prince might
just be the only beast

00:19:30.604 --> 00:19:33.215
of his kind on the
entire continent.

00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:38.612
And that is why I will
utterly devour him.

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.921
[WEIN] I saw this coming
from the beginning!

00:19:43.965 --> 00:19:46.446
That dirty pig played me!

00:19:46.489 --> 00:19:49.231
Just what kind of alliance is
this supposed to be, anyway?

00:19:49.275 --> 00:19:51.146
I bet he only gave me
that crap about it being

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.844
a "fine idea" to keep things
from turning violent!

00:19:53.888 --> 00:19:55.019
[NINYM]
In the end, it was only

00:19:55.063 --> 00:19:56.978
a verbal agreement,
easily broken.

00:19:57.021 --> 00:19:59.589
Gah! He's in the clear!

00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:04.028
But it's not just Gruyere.
Sirgis got me, too!

00:20:04.072 --> 00:20:05.987
All we can do is
gather our forces

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.163
and face Soljest in battle.

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:11.993
Still. It's gonna be no easy
task fighting them head-on.

00:20:12.036 --> 00:20:14.996
Which means there's one
more thing we have to do.

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:17.825
Then we'll need
you-know-who.

00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:19.566
[WEIN grunts]

00:20:19.609 --> 00:20:21.524
[ZENOVIA] I'm so sorry,
Your Highness!

00:20:21.568 --> 00:20:23.657
It's all my fault things
have come to this!

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.443
I shouldn't have responded
to Delunio so recklessly!

00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:30.229
Please punish me
any way you see fit.

00:20:30.272 --> 00:20:32.840
I've already resigned
myself to my fate.

00:20:32.883 --> 00:20:34.929
However, if you
give me the chance,

00:20:34.972 --> 00:20:38.193
I swear to you that I'll
redeem myself for this!

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.763
[WEIN] So, looks like
she's not quite ready

00:20:42.806 --> 00:20:44.982
to give up after all.

00:20:45.026 --> 00:20:47.289
What will you do?

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:50.205
I will seek reconciliation.

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:52.381
Soljest is moving against Natra

00:20:52.425 --> 00:20:54.427
over a perceived
threat to its ally.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.691
So, if the situation with
Delunio can be resolved,

00:20:57.734 --> 00:21:01.216
Soljest would no longer have a
reason to attack your kingdom.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.087
My vassals have
already departed,

00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:04.654
they're headed for Delunio.

00:21:04.698 --> 00:21:06.395
And I've made arrangements
for them to meet

00:21:06.439 --> 00:21:08.484
with Prime Minister Sirgis.

00:21:08.528 --> 00:21:09.833
Of course, I understand

00:21:09.877 --> 00:21:12.358
that reconciliation
may be a difficult goal.

00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:15.970
But even so, I believe
that I can make it happen!

00:21:16.013 --> 00:21:18.799
So please!
Just give me a chance!

00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:22.237
[WEIN]
Well, this is surprising.

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:23.847
[gasps]

00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:26.241
[WEIN] Indeed. That's exactly
what I would have suggested,

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.112
but you came to it
all on your own.

00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:29.549
[ZENOVIA]
Huh...

00:21:29.592 --> 00:21:31.202
[WEIN] We'll be able to move
faster than I thought.

00:21:31.246 --> 00:21:34.684
Let's set out for Delunio
at once. All right, Ninym?

00:21:34.728 --> 00:21:36.686
Yes, I'll get ready.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:37.818
[WEIN chuckles]

00:21:39.385 --> 00:21:41.125
So, um, what about me?

00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:43.345
There's no time to
assign blame right now.

00:21:43.389 --> 00:21:45.739
We've got way too
much work to do.

00:21:45.782 --> 00:21:48.655
Although, to be honest, I don't
believe you're responsible

00:21:48.698 --> 00:21:50.178
for this incident anyway.

00:21:50.221 --> 00:21:51.745
[gasps]

00:21:51.788 --> 00:21:53.268
[WEIN] And if you can figure out
a way to make my liegemen

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:56.097
see things the way I do
before all this is over,

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.056
you'll be in for a much
lighter punishment.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.668
So, then? Can you?

00:22:01.711 --> 00:22:03.452
Yes, I can!

00:22:04.671 --> 00:22:08.327
Let's go! We're about to turn
everything upside down!
