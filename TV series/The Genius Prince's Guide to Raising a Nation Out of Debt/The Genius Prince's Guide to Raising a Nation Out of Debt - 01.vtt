00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:36.202 position:50% align:center
[OFFICIAL A] And now, if it
pleases Your Highness,

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
I will give my report.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
We have received word that
the Emperor of Earthwold

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
has suddenly passed away.
This has resulted

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
in a power struggle within
the imperial palace.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:49.341 position:50% align:center
Ah. The emperor's charisma
was the light that guided

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.926 position:50% align:center
the empire forward.
But the brighter the light,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.055 position:50% align:center
the deeper the darkness
when it's extinguished.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50% align:center
And if no successor
has been named,

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.309 position:50% align:center
rest assured it will
get even darker.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.186 position:50% align:center
At the present time,
there is unrest throughout

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.272 position:50% align:center
the empire and in our
neighbor kingdoms as well.

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
But not here! For Natra
possesses a unique asset.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.653 position:50% align:center
Our beacon of hope!

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.948 position:50% align:center
Of course, I mean you.
Your Highness, Prince Wein.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.534 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Hmph. It's not
just me, you know.

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:18.244 position:50% align:center
You liegemen who
supported my father

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
all these years are every bit as
much a beacon of hope as I am.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.625 position:50% align:center
Your Highness.

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:26.419 position:50% align:center
Please, we are not worthy
of such praise.

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:31.466 position:50% align:center
As long as we stand united
in pursuit of a common goal,

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.260 position:50% align:center
there is no limit to
what we can achieve.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.304 position:50% align:center
That business with
the imperial ambassador

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.848 position:50% align:center
ought to stand as
evidence of that.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.101 position:50% align:center
Wise words as always,
Your Highness.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:44.938 position:50% align:center
Quite so. What a magnificent
man you've become.

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:46.314 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Anything else to report?

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:47.649 position:50% align:center
No sir.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:50.068 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Then you're dismissed,
with my gratitude.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:51.569 position:50% align:center
[OFFICERS]
Highness!

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:14.384 position:50% align:center
I gotta sell this kingdom, now!

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
Ugh. "You're as much a
beacon of hope as me."

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
Ah! "As long as all
of us stand united

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
in pursuit of a common goal."

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
Man, what a load! There's no
way in hell I can possibly

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
get us out of this mess,
you know!

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50% align:center
Sorry! Guess the whole
kingdom is screwed!

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Please give it a rest, Wein.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't say things like
that, even in jest, all right?

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
Who ever said I was joking?

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
I have never been
more serious, Ninym!

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center
You know that's worse, yeah?
I swear, you're such a lazy brat

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
when no one's watching.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
You should really
put more effort in.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
Thanks. And while you're
at it, why don't you

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
give me a homework
assignment to do, Teach?

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50% align:center
Don't play dumb, you know
just as well as I do

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
how much there is wrong with
this little kingdom of ours.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.244 position:50% align:center
For starters, we've got
500,000 subjects at best.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.288 position:50% align:center
And here in the northern
part of the continent,

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
the springs are short,
and the winters are long.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
Our territory's basically a
bunch of worthless rocks

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
and mountains. We've got no
money for domestic development.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center
No resources with
which to raise capital.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
And no industry to speak of.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
I could keep going, but I think
I've clearly made my point.

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.140 position:50% align:center
We're a puny little kingdom

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.850 position:50% align:center
that could be
wiped out in a snap.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
And now with my old
man being sick and all,

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
I gotta run the place.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna have to
deal with any of this!

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
Man, I can't wait
to sell this kingdom.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.113 position:50% align:center
But if I wanna unload
the kingdom of Natra,

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
then I gotta build it up first.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
If I increase its value,
then it'll fetch a higher price

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50% align:center
when I pawn it off
on the highest bidder.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:33.208 position:50% align:center
And then, my retirement will
be all the more luxurious!

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You've told me
that harebrained plan

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
about a million times.
Could you please

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
try thinking about something
important for once,

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
--just to see what it's like?
--[knocking]

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.092 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:45.178 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] Brother dear?
I'm sorry, I know you're busy,

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
but do you think you could
spare a moment for me?

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
Why, certainly.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
So, what brings you
here, Falanya dear?

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
I thought you might like
to know how Father's doing.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
I've just had a
chance to see him.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
Yes, please.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.445 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to say he's looking
ever so much better now.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.156 position:50% align:center
He even wanted to go
for a short walk today.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
I'm so relieved to
hear it. That said,

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
I think we'd better hold
off on that walk for now.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.955 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
Why is that?

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.957 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] The neighboring
kingdom of Marden

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
is poised to invade
Natra at any moment.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You mean...?

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Mm. Looks like war.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:22.507 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA gasps]

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.592 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] It wasn't long ago
that Marden and Natra

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
were on pretty even footing.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
Then Marden struck gold
and expanded rapidly.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
And yet their king is quite
unpopular with his people,

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.394 position:50% align:center
as you may already know.

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. I've heard tale that
his inner circle is corrupt.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
Always covering up his
failures and praising him

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
as a great leader
to feed his ego.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:45.613 position:50% align:center
It's clear that if this
pattern continues,

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.449 position:50% align:center
Marden's king is going
to drive his country

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.492 position:50% align:center
right into the ground.

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
Understandably, he's
looking to give his people

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
an easy win to distract
them from the situation.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
And it just so happens we're
the perfect target now that

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center
the imperial forces previously
stationed here have withdrawn.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
Yes, but... you've already
thought of a plan

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
to stop them, haven't you?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.758 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA] I overheard
the military officers

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.012 position:50% align:center
talking about it in
the inner courtyard.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
Do tell.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.182 position:50% align:center
"The time has arrived
for the swords of Natra

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
to fulfill their destiny!"
Oh, and: "As liegemen,

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
it's our duty to live up to the
prince's expectations of us."

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:19.356 position:50% align:center
Like that!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.982 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you know.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
Nanaki heard them,
too. Didn't you?

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.947 position:50% align:center
Yeah. They wouldn't
shut up about it.

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Oh great, now those
idiots are getting themselves

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
all worked up with lofty ideas
about heading off to battle!

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose they've
given any thought

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
to the practical aspects of war,
like for instance the cost!

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
[FALANYA]
Brother?

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.796 position:50% align:center
There's not much I can
do to support you,

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
but I can at least
pray for your victory.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
Good luck, I believe in you!

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
Right, thanks.

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:50.970 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] We'll launch a
half-hearted attack,

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.389 position:50% align:center
then sue for peace.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.349 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's the ticket.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Natra's forces number
6,000. Marden's, 7,000.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:09.781 position:50% align:center
[HAGAL]
Your Highness.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
Both of the armies are on
the field and ready to go.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.495 position:50% align:center
Nothing left to do now but
wait for the battle to start.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
Well, there is one more
thing, Your Highness.

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you'd be willing
to address the troops.

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:24.129 position:50% align:center
Going into battle
wears on a soldier.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.797 position:50% align:center
They feel it not
only in their body,

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
but in their soul as well.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50% align:center
That being the case,

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50% align:center
won't you offer them a few
words to boost their morale?

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center
Though they have received
training from the empire,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
this is their first
real campaign,

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
and the tension
is thick in the air.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
[TORACE whimpering]

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Torace of Heinoy.
Your spear, it's upside down.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center
[TORACE] Oh, sorry! Oh please.
Your Highness, forgive me!

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
[KARLMANN, PATESS laughing]

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Karlmann, Patess, Livi,
Logli, it's not that funny.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.581 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Understood, Your Highness!

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
[NATRA SOLDIERS chattering]

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] That cut through
the tension a bit, at least.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.380 position:50% align:center
In the past, there have
been many who have

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:10.216 position:50% align:center
looked down on the Natran army
and judged us as weak.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.720 position:50% align:center
There may have been a time when
that assessment was correct.

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
Right now, Marden's
army is operating

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
on the belief that we still are.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
But I know otherwise.
I know of the grueling training

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50% align:center
every one of you has endured.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
I know of the noble
courage you possess

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.735 position:50% align:center
on a level that is
far beyond compare.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.029 position:50% align:center
And I know of the
imperishable flame

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
that burns steadfastly
in your hearts

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
as you prepare to
face these invaders.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
And that's why I know
beyond a doubt

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
that there is absolutely
nothing weak about any of you!

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Now prove it to them in battle!

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
Show them what it means to
be the dragons of the north!

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.215 position:50% align:center
And let it resound
across the land!

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
We are the most formidable
fighting force in all existence!

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
Hear me! Today will be the day
when we rewrite history!

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
[HAGAL]
You were magnificent, Highness.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
That should at least
calm their nerves enough

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
that they'll be able to
hold on to their weapons.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
Addressing those soldiers by
name was a very effective touch.

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center
Did you plant them
there in advance?

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
Of course not.
That was on the fly.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.788 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] It's not like we have
hundreds of thousands of troops

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
or anything. More like,
less than 10,000?

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
Easy enough to keep
track of all of them.

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:29.004 position:50% align:center

[laughs]

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50% align:center
Now! Warriors of Marden,
listen well to me!

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
It seems the lowly
soldiers of Natra

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
confuse recklessness
for bravery!

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
What's more,
they're foolish enough

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.947 position:50% align:center
to think they can
thwart our advance!

00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
Nonsense! Make no mistake,
there's no way in hell

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
some northern peasants
could ever hope to defeat

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
an elite army like ours!

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.332 position:50% align:center
So! Go and crush them all!

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
See this gray, barren wasteland
stained red with their blood!

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
[MARDEN SOLDIERS cheer]

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center
All right, ready?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
Get ready!

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
Charge!

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:35.403 position:50% align:center
Highness! I have a report!

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:38.948 position:50% align:center
Marden's troops are in a
center-heavy formation!

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
[URGIO] After we've broken
through their center,

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
we'll turn around and
crush them from behind!

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.748 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] If that's their game,
then we'll stand our ground!

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.084 position:50% align:center
Our defensive line
will surely break them.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
The Mardenian army
won't know what hit them!

00:11:56.633 --> 00:12:00.679 position:50% align:center
[NATRA SOLDIERS yell]

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:01.721 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Whoa-whoa-
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.559 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hold on a second!
What's happening?

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center
[MARDENIAN SOLDIER A]
General Urgio!

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.230 position:50% align:center
Our left flank is requesting
reinforcements!

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
Sir! We've lost Sanse Company.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center
Tology Company is
moving to fill the void!

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
General! Our right flank
is in big trouble!

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
[URGIO] Is this real? How
the hell is Natra this strong?

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
How is Marden this weak?

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
Could somebody please
explain this to me?

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
How are we kicking
their butts right now?

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:32.669 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:36.339 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Oh Marden,
what are you even doing?

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
This isn't a schoolyard brawl!

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
And Natra, keep up
the good work, I guess?

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center
[HAGAL] Something the matter,
Your Highness?

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Actually, I was just
marveling at how well

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.600 position:50% align:center
our troops are performing.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:48.852 position:50% align:center
Don't be modest,
Your Highness,

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:51.229 position:50% align:center
your plan has
worked out perfectly.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
Yes. I remember well the day

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
you met with the
imperial ambassador.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
Ambassador Blundell.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
I consider it my top
priority to maintain

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.950 position:50% align:center
a friendly relationship
with the empire.

00:13:04.034 --> 00:13:05.201 position:50% align:center
And to that end,

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.245 position:50% align:center
why don't we bridge
the divide between

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
the Imperial Army and
Natra's Royal Army?

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.250 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's a fine idea.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:15.295 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Specifically. Might the
empire be willing to share

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.714 position:50% align:center
its resources and expertise
in order to help

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
improve our Royal Army?

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:23.678 position:50% align:center
The Empire, going along
with a request like that.

00:13:23.762 --> 00:13:26.306 position:50% align:center
I have to admit,
it's hard to believe.

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.934 position:50% align:center
And yet Ambassador Blundell
did go along with it.

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:32.145 position:50% align:center
Which means, the methods
of the continent's

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:35.106 position:50% align:center
greatest military force
are now at our disposal.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.026 position:50% align:center
And with the empire's abundant
capital behind it as well,

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
our military has improved
by leaps and bounds.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:44.199 position:50% align:center
At this point, I think it's
safe to say Natra's army

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
can more than hold our own
against any petty kingdom

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
that would dare to challenge us.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.081 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Now what? Best case scenario,

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
Marden cuts their
losses and runs. Or...

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:55.460 position:50% align:center
[NATRAN SOLDIER D]
Highness!

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.671 position:50% align:center
The center of our line
is under pressure!

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:02.133 position:50% align:center
[HAGAL] The morale of our
forces is beginning to fray.

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Aw, crap.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
But what about the training
they went through?

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.514 position:50% align:center
The training was rigorous.

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
And your words were profoundly
inspiring, Your Highness.

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.227 position:50% align:center
They just weren't ready for

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.813 position:50% align:center
the mental toll
of a real battle.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:17.816 position:50% align:center
The chill air,
the splattering blood,

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
and the wanton slaughter
were too much for them.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
The tide is turning against us,
Your Highness.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Maybe if I'm lucky,
he won't notice.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
Seems Natra's forces are no
longer pressing the attack.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
They were merely putting
on a show after all.

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
Go and notify the commanders
of both flanks

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
that they are to enter the fray!

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.720 position:50% align:center
Tell them to stop the enemy dead
in their tracks at all costs!

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
And have our forces in the
center re-form their lines!

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
We will strike as soon
as they're ready!

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:54.644 position:50% align:center
[MARDENIAN SOLDIER B]
What's the target, sir?

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:59.816 position:50% align:center
[URGIO] I want their
leader's head on a spear!

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
He noticed. So much for luck.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.324 position:50% align:center
Highness, we must
fall back at once.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.326 position:50% align:center
I see that.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
[MARDENIAN SOLDIER C]
General!

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.538 position:50% align:center
They're pulling
out of their camp!

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:17.625 position:50% align:center
How disgraceful! At least face
your last moments with dignity!

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
Take them down
from behind before

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.922 position:50% align:center
they have a chance
to hide in the hills!

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Damn it. How did this happen?

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.388 position:50% align:center
Quick, men! Turnabout!

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
Now we've got you! [laughs]

Th-They're attacking!

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
Defend General Orgio
with your lives!

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
How weak.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.771 position:50% align:center
[URGIO]
You!

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
Are you the general, then?

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
Surrender now and we'll
see that you get treatment.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.612 position:50% align:center
You might just survive this.

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:30.865 position:50% align:center
That's absurd.
You think I'll surrender?

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
To hell with that! You're
talking to Marden's general!

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.913 position:50% align:center
Never! I'll never surrender
to some woman,

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
much less to a filthy,
disgusting Flahm!

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.334 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Your call.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
[NINYM] Now collect his head and
raise it high for all to see.

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:52.846 position:50% align:center
Also, please see to it that
those last words of his

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
never reach another ear.

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
Last words, ma'am?
To the very best of my memory,

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:00.478 position:50% align:center
the general died
without saying a thing.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:04.357 position:50% align:center
[NATRA SOLDIERS cheering]

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.331 position:50% align:center
Well, that's that.
The battle's pretty much over.

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:21.916 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] All I have to do now
is figure out what the hell

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.879 position:50% align:center
comes next.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER A] Now that we've put
down the Mardenian invaders,

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
Eastern Marden is
vulnerable to attack!

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center
We should seize this
opportunity and launch

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
an immediate counter-invasion!

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
Yes, we could carve
off a sizeable chunk

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.313 position:50% align:center
of Marden's territory!
This is our chance!

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:44.731 position:50% align:center
I quite agree.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER D] And since our
victory was so swift,

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
we still have plenty of troops
and supplies at the ready.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER A]
Your Highness!

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER B]
What is your command?

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Hm...
These guys are ludicrous!

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
Invading Marden without
carefully planning it out

00:17:56.993 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
beforehand is the
height of recklessness!

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
But it's not like I can
actually say that, so...

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
If I make myself look weak
in front of the generals

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
after the spanking
we just gave Marden,

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
their faith and trust
in me is gonna come

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
crashing down like an avalanche.

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
And we all know
where that leads!

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:15.720 position:50% align:center
Next stop: coup d'etat!

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
This isn't ideal, but they've
left me no other choice.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
You all make excellent points.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
Our great victory has put
tremendous momentum behind us

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
and we'd be wise to
take advantage of it.

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
[OFFICERS grunts]

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:32.404 position:50% align:center
So, then, here is what I
would like to propose now.

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
As we all know, ours is a
barren, unprosperous land.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
The same can be said of
our neighbor, Marden.

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
Within its eastern region,
there are few points

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
of strategic value to be found.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.458 position:50% align:center
Taking into account our
current troop strength

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
and all of the options
that are available to us.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
I can identify only one
location worth taking.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
The Jilaat Gold Mine.
All things considered,

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
this should be our target.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
[OFFICERS gasp]

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] There it is! That's the
reaction I was looking for!

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
Going after their gold mine
is as crazy as it gets!

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:07.647 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Sure, it's valuable.
And heavily guarded.

00:19:07.731 --> 00:19:09.107 position:50% align:center
Sending battle-weary troops

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
in to attack Marden's
crown jewel

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
with no intel and no plan
of attack whatsoever

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
would be fruitless,
futile, and fatally,

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:16.823 position:50% align:center
fantastically for the birds.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.575 position:50% align:center
But now I've got 'em thinking.

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
The gold mine is
clearly not an option,

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
so the next step is to come up
with an alternative target.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.956 position:50% align:center
The question is, where?

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
Where in Eastern Marden
is there a site

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
remotely comparable to the mine?

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
Give up? The answer is nowhere!
There isn't a single one!

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
All the other potential
targets are worthless.

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center
When they realize that,
they'll be discouraged

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
and their thirst for
conquest will evaporate.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.932 position:50% align:center
Still, I may have made myself
look a bit foolish just now,

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:45.101 position:50% align:center
in which case. Fine by me!

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
But if I can end these
discussions here,

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:49.689 position:50% align:center
a little embarrassment
is a small price to pay.

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER A]
Your Highness.

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Here it comes! Well?

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:57.155 position:50% align:center
Are these guys gonna tell me
my idea is bonkers or not?

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
Or maybe they're still
trying to figure out

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
how to break it to me.

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
Gotta make this easy on 'em.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
If I react with
disappointment at first,

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.164 position:50% align:center
but then temper it
with appreciation

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:07.916 position:50% align:center
for their wise and
honest counsel,

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center
I think everything's gonna be--

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
[OFFICER A]
Your intellect

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.837 position:50% align:center
is even more dazzling
than I realized.

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:13.672 position:50% align:center
[WEIN gasps]

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:15.006 position:50% align:center
It's exactly as you say:

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
the Jilaat Gold Mine is
the only target of worth.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
Couldn't have put
it better myself!

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
Well, your Highness,
you've done it again.

00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:23.390 position:50% align:center
Amazing. You managed
to put your finger on

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.183 position:50% align:center
the very target
we've had our eyes on

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
for quite some time.

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.562 position:50% align:center
I must say, I'm utterly in awe.

00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
And while we were
celebrating our victory,

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
it seems Your Highness
was carefully evaluating

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:38.780 position:50% align:center
the feasibility of our plan.

00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
Your dedication is truly
humbling, Highness.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:42.575 position:50% align:center
[OFFICERS grunt]

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:45.662 position:50% align:center
Well, then. Give the order,
and we can set out now!

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.540 position:50% align:center
Let's strike the gold mine while
the iron's hot, Your Highness!

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
--Yes, let's!
--Yes, let's!

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.418 position:50% align:center
[OFFICERS]
Highness!

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
[WEIN grunts]

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.088 position:50% align:center
[HAGAL]
Mm.

00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Ninym, help.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Sorry, you're on your own.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:04.180 position:50% align:center
[WEIN groans]

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:07.559 position:50% align:center
The Marden invasion is
now all but a done deal.

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
I could've gotten out
of it if our victory

00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:12.105 position:50% align:center
hadn't been so
annoyingly decisive.

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
What are you going
to do next, Wein?

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:17.736 position:50% align:center
I don't feel like thinking
about it right now. So there.

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
You don't really have
a choice, you know.

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
I don't, huh?

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
No, you don't.

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
Hey. Maybe it'll help me
think this through

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
if you meow like a cat.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
'Kay, come on!
Let's do this! Meow away!

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
Hey, I haven't heard one
"meow" out of you yet, Ninym.

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:37.380 position:50% align:center
What's the matter? Has the
cat got your tongue? Huh?

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
Very well. Meow.

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
Now then, any ideas?

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
Well, let's see.
The first thing would be

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
to get some solid intelligence
on that gold mine.

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
Let's review our
supply lines, too,

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:53.480 position:50% align:center
and do our utmost
to maintain morale

00:21:53.563 --> 00:21:54.606 position:50% align:center
among the troops.

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:56.316 position:50% align:center
We should be able to
take over the mine

00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:58.902 position:50% align:center
before Marden's even
mounted a defense.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:01.363 position:50% align:center
Theoretically, you're right,
but in practice...

00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.615 position:50% align:center
--Who can say for certain?
--Hm...?

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:05.033 position:50% align:center
Meow.

00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
Very good point. I mean,
with two battles back-to-back,

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
it's quite possible
we'll hit a snag.

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:13.750 position:50% align:center
And if that happens,
what else can we do

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:17.253 position:50% align:center
but withdraw and
reassess our next move?

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:20.256 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] So, that's exactly
what we'll wait for.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.010 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Right. Meow.

00:22:26.888 --> 00:22:31.101 position:50% align:center
[WEIN] Well, what do you know?
We really took the mine.

00:22:31.184 --> 00:22:33.395 position:50% align:center
We most certainly did.

00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:37.982 position:50% align:center
[WEIN]
Could you meow for me again?

00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:39.567 position:50% align:center
[NINYM]
Nah, I'm over it.
