(upbeat music)

7
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:55,440
- [Man] A leak, great.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,853
I am not getting paid enough for this.

9
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:03,516
(panting)

10
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,430
This place is freakin' me out,

11
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,009
it's just a mirror.

12
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:09,842
- [Man] Just a mirror?

13
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:15,829
(laughing)

14
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:21,271

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,880
- [Satsuki] God, Leo, you
are the slowest storyteller.

41
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,991
What happened then?

42
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,947
- And then, when the
janitor turned around,

43
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:22,392
the face in the mirror...

44
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:23,670
(screaming)

45
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,600
Yeah, pretty scary, don't you think?

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,410
I'm thinking about hooking up with CAA

47
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,920
or turning it into a series.

48
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,810
Ever since Lost, the
nets will take anything

49
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,440
with a supernatural bent to it.

50
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,780
Originality is dead.

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,009
- No, behind you, you dope.

52
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:39,355
(upbeat music)

53
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:41,688
(screaming)

54
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,913
- School's over.

55
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:46,701
Will you kids go home
so I can start cleaning?

56
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:49,670
(laughing)

57
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,280
- [Hajime] I'm glad
that janitor showed up.

58
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,170
Our school's getting disgusting.

59
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,810
- [Leo] I don't understand
what that powder is

60
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,170
they always pour on vomit.

61
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,090
What's up with that?

62
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,080
- [Girl] It's sand,

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,860
just like the sand Jesus
used to heal the blind man.

64
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,720
- [Leo] I'm not listening to you.

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,553
- [Satsuki] If I end up

66
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:05,070
not being able to look
in the mirror tonight,

67
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,950
it's going to be your fault, Leo.

68
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,270
- Are there any mirrors
left in your house?

69
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,840
- Huh, what do you mean?

70
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,240
- You've lived there a while now.

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,863
Haven't you shattered
them by looking at 'em?

72
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,999
- Oh, I just love the
charming little things

73
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:19,304
that come out of that mouth of yours.

74
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:20,580
Oh, look at that.

75
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,550
- [Hajime] Stop it, you're
stretching my lips out.

76
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,730
- [Satsuki] Like this is the first time

77
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,680
that's ever happened.

78
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,390
- What's that supposed to mean?

79
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,223
- Oh, you know what I'm referring to.

80
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:29,993
- I don't think I like your insinuation.

81
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,173
- [Leo] I'm home.

82
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,240
Mom, Mom.

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,810
Are you home?

84
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,070
Where are you?

85
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,033
I want my after-school snack.

86
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,350
You're not in the
Manischewitz again, are you?

87
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,993
I'll tell dad.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,910
I found the bottle.

89
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,549
You kept it down to
three glasses this time.

90
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:53,853
I'm proud of you.

91
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,200
Not Grand Theft Auto again.

92
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,674
What would Hillary Clinton say?

93
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,443
(button clicking)

94
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:03,058
Huh?

95
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:04,900
Mom, what's going on?

96
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,310
- [Woman] Come rub my nipples.

97
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,520
- Excuse me.

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,757
- [Woman] Didn't you hear me?

99
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:11,845
Oh, never mind, I'm
playing games of my own.

100
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,845
(screen flickering)

101
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,540
- [Satsuki] Mirror, mirror, in my hand,

102
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,344
who's the hottest chick in the land?

103
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:24,720
- [Cat] Lindsay Lohan.

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,140
- You, I know you've got paws,

105
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,589
but you could at least
knock before you come in.

106
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:30,760
- We were calling you forever.

107
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,110
- What do you want?

108
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,300
- Leo's having a tanic appack.

109
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,133
- Huh?

110
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:37,930
- Satsuki, there's something strange

111
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,010
going on with my mother.

112
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,920
- [Satsuki] Not the Manischewitz again.

113
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,690
- No, just three glasses this time.

114
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,120
Something else, something harder.

115
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,470
She's playing video games with the TV off.

116
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,440
- [Satsuki] How's her score?

117
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,550
- [Leo] Pretty good, actually.

118
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,030
Kind of fuzzy on how the thing's played,

119
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,820
but she's got like a bazillion points.

120
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,653
Wait a minute.

121
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,739
That's not the point.

122
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:58,793
Listen, she's different,
different than usual.

123
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,677
(upbeat music)

124
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:07,861
(screaming)

125
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:09,570
- I said it once, I'll say it again,

126
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,393
slow storyteller.

127
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:14,610
(phone beeping)

128
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,273
Now a dramatic pause.

129
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:19,700
Hajime!
- So, I'm nailing this midget

130
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,549
when my mom walks in, (laughing)

131
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,600
- Hajime!
- And in the midge

132
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,433
screams out..

133
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,980
- Hajime!
- Hang on, I got company.

134
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,399
What does she want?

135
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,980
I'm telling a story here!

136
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,697
- It's probably that
damn midget story again.

137
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:31,762
Leo needs us!

138
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:32,595
- Leo?

139
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,773
(doorbell ringing)

140
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:35,922
- Leo!
- Leo!

141
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:36,968
- Open up!
- Leo, open up!

142
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:40,197
- [Hajime] Leo, open the damn door!

143
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:42,390
- Why are you being so loud and obnoxious?

144
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,810
You're going to annoy the neighbors.

145
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,110
Hold it down, please.

146
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,200
- Do what?

147
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,510
- Blink twice if she's loaded.

148
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,090
- She's fine.
- Make up your mind.

149
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,790
On the phone, you said
she was freaking you out.

150
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,680
- [Leo] There's nothing wrong, really.

151
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,960
I love my mother.

152
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,050
- Okay, blink three times-
(door slamming)

153
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,260
- I was talking-
- Don't you ever

154
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,140
close the door on me like that again.

155
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,194
I'll kick your ass.

156
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:04,720
Leo, open this door!

157
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,553
- You little...

158
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,420
Remind me why I'm his friend again.

159
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,330
- His eyes looked kind of weird to me.

160
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,560
It's riddling.

161
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,613
His damn mother.

162
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,563
So, you want to go?

163
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,125
(upbeat music)

164
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:35,224
(students chattering in hallway)

165
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:38,057
- Oh, Satsuki, what are you doing?

166
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:43,950
- Do you think my eyebrows are even?

167
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,913
- I hate pride and
arrogance, Proverbs 8:13.

168
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,140
- And I, for one,

169
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,650
don't see one thing you
have to be proud about

170
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,067
or are you just hoping
to grow pretty one day?

171
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:56,482
"Oh, daddy, can I please
have facial reconstruction?"

172
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:57,665
(screaming)

173
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:00,031
- [Satsuki] I'll show you
facial reconstruction.

174
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:01,960
You're gonna be the one needing surgery

175
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,580
after I bash your ugly face in

176
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,330
with this Encyclopedia Britannica.

177
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,300
- Just make sure your blind me,

178
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,110
so I don't have to look at you anymore.

179
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,040
Right, Leo?

180
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,470
Leo, where are you going?

181
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,343
Leo?

182
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,570
- So, who are Tweedledum and Tweedledork?

183
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,020
- The meek shall inherit...

184
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,910
I have no idea.

185
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,450
- [Hajime] He's been acting
weird ever since last night.

186
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,040
First, I thought it was new drugs,

187
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,890
but now I wonder if it's
those chess club dorks.

188
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,110
- [Satsuki] Let's go ask Mr. Sakata.

189
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,760
- [Sakata] Didn't you do
something to make Leo angry?

190
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:32,584
- No more than usual.

191
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:33,417
(coughing)

192
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,447
- Whenever people live
or work with one another,

193
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:39,110
there are bound to be times
when things don't go so well.

194
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,510
After some time passes,

195
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,040
you'll be able to speak
with him as you did before.

196
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,480
- Okay, but he seems totally different.

197
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,880
- [Sakata] Don't worry.

198
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,740
- Yay.
- Yay.

199
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,000
Man, that guy is tweaked.

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,290
- No joke.

201
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,180
- I thought meth was only bad in Oregon.

202
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,023
- Yeah, but it's like he was
a totally different person.

203
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,270
- Who's there?

204
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,506
- I just remembered Leo
said the same thing.

205
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:04,469
- [Leo] It's like she's a
totally different person,

206
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:05,510
person, person, person...

207
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,283
- It's not meth, it's another damn ghost.

208
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:12,100
(laughing)

209
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,882
- [Cat] Call Mensa.

210
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,050
- Stop doing that.

211
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,870
- The spiritual sleep was broken.

212
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,940
Now that they've awakened,

213
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,313
no one can escape their
supernatural power.

214
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,290
You two won't be around much longer.

215
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,990
- Oh, thanks, you can go now.

216
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,823
- See ya.

217
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:31,538
(water running)

218
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,720
- Oh, Leo, what's up?

219
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,234
So, how is your tanic appack?

220
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:39,067
Did Satsuki Alavam or Dazax?

221
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,593
Oh, I guess she did.

222
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:48,022
Ew.

223
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,122
(upbeat music)

224
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:59,519
(screaming)

225
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,606
- [Satsuki] I'm home.

226
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:05,973
Katuro-
- What?

227
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,520
- [Satsuki] Have you
done your homework yet?

228
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,880
Oh, wait, you're dyslexic.

229
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,304
Done you're yet homework, have?

230
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:11,580
You, you, I'm answer.

231
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,340
Hey, talking me too.

232
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,130
Well, if you're not going
to do your homework,

233
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,093
then at least help me with the chores.

234
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:21,844
(screen flickering)

235
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:24,603
Katuro, what are you doing?

236
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,229
You don't wear glasses, and
certainly not Anne Cline's.

237
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,812
(upbeat music)

238
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,205
(screaming)

239
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:41,538
Dad, I've got bad news,

240
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:43,292
Katuro's wearing glasses.

241
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:44,676
Wait, that's not the bad news.

242
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:49,266
Katuro doesn't have eyes!

243
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,602
(screaming)

244
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,055
Wow, this is not good.

245
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,305
I mean, can we not do this?

246
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,123
(screaming)

247
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,207
Can we not negotiate this?

248
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,399
(screaming)

249
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:12,290
- Are you all right?

250
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,217
- Yeah, thank you.

251
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,240
Why do you have your
shoes on inside the house?

252
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,770
- This isn't the time for
cultural translation differences.

253
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,170
We've gotta get out of here.

254
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,883
(upbeat music)

255
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:30,899
A police station, thank God.

256
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,350
I never thought I'd be happy
to see one of those things.

257
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,990
Hey, put the donuts down.

258
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,540
Drop the Krispy Kreme, Serpico,

259
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,497
we need your help here.
- These people in my house

260
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,908
look like my father
and my brother after...

261
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:39,958
- They're imposters!

262
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,130
They wear glasses, but
they don't have eyes!

263
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,653
- I see, and did these ghosts....

264
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,133
Look like this?

265
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:53,629
(screaming)

266
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,796
(moaning)

267
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,009
- It's like a zombie
Weight Watchers meeting.

268
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:03,729
- Yeah, it's like before weigh in.

269
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:05,896
(moaning)

270
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,816
(moaning)

271
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:20,740
- Did I say Weight Watchers?

272
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,690
I meant Avon.

273
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,060
- That or Richard Simmons
sweating to the oldies.

274
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,360
They're monsters, idiot.

275
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,203
- Oh, hell.

276
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,017
Let's start the running away part.

277
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:33,457
- Yeah.

278
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:35,624
(moaning)

279
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,640
Why on Earth did we decide

280
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,520
to hole up in the old
school house, why, why?

281
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,470
- Because the mall was
closed, I don't know.

282
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,940
- [Satsuki] We passed REI,
we passed an Oshmond's,

283
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,490
we passed Neiman's for Christ's sakes.

284
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,470
You're a idiot.

285
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,520
- Hajime, Satsuki, this way.

286
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,959
Come this way please.

287
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,880
- Leo.

288
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,830
- What's up with the
Fire Island wrist action?

289
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,663
- Oh, for God's sakes,

290
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,834
you kids are so stupid.

291
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,523
You both deserve to die.

292
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:13,300
(upbeat music)

293
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,660
- [Leo] I'm so glad you're both safe.

294
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,660
I was worried about
you, very worried, yeah.

295
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,900
I was afraid you'd already
become victims of the Utsushimi.

296
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,040
- [Satsuki] Uma Therma sushi?

297
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,610
- [Leo] The ghosts of the mirror.

298
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,900
- [Hajime] The ghost and Mrs. Muir?

299
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,440
- [Leo] No, the ghosts of the mirror.

300
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,480
- Oh.
- Oh, you mean

301
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
the ghost you grabbed
the janitor was real.

302
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,313
- [Leo] Yes,

303
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,466
they trade places with
people's reflections

304
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:40,790
and then walk around the city at night.

305
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,830
- Kind of like thriller,

306
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,012
a fat thriller.
- Yes,

307
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:47,350
they've probably been traded
out already like cars.

308
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,265
I think we're the only ones left.

309
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:50,470
- What'll we do?

310
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,620
- Okay, I'm sorry,

311
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,970
when are you going to need
another dramatic plot point

312
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,361
until you decide to whip
out that damn ghost book?

313
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:58,573
- Good idea, but I left it at home.

314
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:02,176
- [Leo] I'm still talking.

315
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,412
Hey, I've got an idea.

316
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:07,750
Why don't we stay here
alone and try to fight them?

317
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

318
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,969
- You can trust me, yeah.

319
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:13,228
- Wait.

320
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,061
- Wait for what?

321
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:14,894
Let's go.

322
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:19,630
- [Hajime] My BS detector's going, "Ding."

323
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,160
- What do you mean, Hajime?

324
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,815
Everything is fine.
- I can read.

325
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:24,610
Not well, but I can read

326
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,763
and those letters are backwards.

327
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:35,710
Hello? Backwards, the
letters, mirror image.

328
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,452
(laughing)

329
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:40,230
- So you noticed, did you?

330
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,660
And here I was thinking I could
just quietly trap you two...

331
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,800
Inside the mirror.

332
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,050
(laughing)

333
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:53,441
(screaming)

334
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:00,400
You are the last of the humans.

335
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,043
Now then, come into the mirror world.

336
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,656
(laughing)

337
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:12,540
My mirror homies are trying
to knock down the front door

338
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,093
like angry Avon ladies.

339
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,140
It's just a matter of time
before they force their way in.

340
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,870
It might be a little painful,

341
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,646
like watching Two and a Half Men,

342
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:27,430
but you'll both get used
to it after a while.

343
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,880
- I'm sorry, I've never
gotten used to that show.

344
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,304
Now get out of my way.

345
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:33,345
I'm getting my little brother.

346
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,010
- Wait, mop girl!

347
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,920
- You're on our side?

348
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,250
Wait a minute, what's your angle?

349
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,083
What happened to my leg?

350
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,250
- If you break it, your little brother's

351
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,263
going to the retarded school in the sky.

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,580
- The ghost diary.

353
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,920
Nice trick, flea bag.

354
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,160
- I'm not doing this for you.

355
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,090
If you get captured,

356
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,280
things would be a bit inconvenient for me.

357
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,300
Just take the book and
get out of here now.

358
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,820
(cat hissing)

359
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,980
- Why you!

360
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,090
You're a ghost, how dare
you take the side of humans!

361
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,360
- They're my prey.

362
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,420
Your buddy didn't like this,

363
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,260
and doing whatever you
please is ruining my plans.

364
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,030
Remember I was here first.

365
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,880
Now that we've got this pissing
contest out of the way...

366
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,230
(glass shattering)

367
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,563
(screaming)

368
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,470
- That was so nice of
him to bring us my book.

369
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,540
Here it is, how to put
the sushi thing to sleep.

370
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,010
Mom's writing is terrible,

371
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,520
but I think it says make a barrier

372
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,910
by pointing a mirror
toward another mirror.

373
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,890
- I love that trick.

374
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,740
- There's more.

375
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,300
She must have flunked every class

376
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,090
because she was writing
in this stupid book.

377
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,410
Okay, it also says
mirrors facing each other

378
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,240
are a portal to the demon world.

379
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,750
If we open that door, we
can get back the people

380
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,260
who are trapped inside the mirrors.

381
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,761
- My legs are moving-
- But I feel like

382
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,700
we're not getting anywhere.

383
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,090
(upbeat music)

384
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,641
- [Hajime] That's better.

385
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,308
(upbeat music)

386
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,850
Oh, God, stairs.

387
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,683
Let's go.

388
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,741
(moaning)

389
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,345
That is not a good look for you.

390
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:23,012
- [Satsuki] Kankles!

391
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,790
(screaming)

392
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:31,562
- Satsuki!

393
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:36,755
(glass shattering)

394
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,046
(screaming)

395
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:41,296
(laughing)

396
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:43,366
- [Satsuki] Help me!

397
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,665
Somebody help me!

398
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:46,185
And stop stepping on my feet.

399
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:49,102
Get off me, and give me some space.

400
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:54,723
(moaning)

401
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,590
How pretty.

402
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,590
Very pretty.

403
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,483
(screaming)

404
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:16,711
Hey, did you see how awesome I look?

405
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:21,377
(upbeat music)

406
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:31,758
Whoa, wow!

407
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,267
(moaning)

408
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:28,000
Wow, was I tripping or did that work?

409
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,213
- One way to find out.

410
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:33,065
(people chattering)

411
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,872
- I guess I need to rethink
my anti-drug stance.

412
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,863
- I don't remember having that
many drinks at happy hour.

413
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:50,201
(screaming)

414
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:53,920
Hey, what the hell happened to the door?

415
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,770
The principal's gonna kill me.

416
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,850
I'm being framed.

417
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,217
It's Hadley, somebody find me Hadley.

418
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,360
(laughing)

419
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,470
- Good thing that compact
had an unbreakable mirror.

420
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,990
We would have been totally screwed

421
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,810
if your face would have broken that one.

422
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,403
Gotta love MAC.

423
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,373
- That compact was a
keepsake from my mother,

424
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,853
my dead mother.

425
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,680
- Satsuki, I was

426
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,860
just kidding around-
- Wait a second.

427
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,030
- I didn't mean to make fun...

428
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,007
I'm sorry.
- I'm kicking ghost ass.

429
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:30,850
What's the matter with you?

430
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,907
- Nothing, you just gave me
a heart attack, that's all.

431
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,450
- [Keiichirou] Satsuki!

432
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:40,066
(laughing)

433
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,395
- Keiichirou!
- Hey!

434
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:44,360
- It was a ghost, just like I said.

435
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,950
There really were mirror ghosts.

436
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,470
I can't believe you wouldn't believe me.

437
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,140
You know how right I am about these things

438
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,680
being the school's resident
psychical researcher and all.

439
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,337
I did wish I would've
gotten a picture though,

440
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,330
as proof, dammit.

441
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,700
Then I could have sold it to Time

442
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,533
or used it for-
- I liked the zombie Leo

443
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,246
better.
- No, the Daily Mirror!

444
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:00,997
Wait, where are you going?

445
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:02,840
- I'm going home, finally.

446
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,590
- But I haven't even
told you my first person

447
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,890
account of what happened
to me being in the mirror.

448
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,080
You're not listening to me.

449
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,040
- [Hajime] I am listening,

450
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,920
not paying attention, but I am listening.

451
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,300
- [Leo] Well, if you'd been in a mirror,

452
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,923
I'd listened to you and attentively too.

453
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,460
- But then if everything
was already reversed,

454
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,980
which world would be the real world,

455
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,340
would it be the mirror world or this one?

456
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,343
Maybe the reflection we see
is real, ever thought of that?

457
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,997
(upbeat music)

458
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,300
(car horns honking)

459
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,340
Isn't that just freaking you out?

460
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,320
I mean, seriously,

461
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,442
isn't that just whack crap?

462
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:41,210
(laughing)

463
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,370
I'm playing with your mind, man.

464
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,960
And you know what the weird part is?

465
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,319
I'm not even high, not
a bit, totally sober.

466
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,569

there's something you

490
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:30,719
Under no circumstances should you get lost

491
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:33,490
or the demon from the
road to the underworld

492
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,978
will take you to the River Sunzoo.
