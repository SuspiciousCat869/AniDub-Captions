1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,220
- [Nancy] So you're telling me

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,432
that you haven't even seen the report.

3
00:00:05,432 --> 00:00:07,760
I-I just can't believe this.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,320
I mean, I mean, a woman's fiance is dead.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,210
Dead, Charles.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,043
- [Charles] But they-

7
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:14,876
- [Nancy] Dead!

8
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:19,040
Now, I have seen some rampant
incompetence in my days

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,840
as a successful litigator, but never,

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,109
never have I seen this level of inanity.

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,526
(air rushes)

12
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:31,880
Do you have nothing to say,

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,940
nothing to say to that girl's mother?

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,412
I'm out of patience,
and I'm all out of time.

15
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:39,360
(engine whirs)

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,463
Goodnight, friend.

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,500
Please stay tuned for the
hottest homosexual newscaster

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,501
on the planet, my friend, Anderson Cooper.

19
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:52,349
(tires screech)
(driver screams)

20
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:54,920
(tires screech)

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,765
- What would Nancy Grayce make of this?

22
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,811
(tires screech)

23
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:00,469
(metal creaks)

24
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,469
(driver yells)

25
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,508
(boards rumble)

26
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:07,175
(tires screech)

27
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,251
(boards crash)

28
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:12,921
(driver screams)

29
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,769
(tires screech)

30
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:18,477
(air rushes)

31
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:21,144
(tires screech)

32
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:24,437
(tires screech)

33
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:27,245
(engine rumbles)

34
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,745
(engine revs)

35
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:34,774
(ominous music)

36
00:01:37,645 --> 00:01:40,228
(upbeat music)

37
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:12,154
(ominous music)

38
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:14,760
(school bells chime)

39
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,050
- [Satsuki] Scarves?

40
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,760
I thought today was ugly,
beige, v-neck sweater day.

41
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
- [Momoko] You should think

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,070
about wearing a scarf every day, Satsuki.

43
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,540
Your wattle.

44
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,970
- [Hajime] Everyone's wearing them.

45
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,350
Was there a spread in "Elle"?

46
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,220
- [Leo] No, there was not
a fashion spread in "Elle".

47
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,450
No one is wearing these
scarves to look good.

48
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,760
The reason these scarves
are making a comeback

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,350
is because of the curse
of the headless rider.

50
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,920
- [Satsuki] Headless rider?

51
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,480
- [Leo] Kind of like the
headless horseman, but not.

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,980
No, this guy is a member

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,750
of a gay leather Hell's
Angels club, or was.

54
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,300
You see, one day on the way

55
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,110
to their annual homosexual
orgy at Burning Man,

56
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,640
this guy stood up on his bike

57
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,870
and was mooning this
family in a station wagon.

58
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,150
So he was looking at the hot,
jock teenager in the backseat.

59
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,760
This is pre-condom 70's,

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,280
and didn't see the low hanging overpass.

61
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,150
Well, needless to say,
when this dude went looking

62
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,920
for head the next time it took
on a whole different meaning.

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,880
And every year on the
anniversary of his decapitation

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,180
he goes looking for a replacement head.

65
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,070
- It's true what they say.

66
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,230
You've never had a girlfriend have you?

67
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,150
- No, I haven't, but that's not the point.

68
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,820
- This story is %100 true,

69
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,800
because the teenage boy
is the second cousin

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,410
of a friend's brother's sister-in-law's

71
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,140
neighbor's third cousin.

72
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,530
- We saw the headless rider

73
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,680
in the premiere episode, remember?

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,090
He was about as threatening
as the potty ghost.

75
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,560
Get over it, Leo.

76
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,200
This is the episode where Momoko takes me

77
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,215
to a salon across town so
dykes will quit hitting on me.

78
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:39,048
- Ep 19.

79
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:41,780
- [Hajime] No salon in this
town will have you, pug.

80
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,700
- [Momoko] My cousin has quaffed

81
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,110
some of the world's biggest
Christian celebrities,

82
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,330
Kathie Lee Gifford, Patricia Heaton,

83
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,799
and
Mel
closest-to-the-lap-of-our-Lord-Jesus-Christ
Gibson.

84
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:52,632
(scarf flaps)

85
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:53,490
- [Leo] Well, neither of
you should be going anywhere

86
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,160
in town without scarves for protection

87
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,692
or you'll be giving head.

88
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:57,525
- [Momoko And Satsuki] Giving head?

89
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:58,860
- Not that kind of head you sluts.

90
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,370
You know what I mean!

91
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,510
What I mean is that if you
wear scarves around your neck,

92
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,050
your fashion sense would
protect you from his curse.

93
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,140
Do I have to spell it out for you?

94
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,050
Y-O-U-K-N-O-W-W-H-A-T-I-M-E-A-N.

95
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,460
Don't, you're gonna die.

96
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,220
- I'm not wearing a scarf,
I'll look like a fag.

97
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,610
- [Leo] What do you care about?

98
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,920
How you look or if you have a head or not?

99
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,910
- I've worn the same shirt
since the show started.

100
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,100
You know the answer to that.

101
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,130
- [Teacher] Hey kids,
deal your drugs later.

102
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,763
I need a hand over here.

103
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:30,846
- Teacher, Hajime still hasn't worked off

104
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:32,056
his community service

105
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:33,800
for taping Joey's butt cheeks together!

106
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,100
- Hey, shut your mouth, Biz-atch!

107
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,195
- If you do I'll suck you
off for a Scooby Snack.

108
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:40,028
(boinging)

109
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:42,190
- Oh my God, you'll suck
us off for a Scooby Snack?

110
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,022
- Oh my God, she'll suck
us off for a Scooby Snack.

111
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:47,725
- Don't know what it is, but I want it!

112
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:50,790
(boys gasp)

113
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,158
- Keiichirou, she was kidding,
she's not going to do that.

114
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:55,160
- [Keiichirou] She's not?

115
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,860
- (sighs) I know it was
profane, but thanks.

116
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,117
- [Momoko] Now you have
to go to church with me.

117
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:00,907
- [Satsuki] Not gonna do it.

118
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:03,999
(mysterious music)

119
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:05,573
- What is it?

120
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,240
(ominous music)

121
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,630
Don't do it, it's not high enough.

122
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,070
- Actually, I was thinking
about pushing you.

123
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,310
All right, let's go get me glamorous.

124
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,450
- [Momoko] (laughs) Oh Satsuki,
we're just going to a salon,

125
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,003
not the plastic surgeon.

126
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,310
- Apparently Hadley's
won Teacher of the Year

127
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,900
or some crap like that, so I
get to move the art projects.

128
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,490
Bet they give that skank a raise, too.

129
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,940
God, I hate her.

130
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,300
And yeah, someone chopped off their heads.

131
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,690
If you happen to find 'em, let me know.

132
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,190
Some of these kids have talent,

133
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,982
and I can sell 'em at the
flea market this Sunday.

134
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:44,950
(footsteps clack)

135
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,160
- So why don't they have heads?

136
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,770
- Scarves don't look bad now, do they?

137
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,705
- What the hell are you doing?

138
00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:52,890
(cloth rips)

139
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,720
Can I please take this off?

140
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,710
- [Leo] Sure, you can take
it off if you want to,

141
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,440
but don't expect me to be
buying you a hat for Hanukkah.

142
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,560
- Oh, like there's a chance in hell

143
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,220
you'd buy anybody anything.

144
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,250
(footsteps clatter)
(ominous music)

145
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,160
What's the matter, are we lost?

146
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,794
- [Leo] That's not it.

147
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:07,928
(loud crash)

148
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:08,800
(boys yell)

149
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,190
- What's up with the heads?

150
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,440
- [Leo] Gary Coleman, Michael
Landon, Princess Diana,

151
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,136
and the face transplant lady.

152
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,890
(boys thickly swallow)

153
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,764
(ominous music)

154
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:22,416
(boys gasp)

155
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,083
(ominous music)

156
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:29,752
(boys scream)

157
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,472
(flesh squishes)

158
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:35,344
(body creaks)

159
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:38,340
(flesh squishes)

160
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,240
He's got eyes in the back of his head.

161
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:44,090
(drop splashes)

162
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,780
Jesus, Jesus. (gasps)

163
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,890
Oh, it's just the cat.

164
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,736
- [Keiichirou] Hi, Kitty!

165
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,556
- [Hajime] That's disgusting.

166
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:54,120
- Oh no, how did you get cut up like that?

167
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,010
- Don't get all upset kid.

168
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,712
I made sure so you don't have to pay.

169
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,650
(air rushes)
(cat grunts)

170
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,340
But you should get a look at
the other guy, not pretty.

171
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,731
He's not going to be dancing anytime soon.

172
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:06,570
- [Keiichirou] Dancing?

173
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,210
- [Cat] Oh, nice Hermes, ladies.

174
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,780
Bea Arthur lookalike contest today?

175
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, if you win or lose, I'd
keep those on if I were you.

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,833
Good luck!

177
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,811
- Leo's going to win.

178
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:18,552
(engine revs)

179
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:19,827
(boys gasp)

180
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:20,660
(horn honks)

181
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,973
That is the gayest sounding
bike horn I've ever heard.

182
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:24,121
(boys scream)

183
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:25,954
- [Keiichirou] Spider!

184
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,090
- [Satsuki] I can't wait to see

185
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,150
what your cousin's going to do to me.

186
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,380
- [Momoko] Oh, you dirty
minded little sinner.

187
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,250
You're in for quite a disappointment.

188
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,260
My cousin is not going to like you.

189
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,760
- [Satsuki] I'm so sick
of you dissing my looks.

190
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,650
He'll like me!

191
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,750
- [Momoko] No, he won't.

192
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,583
- [Satsuki] Yes, he will!

193
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,416
- [Momoko] No, he won't.

194
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,370
- [Satsuki] Yes, he will!

195
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,880
I have a great rack, awesome
legs, and a cute butt.

196
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,500
- [Momoko] Do you have a penis?

197
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,810
- [Satsuki] And a big- What?

198
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,080
- [Momoko] A penis? I
know you're kind of manly,

199
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,430
but I doubt you have
what Maki's looking for.

200
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,300
You see, Maki is a filthy anal pirate

201
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,893
who gives oral pleasure to men.

202
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,343
- So he's gay.

203
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:08,160
(people clamoring)

204
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,430
- [Momoko] Scarves are
awfully in this year.

205
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,280
- [Satsuki] Yeah.

206
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,592
(engine revs)

207
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:15,425
(girls gasp)

208
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:17,975
(engine rumbles)

209
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,190
(ominous music)

210
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,227
(girls gasp)

211
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,279
(engine rumbles)

212
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,592
(girls pant)
(footsteps clatter)

213
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:26,066
(engine rumbles)

214
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,984
(girls pant)

215
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,484
(engine revs)

216
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,650
- [Maki] Oh my God,
don't you look fabulous,

217
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,430
but I totally see why you called.

218
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,349
She needs help.

219
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:45,182
(water runs)

220
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:46,783
- [Momoko] I know, she
has no sense of style.

221
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:48,660
- [Satsuki] I'm sick of it! I'm pretty!

222
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,880
- Um yeah, Momoko's told me

223
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,800
you couldn't get a man to save your life.

224
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,130
And girl, I can see why.

225
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,390
Mommy wasn't very attractive, was she?

226
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,730
- [Satsuki] Watch it, friend of Dorothy.

227
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,210
- Well, this is going to take
a while, let's get started.

228
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,710
- Remember not to get
your hopes up too high.

229
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,330
I'm gonna go pray for
the homosexual's soul.

230
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,630
- [Satsuki] Suit yourself.

231
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:11,410
(Satsuki gasps)

232
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,270
- Oh, I know, aren't they just tragic?

233
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,580
Ever since that damn
Felicity Huffman movie,

234
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,990
we can't keep ugly wigs in stock. Gag!

235
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,213
- Rhymes with fag.

236
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:22,305
(instruments clatter)

237
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:23,850
- [Leo] Do I have to spell it out for you?

238
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,450
You're gonna die.

239
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,740
(instruments clatter)

240
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,548
(hair flaps)

241
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,435
Do it!

242
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:35,342
- Oh, what the hell's
wrong with you, bitch?

243
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:36,320
(ominous music)

244
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,710
- [Hajime] No way.

245
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,720
- [Leo] Yes, a bunch
of other computer nerds

246
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,600
without girlfriends have
this ghost chat room

247
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,780
to monitor supernatural activity.

248
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,250
Kind of pathetic, really.

249
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,920
And as you can see, most
of them are Japanese.

250
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,647
Not a lot of activity since '01.

251
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:51,920
(door clicks)

252
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,090
- No lights on. Good boy, Leo.

253
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,960
- [Hajime] Could you turn
the heat on, at least?

254
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,793
- [Keiichirou] Mazel tov!

255
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:58,270
- Oh, just huddle together.

256
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,800
- [Leo] Any closer, and
there'd be insertion.

257
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,720
- I may be a successful doctor,

258
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,960
but first and foremost, I'm a Jew.

259
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,810
- [Leo] Oy vey.

260
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,990
- Maybe, I better lock the thermostat,

261
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,520
since I have to go to the hospital.

262
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,120
- Don't tell me there was an accident?

263
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,078
(tires screech)

264
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:13,040
- [Leo's Father] Yeah, how'd you know?

265
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,020
Another graduate from the Joaquin Phoenix

266
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,720
Don Rush Driving Academy had an accident.

267
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,920
But this guy,

268
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,577
- Head, head, my head!

269
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:22,410
(nurse gasps)

270
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,073
He's after my head! (gasps)

271
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:24,906
- [Nurse] No, (indistinct) is not gay!

272
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,624
- [Patient] I need to hide, if
I don't hide he'll- (screams)

273
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:31,573
(nurse screams)

274
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:33,530
- [Leo's Father] If I've
told that nurse once,

275
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,430
I've told her a thousand times.

276
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,630
Around suicidal patients,
plastic knives only.

277
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,463
(ominous music)

278
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:40,296
- [Leo] You're an optometrist.

279
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:41,840
What does this have to do with you?

280
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,140
- Not a lot, actually. I'm just nosy.

281
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,240
But it sounds just like
this story from 15 years ago

282
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,253
where another driver said
he saw a headless biker.

283
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:54,141
(ominous music)

284
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:56,470
- So, are all gay bikers this persistent?

285
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,810
- But I told this story at
the beginning of the episode,

286
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,630
why are you repeating it?

287
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,000
- Hmm, because before the
poor bastard stabbed themself,

288
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,430
he said he saw the biker
heading towards Jap fag town.

289
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,610
- Isn't that where the queer

290
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,810
is giving Satsuki a much needed makeover?

291
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,446
- What exactly is queer?

292
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:13,370
(Leo gasps)

293
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,060
- [Maki] What do you wash
your hair with, Ajax?

294
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,550
(clicks tongue) I haven't
seen this many split ends

295
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,668
since Hillary Clinton came in here.

296
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:22,583
(phone rings)

297
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,628
You're going to have to soak.

298
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:24,461
(Satsuki groans)

299
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:28,217
- [Satsuki] I wonder if he's
a top or a bottom? (gasps)

300
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:30,800
(engine idles)

301
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,573
(wind blows)

302
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:34,977
(cart rattles)

303
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:37,619
(lights buzz)

304
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:40,957
(ominous music)

305
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:44,110
(air rushes)

306
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,242
(engine idles)

307
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:47,750
(engine revs)

308
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,812
(light bulbs shatter)

309
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,829
(cart rumbles)

310
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:51,806
(Satsuki gasps)

311
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:54,223
(glass tinkles)

312
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:57,370
(ominous music)

313
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,997
(engine fades)

314
00:12:59,997 --> 00:13:01,895
(Satsuki pants)

315
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:02,779
(engine revs)

316
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:05,240
- [Maki] (screams) What'd you do?

317
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,898
- [Momoko] Sorry, she's very clumsy.

318
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:09,276
- [Maki] (screams) Oh, my product!

319
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:11,016
- He's-he's after me.

320
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:13,888
- No, I told you, he's gay.

321
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:15,512
- I need to hide.

322
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:17,076
- [Momoko] Your tummy roll?

323
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:18,035
- I need to hide my head!

324
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:18,944
(mannequin crashes)

325
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:19,997
- [Momoko] Satsuki, no!

326
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:22,101
A little concealer can
help you, I promise.

327
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,284
- [Maki] Get out!

328
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:26,885
(ominous music)
(Satsuki pants)

329
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:28,511
- [Momoko] Yes, working out can help you

330
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,293
lose those unwanted pounds!

331
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:34,359
(Satsuki pants)
(engine whirs)

332
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:35,373
- [Satsuki] Yield, go, stop, yield,

333
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:38,934
go, yield, stop, stop, yield. (screams)

334
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:41,326
(engine revs)

335
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:44,525
(alarm dings)

336
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:48,025
(train rushes and clacks)

337
00:13:57,643 --> 00:13:59,071
(barrier arm clicks)

338
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,548
(Satsuki gasps)

339
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:06,548
(Satsuki whimpers)
(engine whirs)

340
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:11,206
(engine fades)

341
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:19,409
(Satsuki gasps)

342
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:22,159
(dramatic music)

343
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,734
(paper rustles)

344
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,151
(wind blows)

345
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,418
- [Hajime] Satsuki!

346
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:35,251
(footsteps clatter)

347
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,141
- [Momoko] We're coming!

348
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:38,273
- Always late.

349
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:40,170
(group pants)

350
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,070
- [Hajime] Whoo, hope
he didn't charge you,

351
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,800
you're still ugly.

352
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,980
(siren blares)

353
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,040
- Your face makes me cry a lot.

354
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,743
- Hey, where's your scarf?

355
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:52,969
(gasps) Did you lose your scarf?

356
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:54,340
- Mm hmm.

357
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,173
- [Hajime] Idiot!

358
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:57,800
- I don't suppose you'd like
to catch up on your reading.

359
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,320
- Oh, I already tried looking it up

360
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,220
after Leo told us about Headless.

361
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,853
Evil Knievel's not in there.

362
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,594
- Answer the question.

363
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:06,870
- Gimme that. (groans)

364
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,315
Let's see here, ep 17, ep four. Aha!

365
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:14,980
Hey, wait. February 28th,
a headless horse ghost

366
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,190
went on a rampage, and I
stood at the waterfront

367
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,650
and held a doll up to the light,

368
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,190
chanted a spell, and put it to sleep.

369
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,170
How does this help?

370
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,340
- [Leo] I have no idea.

371
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,260
So far this episode hasn't made any sense.

372
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,060
I don't see it beginning to now.

373
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,767
- Yes, but where will we find a doll?

374
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,020
- "Your plenty will
supply what they need."

375
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,407
Cornithian something.

376
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:35,070
(footsteps clatter)

377
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,220
- Thank you, Lord.
Forgive me for stealing.

378
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,690
- Doll, water, and-

379
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,950
- Now all we need is-

380
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,245
(engine revs)

381
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,667
(Hajime gasps)

382
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,250
(engine whirs)

383
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,430
Murdock, you and Hannibal take
the corner of Lex and Fifth.

384
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,490
BA, you and I get the chopper.

385
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,323
- [Satsuki] I pity the fool.

386
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,316
- [Hajime] It's for the jazz.

387
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,149
(engine whirs)

388
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:57,284
(footsteps clatter)

389
00:15:57,284 --> 00:15:59,490
(engine revs)

390
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,970
(group whimpers)

391
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,600
Wait a minute, I am so lost. Huh?

392
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:09,062
- Yon hither.

393
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:10,235
- [Hajime] What?

394
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,068
(ominous music)

395
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,266
Fall out!

396
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:14,113
- [Satsuki] I pity the fool.

397
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:17,128
(group gasps and pants)

398
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:17,961
(ominous music)

399
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:21,123
- Even if we can't find light,
we still have our scarves.

400
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:22,762
(wind whistles)

401
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:24,328
(Hajime groans)

402
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:25,161
(Keiichirou yells)

403
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:25,994
- [Leo] Dang!

404
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:27,358
- [Momoko] Good job.

405
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:30,025
(ominous music)

406
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,710
(girl screams)

407
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,210
(engine revs)

408
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,240
- Why am I being punished? I'm only four.

409
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,760
- My people are always punished.

410
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,666
Now with the goddamn Hamas,
it's going to get even worse.

411
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,290
- Well you know, probably
shouldn't have killed Jesus.

412
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,873
(engine whirs)

413
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,506
(light tinks)

414
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:56,504
(Satsuki gasps)

415
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:59,366
(engine revs)

416
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:00,836
- Give me the clown, Judy Collins.

417
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,736
- There have to be clowns.

418
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:04,905
(engine revs)

419
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:06,998
(footsteps clatter)

420
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:09,546
(ominous music)

421
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:10,668
(Satsuki grunts)

422
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:12,734
(engine rumbles)

423
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:13,892
(loud clacking)

424
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:14,725
- Take cover!

425
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:15,870
- Higher, so I can see your panties!

426
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,004
- I'm trying to save your
life, you dickless halfwit.

427
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,905
Quit looking at my Hanes!

428
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:23,877
Take the clown, Evil! Take the clown!

429
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,793
(engine whirs)

430
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:27,249
(ominous music)

431
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:29,721
If you want head so bad, you
Harley Davidson dickhead,

432
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:32,648
put it into high gear and take it!

433
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:34,065
Take it, oh yeah!

434
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:37,948
Take it, come on, baby.

435
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:42,760
I'll give you head if you
want head. Oh, yeah. (moans)

436
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,927
Take it, take it, take it.

437
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:48,282
(board rumbles)

438
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:51,115
(Satsuki screams)

439
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:56,766

440
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,821
(doll head clatters)

441
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:03,488
(Satsuki pants)

442
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,925
(Hajime groans)

443
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:10,508
- [Hajime] Oh yeah. Oh God. Oh.

444
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,128
- [Momoko] Lord have mercy,
get off her, you're sick.

445
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:19,393
(footsteps clatter)

446
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:21,010
(chime rings)

447
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,858

448
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:24,660
(group pants)

449
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,344
- [Satsuki] Don't call me.

450
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:28,700
(wind blows)

451
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,596
(ominous music)

452
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:31,768
(Hajime and Satsuki gasp)

453
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:35,768
(doll head crunches and cracks)

454
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,337
- [Group] Huh?

455
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:42,492
(engine whirs)

456
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:45,075
(ghost laughs)

457
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,649

(waters splashes and bubbles)

460
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:03,763
What?

461
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:07,522
(water bubbles)

462
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:16,364

(scarves flap)

464
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,290
- A boomerang wind gust.

465
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,873
(scarves flap)

466
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,740
- [Momoko] The Lord has saved
us through Satsuki once again.

467
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,140
- She never really lets
you take the credit.

468
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,640
- [Cat] I wouldn't buy
the La-Z-Boy just yet.

469
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,287
Might want to keep on your
guard a little longer.

470
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:37,120
- [Keiichirou] Kitty!

471
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,080
- [Satsuki] Don't talk to him.

472
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,143
- Go away.

473
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,490
- Hey, can you guys hear anything?

474
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,820
- You know what I hear?

475
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,960
I hear the sound of you
shutting the fuck up.

476
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,113
- Let's see, seven.

477
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:52,226
- What the fuck are you talking about?

478
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:53,775
(board creaking)

479
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,665

(water splashes)

484
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,140
That was a close one.

485
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,520
- I'm just asking, can you read?

486
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,150
I know it's not on Oprah's book club,

487
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,763
but it is required reading.

488
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,169
- Subtitles, please.

489
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,550
- Ghosts extremely are headless spirits

490
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,420
drawn cautious must so be
you after put even sleep.

491
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,180
It will capture little
power trying itself-

492
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,597
(cat groans)

493
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,900
Try and crawl, that's

495
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,197
Well, of course.

496
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:39,420
(board crashes)

497
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,153
- Wait, wait, say what?

498
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:45,960
(water roils)

499
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,273
- No idea what's going on,
but we better get our scarves.

500
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:52,367
(group clamors)

501
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,867

508
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:26,619
(ominous music)

509
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:34,490
- [Leo] Oh, God.

510
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,850
- [Hajime] That was so stupid.

511
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,160
- [Leo] It made no sense.

512
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,730
- [Satsuki] We could've
all just worn turtlenecks.

513
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,679
What? The ghost would've left us alone.

514
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:41,549
(engine revs)

515
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:43,966
[Keiichirou] Good job, Japan.

516
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,096
(engine revs)

517
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:55,137
(upbeat music)

518
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:25,298
(melancholy music)
