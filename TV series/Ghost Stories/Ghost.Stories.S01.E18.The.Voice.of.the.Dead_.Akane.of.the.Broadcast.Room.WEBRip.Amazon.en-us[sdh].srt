1
00:00:00,911 --> 00:00:04,028
(static whooshing)

2
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:07,195
(clock tower chiming)

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,590
- All right, everybody.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,670
It's 4:30.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,500
School is finally over.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,840
Time to go home, load up that bong

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,893
and watch "Pokemon", not!

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,900
Wow, I feel just like Christian Slater

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,297
in "Pump Up The Volume".

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,830
Oh, remember when Christian
Slater had a career?

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,100
Well, enough about deadbeat actors.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,700
This is Suzie Haang signing off.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,720
- [Yayoi] And clear.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,834
Green apple martinis?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,330
- [Mysterious Voice] You'll die.

16
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,350
- [Girls] What?

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,640
- [Mysterious Voice] You'll pay.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,810
- Wait, are you talking to me or her?

19
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,477
- [Mysterious Voice]
10, nine, eight, seven,

20
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:57,828
six, five,

21
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:01,666
three, two.

22
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:09,274
(girl screaming)
(ominous music)

23
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,439
(singing in foreign language)
(upbeat music)

24
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,418
(ominous music)

25
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:57,030
- Whoever took Mimi's
lunch, please give it back,

26
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,319
without boogers in it this time!

27
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,910
(kids chattering)

28
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,640
All right, I've gotta fill
in for the junior today show.

29
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,970
Try not to choke on your food.

30
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,986
The nurse isn't outta rehab yet.

31
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:10,819
(kids chattering)

32
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:19,370
(boy groans)

33
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:25,350
- Hey, what's the big idea?

34
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,880
- You eat those, and I give
the panties back, I promise.

35
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,853
- All right.

36
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,440
- Doesn't it seem a little quiet today?

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,780
- It was until you opened your big mouth.

38
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,890
- I believe she's referring

39
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,900
to the school's imposed radio silence.

40
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,593
- God, what a fag.

41
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:46,721
(ominous music)

42
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,760
- Because the broadcast
students are all out sick today,

43
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,410
I'll be filling in.

44
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,483
Welcome to the Nooner
with Bobby Matsushima.

45
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,973
I'm your host, Bobby Matsushima.

46
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,391
Let's start off lunch with a bang.

47
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:13,427
- This teacher needs to get
laid more than you do, Leo.

48
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,490
- You're right.

49
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,250
- Oh yeah, bang me till I'm screamin'

50
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,770
by raging horny pussy sluts.

51
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,610
Oh, this is perfect.

52
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,810
Oh, and just enough
time to fit in a douche.

53
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,313
Oh no!

54
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,890
Lock's a little dicey.

55
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,163
Better not use this room.

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,970
- Are you sure?

57
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,780
- Mm-hm, she fell unconscious
after her broadcast yesterday.

58
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,180
If Christian Slater was filming
"Cheaper by the Dozen: 6",

59
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,140
I'd suspect him.

60
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,610
Steve Martin, I forgive

61
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,850
because at least he uses
his stuck up paychecks

62
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,270
to pay the bills while he
writes well-received novellas,

63
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,730
but Eugene Levy's just a Jew.

64
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,050
- But you're Jew, Leo.

65
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,530
- I know, but this looks like the work

66
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,150
of another bitter ghost.

67
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,140
- Don't do that.

68
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,450
- Radio jocks are drug addicts.

69
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,110
She probably just OD'd.

70
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,080
- This school needs Sirius, I'm serious

71
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,220
- Where is Annie Apacelot.

72
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,053
- Leave me alone.

73
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,698
I'm doing my standard
anime elbows-up pose.

74
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,833
- [Mr. Sakata] Miyanoshita.

75
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,350
- Hey, Teach.

76
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,370
- Miss Matsu wants me.

77
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,240
I mean, Miss Matsushima
needs a little favor.

78
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,073
- No, please kill me.

79
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:39,760
What, you want me to do the broadcast?

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,200
- Say, weren't you like the little,

81
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
but less fiscally aggressive Katie Couric

82
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,560
at your previous school?

83
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,400
- I prefer to think of
myself as Michelle Norris.

84
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,790
- Good, then you can do the broadcast

85
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,860
so I can get my brains
banged out by Mr. Sakata

86
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,970
before third period.

87
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,360
I mean, Mr. Sakata and I

88
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,280
have a very private
teacher-teacher conference

89
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,770
we have to do this afternoon.

90
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,760
- Oh wow.

91
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,510
I can't even comprehend
how inappropriate this is.

92
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,660
- [Yayoi] Where's the DJ nerd?

93
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,910
- Oh, who knows?

94
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,470
I was giving you an F on that
terrible term paper you did

95
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,260
when she came in complaining of cramps.

96
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,550
I tried to be consoling,
but I really don't like her.

97
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,690
If her mother didn't tell her

98
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,670
what a fucking bitch blood
and pain is every month,

99
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,233
it ain't my goddamn problem.

100
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,400
- I'll do the broadcast

101
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,800
if you never talk to me again please.

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,660
- Good girl.

103
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,960
You keep sucking up like this

104
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,380
and I'll make you valedictorian.

105
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,733
Harvard's in the bag.

106
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,330
- Okay, but I want prime
time next year, got it?

107
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,680
- Good, I've got a hot
load with my name on it.

108
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,650
- [Hajime] Sakata's
bangin' the living fuck

109
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,540
outta Matsushima.

110
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,453
- Are you gonna take video for me?

111
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,670
Hey, did my sister go too?

112
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,800
- No, dude, I don't
think they invited her.

113
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,743
- Gee.

114
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,770
- [Momoko] Blessings be.

115
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,700
- [Keiichiro] Boy, have
you guys missed everything.

116
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,600
- [Leo] Hey, where's
your sister, Keiichiro?

117
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,710
- Well, one thing's for sure,

118
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,960
she's not getting the living
fuck banged out of her

119
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,323
by Mr. Sakata.

120
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:57,200
- What?
- What?

121
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,323
- They're poisoning his mind.

122
00:06:58,323 --> 00:07:00,279
- [Hajime] What are you really here for?

123
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,760
- Well, we heard from the
others in the broadcast club.

124
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,160
Yayoi called everyone last night and said-

125
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,900
- Don't go into the broadcast
booth, no matter what you do.

126
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
Okay, good night and good luck.

127
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,980
- I'm feeling an immense
sense of evil emanating

128
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,295
from the liberal broadcasting studio.

129
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:16,128
- Oh.
- Oh.

130
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,440
- What a surprise.

131
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,850
- I saw you beating off
the other day, tiny,

132
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,462
or should I say speedy?

133
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:25,312
Anywho, looks like a ghost showed up.

134
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,140
- Power, how hard can this be?

135
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,060
All means it broadcasts to all the school

136
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,310
and laid means I'm horny.

137
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,730
I've explained it six
times and Sakata's waiting.

138
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,500
Do you have this down yet?

139
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,490
- Yes.

140
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,690
- [Miss Matsushima] At 4:30, hit all.

141
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,860
Got it?

142
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,350
Ooh, that reminds me.

143
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,730
I've got something hard
and bent waiting for me.

144
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,270
- God, you're making me sick.

145
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,437
- One day you'll understand
the benefits of a good curve.

146
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,620
- Go!

147
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,820
- [Miss Matsushima] God, I
hope Sakata's curves hard left.

148
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,913
That hits my spot like you won't believe.

149
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:57,913
- [Satsuki] Get out!

150
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,573
- Oh, this is not happening.

151
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,360
That was a close one.

152
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,900
I thought I was gonna
have to have you do me

153
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,780
for a second there.

154
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,936
Or at least have a moment
alone with that mic.

155
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:09,769
- Bye!

156
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,110
- [Hajime] Like the ugly chick fired

157
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,150
from the weather channel.

158
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,540
- Exactly, just another bitter newscaster.

159
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,390
But this one happened
to die of a heart attack

160
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,720
in the middle of her broadcast.

161
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,350
Why can't that happen to Carson Daly?

162
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,820
After that, it's said

163
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,410
that you can hear her
sometimes through the speakers.

164
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,560
Probably still trying
to finish her broadcast.

165
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,150
I mean, do we really need
another Clearasil commercial

166
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,090
on this campus?

167
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,730
Wash your face, for God's sake.

168
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,620
Well, where was I?

169
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,020
Oh yeah, rumor has it

170
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,203
if you hear Akane's voice,
you're dead by sunset.

171
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,953
- This is Satsuki Miyanoshita

172
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,560
with this late breaking news update.

173
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,160
- [Amanojaku] Somehow
she's back on the air.

174
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,257
Stay tuned.

175
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:48,780
- [Satsuki] Homeroom teacher,
Mr. Sakata has herpes.

176
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,480
- Guess, she was just testing her powers,

177
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,101
giving those kids a fever.

178
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:55,101
(suspenseful music)

179
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,980
God, you are four

180
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,440
of the ugliest fucking kids I
have ever had the misfortune

181
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,400
of laying my eyes on.

182
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,930
I can't wait for this bitch to kill you.

183
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,890
- Leo, when the hell
do they go off the air?

184
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,330
- Right before Pokemon, duh!

185
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,163
- None of this would happen

186
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:11,527
if they would hear "Focus on the Family",

187
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:12,860
"The Old-Time Gospel Hour"

188
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,210
and Jars of Clay.

189
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,043
- [Hajime] This'll be worse

190
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:16,903
than John Stossel's "20/20" segments!

191
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,550
- Will he ever trim that mustache.

192
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,450
- Another "Lost" cast
member is arrested for DUI.

193
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,388
Satsuki Miyanoshita, reporting.

197
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,103
but a D in endurance.

198
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,260

00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,867
of the year is Satsuki Miyanoshita.

200
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,499
- Good thing I work out so much at 24.

201
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,423
- [Satsuki] (speaking
in foreign language) on!

202
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,090
- Don't work out enough.

203

Satsuki, open up!

204
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,928
I do more cardio than circuit.

that fat-faced doughboy Scott McClelland

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,132

I'm gonna die.

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,527
- [Eerie Voice] Does (indistinct).

220
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:42,450
You'll die.

221
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,283

- Okay, Leo, you're not helping.

229
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:27,454
- So erotic.

230
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,490
- If we don't play FCC and cut her off,

231
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,960
we're all gonna die.

232
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,120
- Leo, when will the sun go down on me?

233
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,123
- Oh now you respect my
scientific abilities!

234
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,900
Holy crap, we have less than 30 minutes.

235
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,543

- [Leo] I know, we've done "The Ring"

241
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,720
like four or five times.

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,843
- [Miss Matsushima] What
the hell is she doing?

243
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,420
- Finally, a teacher.

244
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,100
- What is she doing with her voice?

245
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,250
- If you're not too tired

246
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,850
could you let us in?

247
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,620
- Do not even go there, junior,

248
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,370
and let me put it to you this way,

249
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,543
I woulda had more fun with the mic.

250
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,770
- Listen, a dirty slut
like you will be the first

251
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,258
to burn in hell if we
don't stop that ghost.

252
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:34,935
- What?

00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:40,296
(static buzzing)

255
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,530
- [Mysterious Voice] I shouldn't have been

256
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,304
the only one to die.

257
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:58,054

258
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:04,461
Everyone should've died with me.

259
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:10,060
- This school is haunted.

260
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,660
If you wouldn't have been
sucking off Mr. Sakata,

261
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,510
you might have noticed.

262
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,480
- Two words for ya, kid, minute man.

263
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,030
- The least you could have
done was to invite my sister.

264
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,447
(boy crying)

265
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:26,917
To have sex with you and Mr. Sakata!

266
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,667
Now she'll die a virgin
and I'll die a virgin.

267
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,367
- [Amanojaku] Will someone shut him up!

268
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,580
- [Keiichiro] Whatever that is.

269
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,887
- Getting a (indistinct).

270
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:36,840
Oh, I saw you and the teacher too.

271
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,950
Nice job.

272
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,783
- Oh my God.

273
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:40,790
Oh my God, that cat is talking.

274
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,430
- Oh boy, does he ever.

275
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,230
How do we put this hellish
Howard Stern to sleep, cat?

276
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,294
- I know, but I'm not telling.

277
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,680
(Hajime squeals)

278
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,513
- So you don't care

279
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:51,090
if all of us get killed?

280
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,906
- You filthy, furry spawn of Satan.

281
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:54,573
Goddamn you to hell.

282
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:57,932
- Well, not gonna.

283
00:13:57,932 --> 00:13:58,765
- Why you-

284
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,745
You know what?

285
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:04,995
I'll bet you really
don't know how to, do ya?

286
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,990
I mean, you use a litter box.

287
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,980
How smart could you be anyway?

288
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,813
- Very smart.

289
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,290
- And you lick your own ass.

290
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,680
- Oh I do not!

291
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,030
Yeah, I do, it feels pretty good.

292
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,480
Okay, I guess it wouldn't kill
me to give you a little hint.

293
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,610
If I wanted to find out about Akane,

294
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,340
I might just take a little recess over

295
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,853
to the old school house.

296
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,830
- [Leo] He's right.

297
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,663
- Of course.

298
00:14:28,663 --> 00:14:30,670
We have to go there every episode.

299
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,503
Hey, teach.

300
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,500
Hello?

301
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,333
- What?

302
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,930
- [Hajime] Oh, God, stop thinking
about Sakata's whack stick

303
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,763
and help up!

304
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,793
- I hear you're pretty good with knobs.

305
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,303
- Too good, apparently.

306
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:48,061
(static buzzing)

307
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:58,810
(Satsuki gasping)

308
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:03,822
(Akane muttering)

309
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,680
- Well look what the cat dragged in.

310
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,933
- I'd have been here
too if I had four legs.

311
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,720
- Note exhibit A, Akane was
trapped in that microphone

312
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,340
but after a long time, it
rusted, rotted and broke.

313
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,737
Kind of reminds me of the
last Rolling Stones CD.

314
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:22,820
"A Bigger Bang", really?

315
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,690
That's what we're calling it?

316
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,412
Where's your Metamucil sponsorship.

317
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:26,578
- [Leo] We fix the mic,

318
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:28,800
we'll be able to stop
this nasty newscaster.

319
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,080
- I thought you were the smart one.

320
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,800
She's not a dog you
can put back in a cage.

321
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,700
Hang on kids.

322
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,530
These ears are really good antenna.

323
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,980
We now return to our
regularly scheduled program.

324
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,130
(Satsuki screaming)

325
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,155
- I know that voice!

326
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:43,905
(static buzzing)

327
00:15:57,461 --> 00:16:00,061
- [Akane] Now that's better.

328
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:02,290
- [Satsuki] Have I waited long enough?

329
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,213
Yeah, probably.

330
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:05,811
The ghost diary!

331
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,228
- [Akane] The sun is setting.

332
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,276
Down for you all today.

333
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:18,590
- [Satsuki] I used to have
my hair just like that.

334
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,037
God, why didn't anybody tell
me how awful it made me look?

335
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:22,870
(suspenseful music)

336
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,370
- [Akane] Five more minutes
and I'll ruin your day.

337
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,370
- I've cleaned your litter box for weeks,

338
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,290
won't you please help me, please!

339
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,223
- Oh, knock it off, help us!

340
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,223
- [Amanojaku] No.

341
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:40,093
- [Hajime] You ass!

342
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:43,825
- [Akane] You're listening
to the (indistinct) radio.

343
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:45,712
You're gonna die.

344
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:46,962
- Do something!

345
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,979
Pray to God!

346
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:52,312
- [Akane] Everyone will die.

347
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,060
- Hey!

348
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,893
Cut it out.

349
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,023
I haven't been in band for years.

350
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,020
- God, you're dense.

351
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,853
- Give it to Leo.

352
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:02,750
He's still a nerd.

353
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,320
- [Leo] Hey!

354
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,020
- Play it, they use those tones

355
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,033
to end a broadcast in Japan, apparently.

356
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:10,120
I don't know.

357
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,953
- She's right.

358
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:13,470
We play station manager
and we end the broadcast.

359
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,830
- [Hajime] Big nerd.

360
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,700
- I may be a nerd but you're a idiot.

361
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,900
Listen closely, the script so far

362
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,220
isn't making any sense to
anyone working on this show

363
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,650
so here's what we got, I think.

364
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,410
Somehow, we use this tone
thingy to end her broadcast

365
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,960
and we all live happily ever after.

366
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,400
- [Momoko] Devil cat, did you give us

367
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,450
this musical instrument to help us?

368
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,980
- No, I just gave it to you
because I love the xylophone.

369
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,813
- Let's go!

370
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:41,510
- You know, you're not such a bad cat.

371
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,940
- Sure, don't thank me yet.

372
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,918
I didn't give you the whole story.

373
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:45,853
Oh, well.

374
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:53,412
(ominous music)

375
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:55,820
- [Satsuki] Her posture's just terrible.

376
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,770
I wonder if she has scoliosis.

377
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,207
Poor little thing.

378
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:03,592
(Satsuki screaming)

379
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:06,054
- 29, 28, 27, 26...

380
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,169
- [Satsuki] Now I have scoliosis.

381
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:13,252
- 25, 23, 22,

382
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:22,145
21, 20, 19.

383
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:28,460
- [Satsuki] This bitch can't count?

384
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,710
- 17, 16, 15, 13, 12, 11...

385
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,187
- [Satsuki] Uh-uh!

386
00:18:37,187 --> 00:18:38,020
- [Akane] Let's see.

387
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,520
- [Satsuki] Uh-uh!

388
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:43,363
- [Akane] Oh my, definitely a 10.

389
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:50,270
- [Satsuki] A math-deficient
lesbian with scoliosis.

390
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,306
What is it with me and lesbians!

391
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:54,881
It's the jacket.

392
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:56,381
I need a makeover.

393
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:00,825
- It's locked.

394
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:04,067
- [Miss Matsushima] Get back!

395
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:08,183
- [Satsuki] She has got
to work on her foreplay!

396
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:09,516
Four, that's it!

397
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:12,198
She's skipping fours!

398
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:15,376
- [Akane] Two, one.

399
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,418
(suspenseful music)

400
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:21,251
- Four!

401
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:24,432
Not, like golf, you stupid bitch.

402
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:27,765
F-O-U-R, four, four, four!

403
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,211
Four, four, 14, 474, four, 14, four, 54!

404
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:44,711
(bell chimes)

405
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,000
(ghost cackling)

406
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,045
(boy crying)

407
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:06,107
Learn to count.

408
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:08,503
- God come through once again.

409
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,073
- Could we have just
sung the national anthem?

410
00:20:12,073 --> 00:20:12,906
- [Miss Matsushima] Ow!

411
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:13,739
- What's with you?

412
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:18,643
- That was the most excitement
I've had all day, yeah.

413
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,410
What?

414
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,160
On June 15th, I put the evil yet,

415
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,100
somehow alluring Akane,
to spiritual sleep.

416
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,820
I asked her what she was
looking at me like that for

417
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,360
and she started screaming.

418
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,540
At first I thought she thought I was ugly

419
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,610
but then I just realized
she hated the number four.

420
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,880
I chanted four until she was dead.

421
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,330
Then I realized I could've just
played those damn four notes

422
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,880
and saved myself a lotta grief.

423
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,360
If this is yours, I'm afraid I'm going

424
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,400
to have to take back that Harvard offer.

425
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,660
- It's my mom's.

426
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,010
- Well, that explains your
painfully unattractive looks

427
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,640
and your lackluster scholastic performance

428
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,706
and your unfortunate brother.

429
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:03,960
- Bitch.

430
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,450
- Man, that chick better not.

431
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,453
Miss Matsushima!

432
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,810
I heard about this liberal-like broadcast.

433
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,140
You're not going NPR on me, are ya?

434
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,973
- Me, never.

435
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,670
- Good, I was afraid we
wouldn't hook up again.

436
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,980
Most of the teachers in
this school are Dobermans

437
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,490
but you're my librarian
fantasy made flesh.

438
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,493
I mean, I respect your teaching ethic.

439
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,190
What the hell happened to the door knob?

440
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,573
- You left me a little frustrated.

441
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:30,540
(kids giggling)

442
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,590
Love to stay, but I'm late

443
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,730
for meeting Miss Hadley
for a massage and drinks.

444
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,510
- Hey, wait, I thought-

445
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,773
Damn it Hadley, you cock blocked me.

446
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:42,619
(peaceful music)

447
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,650
- Maybe I've underestimated

448
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,947
this spunky little
redhead chick after all.

449
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:58,513
(upbeat rock music)
(singing in Japanese)

450
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:04,285
♪ I miss you, I miss you ♪

451
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:05,960

455
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:25,890
- [Satsuki] Take it, oh yeah!

456
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,610
Take it, come on, baby.

457
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,010
I'll give you head if you want head.

458
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,409
Ooh yeah.

459
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:36,173
Take it, take it, take it!
