1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,550
- You shouldn't run
right after eating lunch.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,030
You're lucky you're not
barfing your guts out.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:08,923
- Thanks.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,430
- I gave you a suppository
so you should be fine.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,030
I'll go tell your teacher.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,863
Good luck.

7
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:19,590
(light footsteps)

8
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:23,151
(door creaks)

9
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:28,551
(dramatic orchestral music begins)

10
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:35,626
(screams loudly)

11
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:45,249
(singing in a foreign language)

12
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:15,803
(slow piano music)

13
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:19,810
(camera shutters)

14
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,270
- That's where she was?

15
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,180
- She looked like one of the man girls

16
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,960
from Paris Is Burning.

17
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,860
- The school nurse is a big pentathlon fan

18
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,940
maybe you were just high.

19
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,240
- I was not high.

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,173
I swear I never left the bed.

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,180
- I'm guessing it was the cursed nurse.

22
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,710
- Cursed nurse?

23
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,543
- Cursed Nurse?

24
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:40,250
- Yes, she possesses sick
people without health insurance

25
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,850
and takes them with her
to the spirit world.

26
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,260
Long ago this poor kid
at our school got sick

27
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,550
all of a sudden and was
taken to the infirmary.

28
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,297
The cursed nurse showed up

29
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:52,796
and the boy just, well
don't make me say it.

30
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:53,629
- Say it, you can say it.

31
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,450
- Don't you get scared little guy?

32
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,870
You're tough as nails.

33
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,360
- You're hurting me.

34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,303
- You're a goner.

35
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,397
(dramatic orchestral music)

36
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:09,794
(door slams)

37
00:03:09,794 --> 00:03:12,240
- I don't believe in that ghost.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,400
Come on, Keiichirou, we're going home.

39
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,483
- What? Home?

40
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:18,900
You don't believe me.

41
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,513
- There's no such thing as a cursed nurse.

42
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,853
- What's her problem?

43
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:29,370
(door opens)

44
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,480
- Hey, what do you want tonight?

45
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,950
Lean Cuisine or dumplings?

46
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,020
- Dumplings.

47
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,023
- You're gonna get meow Mix.

48
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,300
- You shut the curtains already?

49
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,093
- I don't want that drag
queen nurse peeking in at me.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,630
- Drag queens won't bother you.

51
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,840
Worry about priests.

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,130
- Leave me alone.

53
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,223
I've got to fill out my
Special Olympics application.

54
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:53,090
(laughs)

55
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,480
- Special, Special Olympics (laughs)!

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,313
Can't wait.

57
00:03:57,313 --> 00:03:58,664
- Leave him alone.

58
00:03:58,664 --> 00:04:00,831
(mumbles)

59
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,430
- Stop being hateful and tell
me about this cursed nurse

60
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,531
you fur bag.

61
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:09,160
- Oh, all right, I'm sorry.

62
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,180
Why don't you look in
your mommy's ghost diary?

63
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,520
- Just like I thought, you don't know

64
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,950
she doesn't exist.

65
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,783
- What's the matter?

66
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:17,913
Did Oprah have a show on
the d-d-denial or something?

67
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,390
- Tyra Banks.

68
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,830
Keiichirou, what do you want for dinner?

69
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,663
Tell me.

70
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,160
- (mumbles)

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,250
- I'm gonna beat you retarded.

72
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,374
- [Satsuki's dad] I'm home.

73
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:33,290
- (speaking in foreign language)

74
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,010
- Be a little hard to show my face

75
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,820
after that dorm molestation scandal

76
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,170
but if you kids want me to make

77
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,670
this parent-child lunch thing,

78
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,400
I'll get up and go.

79
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,202
That's your cue to let me off.

80
00:04:43,202 --> 00:04:47,119
(speaking in foreign language)

81
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:52,500
- Okay.

82
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,230
- Why don't you just stay home?

83
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,063
- Really?

84
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:56,820
- What are you saying Keiichirou?

85
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,290
- Could you wear a wig and a dress?

86
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,770
- I think I'm in enough trouble.

87
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,460
- And staff apron, make sure
you tie your pee-pee down.

88
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,743
I don't want to be the
only kid without a mom.

89
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:07,865
- Keiichirou!

90
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,599
- They beat me up all the time.

91
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,270
I don't need another goddamn reason!

92
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,580
- You watch your goddamn mouth!

93
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,900
- Okay, I'm off the hook.

94
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,218
- Dad?

95
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:19,072
- I understand them Satsuki.

96
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:21,382
They make fun of me all the time too now.

97
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:24,367
I don't need another
goddamn reason either.

98
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:27,760
(soft piano music)

99
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,980
Remember what I was telling you

100
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,950
about your mother's cooking, Satsuki

101
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,040
Well, these dumplings would do your mother

102
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,733
and Paula Deen proud.

103
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,837
If Paula was Japanese.

104
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,754
(soft piano music)

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,430
- Why are my memories always (mumbles)?

106
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:58,973
(hissing sound)

107
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:06,792
(gulping sound)

108
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,741
(sobbing)

109
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:10,574
- Oh God!

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,603
- Is it good?

111
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:18,621
- Yeah.

112
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,700
- You certainly love apple juice,

113
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,063
don't you Keiichirou?

114
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:23,550
- Yeah.

115
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,200
- But it gives you such gas.

116
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,033
- Yeah.

117
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:30,226
(burping)

118
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,373
- Pardon me.

119
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,840
You're gonna die, aren't you?

120
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,943
- Ah-ah.

121
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,021
- Let's lighten this
dark moment with a joke.

122
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:45,093
Go ahead mom, pull my finger.

123
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,733
- Okay.

124
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,497
Oh oh.

125
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:52,414
- Hey!

126
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:55,581
(Loud dramatic music)

127
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:59,070
- Come back, it's really funny.

128
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,130
Everybody in my school is doing it.

129
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,020
You see, when you pull my finger,

130
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,714
I make a noise like I
farted, it'll kill you.

131
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:09,297
(loud screams)

132
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:13,431
(loud cries)

133
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,598
(screams)

134
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,076
(indistinct)

135
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:23,678
(screams)

136
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:26,511
(breaths heavily)

137
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,878
- Trying to sleep here.

138
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:36,795
(speaking in foreign language)

139
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,370
- Get a hold of yourself.

140
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,113
You just had a dream, that's all!

141
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:46,664
(speaks in foreign language)

142
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,100
- Well, he screams and cries every night

143
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,530
and wakes me up and then
I can't get back to sleep.

144
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,193
God, having a dead mother
is hell on your beauty rest.

145
00:07:56,193 --> 00:08:00,020
- I'm a little hung over, so
can we talk about this later?

146
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,853
- Fine.

147
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:04,020
(chopping sounds)

148
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,480
Don't talk, just remember
I haven't had much sleep.

149
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,360
and I've got a knife.

150
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:21,116
(wind blowing)

151
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,843
- Damn it!

152
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:27,403
Just like etch a sketch.

153
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,203
What?

154
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:34,814
(cries)

155
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,700
- Sorry I'm late, Mr
Stikato is being an ass.

156
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,179
- She's back! (mumbles)

157
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,012
- What?

158
00:08:44,012 --> 00:08:45,880
- The drag queen nurse is back, look.

159
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:47,814
What?

160
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:50,963
- I don't see anyone.

161
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,167
- She was there, I saw her.

162
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,609
- He's on drugs.

163
00:08:57,609 --> 00:08:59,860
- I'm not on drugs.

164
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,853
Just Paxil.

165
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,560
No Keiichirou, Momoko is right.

166
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,280
After all you didn't get
much sleep last night.

167
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,400
- I never do. You snore like Rob Mungle.

168
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,633
- Then you're lying.

169
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:15,411
(speaking in foreign language)

170
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:17,578
(sobbing)

171
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,017
- Spare the rod...

172
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:24,784
(birds chirping)

173
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:28,088
- Morning Satsuki!

174
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:29,090
- Hi there.

175
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,100
- Don't you just hate laundry day--

176
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,293
- If your husband would get
a job, you could by a dryer.

177
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:35,430
- It's so good to have
that dead be come home

178
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,290
with a liquor on his breath
and lipstick on his collar.

179
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,212
red bastard!

180
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,993
- Keiichirou, why am I still
talking like that redneck?

181
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,053
Hey.

182
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,070
- Sis dear mom, a love
going you're P.S. see to.

183
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,903
- Oh no!

184
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,100
Please let her not be in here.

185
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,920
Please let her not be in here.

186
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,020
She's definitely not here.

187
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,770
Why couldn't she have written
a damn table of contents?

188
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,410
It's Marilyn Manson.

189
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,383
I put the cursed nurse to
spiritual sleep in the infirmary.

190
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,530
- [Narrator] To put her
to spiritual sleep say,

191
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,650
The patient's illness has been cured,

192
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,810
the patient's illness has been cured.

193
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,313
I mean, you say it twice.

194
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,260
But some people say the cursed nurse

195
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,330
is actually the grim reaper.

196
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,710
So I don't know if this
really worked or not.

197
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,543
Sue me.

198
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,757
- If she wasn't dead, I
swear to God I'd kill her.

199
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:46,051
- Keiichirou!

200
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:48,171
(train engine roaring)

201
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:50,700
(screams)

202
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,475
- God, I can't breathe in here.

203
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:53,924
- Stay down and shut up.

204
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:55,824
- Stay down and shut up.

205
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:59,074
(train engine roaring)

206
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,730
- Thanks for coming with me Momoko.

207
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,884
I mean, you could always use some Jesus,

208
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:11,920
you know what I mean?

209
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,340
- I have such fond
memories of that hospital.

210
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,860
It's a loving place of healing,
except for those who die.

211
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,850
- Roger that.

212
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,370
Keiichirou was so young when
mom was in the hospital,

213
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,410
how would we find it?

214
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,549
And with his dyslexia, he
could end up in Bangkok.

215
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:28,753
(speaking in foreign language)

216
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:29,586
- What?

217
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:32,640
- I mean, mom said she put
the cursed nurse to sleep

218
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,830
when she was a child.

219
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,180
- When you were in the hospital,

220
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,900
did she say anything about it?

221
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,130
And why would she only show
up when Keiichirou was around?

222
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,720
- It seems like she's after him,

223
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,140
or she has a crush on him or
too much time on her hands.

224
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,100
Help me out here.

225
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,630
- Did you try looking her up
in your mother's ghost diary?

226
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,290
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,123
- I'm confused.

228
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:53,360
Did you look under C or
did you look under N?

229
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,710
I never get those things right?

230
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,390
- I hate them.

231
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,223
- Huh?

232
00:11:58,223 --> 00:12:01,780
- No, not N's or C's,
hospitals and nurses and stuff.

233
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,040
Bad memories.

234
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,700
- Listen Satsuki, you only
get a chance like this

235
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,693
once in your life.

236
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,940
All right who's first?

237
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,320
- Do you know how long I
waited outside that room

238
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,500
for him to finish?

239
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,333
- Oh dear God!

240
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:16,521
(bus engine roaring)

241
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:25,131
(button clicking)

242
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,930
- Okay, I got a level with you here.

243
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,900
Remember that I told you
that I met your mother

244
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,650
at the Exodus Homosexual Conversion Camp?

245
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,910
Well, that was just one of
the floors at the hospital.

246
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,860
The one floor I was on was the rehab wing.

247
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,570
Before I met Jesus, I
was really (bleeps) up .

248
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,403
- No.

249
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:48,236
- And a slut.

250
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:50,730
Anyways, we heard this
story about this nurse

251
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,930
who comes around after the
other nurses make their rounds.

252
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,680
Every time she went into one of the rooms,

253
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,520
that patient, swear to God,

254
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,650
flat blind, dead, gone.

255
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,633
I mean truly meeting Jesus.

256
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,610
Stop looking at me like that.

257
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,367
Well, you know how it is,

258
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:10,310
you give up one addiction,
you get another.

259
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,230
- Apple juice.

260
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,063
- What?

261
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,920
- Yeah, I know.

262
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,677
Anyway, so I'm getting my (indistinct).

263
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,800
- Momoko, did I scare you baby?

264
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,930
- Yes, actually you did.

265
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,873
- Momoko, I wanna tell you something.

266
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,999
Oh, you're hot.

267
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:30,410
(laughs)

268
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,580
I really enjoyed praying
with you the other day.

269
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,870
- I got to tell you I was
a mess before I came here.

270
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,450
The drugs, the sex, crazy.

271
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,260
Jesus saved my ass.

272
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,232
- And what a lovely little ass it is too.

273
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:48,149
(slow piano music)

274
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,853
- Oh, I'm freaking you out, aren't I?

275
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,710
- Yeah, but like I can talk.

276
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,150
- I feel I can talk to you about anything.

277
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,370
- You can.

278
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,920
- And boy did she.

279
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,050
she starts going on and on
about how there was this party

280
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,710
and she was wasted and
she never slept with a guy

281
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,260
and go figure, she gets knocked up

282
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,520
and then she thinks she's
got to marry this dude.

283
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,260
You know where this is going, don't you.

284
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,460
- Looking on the bright side,

285
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,040
she must've been Bi because
you've got a little brother.

286
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,660
I mean, she slept with
a guy at least twice.

287
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,170
I mean, she didn't have to have you.

288
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,710
- What about the damn ghost?

289
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,670
- Oh yeah.

290
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,680
Never heard much about her after that.

291
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,450
Maybe your mother put her to sleep.

292
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,303
Maybe she was your mother's
lover and got pissed.

293
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,283
- She would have lived
if she wasn't in County.

294
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:43,449
(laughs)

295
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,110
- I have a confession to make.

296
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,600
The last time I saw mom

297
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,019
was right before I went
to go get myself some--

298
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,130
(yawning)

299
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,103
- We'd been there for
hours, I was thirsty.

300
00:14:59,387 --> 00:15:01,720
(struggles)

301
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:10,926
- What's the matter?

302
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,200
- What do you think is the matter.

303
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,779
I'm two feet tall, I
can't reach the juice.

304
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:15,848
(sobbing)

305
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,380
I'm too short.

306
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,603
- Guess you don't get your juice then.

307
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:21,340
- You could help me, you know.

308
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,193
- Here.

309
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,063
- Got me my juice.

310
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,840
- You're welcome!

311
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,820
- I mean, I heard the nurses talking,

312
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,370
I knew she was a goner.

313
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,510
I saw the old man and 36 feet kick

314
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,920
and it was just gross.

315
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,970
All the stuff coming out
of them in the morning.

316
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,510
Who wants to see your mom go through that?

317
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,530
Why'd they take me to the
hospital anyway, I was two.

318
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,080
Let me stay home and
watch cartoon network.

319
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,913
- I hear you.

320
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,840
- SpongeBob SquarePants,
Fairly OddParents,

321
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,530
Teen Titans, Ravens--

322
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,700
- I said I heard you!

323
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,695
- I'm just saying, dude, she's hot.

324
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:56,528
Kinda wanna, you know?

325
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,130
- Where is everybody?

326
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,030
Hey, I got an idea.

327
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,820
Let's switch everybody's charts around.

328
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,773
Give the guy in 4B a breast job.

329
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,290
- I mean, her cape is
just so sexy, you know.

330
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,503
You feel me?

331
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:22,015
(dramatic orchestral music)

332
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:34,760
(speaking in foreign language)

333
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,464
(sobs)

334
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:53,184
- It's like the grind game.

335
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:54,570
- Keiichirou!

336
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,403
- Satsuki.

337
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,083
This transvestite won't leave me alone.

338
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,760
- If you lay even a finger on Keiichirou,

339
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,697
I'll kick your ass you (mumbles)

340
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:09,992
I come from a long line of
quasi-lesbian ghost killers!

341
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:12,180
I'm not afraid of your ugly draggy ass.

342
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,073
- Don't piss her off, you
know how lesbians can get.

343
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,776
- The patient has been cured.

344
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:20,604
Oh, once more, The patient has been cured!

345
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:24,271
(dramatic orchestral music)

346
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,073
- I can't put her to spiritual sleep.

347
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:30,073
- Then why did you come?

348
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:33,420
- Pretty good question.

349
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,513
- Chill kid.

350
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,710
She's not gonna hurt you.

351
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,390
I want to, but she won't.

352
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,190
Float and Florence Nightingale here.

353
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,720
She's only coming to give
you a little message.

354
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,303
Don't feel bad about
bailing on mommy dearest.

355
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,140
Now that is some really nice animation.

356
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,570
- Did she go to spiritual sleep?

357
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,620
- She gave us a bill.

358
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,661
- What the,

359
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:18,088
it's a letter from mom.

360
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:19,270
- Huh!

361
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,984
- When did she write this?

362
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:23,930
(breathes heavily)

363
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,864
- Well, I totally forgot about that.

364
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:26,697
- What?

365
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:28,260
- That nurse isn't the grim reaper.

366
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,470
She's an angel of the Lord

367
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,580
telling people to say their goodbyes.

368
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,560
I thought it was just having
a flashback or something

369
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,517
when your mother told me about her,

370
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:36,953
I mean I was a huge user,

371
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,330
huge!

372
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,200
When your mother was talking
about a nurse saying it's time,

373
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,620
I thought she was talking
about a bath or something.

374
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,290
So, you know you're gonna die

375
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,888
and you're gonna write your kids a letter.

376
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:49,330
(laughs) It's messed up.

377
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,823
- Yeah, got any stationary?

378
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:54,210
- I guess I was so caught
up in her sexuality story,

379
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,930
I kinda forgot about her dying and all.

380
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,160
And now this angel of the Lord

381
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,129
brings the letter to Keiichirou.

382
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:01,668
Is this so great or what--

383
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:02,730
- Keiichirou!

384
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,590
- Oh, Hey dad.

385
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,300
- I was so worried about you.

386
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,130
- Dad, you got a letter from mom.

387
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,029
Hope for your sake it's not COD.

388
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,862
- Huh!

389
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,140
- [Satsuki's Mom] Dear Keiichirou,

390
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,340
Well, I'm sure this is
incredibly inappropriate.

391
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,560
I mean, you'll probably
be only four or five,

392
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,700
by the time that nurse spirit
finally gets this to you.

393
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,130
It's not like the afterlife
has any FedEx office

394
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,700
or anything.

395
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,680
I'm leaving strict instructions

396
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,530
for this letter to be left out for you.

397
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,840
But with my luck this
being County and all,

398
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,123
they'll probably bury it with me.

399
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,300
I would like to give you some words

400
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,413
of wisdom or comfort
or some heartfelt mojo,

401
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,780
but I'm so strung out
on methadone right now.

402
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,460
I'm doing good just holding my pen.

403
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,340
Oh, before I forget, let
me get down to business.

404
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,938
Me and my mom have really
pissed off some ghosts

405
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:01,290
and spirits in our time.

406
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,220
And well,

407
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,470
sorry to break it to you,

408
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,110
but they'll probably
be coming to kill you.

409
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,000
Hope Satsuki finds that diary.

410
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,123
Can't remember where I put the damn thing.

411
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,610
I'm so high.

412
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,082
God! (laughs)

413
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,780
Oh, but I did leave you a photo album.

414
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,643
Look at what I was wearing.

415
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:25,540
Oh, horrible.

416
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,620
I mean, even after I married your father

417
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,210
I still dress like a dyke.

418
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,350
Hope I didn't put that
pink suit picture in here.

419
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,897
Oh goddamn it.

420
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:35,950
And your father always thinks it's so cute

421
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,460
to cross his eyes and pictures

422
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,943
see, see, he...look...look
he did it there.

423
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,920
But for all his flaws, I
really did love the guy

424
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,210
and the hot sweaty wall slamming
sex we used to have, wow.

425
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,540
And I have to say,

426
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,750
I really enjoyed being you kid's mother.

427
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,320
At least I think I did.

428
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,353
Nurses increasing drip and I'm losing it.

429
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,530
I'd love to give you some
more family ties moments

430
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,480
but that's not me.

431
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,070
Tough love baby.

432
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,390
That's just how I rumble

433
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,163
- Man, I'm thirsty.

434
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,050
Look dad I can reach the buttons now,

435
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,717
can I have a couple more
bucks for some Cheetos?

436
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:23,550
- Huh.

437
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,950
- But could you open it for me?

438
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,293
You know how bad I am with shapes.

439
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,113
- No Keiichirou,

440
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,361
this time son, you open it yourself.

441
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,210
(cries)

442
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,253
- Oh, dad.

443
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:42,471
- Oh, son.

444
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:43,304
Son.

445
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:45,300
- Argh.

446
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,313
Oh I'm sorry.

447
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:48,423
(screams)

448
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:50,423
