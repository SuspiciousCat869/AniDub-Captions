1
00:00:01,216 --> 00:00:03,799
(low rumbling)

2
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:14,156
(snow crashing)
(jingling)

3
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:18,121
(wind whistling)

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,625
(whimpering)

5
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:43,278
(singing in foreign language)

6
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:15,084
(mysterious music)

7
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:21,639
(bright cheerful music)

8
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,530
- [Leo] I just love your
"Grease" Pink Ladies bag.

9
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,287
- I am gonna look so hot snowboarding.

10
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:31,200
- You're as fat as Queen Latifah.

11
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,530
One-time-cool rapper needs to quit doing

12
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,020
those Pizza Hut VOs.

13
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,000
- She was nominated
for an Oscar, you dope!

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,100
- She's being punished.

15
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,900
The only royalty is Jesus
and Black rap is satanic.

16
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,230
- Why do I have to sit next to her?

17
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,620
- Remember, we drew straws and you lost.

18
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,010
On the way back, Leo gets her.

19
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,230
Can't wait to see the holy war then.

20
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,470
- You drew that straw.

21
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,935
You're the one who's
supposed to sit next to Leo.

22
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:54,366
- Is anyone talking to you?

23
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:55,199
No!

24
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:03,745
- Wow!

25
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:08,745
Look at all the snow! (laughs)

26
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:11,680
- Praise God.

27
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,910
He's covered the world in the
white blanket of holiness.

28
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,740
- The ski area's right around here.

29
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,870
Why aren't there more people?

30
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,650
Is Claudine Longet around?

31
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,610
- Come on!

32
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,940
Let's make a snowman! (groans)

33
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,390
- You okay, little lamb?
- I'm good.

34
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,540
- Bitchin' ski resort.
- I'm gonna make a snowman-

35
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,319
- So, where are all the
hot snow bunnies at?

36
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,010
- And a snowwoman-
- I have yet to be thanked

37
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,800
for all the money I saved
us by booking on Priceline.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,633
- Thank you. Shut up.
- I guess I'll have

39
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:33,630
to make the snowwoman dead

40
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,344
'cause my mom's dead.
- Where the hell

41
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:36,177
is the driver?
(Leo sobbing)

42
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:37,650
No wonder the tickets were so cheap.

43
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,740
- Hey, isn't it some relative of yours?

44
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,560
- Yeah, but this is from
dad's side of the family.

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,460
Bunch of degenerate alcoholics.

46
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,560
Hope he hasn't killed
someone on the way up here.

47
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,540
- Let me ask you something.

48
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,810
If I slip some cognac
into Momoko's thermos,

49
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,540
you think maybe I could just possibly

50
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,420
get her to give me a little cranium?

51
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,420
- Maybe I'll try giving them a call.

52
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,520
Duh.

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,597
- I have a cell phone.
(phone beeping)

54
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:01,847
but we're out of range.

55
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,210
- [Satsuki] "I have a cell phone."

56
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,063
Rich Jesus skag.
(beeping)

57
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,030
- [Operator] The number you've dialed

58
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,541
is no longer in service.

59
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,374
Hey!

60
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:13,820
Maybe if they paid
their fuckin' phone bill

61
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,880
you could call again!

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,415
- Asian trash, can't pay their phone bill.

63
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:19,998
(jingling)
Huh?

64
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,469
What the hell's going on?

65
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:24,600
(horn honking)
(Satsuki gasps)

66
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,760
- Last bus to the skiing area today,

67
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,700
so if you wanna get on before I get off

68
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,917
you better move it.

69
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,167
- [Group] What?

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,810
- We've been married about six years now.

71
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,720
- Nobody's talking to you,

72
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,727
just drive the bus, bus driver.

73
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:39,060
Fucking nosy.

74
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,570
- I mean, I think I'm
still a good looking man.

75
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,070
What do you think, sweetheart?

76
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,373
- You're still talking.

77
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,080
Finally.

78
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,400
I was sick of that lonely-ass bus driver.

79
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,610
- [Hajime] He was so fucking nosy.

80
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,503
- [Satsuki] Hello!

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,690
- Like Sodom and Gomorrah.

82
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,110
No hospitality.

83
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,363
- Worst trip ever.

84
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,900
- It's not locked or anything.

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,037
(ominous music)

86
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:17,078
(group screaming)

87
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:32,730
- Lame museum.

88
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,440
- How in the world could someone do that

89
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,123
to God's gentle creatures?

90
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,210
- (coughing) blowjob.

91
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,200
- These must be the priceless possessions

92
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,020
of some wealthy Jewish
philanthropist collector.

93
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,160
- A bird and a bear?

94
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,125
I ain't paying for this.

95
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,310
♪ Lame ♪

96
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,620
- I didn't know the hotel had a zoo.

97
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,190
- It's no Madam Tussauds.

98
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,140
- None of those people

99
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,810
look like they're supposed to, either.

100
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,290
- Maybe your friend was the victim

101
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,090
of the dreaded abominable
snowwoman of the mountain.

102
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,860
Does anyone else feel a little chill?

103
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,492
I feel cold, and a little watched.

104
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,662
(jingling)
(Leo whimpers)

105
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:07,142
(woman gasps)
(Leo screams)

106
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:12,142
There she is!
(group screaming)

107
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:14,570
- Konnichiwa.
- Konnichiwa.

108
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,270
- Konnichi-whatever.

109
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,480
- Konnichi-lingus.

110
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,760
- Hey, wait a minute.

111
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,670
Miyuki?

112
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,340
- Miyuki is my older sister.

113
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,440
I'm her younger, cuter sister, Yuki.

114
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,273
- Oh.

115
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:26,960
Sorry, all you little yellow
people look alike to me,

116
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,690
and African Americans,
but not the Mexicans.

117
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,880
Why do you think that is?

118
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,840
I mean, don't you find that
just the weirdest thing?

119
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,850
- Not really.

120
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,720
- You don't?

121
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
- No, but I do notice something else.

122
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,360
Black men have larger penises

123
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,880
than either Asians or Mexicans do,

124
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,860
and I'm a size queen from the word go,

125
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,820
you know what I'm saying?

126
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,010
- Did I happen to mention how hung I am?

127
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,807
- Romans 1:26.

128
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:51,317
"God gave them over to shameful lust."

129
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:52,150
(Hajime groans)

130
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,990
- I'd like to be given
over to shameful lust.

131
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,810
- [Momoko] And they
shall be white as snow,

132
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,998
except you, you're all heathens.

133
00:06:57,998 --> 00:06:59,300
- [Group] Whoa.

134
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,800
- Now that's a view.

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,850
- [Yuki] A view of the
Bloodstained Lake. (screams)

136
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,820
- Bloodstained Lake?
(Yuki screams)

137
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,900
- Despite it being blue?

138
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,120
- Oh, it may be blue now,

139
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,190
but soon it will be redder
than Republican Texas.

140
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,150
I can't even look at it.

141
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,680
See, right now I'm even
turning away not looking at it.

142
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,540
- You're weird.

143
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,023
- No, I'm serious, bitch.

144
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,600
I swear to god, blue.

145
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,260
- I have to see something else, to forget.

146
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,960
An extra large black penis, maybe.

147
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:32,294
- Hmm.

148
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,280
You know, guys, maybe I would've
gotten an even better deal

149
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,853
if I would've gone to
Orbitz instead of Priceline.

150
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:42,080
(Keiichirou speaking gibberish)

151
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,270
- We go through this every episode.

152
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,630
- Sometimes travelers tend to hide money

153
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,590
in their hotel rooms

154
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,480
and forget to take it with
them when they check out.

155
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,453
Behind the picture?

156
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,080
This picture?

157
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,522
Maybe this vase isn't nailed down.

158
00:07:56,522 --> 00:07:57,355
(door rustling)

159
00:07:57,355 --> 00:08:00,472
(Leo screaming)

160
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:02,430
- I'd put that down if I were you.

161
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,590
All our furniture and electronics
have tracking devices.

162
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,483
I've seen your kind here before, Jew.

163
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,640
- Hello, I'm Reiichirou
Miyanoshita's daughter.

164
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
- Oh, the ex-lesbian!

165
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,370
I haven't seen you since that funeral

166
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,600
when your little retarded brother

167
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,210
cried the whole time. (laughs)

168
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,920
So, did you find Miyuki all right?

169
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,753
- Never showed up.

170
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,950
Service here sucks.

171
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,140
(phone rings)
(Satsuki gasps)

172
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,100
- Love to stay and chat,
but there's the phone.

173
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,933
Gotta go!

174
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,650
- Gotta email that awful
Great Hotels bitch.

175
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,483
- I hate her.

176
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:34,316
She's so perky.

177
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:35,740
- Let's just look at the bright side.

178
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,040
We're gonna save a bundle

179
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,090
on not having to tip any of these losers.

180
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,820
- I never tip maids.

181
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,653
It's their job to clean up.

182
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,440
And I don't recycle towels.

183
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,200
- This is one step above
a goddamn Days Inn.

184
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,170
- I'm hung!

185
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,420
- [Keiichirou] Is anyone going to feed me?

186
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,050
- [Satsuki] I think a saw
a fruit bowl in the lobby.

187
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,970
Go knock yourself out.

188
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,440
I'm gonna go find a bar.

189
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,831
- [Hajime] After "I Am Sam"
eats let's hit the slopes.

190
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,341
- [Group] Cowabunga!

191
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:03,341
(water bubbling)
(thunder rumbling)

192
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,061
- Man, that was awesome.
- You ate the head.

193
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,540
- [Hajime] (giggles) Head.

194
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,050
- Thank god there was a
Long John Sushi's nearby.

195
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,590
The hotel dining room is way too sketchy.

196
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,610
- I need a nap and some room service.

197
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,410
- Just imagine our good fortune.

198
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,010
You know, this must be the only ski lodge

199
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,003
with an off-season in December.

200
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,400
- Roger that.

201
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,053
I bet there's gonna be a
mandatory timeshare meeting soon.

202
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,823
Uh-oh.
- What?

203
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,670
- It's my sister, she.

204
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,151
- She what?

205
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:38,984
- What?

206
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,309
- [Satsuki] What was she, four?

207
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:46,107
- (laughs sarcastically)
That's really funny,

208
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,520
"What was she, four?"

209
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,456
It'd be even funnier if she wasn't dead.

210
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,289
- [Group] Dead?

211
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,330
- Yeah, dead, don't you know, Christian?

212
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,320
- Why?

213
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,750
- I mean, can't you feel it, too?

214
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,730
An evil presence?

215
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,580
- God, shut up, Jennifer Love Hairdo.

216
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,630
- It's the Lord.

217
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,540
I'm so close to his gentle spirit,

218
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,930
I can feel when he's disturbed

219
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,190
over the presence of evil!

220
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,023
- You're right.

221
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,940
We're 10 minutes into the
episode and no ghosts yet.

222
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,340
- [Satsuki] Where's the bar?

223
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:13,340
(Yuki screams)

224
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,420
- Don't do that!

225
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,450
- I can't help it.

226
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,280
Can't you see what's
happened to the picture?

227
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,717
The one beside the bunny, asshole!

228
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:23,384
(group screams)

229
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:26,010
I know how she died.

230
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,920
- [Satsuki And Momoko] What?

231
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,600
- She was so beautiful and popular,

232
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,650
and then one day, plop!

233
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,090
She just fell into the lake.

234
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,160
Everyone missed her.

235
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,140
They loved her.

236
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,160
Did I tell you she was really popular?

237
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,683
- The blue Bloodstained Lake?

238
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:39,430
(Hajime screams)

239
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,873
Okay, that is nasty.

240
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,610
- [Satsuki] I have some
nail polish that color.

241
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,490
- [Leo] Pantone 106, I believe.

242
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,800
- [Hajime] Shut up, Leo.

243
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,270
- Pantone 107.

244
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,780
Oh, by the way, I might've
failed to mention something

245
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,870
about the Bloodstained Lake. (screams)

246
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,640
Sorry about that.

247
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,940
When the lake turns from a
beautiful blue to a bloody red,

248
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,360
it means she's coming back
to take someone with her

249
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,260
into the spirit world.

250
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,150
- So, she's coming after us?

251
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,530
- That would explain
why nobody comes here.

252
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,920
- Maybe it's like Moses
turning the sea to blood.

253
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,634
- Well, Mrs. Moses looks
like she lost her bonnet.

254
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:20,295
(Yuki screams)

255
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:25,295
- It's her hat! (screams)

256
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,676
She was so popular! (sobs)

257
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:30,506
- We need to check the hell out of here!

258
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:31,924
Where's the bellboy?

259
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,464
What good are you?

260
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:34,826
God, you're pissing me off.

261
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:35,659
(Yuki screams)

262
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,480
- [Leo] I saw a payphone in the hall.

263
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,637
And I don't have any change.

264
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:42,304
(phone beeping)

265
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:45,151
(speaking foreign language)

266
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:47,762
(jingling)

267
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:52,762
(breathes heavily)
(phone beeping)

268
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,252
(jingling)
What?

269
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:59,242
Bells?
(jingling)

270
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:00,075
A cat?

271
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:07,975
Oh, of course.

272
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:15,002
Wow, cool boots.

273
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:23,189
(breathing heavily)
(suspenseful music)

274
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:40,818
Get away from me, you freak! (screams)

275
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:52,016
(screams)

276
00:12:52,016 --> 00:12:53,586
- [Yuki] (screams) It's her!

277
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:54,712
- [Satsuki] No solicitors!

278
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:56,370
Don't you let that bitch in!
- Hey!

279
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,990
Don't just stand there, get a chair!

280
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,214
- [Leo] They'll charge us if
someone else stays in our room!

281
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,700
- Hey, stupid!

282
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,253
Get me a chair!

283
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,933
- Stay there!

284
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,570
I'll stand very close behind you.

285
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,640
- [Miyuki] Open the door!
- I'll help, yeah.

286
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,580
- Well, if you're gonna
stand close behind me-

287
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,609
- [Miyuki] Open the door!

288
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:12,530
Open the door!
- Stand closer,

289
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,830
I can't even feel it!

290
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,405
And they wonder why I like Black men!

291
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:16,238
(Keiichirou speaking gibberish)

292
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:19,230
- [Miyuki] Open the door!
- I feel a very evil presence

293
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,183
in our midst.

294
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:24,003
(groaning)

295
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,130
- I kept her out.

296
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,497
Thank goodness for Power 90.

297
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:29,308
- Whatever.

298
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,758
(Hajime sighs)

299
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:31,591
(Hajime screams)

300
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:33,270
- Oh my god, I forgot the back door!

301
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,230
Goddammit!

302
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,730
- Wait!

303
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,750
I'll go stand right behind you.

304
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,730
- [Yuki] No, no, no,
that's okay, I got it.

305
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,563
- Wait!

306
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:42,981
Hello?

307
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:46,947
(creaking)

308
00:13:49,598 --> 00:13:52,265
(door rustling)

309
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,200
The paper.

310
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,403
They could've at least
brought it to my room.

311
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,187
Say what?

312
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:02,948
(door rustling)
(Hajime gasps)

313
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:05,781
(lock clicking)

314
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:08,531
(Hajime screams)

315
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,570
(Keiichirou screams)

316
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,453
- You don't have any change?

317
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,270
Leo?

318
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,370
- There's no signal on my expensive phone.

319
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,760
- I told you you should've gotten

320
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,476
a friends and family plan.

321
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:24,647
(banging)

322
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:26,036
(group screaming)

323
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:29,056
(bear roaring)

324
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:31,889
(group screaming)

325
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:43,268
- This way!

326
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:44,851
This way to safety!

327
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,433
Come on!

328
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:49,479
Move your ass!

329
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:54,479
God!

330
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:00,988
- Outside in the freezing cold!

331
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:01,821
Hurry!

332
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,757
(Keiichirou screams)

333
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,980
Man, are you guys out of shape, or what?

334
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,439
- Where's perv?

335
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:18,272
- Huh?

336
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:20,020
God finally did it.

337
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,240
He killed him as punishment
for his wickedness.

338
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,700
- Maybe my sister got him

339
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,500
and took him into the spirit world.

340
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,580
- What?

341
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,240
- But maybe it's not too late.

342
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,000
If we made peace with
this very popular girl

343
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,040
we might just be able to
save the poor bastard.

344
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,170
- Screw him, what about me?
(jingling)

345
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,010
- Oh yeah, I guess that's a good point.

346
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,900
Hey, hold on a second.

347
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,520
I know, I've got just the thing.

348
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,640
Thank goodness I remembered
the bloody picture.

349
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,360
Okay, now you guys chant after me.

350
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,973
I'll tell you what to say,
and you repeat exactly.

351
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,750
- [Group] Got it.

352
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,470
- Okay then.

353
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,470
Now, we go with the snow, but
not the snow that is yellow.

354
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:02,450
(group gasping)

355
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,440
See, it's really powerful, and it works.

356
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,380
Okay, everybody, let's hit it.

357
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,417
- Hey, look, here she comes!
(Yuki screams)

358
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:14,689
- [Keiichirou] She's coming.

359
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:17,330
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's coming.

360
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,236
Chant the spell.

361
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:20,097
- But I can't spell well.

362
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:21,396
(Leo groaning)

363
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:22,646
- [Keiichirou] Snow.

364
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,979
O-S-W-N-E?

365
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:30,515
- Oh, you.

366
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:33,390
- (gasps) Oh, no.

367
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,480
- Let's do this!
- Don't talk,

368
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,670
just shut up and do it!

369
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,148
- Let's hurry up!

370
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:39,637
I'm freezing my ass off!

371
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,963
- [Group] We go with the snow,

372
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,868
but not the snow that is-

373
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:48,108
- Stop!

374
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,193
Stop it!

375
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:52,270
(groans)

376
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,988
Stop it!

377
00:16:53,988 --> 00:16:54,821
- Perv's here.

378
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:58,960
- (breathing heavily)
Don't finish the spell!

379
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,570
- Why the hell not?

380
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,083
It's practically poetry, you jerk.

381
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,053
- Because.

382
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,250
Because the ghost is

383
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:10,977
her!

384
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:12,477
- [Group] Wowzers!

385
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,990
- [Keiichirou] Price half Macy's day sale.

386
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,450
- No, you idiot, the other headline!

387
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,970
Yuki Shirogane, age 10, stumbled,

388
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,554
plunged into the lake
and died 40 years ago.

389
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:26,387
(Satsuki gasps)

390
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:27,520
- [Yuki] They forgot to say popular!

391
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,760
- An old Yuki Shirogane would've
gotten away with it, too,

392
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,570
if it wasn't for us meddling kids

393
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,950
and our trusty retarded
sidekick, Keiichirou.

394
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,153
I've been waiting five
volumes for that joke.

395
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:39,881
(bell jingling)
- there's the damn bell!

396
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:42,130
- Somewhere an angel just got their wings.

397
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,540
- I was freezing out here.

398
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,800
Go figure, some loser waitress' kid

399
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,340
who fell in the lake 40 years ago

400
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,260
is pinning me for the fall.

401
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,173
What a bitch.

402
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,160
- I was so popular!

403
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,190
Why didn't anyone come for me?

404
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,480
I waited and waited, and no one came.

405
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,400
That really pissed me off.

406
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,480
I got so lonely waiting out there,

407
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,920
and then death, well,
that's really lonely.

408
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,570
And so, I (screeches)

409
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,017
I, I really wanna take
you with me, Miyuki.

410
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:16,648
(group screams)

411
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:19,510
(Miyuki screams)

412
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,851
- This bitch is nuts!

413
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,501
- And ugly as Nicky Hilton!

414
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,169
- [Hajime] I wanted to go to Acapulco.

415
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,181
"Let's go skiiing, let's go skiing!"

416
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:27,626
(groans) Dammit.

417
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:29,398
Even New Orleans, AKA Chocolate City,

418
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:31,976
would be better than this Arctic fuckfest!

419
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,230
Hell, I could've just stayed home

420
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,410
and have a ghost attack me.

421
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,537
This show's so damn predictable!

422
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:37,370
(Yuki laughing)

423
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,864
- My peepee's cold.
- Mine, too!

424
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:41,795
(Miyuki screaming)

425
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:42,628
- Get back here!

426
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:47,628
This is all your fault! (groaning)

427
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,113
(Yuki laughing)

428
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:54,083
- Come on.

429
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,614
Death isn't so bad, Miyuki.

430
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:57,677
(Satsuki screaming)

431
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:00,534
- I hate cold weather. (shivers)

432
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:05,174
(Yuki laughing)
(Satsuki screaming)

433
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:07,756
(Hajime shivering)

434
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:11,164
(Yuki laughing)

435
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:13,831
And I used to think she was hot.

436
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:18,430
- (gasps) Holy snowball and circle jerk.

437
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:20,738
That's it!

438
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:24,647
- What?

439
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,507
- Well, do it!
(slow music)

440
00:19:30,814 --> 00:19:32,364
- They forgot popular!

441
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:33,220
- [Group] We go with the snow,

442
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,780
but not the snow that is yellow.

443
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,580
We go with the snow, but
not the snow that is yellow.

444
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,450
We go with the snow, but
not the snow that is yellow.

445
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,353
We go with the snow, but
not the snow that is yellow.

446
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:51,080
We go with the snow, but
not the snow that is yellow.

447
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,364
We go with the snow-
- [Miyuki] Is she dead yet?

448
00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:57,114
(group groaning)

449
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:05,612
(Yuki screaming)

450
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,694
- [Yuki] I was popular.

451
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:25,937
(Miyuki gasping)

452
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:28,437
(group sighs)

453
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,311
- She must be one of
God's chosen, like me.

454
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:35,978
(bell jingling)

455
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,770
- [Miyuki] Do you know
how many bathing suits

456
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,480
that damn red lake has ruined for me?

457
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,360
Goddamn fortune.

458
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,710
I mean, I had to wear red suits.

459
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,080
I look awful in red.

460
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,470
- Dear Lord, I just thank you

461
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,930
that I look good in red.

462
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,510
- Where is your mother?

463
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,460
- Oh, my mother's at a relative's place.

464
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,500
She sent me to collect.

465
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,530
Your card was denied.

466
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,567
- We're not paying!

467
00:21:05,627 --> 00:21:07,240
- "My mother's at a relative's place."

468
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,073
I hate her.

469
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:09,450
- I'm gonna write William Shatner

470
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,860
and Priceline a nasty letter.

471
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,860
- Here it is, a waitress
at this sketchy inn

472
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,260
abandoned her child here and disappeared.

473
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,580
The girl was always waiting
for her mother to return,

474
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,290
but she never did.

475
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,610
They found her blue and
purple bloated carcass

476
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,720
of a body holding a soggy crust of bread

477
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,180
at the bottom of the lake.

478
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,660
They took her out with fishhooks.

479
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,830
- Did I leave the iron on?

480
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,010
- Speaking of William Shatner,

481
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,510
did you hear that he sold his
kidney stone for 25 grand?

482
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,780
And he gave the cash to
Habitat for Humanity.

483
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,090
So, some Trekkie just
built a poor person a house

484
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:47,620
- [Group] Ah.

485
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,647
- This is so gay.

486
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:53,490

487
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,353
