1
00:00:00,651 --> 00:00:05,651
(spooky music)
(wind blowing)

2
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:40,898
(spooky music ends)

3
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:44,148
(singing in Japanese )

4
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,133
(spooky music)

5
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:26,086
- (Momoko) Man it's colder than a witch's

6
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:26,919
- (Satsuki) Skip it.

7
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,300
- (Leo) My dad said the
weather channel predicted snow.

8
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,499
Why do old people always
watch the weather channel?

9
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:33,204
- (Satsuki) I'm freezing!

10
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:35,527
- (Hajime) Nature's little
thermometers acting up?

11
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:38,110
- (Satsuki) I'm ignoring that
perv; And I'm sure it's no

12
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,930
different than the shrinkage
issues you're having right now.

13
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,680
Do you know how much I hate you?

14
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,840
And it's not cold weather;

15
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,320
It's cold swimming pools.

16
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,830
James 1:14; Each one is
tempted by his own evil desire.

17
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,530
But I think your skirt is helping him out;

18
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,267
Slutski; I mean Satsuki!

19
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,720
- You're just jealous
of my Mary Hart gams.

20
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,180
- I'll tell you what, if I was a girl and

21
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,370
I had an ass your size there's no way I'd

22
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,070
wear a micro-mini; in fact
I'd probably wear mumus and

23
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,760
(heavy drum thump)

24
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,600
- You just know she's covering her lust

25
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,859
for me with cruelty and violence.

26
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:10,830
(crow caws)
- With how much she attacks

27
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,630
you she must really really
really really really like you.

28
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,410
- Yeah that's it; Oh good grief

29
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,297
where'd Keiichirou run
off too? Keiichiro-uh...

30
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,706
Get back here, do you know how many

31
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,607
child molesters there are in Japan!?

32
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:27,363
- Satsuki come look what I found!

33
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:28,760
(rolled harp chord)

34
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,030
- Not a Bratz; no wonder
some girl threw it away.

35
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,160
- It's so dirty and old and
trashy like Anna Nicole.

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,040
- Hey Satsuki can I have it, can I?

37
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,590
- You shouldn't pick up things that have

38
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,270
been thrown away by someone else.

39
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,960
And I don't care what they say,
boys don't play with dolls.

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,180
(Keiichirou cries)

41
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,398
I'm not going to have
a retarded gay brother.

42
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:50,370
(Keiichirou cries harder)

43
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,251
- Come on Hajime get up let's go home.

44
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:54,186
- (Hajime) My balls hurt.
(crow cawing)

45
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:55,729
- (Keiichirou) My tummy hurts!
(silverware clattering)

46
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:58,079
- (Satsuki) Well you ate
like a pig, no wonder.

47
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,950
And what four year old eats bell peppers?

48
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,900
Come back here I'm not doing
the dishes alone again.

49
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,343
I mean it, I'm not the damn maid!

50
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,700
Hey listen Dad, How about
you and I just discuss

51
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,200
your non-corporeal punishment stance?

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,875
Gah don't eat his crumbs we're not poor!

53
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:17,800
(water running)

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,794
Maybe we are poor; where's
the damn dishwasher!

55
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,160
- (Dad) And I thought her Mother's voice

56
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,564
grated on my nerves, I mean what?

57
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:27,910
- (Satsuki) Let me ask you, Mom was

58
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,627
a pretty good cook wasn't she?

59
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:35,947
- Well not bad it was edible at least.

60
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:36,780
(chuckles)

61
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,034
The woman was no Paula
Deen but she was all right.

62
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:40,060
- (Satsuki) That woman's
trying to kill her

63
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,470
husband no one uses that much butter.

64
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,610
But it's that semi-homemade chick

65
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,540
that's really dangerous; scary.

66
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,693
- Yeah gotta agree with you there.

67
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:58,742
(approaching footsteps)

68
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,983
- Wonder if this is how Tom Ford started.

69
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:13,149
(loudly spits)

70
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:21,283
(sigh)

71
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:25,059
Keiichirou get your ass down here!

72
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:25,892
- (Keiichirou) What?

73
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,823
- Don't "what" me when I
call you, You say Yes Ma'am!

74
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:32,078
(distant footfalls)
- You're such a bitch.

75
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:33,226
- (Satsuki) What did you say!?

76
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:34,466
- (Keiichirou) I have an itch?

77
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:36,370
- (Satsuki) M-hm an itch to play dolls!

78
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,940
Why did you bring this trashy little thing

79
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,930
home when I told you not
to go digging in the trash?

80
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,240
Why can't you do what I tell you?

81
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,171
- It wasn't me
- Huh?

82
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:47,800
- (Keiichirou) It wasn't
me I didn't bring it home.

83
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,280
- Haven't you listened to Momoko?

84
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,540
God's going to send you to hell for lying.

85
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,490
- I'm being framed!

86
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,218
- Oh you are, are you;
Who's framing you the dog?

87
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:57,361
- (Keiichirou) I want a lawyer!

88
00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:58,940
- Shut up!

89
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,830
You are not getting a
lawyer, all you've got is me

90
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,370
and I'm all you're going to get.

91
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,577
I'm your judge, the jury, and executioner.

92
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:10,132
(Door slams)
(Keiichirou crying)

93
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:12,299
(Snoring)

94
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,126
(Phone ringing)

95
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:37,506
(footsteps)

96
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:46,024
- Hello Manshita residence.

97
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:51,159
Eh.

98
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,433
- (Phone) Hi I'm Merry
Mary let's play together!

99
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:59,433
Meet my at the trash can!
(dial tone)

100
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:05,438
(Phone ringing)

101
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,400
(dramatic music)

102
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,291
- Hello again, like I said
this is the Manshita residence

103
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,135
- (Mary) It's Mary!
(hacking cough)

104
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:17,135
I'm at the cigarette store!
(dial tone)

105
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:21,360
(phone ringing)

106
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,653
- Listen Hajime stop having
your midget girlfriend call me.

107
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,506
- (Mary) Mary again, I'm
inside of your house!

108
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:28,339
- Huh?

109
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:39,362
(phone rings)

110
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:42,225
- Hello?
- (Mary) It's Mary!

111
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:46,057
I'm right behind you; you stupid bitch!

112
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:47,474
No the other way!

113
00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:55,274
Atta-girl; hehe that's it now you got it.

114
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:59,177
(maniacal laughter)

115
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,014
- I'm Merry Mary, Let's
play together Satsuki!

116
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,608
(gasp)

117
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:11,608
(phone clatters)
(screaming)

118
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:14,829
- (Dad) Satsuki I've told
you no phone after ten!

119
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:17,429
- You should be yelling at
the one who's calling me.

120
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,230
- And no doll playing; after ten fifteen.

121
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,243
- Look at her closely
Dad, She's so lifelike.

122
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,168
Too lifelike!
- What?

123
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:34,910
(door opening)

124
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,910
Oh no, no don't say another
word just keep your mouth shut.

125
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:44,990
- What are you doing; That's sick!

126
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,086
And it wasn't me I put
it back in the trash can.

127
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:49,728
- (Mary) I'm at the trash can!

128
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:50,561
- No; no!

129
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:58,910
- (Leo) So what happened
to the Merry Mary doll?

130
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,603
- Don't know, Dad said he
would take care of her.

131
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:04,730
- (Hajime) You should've let
Keiichirou keep the doll.

132
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,450
I mean Leo played with
dolls when he was a kid

133
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,920
and he's not a fag.
(wheezing)

134
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,430
- (Leo) I only used the
Barbies for G.I. Joes hoes.

135
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,750
- But if you catch him wearing dresses

136
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,717
he'll move to We-Ho before you know it.

137
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:17,539
(PA Chime)

138
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:20,380
- (PA) Satsuki Manshita
please report the front office

139
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,000
again, I repeat Satsuki
Manshita please come

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,323

141
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:30,463
(keyboard clatter)
- Yes I'm here.

142
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,410
- Well look at you, what
a tardy little outfit.

143
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,610
You've got a call on
line one make it quick.

144
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:46,677
- Hello I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

145
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:48,481
This is Satsuki speaking.

146
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:51,451
- (Phone) I'm Mary,
Now I'm at Foot Locker!

147
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:55,714
Let's play together!
(violent slam)

148
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:58,261
(ringing)

149
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:02,178
(increasing number of ringing)

150
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:10,958
- (Hajime) Where's the fire?

151
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,295
- (Leo) I didn't hear the alarm.

152
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:16,045
(phones ringing)

153
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:21,280
(panting)

154
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,350
- You found out he is gay, didn't you?

155
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,670
- Is he out?

156
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,966
- It was Mary.

157
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,431
- (Hajime) Oh that's not nice.

158
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:30,260
- (Satsuki) Not that
kind of Mary you idiot.

159
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,600
The Merry Mary doll, She's pissed at me

160
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,750
for wanting to throw her away.

161
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,380
She's trying to kill me!

162
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,564
- Girl you need extensive therapy.

163
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:38,603
- (Satsuki) No I don't!
(phone vibrating)

164
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:39,790
- (Hajime) You're blaming
this doll for your brother's

165
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,076
sexual preference so
that makes you infinitely

166
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,827
- (Mary) Hey jew kid put Satsuki on!

167
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:48,087
Hey Satsuki it's me, Mary,
I'm on the roof let's play.

168
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:50,420
(Dial tone)

169
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,844
- No, oh no I can't take it anymore.

170
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:57,761
- (Hajime) How, how does
she know we're on the roof?

171
00:10:57,761 --> 00:11:00,664
- How, how did Merry Mary get my number?

172
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:01,954
(metal rattling)

173
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,630
- Manshita, I've been
looking everywhere for you.

174
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,500
You need to go to central hospital.

175
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,090
And I've got to take a dump!

176
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,550
Your fathers been in an accident

177
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,473
and I'm about to have one, now
where's your little brother?

178
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:14,011
- (Leo) He's in Class 2, Grade 1

179
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:19,011
- (Satsuki) Special Ed!
(dramatic music)

180
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,222
(distant running)

181
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,389
(panting)

182
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:34,334
- Dad!

183
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,760
- Oh hi Satsuki, guess
that's the last time

184
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,971
I play with one of your
little blonde dollies

185
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:43,206
(chuckle)

186
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:44,287
- Dad; Dad!

187
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,760
- (Dad) Keiichirou; what did you teacher

188
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,650
do put this in the school paper?

189
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,640
Those prude bitches in the PTA

190
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,209
are going to have a field day with this.

191
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,489
(both crying)

192
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:56,518
Oh calm down I'm all right.
(crying louder)

193
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:59,851
It's not like I wanted more kids anyway.

194
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:05,528
- Poor Keiichirou is crying so hard

195
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:08,870
I hope his dad can accept his homo...

196
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,379
- Oh thanks a lot for the help big mouth.

197
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:14,590
- (Sakata) Yeah yeah,
remember this at Christmas.

198
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,289
- My HMOs trying to kick me out

199
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:18,543
but I think I'll stay
for the hot night nurses.

200
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:20,616
I mean listen Satsuki the doctor

201
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,790
wants to keep me for observation.

202
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,180
You'll watch your little brother, right?

203
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,340
Hajime!

204
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,400
- Yeah I'm awake.

205
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,851
- Would you, would you mind checking in on

206
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:33,286
Satsuki and Keiichirou for
me, you can do it right?

207
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:36,970
- Aren't I a little old
sounding for that role?

208
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,640
- Thank goodness it wasn't serious

209
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,581
hospitals are so expensive.

210
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:44,140
- (Satsuki) That plastic skag.
- (Leo) Who?

211
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,817
- That Merry Mary bitch,
I'm going to kill her.

212
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,470
She tried to murder my...

213
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:54,410
(dramatic music)

214
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,530
- Why is that midget staring at us?

215
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,363
- Hajime that's Merry Mary.

216
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:04,470
- If you kids don't want her I can

217
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,225
get a few bucks for her on Ebay.

218
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:08,129
- Put her down Mr.Sakata don't let those

219
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:10,740
blonde girls in pink dirndl
fool you, she's a killer!

220
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,270
- Oh come on she can't be worse

221
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,891
than the blonde I had last night.

222
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:16,999
(Keiichirou sobbing)

223
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:18,540
- Okay

224
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,400
if she's freaking you out that bad

225
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,250
I can show you a place to take her.

226
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,050
There's a group of guys
I met at a rest stop

227
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,598
last week who'd just love her.

228
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,710
(distant chime)

229
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,650
- Temple of the dolls?

230
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,553
- What scares me is how
he knows about this.

231
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:36,230
- (Sakata) Okay everybody
be cool, act natural.

232
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,520
I'm getting this huge boogie nights vibe.

233
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,320
- It's not by Mattel but
I guess we'll take her in.

234
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,563
File it Toby.
- Yes daddy.

235
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:48,683
- (Leo) I'm a little fuzzy
on the doll temple concept.

236
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,110
(chuckle)

237
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,263
- Young mantis weep for cheetah.

238
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:56,263
- (Leo) Still fuzzy.

239
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:59,340
- (Monk) I am a member of club of aging

240
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,370
homosexuals, most of us in publishing.

241
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,820
On holidays we come to this
temple, get really baked

242
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,890
and put in a Joan Crawford movie.

243
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,883
We reenact the film with our dolls.

244
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,460
Some times we perform
more contemporary works.

245
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,090
Particularly from the
canon of Christian Slater.

246
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,090
And your little dolly has arrived

247
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,653
for us at a most opportune time.

248
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,140
She'll play the Tara Reid
character from Alone in the Dark.

249
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,769
- So kids you feel a little
better about everything?

250
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,530
- (Leo) No, I don't know what's scarier

251
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,080
the killer doll, the weirdo sensei,

252
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,834
or you knowing about this place.

253
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,200
- (Sakata) What's the matter Manshita?

254
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,390
They paid us in cash.

255
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,752
- No I'm down with it, nice
to know a new dealer, yo

256
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:46,420
- (Leo) Okay I guess if we think of it

257
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,020
as a doll prison I can
feel a little better.

258
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,611
Maybe they can all learn some
kind of vocational skill.

259
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:53,873
- (Hajime) Yeah that's
a good idea; shut up.

260
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:57,806
(discordant music)

261
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:19,760
- (Sakata) Love to stay but I'm hooking up

262
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,830
with this cinnamon chick.

263
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,750
- Okay, safe plays save Mr. Sakata

264
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,683
- Your teachers such a weirdo.

265
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,186
Dads not home I can play Snuff 3

266
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:30,186
- (Satsuki) Shoot some hookers,
score some drug I don't care

267
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,020
(sigh)

268
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,650
Hey why are you acting all pissed off?

269
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,900
- Because I don't think I'm getting paid

270
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,693
for this gig, that's why.

271
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:39,820
- (Satsuki) I don't need you.

272
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,637
- News flash, retarded brother.

273
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:43,600
(Phone ringing)

274
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,723
Hello.

275
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:47,723
(Keiichirou crying)

276
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,450
You going to answer it?

277
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,630
Your fathers in the hospital, remember?

278
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,623
- Oh yeah right.

279
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,314
(beep)
- (Phone) I'm Mary!

280
00:15:58,314 --> 00:16:01,319
(hacking cough)
Gotta give these things up.

281
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:03,571
Let's play together!
(click)

282
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:06,782
(dramatic music)

283
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:08,862
(sobbing)

284
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:10,730
- (Hajime) Don't even,
are you going to let some

285
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,664
little polly pocket get the better of you?

286
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,553
- (Satsuki) Yes.
- (Hajime) Oh hell no.

287
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,670
This barbie bitch is going down.

288
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,920
First we do this geographic montage,

289
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,393
to show we traveled a
long way from your house.

290
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,010
There that should be enough.
(floor creaking)

291
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,516
- Where are we?

292
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:35,500
- (Hajime) Sketchy, scary,
abandoned square dancing hall.

293
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,310
Toby Keith played here, Nazi.

294
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,942
We make this out home base.

295
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:40,030
- (Satsuki) Was the super dome full?

296
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,070
- Leo and I scoped this place
out for just this occasion.

297
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,580
We planned on stocking
it with some provisions

298
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,550
but all we got were
these two sleeping bags.

299
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,020
Kind of spent all out
money on porno and lube.

300
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,721
It's the thought that counts.

301
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:55,005
- (Keiichirou) Hey Hajime
where's the bathroom?

302
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:56,834
- (Hajime) Just piss on
the Toby Keith poster.

303
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:57,917
- Number two!

304
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:02,183
(wolf howling)
(farting)

305
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:05,571
- Oh my god in heaven I can't believe it.

306
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:07,220
(Keiichirou crying)

307
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,358
It only gets worse when you get older.

308
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:10,706
- (Keiichirou) there's no paper.

309
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:11,666
- What!

310
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,583
(gasp)

311
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,847
(panicked gasp)

312
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,243
- Hello I'm Mary let's
play together; Let's play.

313
00:17:34,157 --> 00:17:36,168
- (Doll 1) What do you
think we should play?

314
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:39,251
- (Doll 2) I have a great
idea, let's play Saw!

315
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:42,104
- (Doll 3) No let's play
The Hills have Eyes!

316
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,844
- (Doll 4) Let's play Se7en!

317
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:46,442
- (Doll 5) No let's Glitter,
that movie was scary.

318
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,810
- (Doll 6) No I want to play
Texas Chainsaw Massacre!

319
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,272
But not the remake!

320
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:54,527
- (Doll 7) Danger danger, Will
Robinson; wait wrong movie.

321
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:59,527
- (Doll 8) Kill the bitch!
(overlapping shouting)

322
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,273
(silence)

323
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:08,281
- (Dolls) ♪ Satsuki's a goner this we know

00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:43,146
(suspenseful music)

333
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:46,028
(All shouting) Amen!

334
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:50,360
- (Satsuki) Hajime, somebody help me!

335
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,229
- That doesn't sound good.

336
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:54,580
- (Hajime) Satsuki!
- (Keiichirou) Hajime!

337
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,369
(window rattling)
- (Hajime) Crap!

338
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,946
- (Momoko) Hajime where's Satsuki!

339
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:01,117
- (Hajime) Nice outfit;
she's locked inside!

340
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:06,944
(muffled screaming)

341
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:15,555
- (Mary) Okay it's decided
we'll play pluck it out.

342
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,701
(dull thud)

343
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:34,550
(whimpering)

344
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,550
Okay that spit thing was kind of gross

345
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,047
but it's the thought that counts.

346
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:43,464
(dolls shout in protest)

347
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,730
Knock it off, this isn't
a goddamn democracy.

348
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,273
I'm running the show, I
said let the bitch go.

349
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,557
(melancholy piano)

350
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,320
Yeah that was a close on for ya.

351
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,640
For a minute there I was seriously

352
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,643
thinking about cutting your tits off.

353
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,060
But this Herme's kind of nice.

354
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,768
Okay I'm out of here; Late.

355
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:19,101
- Go help her man.
- Satsuki!

356
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:26,170
On your knees, are you praying?

357
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,600
- Jesus thank you, guess I am.

358
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,170
- The Merry Mary doll called
me on the phone too Satsuki

359
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,663
I'm unlisted don't know
how she got my number.

360
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,690
I tried to put my Patty
Prayer doll on the phone

361
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,893
but those two just did not get along.

362
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:48,640
- (Hajime) Incoming!
(glass shattering)

363
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,940
Satsuki are you all right!

364
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,140
What, what are you looking at?

365
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,830
What's wrong with you, speakless

366
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,250
by my Bruce Willis like moves?

367
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,800
- Hajime that was brave
but not very bright.

368
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,110
- What do you mean?
(trickling sound)

369
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,463
What, what, what; somebody help me!

370
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:08,733
- (Keiichirou) Somebody get a bandaid!

371
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:09,691
(Hajime screaming)

372
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:11,521
- (Satsuki) God that is disgusting

373
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:15,136

little neater next time?

374
00:21:15,136 --> 00:21:18,200
(creepy music)
(humming)

375
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,803
- Up, up and
- (Amanojaku) Hey you, doll!

376
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:25,554
- (Mary) Well look who's here, nice coat.

377
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:27,780
- Ahahaha, very funny.

378
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,070
Now that you've got your little cape on

379
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,730
why don't you fly out of here.

380
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,433
Before I push you off this roof.

381
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,560
- Well you're a pissy
little pussy ain't cha?

382
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,777
Maybe I should cut your tits off.

383
00:21:43,017 --> 00:21:45,230
- Hm Satsuki's doing her ancestors proud,

384
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,823
not easy to impress our crowd.

385
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:50,562
Hm I'm not feeling a
little soft spot am I?

386
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:51,395
Me, nah.

387
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,896

388
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:26,528
♪ My mommy lays over the ocean, ♪

00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:29,703
