1
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:04,558
(ominous music)

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,620
- Hold still, keep your neck straight.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,810
(laughs) I love that.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,790
God, I just kill me.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,120
Nice rack.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,463
Mind if I make them a
little bigger? (laughs)

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,460
Boobies, love boobies.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,152
Nice lips too.

9
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:28,535
I used to have lips!

10
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:31,368
(woman screaming)

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,657
(singing in Japanese)

12
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,893
(eerie music)

13
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,190
- [Child] Look, Satsuki, you got the gold.

14
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,100
- [Leo] I prefer the angry homoeroticism

15
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,200
of earlier Mapplethorpe,

16
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,780
but this will do in a pinch.

17
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,690
- You could paint anything
and you paint a school?

18
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,550
Weak.

19
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,410
- I know, right?

20
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,014
Hey, wait a minute, what's
that supposed to mean?

21
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:28,820
- Is that the bell?
- Come back here, you newt.

22
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,009
- [Janitor] I know you all love school

23
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:31,593
but you need to leave.

24
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:32,548
- [Children] Okay.

25
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:34,890
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

26
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,210
- Bye!
- Yeah, yeah.

27
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,253
See you tomorrow.

28
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,689
(eerie music)

29
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:49,050
(soft music)

30
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,480
- Oh darling, our
daughter got first place,

31
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,690
just like you did 28 years ago.

32
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,810
Just like I got to
first base 28 years ago.

33
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,810
Boo yeah!

34
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,688
- Is that pot?

35
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,521
Dad!

36
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,843
That sounds pretty.

37
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,930
I've never seen a
musical stash box before.

38
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:07,479
- Hmm?

39
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,480
It's empty.

40
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,940
Haven't had dope in here in weeks.

41
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,478
- I guess that intervention
at Momoko's church worked.

42
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:15,830
Well, praise the name of the Lord.

43
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,970
- Wow, Satsuki, when I
look at you sometimes,

44
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,920
you look so much like your mother.

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,753
- It's the haircut.

46
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:22,490
It makes me look butch, doesn't it?

47
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,876
- Yeah, very LPGA.

48
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:27,043
(screams)

49
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,180
Momoko, what is Keiichiro doing?

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,013
- No clue.

51
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,385
- Lunch time, BJ?
- I'm in, dude.

52
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:37,833
- No clue what that's about either.

53
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,510
- That is disgusting.
- Yeah.

54
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,940
- [Girl] Oh my God, that's so gross.

55
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,773
Excuse me.

56
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:44,665
(gasps)

57
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:47,653
- You've been vandalized.

58
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,890
- [Satsuki] Taggers.

59
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:53,910
- They're tough critics.

60
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,054
- That's kinda gross.

61
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:57,411
(eerie music)

62
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:59,578
(moaning)

63
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:04,510
- You guys gotta see what's happening

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,730
at the old school house.

65
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,740
Serious, bitch.

66
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,920
- Hope it's Donrush getting beat up again.

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,830
- What's going on?

68
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,369
- Maybe it's the art guys.

69
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:12,202
Oh no.

70
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:15,456
- Oh hell yeah.

71
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,946
(eerie music)

72
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,850
- [Satsuki] What the hells happening?

73
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,853
- Satsuki, look.

74
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:27,940
(gasping)

75
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,000
- [Hajime] Gross, aint it?

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,370
- I've got the mini version right here.

77
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,860
- Macken breaking.

78
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,160
- Your paintings vandalized
like the building.

79
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:38,500
Hey, hey, watch your hands, Leo.

80
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,970
- Keep it down, you guys.

81
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,960
This is obviously some kind
of psychical phenomenon.

82
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,923
- Oh yeah.

83
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,390
- Let's follow them and investigate, yeah?

84
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,720
- You are stupid.

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,280
- Seek and ye shall find.

86
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,680
- That's what I'm afraid of.

87
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,430
Maybe I should of done a painting

88
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,310
of the last supper with Mary Magdalene

89
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,690
the whore on Jesus' right.

90
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,610
Da Vinci could of been on to something.

91
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,640
- God bless you.

92
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,913
- [Keiichirou] Let's roll.

93
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:03,163
- I'll stay.

94
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,953
Or not.

95
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,875
- it's probably coming from here.

96
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:17,125
(eerie ethereal music)

97
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:19,252
What?

98
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,690
Goddamn kids.

99
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,640
- Is that blood?

100
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,473
- A positive.

101
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:23,767
Shut up and mop.

102
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:24,600
- Okay.

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,334
Oh, this is water from
the rain leaking in.

104
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:33,155
There's a big wet stain
here on the ceiling.

105
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:36,580
This is what the red blood actually is.

106
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,640
- Good, pour some more cans.

107
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,330
I want this cleaned up in an hour.

108
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,980
Put a little blue and it turns purple.

109
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,813
- Purple?

110
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:44,370
- Get to work!

111
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,713
Artists, I hate kids.

112
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,980
- Spilled paint, lame.

113
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,100
- Most psychical phenomena

114
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,930
are actually people misunderstanding

115
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,570
normal everyday events.

116
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,970
- Like Jesus on tortillas.

117
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,710
- Yeah, that's how it is.

118
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,127
I'm going home to, you know.

119
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,160
- And crying statues of Mary.

120
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,731
These Mexicans will believe anything.

121
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:03,890
Ay carumba.

122
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,275
- Trying to leave here.

123
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:06,277
- Mira!

124
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:07,339
(gasping)

125
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,170
- [Hajime] That's cool.

126
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,833
I mean (screams).

127
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,970
- Hey, the janitor man is
in the painting, you guys.

128
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,250
- [All] What?

129
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,136
(eerie tense music)

130
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:18,200
(gasping)

131
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,712
- [Hajime] Short bus is right.

132
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,720
- Does this mean what's
happening in real life

133
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,650
is gonna show up in Satsuki's painting?

134
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,650
Could you draw me getting
a nice Jewish girl

135
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,550
in a lap dance?

136
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,223
- [Kaya] Someone call art forum.

137
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:31,810
- [Satsuki] Kaya!

138
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,070
- Or maybe you should
call child murder weekly.

139
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,280
- I hate you so much.

140
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,600
- Hey, where Momoko go?

141
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,433
- You're right.

142
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:39,000
Haven't felt the obnoxious
presence of guilt.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,540
- What you do with her, stupid cat?

144
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,920
- Dead artist works are priceless

145
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
and ghost artists prices, ca-ching.

146
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,193
- What ghost artist?

147
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,470
- The school house Da Vinci is back.

148
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,136
Some art teacher who wanted
to be Leonardo Da Vinci

149
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:52,700
but he didn't have the skills.

150
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,370
I mean, this guy was awful.

151
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,540
Bad hair, too.

152
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,730
Any who, critics hated his stuff

153
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,850
so he killed himself.

154
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,720
Loser.

155
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,553
Now he's a ghost

156
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,670
and when he picks a model to paint

157
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,320
by the time the portrait's finished,

158
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,680
the bitch is a goner

159
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,260
and what really sucks about that is,

160
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,700
she's never coming back.

161
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,090
Not as a ghost or a little
angel with pretty wings.

162
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:11,923
Nothing.

163
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:13,115
- Not even a ghost?

164
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:14,853
- That's some powerful spirit.

165
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:17,330
- This nutcase even has the spooks

166
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,210
at the old schoolhouse spooked

167
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,550
and it's all your fault.

168
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,792
- Why is it all my fault?

169
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:24,040
- Your mother was the one who put Da Vinci

170
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,090
to spiritual sleep a long time ago.

171
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,530
Good job, you're the one who went

172
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,450
and resurrected him.

173
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,610
- What are you talking about?

174
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,711
I haven't done anything.

175
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,878
(gasping)

176
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,394
Here it is, Da Vinci.

177
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:40,150
June 29th, I put the evil spirit Da Vinci

178
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,112
to spiritual sleep in
my beautiful painting

179
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:45,210
but if someone were to paint
the same painting I painted

180
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,056
Da Vinci will probably be reborn.

181
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:50,551
Oh that is just bull(bleep)
is what that is.

182
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,053
- [Kaya] Isn't it ironic?

183
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,056
Don't you think?

184
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,520
Daughter unwittingly paints the picture

185
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,710
that brings back the ghost mommy vanished.

186
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,030
Someone call Canada.

187
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,389
We need Alanis Morissette, stat!

188
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,100
- I oughta know.

189
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,070
- Hey wait, wasn't Da
Vinci a big Christian, too,

190
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,270
or was it Leonardo?

191
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,220
- They're the same.

192
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,300
- Cue kids to look at painting.

193
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,340
- [All] Yeah.

194
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,470
- [Kaya] Now he seems partial

195
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,120
to beautiful young born against.

196
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,400
Hallelujah.

197
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,352
- Oh no, Momoko.

198
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:18,220
- Is that Olan Mills?

199
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,840
- Look at that hairdo.

200
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,610
- Hey, that's the window from the art room

201
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,803
next door, you guys.

202
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,509
- [Hajime] Well, how do we put
this Da Vinci guy to sleep?

203
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:30,420
- Envelop him in incense
smoke and chant this spell.

204
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,660
Oh crap, damn Kool Aid.

205
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,130
Grape flavor stains awful.

206
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,650
I can't read this spell.

207
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,123
- And like any of us
carry incense around, Leo.

208
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:44,773
- Could of used this last night.

209
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:52,276
- Hey, it's Himako.

210
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:56,790
- Well, looky there.

211
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,210
It seems this time even
the ghosts are on your side

212
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,610
or they're just giving
you some really good

213
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,816
Rastafarian incense to ease the pain.

214
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:03,940
- It's patchouli, I hate patchouli.

215
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,773
Let's go.

216
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:06,160
Come on, you guys.

217
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,203
- [All] Thunder cats, ho!

218
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,410
- Hold still.

219
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,720
Keep your neck straight.

220
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,290
(laughing) I love that.

221
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,070
That never gets old.

222
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,270
Let's see.

223
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,716
Purple for your hair.

224
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:20,600
Can't tell this was a goddamn anime.

225
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,219
Oh sorry, my bad.

226
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:25,040
You're the little born again, aren't you?

227
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,410
I painted your boss once,

228
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,450
he and those 12 dorks he ran with.

229
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,050
They wouldn't sit still.

230
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,950
After it was allover, they stiffed me.

231
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,170
- Would you mind terribly

232
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,397
if we took a little break here?

233
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:36,676
I'm getting the worst--

234
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,330
- Shut up!

235
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,860
Worse than Peter, that bastard.

236
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,800
Never stopped moving his damn mouth.

237
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,970
Chatty Cathy.

238
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,259
Why do I have to sit next to Judas?

239
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,615
What an apostle.

240
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,070
- Let her go, hairdo.

241
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,523
- Yeah, you ghost Gogan.

242
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,740
- Where'd they go?

243
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,623
- Thank you.

244
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:05,220
(eerie music)

245
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,221
(shouting)

246
00:10:07,221 --> 00:10:08,603
I'll take that.

247
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:09,436
Whee!

248
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:11,680
- Satsuki.

249
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,584
- Satsuki, get up.

250
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:15,525
- I'm out of here.

251
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:17,402
(screaming)

252
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:20,402
(eerie tense music)

253
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,304
- I got to try that.

254
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:26,565
- Satsuki wait.

255
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:27,824
- [Keiichirou] Satsuki, don't leave.

256
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:30,074
(shouting)

257
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:32,359
- Push harder.

258
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:34,160
- That hurt my face.

259
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
- [Hajime] No good job.

260
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,430
- It looked cool and it
seemed like a good idea

261
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,473
at the time.

262
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,621
Okay, stop trying to look up my skirt.

263
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:46,660
It's a cartoon.

264
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,493
David Williams.

265
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,873
- [Keiichirou] Satsuki, Satsuki!

266
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:52,910
- Sorry, Keiichirou.

267
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,860
I really don't think they can hear you.

268
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,096
- [Kaya] Now they've done it.

269
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:00,690
- Kaya, wait happened,
can you explain it to me?

270
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,860
- Don't ask me.

271
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,152
I look at myself as more of a
postmodern impressionist fan.

272
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:08,050
(stammering)

273
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,560
Please speak!

274
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,700
It's not my problem.

275
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,740
Us ghosts are just happy
this Da Vinci freak

276
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,440
isn't around to bother us anymore.

277
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:20,533
- Kaya, wait, don't go.
- Hey, you come back here

278
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,733
you flea bag!

279
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:24,533
(soft tense music)

280
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:25,770
- Where the hells the new school house?

281
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,690
We need a phone.

282
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,030
- We're inside you're painting.

283
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,653
I told you should of done a nude.

284
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:32,030
- I tried and nipples are a bitch

285
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,150
and don't even get me started on hair.

286
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,635
I should of gone Pollack.

287
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:37,740
Easy.

288
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,610
Hey, where's Momoko?

289
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,950
- Oh yeah, she's the reason
we're in this awful art work.

290
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,537
We should save her now
that we're stuck here.

291
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,913
- You're so loving.

292
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,240
- Oh, so this is where you've been hiding.

293
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,073
Come here.

294
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:52,411
I've got something to show ya.

295
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,244
Oh ya.

296
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:56,420
- [Satsuki Voiceover]
This guys got a cute butt.

297
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,480
Something about that bothers me.

298
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,753
- Listen, I just met you.

299
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,690
- Here, check it out.

300
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,593
Look.

301
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,300
- Cool.

302
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,830
- I got it at Walmart.

303
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,530
- And put it in a Tiffany's box?

304
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,030
- Where'd he get those shorts?

305
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:15,610
- Probably at Old Navy

306
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,080
and sewed a Banana
Republic tag inside them.

307
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,352
Still, people in this
painting are so nice.

308
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:22,110
(people cheering)
What was that?

309
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,143
- To the bat cave.

310
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:26,940
(people cheering)

311
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:31,954
- [Announcer] And they did it.

312
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:34,338
That Hatsasari move and scores another win

313
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,450
over the (rapid mock Japanese).

314
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,510
- Yeah!

315
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,343
- They dropped a bomb, man.

316
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,096
- Things that make you go boom.

317
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:44,027
- I saw we celebrate
tonight with some bodies.

318
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:46,461
- Holy, time machine, batman.

319
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:47,730
It's 1973.

320
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,640
- Holy pre-Parkinson's Michael J. Fox,

321
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,910
Christopher Lloyd Back to the Future

322
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,820
plot rip off device.

323
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,620
Where's my DeLorean?

324
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,690
- Pre-Parkinson's?

325
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,466
You are so shockingly hateful.

326
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:57,790
- I don't feel sorry for him.

327
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,106
He was in Light of Day.

328
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:02,023
(shuddering groan)

329
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:06,340
- Mom.

330
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,240
- Listen, even the music is a
Back to the Future knockoff.

331
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,373
- I see.

332
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,109
He didn't escape into the painting.

333
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:15,767
He went back in time
where Mom's painting is.

334
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:18,951
This isn't inside the
painting after all, Hajime.

335
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:21,010
My painting and mom's painting

336
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,410
are like the entrance and exit

337
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,850
of a tunnel connecting
the two time periods.

338
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,170
How could I figure this out

339
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,820
without it being in the script?

340
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,510
- Oh, I'm sorry for making you wait, Ray.

341
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,340
Something came up and I have to...

342
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,423
Hello, oh.

343
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,293
- Hello, milf.

344
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,500
- Hey, your name wouldn't be Kayako,

345
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,600
by any chance, would it?

346
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,540
- Yeah, that's me.

347
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,780
Who are you?

348
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,270
- You're so artsy fartsy looking.

349
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,791
I just assumed that was you.

350
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,839
Listen, sister, how 'bout
you tell me about Da Vinci.

351
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,770
- How the hell do you know about that?

352
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,060
- [Satsuki] Wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

353
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,978
Listen, I'm looking for a friend of mine--

354
00:13:52,978 --> 00:13:54,040
- Hey.

355
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,530
- Yeah, can you believe you
won first place with that?

356
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,194
- Someones been messing with my work.

357
00:13:58,194 --> 00:14:00,700
I put that jackass to spiritual sleep.

358
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,570
How'd he wake up?

359
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,990
- If someone does the same painting,

360
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,350
the spiritual sleep ends.

361
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,550
I did the same painting as this

362
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,230
but I have to say, mine
was a little better.

363
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,514
- Oh, great.
- Oops, listen.

364
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,340
About Da Vinci.

365
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,770
That long haired freaks
using Momoko as a model

366
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,663
and I don't know the spell
for the spiritual sleep.

367
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,269
- Got any incense on ya?

368
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:19,920
Hope so.

369
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,970
I don't want to have to
run all the way home.

370
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,240
Jesus.

371
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,350
What are you looking at?

372
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,183
Move it.

373
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,423
(whimpering)

374
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:29,256
- [Leo] God, stop it.

375
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:30,200
You're giving me a headache.

376
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,120
- [Keiichirou] I can't
believe Kaya disappeared.

377
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,222
That's so mean.

378
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:34,055
(whimpering)

379
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:35,197
- I need some Advil or some Tylenol.

380
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:36,030
Shut up!

381
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,873
Hey, hey.

382
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:40,249
Where'd the painting go?

383
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:43,170
- It's so pretty and
I love the pine smell.

384
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,450
- The floor's cleaned.

385
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,869
Oh no, the janitor.

386
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:48,369
(tense music)

387
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:50,900
I knew it.

388
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,310
- What's the matter?

389
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,690
- The older daughter on
Roseann was a bait and switch.

390
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,520
- Yeah, Becky, everyone knows that.

391
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,353
- Oh yeah.

392
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:59,271
I hope the janitor hasn't thrown it away.

393
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:00,333
- What?

394
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,666
(screaming)

395
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,570
- Oh.

396
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,050
- No, not the Bob Ross.

397
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,883
Wait!

398
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,530
- Don't crowd me.

399
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,433
10 to one he's behind the green door.

400
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,718
Damn, that was such a good movie.

401
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,990
- Well, maybe you should
check out Playgirl sometime.

402
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,630
Okay, I'll smoke Da Vinci with incense

403
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,980
and you chant the spell.

404
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,150
- So bossy.

405
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,983
- What are we doing?

406
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:27,840
- Smoking Da Vinci with incense

407
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,673
while she chants the spell.

408
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:29,506
God.

409
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,381
- [Hajime] Momoko.

410
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:35,298
(muffled shouting)

411
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,773
- Shut up, we're coming.

412
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:41,389
(muffled shouting)

413
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:43,549
(laughing)

414
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,040
- It's Maria Shriver.

415
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,250
- That's Mrs. Schwarzenegger to you.

416
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,271
- Ah, shut up, Skeletor.

417
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:52,030
(mock laughing)

418
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:55,060
- If I had a dollar for
every time someone said that.

419
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,440
The portraits almost finished.

420
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,773
You trying to put me to
sleep or me wrapping this up.

421
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,520
Want to see who's quicker?

422
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,229
I've done caricatures at
Six Flags in my down years.

423
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,790
(laughs)

424
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,690
- Was that the lords prayer?

425
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,560
- If I had a dollar
every time I heard that.

426
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,240
How bout this, you toss the incense,

427
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,470
I'll toss sister Christian.

428
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,303
- Well.

429
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:18,486
- Motoring.

430
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,890
Oh, I've been waiting
for this day to come,

431
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,470
ever since you put me to spiritual sleep.

432
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,713
You know how boring that's been for me?

433
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,910
- You have got to rethink that hair.

434
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,070
- It's a comb over.

435
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,340
You deal with alopecia for 2,000 years

436
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,360
and see what you look like.

437
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,540
- Hey!

438
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,447
- Slap.

439
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:38,470
- He bitch slapped her.

440
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,353
- Yeah.

441
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,920
Oh, and thanks for your
little Edward Hopper,

442
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,240
by the way.

443
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,020
Thanks to you painting the same painting,

444
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,930
I was set free.

445
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,420
So I'm gonna check out the
world 28 years from now.

446
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,620
I've been trapped in this
stupid time warp school

447
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,090
so long I've mastered in everything

448
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,604
from shop to home EC.

449
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:57,570
I hate home EC.

450
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,403
Ironing.

451
00:16:58,403 --> 00:17:00,348
Who gives a (bleep) about ironing?

452
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:02,060
I mean, who?

453
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,800
Well, now mother and daughter can learn

454
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,287
all about the joys of starch.

455
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:10,500
Oh, FYI, there's no food in the cafeteria,

456
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,333
by the way.

457
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,687
(muffled shouting)

458
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,229
- [Both] Momoko.

459
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:16,580
- Hurry, Hajime, help me.

460
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,550
- I'll grab her ass.

461
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,383
- No, let me.

462
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:20,189
Oh no, I didn't say.
- You get Maria.

463
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:21,699
- Motoring.

464
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:22,967
- [Hajime] Stop him, my hands are full.

465
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:23,970
- [Satsuki] Hurry, Mom.

466
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,193
I mean, girl.

467
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:27,443
(shouting)

468
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,450
- Damn it.

469
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,423
- Richard Pryor.

470
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,115
- [Leo] Wait, stop!

471
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:40,948
- What?

472
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,686
(screaming)

473
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:48,971
- [Leo] Get some water.

474
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:50,158
- [Keiichirou] Dasani?

475
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:51,273
- Get some water.

476
00:17:51,273 --> 00:17:52,355
Dasani.

477
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:54,259
- Took you long enough.

478
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:56,451
(tense adventurous music)

479
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,254
(grunting)

480
00:17:58,254 --> 00:17:59,087
- Yeah!

481
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:03,491
Patchouli.

482
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:05,873
- Ew, what are you a lesbian?

483
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,450
- Paint paint, dry real quick.

484
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,873
Da Vinci is a big fat dick.

485
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,650
Paint paint, dry real quick.

486
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,211
Da Vinci is a big fat dick.

487
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,673
Paint paint, dry real quick.

488
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:17,171
Da Vinci is a big fat dick.

489
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:18,703
- No.

490
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:19,586
(grunting)

491
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:20,419
No!

492
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:25,303
(tense music)

493
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,760
- Nice job, kid.

494
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,703
- Back at ya.

495
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,410
- [Ray] Hey, what's going on?

496
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,700
- Hey, Ray, sorry I missed ya.

497
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,470
Had to, nevermind.

498
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,017
- Huh, what's going on here?

499
00:18:49,017 --> 00:18:50,530
I heard some loud noises.

500
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,580
Something happened?

501
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,980
- Nothing important.

502
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,290
Listen, I want you to meet this girl

503
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,400
who looks just like...

504
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,390
Where'd she...

505
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,140
She was just here with this other hot...

506
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,280
I mean, let's go find her.

507
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,170
- Hey, wait.

508
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,060
A girl who looks just like her?

509
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,893
Ooh ya.

510
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,440
- I should leave her a tract.

511
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,700
- Well, we could be here awhile.

512
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,520
How 'bout a little menge a trois?

513
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,030
- How about you say one more thing

514
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,560
so disgusting it makes me want to vomit?

515
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,750
Okay, we got to get out of here

516
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,313
because one of you just farted.

517
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,410
- How are we going to get to our own time?

518
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,170
I have youth group tonight.

519
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,610
- Oh, of course you do.

520
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,692
- Jiminy kittens.

521
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:29,610
- Huh?

522
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,033
- Hey, can you hear me?

523
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:33,390
You kids might want to
step back for this one,

524
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,810
it could get a little bit messy.

525
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,210
I'm gonna have to open up a time hole

526
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,055
to get my furry little ass
out of this second rate Wyeth.

527
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:41,563
(shouting)

528
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:45,221
(soft music box music)

529
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:46,409
- Here, hold this.

530
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:48,492
- I don't want this crap.

531
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,853
- I got it at Walmart.

532
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,447
- Oh, no I need to return this.

533
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:55,535
He'll get busted.

534
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:56,604
- Return it?

535
00:19:56,604 --> 00:19:58,169
What the hell are you talking about?

536
00:19:58,169 --> 00:19:59,886
- That's so pretty.

537
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:01,410
Hey, where are you going?

538
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,020
- Hey, we got a painting to catch.

539
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,001
- If I don't, Mom and
Dad may not get married

540
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:05,977
and not have me.

541
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,227
- [Both] What?

542
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:12,263
- Kayako, I can't find her.

543
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,490
Hey, it's my present.

544
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,255
So much for plying her with some bling.

545
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,690
- Kayako will like it.

546
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,039
- Hey.

547
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,710
So you're the chick who looks like Kayako.

548
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,033
Well, hello there.

549
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:32,180
- I think she'll like it

550
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,660
and may I suggest a subscription

551
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,775
to a reputable male nude magazine?

552
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:37,430
If she doesn't start liking you,

553
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,040
she's heading for Rosie
O'Donnell's cruise ship.

554
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,873
- What?

555
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,863
She's in love with a guy named Rosie?

556
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,010
- [Hajime] Satsuki, hurry.

557
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,455
The time holes getting
smaller than Leo's penis.

558
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,653
- I'm coming, damn it.

559
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:50,420
Remember, it's all about the tongue.

560
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,253
Bye.

561
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:52,313
- What do you mean?

562
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,867
Her tongue or mine?

563
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:58,366
(shouting)

564
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:02,046
(soft reflective music)

565
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:04,296
(shouting)

566
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:06,905
- All right.

567
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:07,930
- Hey.
- Satsuki.

568
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,561
- This is no time for smear the queer.

569
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,728
(sobbing)

570
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,542
- There, there Keiichirou,
everything's fine now.

571
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:17,875
You buying this?

572
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,164
- You smell just like Mom.

573
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:21,600
- I just saw her.

574
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,433
Why am I telling you?

575
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:23,540
You'll never get the concept.

576
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,720
- You're right.

577
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,160
- Holy tender vittles.

578
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,960
Mommy's book's got a new edition.

579
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,363
This will bake your muffins.

580
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,840
- It happened November 1st.

581
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,070
This very attractive and mysterious girl,

582
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,010
who looked a lot like me,

583
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,060
helped me put Da Vinci
back to spiritual sleep.

584
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,190
She thought I was attractive.

585
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,277
That is so grossing me out.

586
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,302
I love you, though.

587
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:56,432
(singing in Japanese)

588
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,959
(eerie tense music)

589
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,130
- [Hajime] Momoko, look out.

590
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,880
- [Leo] We're not gonna make it!
