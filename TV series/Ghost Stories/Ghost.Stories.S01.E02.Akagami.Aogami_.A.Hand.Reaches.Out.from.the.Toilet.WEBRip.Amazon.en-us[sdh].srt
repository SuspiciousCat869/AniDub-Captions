1
00:00:00,911 --> 00:00:05,911
(train horn blasts)
(foreboding music)

2
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:06,901
(smoke puffs)

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:09,670
- I can't believe it, they're
destroying this gorgeous land

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,220
for overpriced condos.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,340
A monorail, there'll be
Starbucks, another Walmart.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,840
God, what the hell is
this country coming to?

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,350
I think I'm gonna move.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,840
- What are you city council?

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,100
Shut your yap and get back to work!

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,573
- And the well?

11
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:26,350
You still haven't told me
what we're gonna do with that.

12
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,280
- Whatever, just fill
the hole, hole filler.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,363
- Sure! Jackass.

14
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,225
(air whooshes)

15
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:38,272
(exhaust rumbles)

16
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,462
(soil crunches)

17
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:42,520
(crows screech)

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,337
Oh man, I knew I shouldn't
have had Mexican for lunch.

19
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,403
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!

20
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:49,673
(door creaks shut)

21
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:50,779
(sighs)

22
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:53,560
(ominous laughter)

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,566
- [Demon Voice] Do you want
red paper or blue paper?

24
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:59,321
(ominous laughter)

25
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:00,154
(chimes)

26
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:01,005
(thuds)

27
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:03,172
(screams)

28
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:11,178
(sings in foreign language)

29
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,201
(eastern music)

30
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:44,873
(birds chirp)

31
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,450
- [Satsuki] Dad, Keiichirou,
it's time to eat!

32
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,403
- Well, it's about damn time.

33
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:53,090
- What do you think you're doing, cat?

34
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,600
- [Kaya] I was eating!

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,080
- This is dad's breakfast.

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,059
Yours is right over there, down there!

37
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:00,246
(boings)

38
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,559
- (huffs) I don't think so.

39
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,210
- What you say?

40
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,130
- Listen kid, we need to lay a
few ground rules around here.

41
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,230
I'm not eating cat food.

42
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,270
I'm not chasing mice.

43
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,320
There'll be no collars.

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,020
And if my fur needs to be
licked, you're gonna do it.

45
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,110
Just because you and
your nerd friends turned

46
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,210
my long slumber into this feline nightmare

47
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,550
doesn't mean I have to be happy about it!

48
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,210
- Well, when we did that spell,

49
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,140
I never thought for a
minute you were gonna go

50
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,151
into my cat's body.

51
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:27,279
Get outta my cat, you
fat, stinky, ugly demon!

52
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:30,880
(whimsical music)

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,260
- Let's get something
straight here little missy!

54
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,870
I may be furry, but I
am still Lord Amanojaku!

55
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,913
Which means I still have enough
spiritual power to kill you.

56
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:40,746
(cat hisses)

57
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:42,913
(screams)

58
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:44,930
(fish thwaks)

59
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,900
- Hi.

60
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,300
- Something wrong, Satsuki?

61
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,540
- It's nothing, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,910
Don't worry dad,

63
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,900
I'll fix you something else
for breakfast right away.

64
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,510
- No need to let it go to waste,

65
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,138
how about you just give it to Kaya?

66
00:03:57,138 --> 00:03:58,470
(cat meows)

67
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,441
- Sure.

68
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,080
(feet thuds)

69
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,997
(cat paws patter)

70
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:10,789
What are you doing?

71
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:11,810
Quit following us!

72
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,750
- [Kaya] You two morons are
just walking in front of me.

73
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,880
Watch for dogs.

74
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,490
- Go home, we're going to school.

75
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,270
- [Kaya] Sounds good, I don't
have anything better to do.

76
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,080
- You're a cat now stupid.

77
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,160
- For your information,

78
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,170
I've been haunting that school

79
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,650
before you two blew into town.

80
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,920
- I think he's got a point.

81
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,830
- Don't take his side if you
know what's good for you.

82
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,940
I can't believe our sweet, precious cat

83
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,797
is now possessed by Keebler
Elf reject, with bad gas.

84
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:38,214
(cat growls)

85
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:41,622
(can crunches)
(yelps)

86
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:43,622
(yells)

87
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:48,501
(thuds)

88
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,444
(moans)

89
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:53,177
- That'll teach you to make
fun of me, The Lord Amanojaku.

90
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,890
- This is fascinating.

91
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,590
Even though trapped in a cat's body,

92
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,410
he still possesses ghostly powers,

93
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,420
kinda like David Blaine.

94
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,970
- Save it for the science fair!

95
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,880
- You're just jealous of
my psychical research.

96
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,650
And you know what Harvard's president said

97
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,870
about girls in science.

98
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,110
- You may know about science,

99
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,920
but you don't know diddly about girls.

100
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,340
- I'm just waiting for a
nice Jewish girl, yeah.

101
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,510
- Break it up, ladies.

102
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,100
- Hey wait, shouldn't you
two guys know how to do it?

103
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,400
I mean how to turn Kaya back to normal?

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,457
- [Both] What?

105
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:22,370
- That's right.

106
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,003
You're the psychical
researcher, aren't you?

107
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:26,290
- That is my area of expertise,

108
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,090
but except for a few pale Trekkies,

109
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,840
this is the creepiest thing
I've ever come in contact with.

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,130
- Well then, what good are you?

111
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,850
- You're not coming up with ideas.

112
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,370
- If I could, I would have
said my goodbyes long ago.

113
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,730
- Well, we have learned one thing.

114
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,550
- What did we learn? What did I miss?

115
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,340
- Yes, one thing.

116
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,440
- [Satsuki] What?

117
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,757
- Your light blue Hanes
are total chubb material.

118
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:49,345
(gasps)

119
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:50,761
(thuds)
(laughs)

120
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:53,344
(gentle chime)

121
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,760
- [Satsuki] My name is
Satsuki, it's nice to meet you.

122
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,810
- Friendly greeting once, nice change.

123
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,339
Let's see, let's put you
next to Mr. Aoyama, yeah.

124
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,579
- [Hajime] What?

125
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,730
- What in the hell?

126
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,220
What happened to you?

127
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,310
I got beat up by an
apparition of Gloria Steinem.

128
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,665
- [Satsuki] Who are you
calling an apparition?

129
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:12,956
(class laughs)

130
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,250
- You're in the same class
as your next door neighbor,

131
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,560
that's great, God's great.

132
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,930
- Nothing great about it.

133
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,650
It's just like living
next to Charlie Sheen.

134
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,300
Serious, the real problem is that demon,

135
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,400
it's pulling a Linda Blair with my cat.

136
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,490
I don't suppose you know a good exorcist

137
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,873
or Al Sharpton, do you?

138
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:30,512
- I don't think he's a real reverend.

139
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:32,010
What about your mother's book?

140
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,843
- [Satsuki] Oh!

141
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,660
There was a way to defeat
Amanojaku inside the book.

142
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,810
Maybe there's a way to
get rid of him in here too

143
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,125
and I just haven't found it.

144
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,260
(paper rustles)

145
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,093
- When I met her,

146
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:45,180
she was a homosexual destined
for eternal damnation.

147
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,740
Then she was blessed with
holy power, who knew?

148
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,640
- I didn't know she did either
to be completely honest.

149
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,300
It's weird.

150
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,100
Wait, look here!

151
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,130
If you destroy the object a ghost

152
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,290
in spiritual sleep is occupying,

153
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,620
that ghost will begin haunting again!

154
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,480
- [Momoko] Like a soul
who doesn't know Jesus,

155
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,950
floating without purpose.

156
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,783
- You're right.

157
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,580
However, if you try to put the ghost

158
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,450
back into a spiritual sleep

159
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,280
that ghost will take possession
of a person or animal.

160
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,110
Decide the spot where you will make it go

161
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,770
to spiritual sleep.

162
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,270
If you do not follow this

163
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,010
it will be impossible to
turn the one who is possessed

164
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,830
back to normal until all the ghosts

165
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,273
in the school are put
back into spiritual sleep.

166
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,670
I hate you mother.

167
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,200
- Oh no, the mountain, your
mother was so full of Jesus.

168
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,710
She saved those souls from hell

169
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,650
by banishing them into the forest.

170
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,480
But if the mountain's under development,

171
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,210
then that means they.

172
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,940
- The ghosts, all the banished
ones are going to come back.

173
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,740
(swishes)

174
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,130
- [Hajime] Once again, she's
the one who flashed me,

175
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,330
she's a tease.

176
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,580
And you know what kinda
tease I'm talking about?

177
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,510
- [Leo] Um, can we not
talk about this while I'm,

178
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,040
you know, doing.

179
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
- She's undersexed, that's not my fault!

180
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,740
- She's in elementary school,
of course she's undersexed.

181
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,580
I can relate.

182
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,869
- Other girls at this
school are getting plenty.

183
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:01,580
(stomach rumbles)

184
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,750
Yogurt comin' to get me.

185
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,880
I'm too young to be lactose intolerant.

186
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,070
- You're taking a dump?

187
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,503
- [Hajime] I prefer dropping
the kids off at the pool.

188
00:08:09,503 --> 00:08:11,619
- I've gotta find other friends.

189
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:12,900
(screams)

190
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,733
(blasts)

191
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:16,208
- [Hajime] Holy crap!

192
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,368
(blasts)

193
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:20,535
(screams)

194
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:24,771
(water blasts)
(screams)

195
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,554
(water splashes)
(screams)

196
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:28,242
(water splashes)
(screams)

197
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:29,200
- [Male Voice] What the hell?

198
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,430
- [Second Male voice] Dude,
this is the coolest thing

199
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,363
I've ever seen.

200
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:34,210
- [Satsuki] Oh no.

201
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,550
- Okay kids, I'm a little
fuzzy on the details,

202
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,480
but we've got plumbing problems.

203
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,840
Which means the school
has no running water.

204
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,380
If you need to pee or anything,

205
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,669
just use the one at the
old haunted schoolhouse.

206
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:47,752
(protesting chatter)

207
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,620
Settle down, I was just kidding!

208
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,660
There's no such thing as ghosts,

209
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,440
and don't even think about holding it in,

210
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,710
it isn't healthy.

211
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,203
All your butts will explode.

212
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:02,070
- [Male Voice] What, I can't
believe I'm gonna have to wait

213
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,680
all day to go to the bathroom.
- But there is a Hanako.

214
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,637
- Do you think the teachers know?

215
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:08,983
- Euw, what's that smell?

216
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:12,390
- Hajime may have had a little
accident in the bathroom.

217
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,124
- I'm gonna beat your ass.

218
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:16,541
(feet thuds)

219
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:18,589
(birds chirp)

220
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:21,089
(wood creaks)

221
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:26,076
(door creaks shut)

222
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:27,160
- Too much coffee.

223
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,430
I should've just pissed in the
sink in the teacher's lounge.

224
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,303
No one would've known, or
maybe in Mrs. Hadley's thermos.

225
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:36,710
- [Demon Voice] Do you want red paper?

226
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,940
Or blue paper?
- No way.

227
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,120
I can't believe you're
sinking this low for a joke.

228
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,282
Who is this, Hadley?

229
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:48,615
- [Demon Voice] Do you want
red paper or blue paper?

230
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:52,644
(ominous laugh)

231
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:57,599
(chimes)

232
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:59,976
(screams)

233
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:03,559
(other-worldly screeching)

234
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,336
(whooshes)

235
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:11,086
(class chatters)

236
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,450
- Shut up!

237
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,940
I can hear this class all,
wait, where's your teacher?

238
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,740
- Well, he went to the bathroom.

239
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,240
He went to the bathroom and
he hasn't come back yet.

240
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,000
- It must be a Hanako's curse.

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,630
I saw him, I saw him go

242
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,624
into the old school house's restroom.

243
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:28,390
- Hanako the bathroom ghost got him!

244
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,090
- Get out!
- What?

245
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,080
- It's a ghost.

246
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,430
And you know, you're
behind the conspiracy.

247
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,530
- I'm gonna beat your ass.

248
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,420
- You've been talking
about my butt an awful lot.

249
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
- Calm down,

250
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,340
Hanako the bathroom ghost
is just a superstition.

251
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,880
Now, open your books and
turn a page, whatever.

252
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,497
Now, where's Sakata, better
check the girl's locker room.

253
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:49,493
- What are we gonna do with
(door scrapes shut)

254
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:51,493
this bathroom situation?

255
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:55,413
(bells chime)

256
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,577
(laughs)

257
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,560
- [Kaya] They made fun of the ghost.

258
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,897
That's why he ended up like that.

259
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:04,730
- What?

260
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,800
- You were right kid, your
teacher was attacked by a ghost.

261
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,060
I wonder who the next victim will be?

262
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,950
Oh, could I be so lucky, could it be you?

263
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,210
- Not me cat, all I have to do

264
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,920
is stay away from the bathroom.

265
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,180
I'll just hold it and not drink fluids.

266
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,369
- Three, two, one.

267
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:21,657
(yelps)

268
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:22,590
- Keiichirou?

269
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,900
(indistinct)

270
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,052
What's the matter?

271
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,110
- [Keiichirou] (whimpers) It's cold.

272
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,825
You silly, why didn't you
just go to the bathroom?

273
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:32,742
- Can't go.

274
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,630
(chuckles)

275
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,150
- [Satsuki] You have
your gym clothes, right?

276
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,153
Go change, it'll be all right.

277
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:44,233
(ominous music)

278
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,287
- [Hajime] Hey, where are you going?

279
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:48,550
- Where do you think I'm going?

280
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,920
The old school house!

281
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,660
- Of course you are, gotta be
outta your panty-wearing mind

282
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,493
to go in there.

283
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:54,810
- I think I'm gonna have to.

284
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,190
If we can't use the bathroom,
what are we gonna do?

285
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,400
Plus, I have to find a
way to turn my cat back.

286
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,800
- Not the cat again.

287
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,580
- My mom's book told me how.

288
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,850
If I don't put all the
ghosts back to sleep

289
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,280
then that damn demon will be around

290
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,007
till I graduate from Faster.

291
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:09,860
- Don't do it.

292
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,460
- Don't you worry about a thing,

293
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,220
every little thing's gonna be all right.

294
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,270
- What do you mean by that?

295
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,053
- [Satsuki] Listen to more Bob Marley!

296
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:19,193
- Wait for me!

297
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:23,350
(screams)

298
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,570
- Well, what do we have here?

299
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,880
A class cutter.

300
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,921
All the bigger boys in
detention are gonna love you.

301
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:31,023
- I thought you were
the girl's track coach.

302
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:35,660
(door creaks)
(gasps)

303
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,693
- Here we are again.

304
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,157
- Well, just don't stand there.

305
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:41,694
(water drips)

306
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,080
(feet thuds)
- We're totally

307
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,660
on the same page.

308
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,730
- What?

309
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,649
- [Hajime] Don't be coy with me,

310
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,960
you know what I'm talking about.

311
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,091
Don't make me say it out loud.

312
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,460
- (gasp) You what?

313
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,950
Well, it's just, I don't know.

314
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,650
- I've been holding this in too long.

315
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,230
It's time this came out.

316
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,063
I gotta poop.

317
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,570
- What?

318
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,580
- I was gonna go sneak out

319
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,130
behind the school during lunchtime,

320
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,540
but you know, the whole
paper thing, kinda awkward.

321
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,160
And like the teacher
said, it's not healthy.

322
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,979
I sure don't want my butt to explode.

323
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:13,146
(chimes)

324
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,893
- What was I thinking?

325
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:18,096
I don't even like him that much anyway.

326
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,679
(light buzzes)

327
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,930
Perfect.

328
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,366
- Hey, hold up!

329
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:26,870
(ominous music)

330
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,120
I told you I gotta go.

331
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,860
- Suck it up weeny.

332
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,010
- I bet you're glad I'm
here to protect you.

333
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,300
- You couldn't protect crumbs

334
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,420
from the gang of drunk roaches.

335
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,526
Wait, this could be your
chance, something's coming.

336
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:42,784
(taps)
(creaks)

337
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:44,138
- What?

338
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:49,138
(squelching)
(heart thumps)

339
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:51,322
(screams)

340
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:53,305
(taps)

341
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:54,881
A ghost!

342
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,464
(screams)

343
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:59,131
(intense music)

344
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,826
(screams)

345
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:14,801
(air whooshes)

346
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:17,551
(ghost clatters)

347
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:21,118
- [Satsuki] Are you okay?

348
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:23,768
- Yeah, I can't believe
I'm still holding it in.

349
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:25,130
(hand squelches)
(screams)

350
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,797
(hand scuttles)

351
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,020
This was it.

352
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,331
The place where a Hanako
appeared the other day.

353
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,748
(door thuds)

354
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,873
What is it?

355
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:40,190
- Let's check it out.

356
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,040
It's the fourth door,

357
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,460
the spiritual spot where
Hanako appears from.

358
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,550
- Well, go ahead.

359
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,890
- Excuse me!

360
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,870
- [Hajime] It's the girl's
restroom, I can't go in there.

361
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,703
- [Satsuki] Oh good Lord.

362
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:52,308
(ominous music)

363
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:56,070
(door creaks open)

364
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,849
(boings)

365
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:01,093
Momoko!

366
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:02,960
- [Hajime] What the hell is your problem?

367
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,320
- [Momoko] No problem, what do you mean?

368
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,410
What's going on?

369
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,330
- [Satsuki] Hello, Mr. Sakata was-

370
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,970
- He was attacked by
Hanako the bathroom ghost.

371
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,700
- So that was it!

372
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,300
- So what was what?

373
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,330
- At first I thought I just
had to go to the bathroom

374
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,210
but now I realize it was the Holy spirit.

375
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,570
- Wow, convulsion, that was weird.

376
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,930
Okay, I'm sorry, what are you saying?

377
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,230
You came in here alone?

378
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,230
Are you a moron?

379
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,990
- Yes, but that's beside the point.

380
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,823
- [Momoko] God bless you.

381
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,640
- According to your dead
mother's spook book,

382
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,430
Hanako shows up from the fourth door,

383
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,840
like, let's make a deal.

384
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,860
And hello, doors one
through four are all open.

385
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,000
- Wow, you're right.

386
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,910
- But I cast out Hanako in
the last episode, remember?

387
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,739
Hanako, are you here?

388
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:40,647
- [Ghostly Voice] Yes.

389
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:42,647
(yelps)

390
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,739
(screams)

391
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,406
(ominous music)

392
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,183
- Look I'm on top.

393
00:15:54,183 --> 00:15:56,450
- Shut up, she's saying something, stupid!

394
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,323
- [Momoko] Speak!

395
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,033
- Don't go, don't go in there.

396
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:01,009
Don't go.

397
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:02,514
- [Satsuki] Okay, I
didn't nee to hear that.

398
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:05,133
- [Demon Voice] Do you want red paper

399
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:10,133
or blue paper?
(screams)

400
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,038
- [Hajime] Pull!

401
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:17,595
(thuds)

402
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,938
(ominous laugh)

403
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,797
(hand grasps)

404
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:24,034
(screams)

405
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:24,867
- Hajime!

406
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:25,700
(thuds)

407
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,533
- [Momoko] Ow.

408
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,242
- What in the fizzidy yuk is that?

409
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:29,966
(laughs)

410
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:32,290
- [Kaya] Are we having fun yet?

411
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,485
- [Satsuki] You stupid
cat, what is that thing?

412
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:37,103
- Oh him? He's just Akagami Aogami.

413
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:38,683
- Ikegami Origami?

414
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:41,100
- You've got that damn
book, look it up yourself!

415
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,390
- Look it up yourself, fine.

416
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,958
Akagami Aogami, it is a ghost
who appears from a toilet

417
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,100
and asks if you want
red paper or blue paper.

418
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,933
Gimme a break!

419
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:52,560
- What the hell color
should I ask for then?

420
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,660
- Answer red and blood
will rain from the ceiling

421
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,380
and you'll turn all
red, okay that's gross.

422
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,010
Answer blue and you'll turn blue

423
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,170
because you'll be strangled,
these are our options?

424
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,595
What?
- Lord, God, guide us.

425
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:06,150
- [Demon Voice] Do you want
red paper or blue paper?

426
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,220
- Yellow, I'll take yellow Sharmen!

427
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:14,922
- [Demon Voice] Yellow?

428
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:17,110
- Yeah, yellow, yellow Sharmen.

429
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,320
- Oh God, you're so stupid.

430
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,370
Do I have to tell you kids everything?

431
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,794
You're making it worse when
you ask for another color.

432
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,760
- Huh?

433
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,495
- [Demon Voice] Yellow it is!

434
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:28,556
(door creaks shut)

435
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:29,463
(floor crumbles)

436
00:17:29,463 --> 00:17:30,671
- My God!

437
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:31,873
(screams)

438
00:17:31,873 --> 00:17:32,956
- No, Hajime!

439
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:35,714
Just hang on!

440
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,191
- Hang on, why didn't I think of that?

441
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,623
(dramatic music)

442
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:44,310
- That place is connected
to the spirit world.

443
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,750
If you answer with some
color other than red or blue,

444
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,840
you're toast kid.

445
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,367
You get dragged into the spirit world

446
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,700
and you never come back.

447
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,560
Nice knowing ya.

448
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,083
- Don't just stand there,
do something Satsuki!

449
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,620
- I'm sorry, I'm kinda locked up here.

450
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,050
- I forgot my Bible,

451
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,720
so maybe you should look
at your mother's book.

452
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,763
- Oh yeah.

453
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,710
November eighth, I
discovered Akagami Aogami.

454
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,100
I drew a shinto shrine gateway on a jar,

455
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,030
filled it with water and chanted,

456
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,500
I'll be borrowing your restroom!

457
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,810
And it went into spiritual sleep.

458
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,643
A jar!

459
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:15,800
- God will supply all of your
needs according to his riches,

460
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,730
Philippines 4:19.

461
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,563
- What?

462
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,260
- I'm too young to die.

463
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,810
The only person I've had
sex with is my babysitter.

464
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:25,773
- [Satsuki] Is that it?

465
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,890
Is that good enough?

466
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,723
I failed art.

467
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:29,680
- [Momoko] It's fine!

468
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,513
- Ya think?

469
00:18:30,513 --> 00:18:31,346
What if I shaded it?

470
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:32,480
Maybe drew some cherry blossoms.

471
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,323
- [Momoko] Do it!

472
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,843
- I'll be borrowing your restroom,

473
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:39,827
I'll be borrowing your restroom,

474
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,971
I'll be borrowing your restroom!

475
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,638
(ominous laugh)

476
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:48,004
- (chuckles) You're killing me!

477
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:49,000
- I wish.

478
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,520
- Oh shoot, we need water.

479
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,730
- That's right, the book of spells said

480
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,430
to put water in the jar!

481
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,270
- [Kaya] Where are you
gonna get the water?

482
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,160
The school's plumbing system is broken.

483
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,120
You're gonna have to run to the store.

484
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,070
I really don't think you'll
make it back in time,

485
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,903
but while you're out,

486
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:04,153
pick me up a bottle of Osaka will you?

487
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:06,230
- [Hajime] Will you give me a hand here!

488
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,267
(ominous laugh)

489
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:11,100
(screams)

490
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,420
- Satan, you bastard.

491
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,978
- When I said, give me a
hand, this isn't what I meant!

492
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:17,811
(screams)

493
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:19,119
- Hajime, no!

494
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,343
(air whooshes)

495
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:22,603
(whimpers)

496
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:23,436
Hajime!

497
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:28,476
(spell chimes)

498
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:34,715
(gasps)

499
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,713
- Oh come on!

500
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,272
- I'll be borrowing your restroom,

501
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:40,896
I'll be borrowing your restroom,

502
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:44,203
I'll be borrowing your restroom!

503
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:46,870
I'll be borrowing your restroom!

504
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:57,701
(rock crumble)
(demon groans)

505
00:20:05,048 --> 00:20:06,328
(jar chimes)

506
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:09,275
(paper crinkles)

507
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,192
- Whoo hoo.

508
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:12,610
- Hajime!

509
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,538
- Hey, I can't believe you did it.

510
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:16,993
- Amen, faith moves mountains.

511
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:18,776
- Yeah, yeah.

512
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,167
(groans)

513
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,110
(screams)

514
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,170
- What the hell are you kids staring at?

515
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,718
Go get Hadley!

516
00:20:26,718 --> 00:20:28,268
- [All] You were in the toilet.

517
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:36,260
(birds chirping)

518
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,140
- [Satsuki] So, Hanako didn't
attack Mr. Sakata after all.

519
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,740
- [Momoko] When a stronger spirit appears,

520
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,320
the weaker spirit cowers.

521
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,250
But all evil spirits cower before Jesus!

522
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,600
- [Hajime] Then what about
all the Johns exploding?

523
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,160
- Maybe Hanako was just asking for help?

524
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,440
I mean, she doesn't have a
real estate agent, does she?

525
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,410
- [Leo] Hey, the toilets are fixed now,

526
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,589
but boy are the lines long.

527
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,686
- Euw.

528
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:01,640
- I guess you couldn't
hold it forever, could you?

529
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,038
- I'm gonna beat your ass!

530
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,096
(squeaks)
(chokes)

531
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:09,715
(giggles)

532
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,570
- Hey, there's Kaya.

533
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,140
- Not bad this time,

534
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,760
I was actually betting against you.

535
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,740
Good thing I didn't have any cash on me.

536
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,643
Let's see if you can keep it up.

537
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:19,780
- [Satsuki] Hold it right there!

538
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,110
If I remember correctly,

539
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,800
you wanna get out of that body, right?

540
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,780
If I were you, I'd quit criticizing

541
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,930
and help us put these
ghosts back to sleep.

542
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,233
- Dream on princess.

543
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:30,066
- [Satsuki] Hey!

544
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:31,830
- I'd rather cut off my
left hand, I mean, paw

545
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,298
or die than lend a hand to you brats.

546
00:21:34,298 --> 00:21:36,910
- But, you're already dead, aren't you?

547
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,010
- That's not the point!

548
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,760
Listen to me, I've got nine lives now

549
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,350
and I'm going to use 'em all up dying

550
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,844
to make sure you kids pay
for what you've done to me!

551

552
00:21:45,151 --> 00:21:46,173
(leaves rustle)

553
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:48,160
- Man, it's times like this

554
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,960
I wish we would've got a pet gerbil.

into spiritual sleep
soon, everyone will die!

568
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,313
- [Satsuki] There's a curse

569
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:31,890
on the school fine arts festival.
