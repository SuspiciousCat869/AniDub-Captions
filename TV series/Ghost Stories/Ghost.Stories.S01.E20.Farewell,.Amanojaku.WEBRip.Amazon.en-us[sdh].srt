1
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:04,788
(thunder rumbling)

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,798
(lightning crackles)

3
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:19,548
(fire whooshing)

4
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:34,411
(singing in Japanese)
(upbeat music)

5
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,830
- [Keiichiro] Dad, Dad, can't breathe.

6
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,663
- Sorry, son.

7
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:06,930
I'm just a little tense today.

8
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,630
- The only good thing about
these memorial services

9
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,990
is I get a bitchin' new black outfit.

10
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,480
- Can't wait until I'm remarried

11
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,793
and I can quit going
to these stupid things.

12
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,520
- [Amanojaku] I'm hungry.

13
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,353
- So?

14
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,780
- I like to think of this
as the day we lost a mother,

15
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,370
but we gained a cat.

16
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,350
- Well, I like to think of
this as the day we became

17
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,300
the typical WB sitcom
family with a dead mother.

18
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,980
- I kinda hope Kaya's possessed forever.

19
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,340
- Huh?

20
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,500
- So far I've killed my frog, two gerbils,

21
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,070
16 goldfish, a schnauzer and a dachshund.

22
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,350
This is the only bastard that survived me.

23
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,660
- I wish we could say the same thing

24
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,390
about our little sister, Carrie.

25
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,340
- Good kitty, I hope I never kill you.

26
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,080
- Isn't this sweet?

27
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,540
I'm starting to like you.

28
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,903
This must be the last
and touching episode.

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,903
- [Satsuki] Now that's more like it.

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
- [Momoko] So today's the day

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,300
of your mother's anniversary
memorial service.

32
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,730
- [Satsuki] A lesson in modern perversion.

33
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,580
- So is my mother really
in heaven, Momoko?

34
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,520
- Yes, but you have yet
to embrace your savior

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,580
so it's the flames of
eternal damnation for you.

36
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,153
I, on the other hand, we have
a palace of gold in heaven.

37
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:23,323
- Is that the deal?

38
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,630
- The black crows!

39
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,513
- Adam Duritz.

40
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,513
- Hey, holy shades of Hitchcock!

41
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,650
- [Satsuki] Can I be Tippi Hedren?

42
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,240
- At least we're not ripping
off "The Ring" again.

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,890
- [Leo] Hey!

44
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,930
- Leo?

45
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,370
- There's some weird red fog at the school

46
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,420
and I just saved a ton of
money on my car insurance

47
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,520
by switching to Geico.

48
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,030
- You're high again.

49
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,130
- I'm not high.

50
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,420
- Strike the pose.

51
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,370
- There were some really weird
smoke and that reminds me,

52
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,790
you owe me for half of that bag.

53
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,410
I didn't forget.

54
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,260
- You still haven't reimbursed
me for the swag I got you.

55
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,297
- Hey look, the air is bleeding.

56
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:06,320
(kids gasping)

57
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,990
- Sometimes all I need
is the air that I bleed.

58
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,380
Hey, aren't those the people in our class?

59
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,586
- I think so.

60
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,797
- [Satsuki] Hey, what
the fuck are you doing?

61
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:15,630
- [Hajime] Mr. Sakata!

62
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,330
Everyone in the cast, not a good sign.

63
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,173
- [] I never noticed how buff he is.

64
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,007
- Satsuki, no!

65
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,507
(eerie music)

66
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:27,590
Do you hear that?

67
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,190
They're calling you, Satsuki.

68
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,350
- [Satsuki] No, they're not dammit.

69
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,600
I can't let 'em all die.

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,100
- [Keiichiro] I would!

71
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,390
- Come on Leo.

72
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,573
- No, all right.

73
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,930
- [Keiichiro] It's the last episode,

74
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,763
you'd think they'd help us.

75
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:48,880
- It's the last episode.

76
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,713
Why should they care?

77
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:53,250
- Satsuki, Keiichiro,
something's going on.

78
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,260
- It must be some kind of barrier field.

79
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,100
- [Hajime] Leo, what's happening.

80
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,013
- [Leo] I told you!

81
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:59,700
- [Amanojaku] They just
never get any smarter.

82
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,240
- [Momoko] Satan spawn, what's happening?

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,310
Tell us!

84
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,750
- Oh, fuck me.

85
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,690
Every ghost in the
series is making a cameo

86
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,900
to kill those two.

87
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,550
If these kids ruin me
getting my powers back,

88
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,323
I am gonna be so pissed off.

89
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,583
- Hey!

90
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,710
- [Amanojaku] You'll hurt
your limp wrists, Nancy.

91
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,280
They're in a barrier field, you idiot.

92
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,100
- Yeah, that's what I told him.

93
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,463
- Satsuki, look out!

94
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,700
- [Keiichiro] It's the last episode,

95
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,050
do you think I'm gonna die?

96
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:28,160
- [Momoko] Satsuki!

97
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,110
- No sequel.

98
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,331
Your chances don't look good.

99
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,221
(boy crying)

100
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:33,817
Let's get this over with.

101
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:36,317
(eerie music)

102
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:47,570
(steam whooshing)

103
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,763
- Say, ancient Chinese secret.

104
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:58,645
(knife banging)

105
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:00,521
- What's up?

106
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:08,059
Misono, Aiya, Chow-Yun Fat.

107
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,560
What are you doing here with knives,

108
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,235
coming closer to me?

109
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,939
(girl screaming)

110
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,697
- [Keiichiro] Satsuki!

111
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:18,780
Put her down!

112
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,228
I'll hit you in the nuts.

113
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,929
- [Satsuki] Good suggestion!

114
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:26,512
(kids gasping)

115
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:37,881
- Gotta quit smoking.

116
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:43,141
(ghost cackling)

117
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,104
(kids screaming)

118
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,700
- This is no time for you
to be doing your pilates.

119
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,740
- [Hajime] Move, Mother Mary!

120
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,690
- [Momoko] Heathen!

121
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,073
- That hurt.

122
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,350
- Barrier field.

123
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,660
- Oh just stop.

124
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,030
If it's my old buddy,
Ouma who's back in town,

125
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,850
you kids sure can't get in with a hammer.

126
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,870
- Why thank you.

127
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,830
Who?

128
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,790
- He's very upset

129
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,940
with Satsuki and
Keiichiro's bull dyke mother

130
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,968
so he's making them pay for his slumber.

131
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:11,027
- What's happening?

132
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:12,040
- Uh oh!

133
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,707
(dirt rumbling)

134
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,690
- Oh no you guys, it's
a deadly earthquake.

135
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,543
- No sign of Charlton Heston either.

136
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,933
What? Nothing?

137
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,653
Nevermind!

138
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,710
You kids go home and get
"Earthquake" on Netflix.

139
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,543
- A documentary?

140
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:31,910
- Netflix is so expensive.

141
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,620
- We have to go in and help them.

142
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,232
- Hey, how about no.

143
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:37,042
(kids groaning)

144
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,375
- [Momoko] Oh, just stop it.

145
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,243
- She doesn't look fat.

146
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,763
- What are you two waiting for?

147
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:52,263
- Our boners to go down.
- Our boners to go down.

148
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,738
- What the hell is Funikuro doing back?

149
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:00,738
(suspenseful music)

150
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:04,434
- Mrs. Brolin!

151
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:07,184
(shoes thudding)

152
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:18,550
(girl screams)

153
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,390
- I know that obnoxious voice anywhere.

154
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,501
Come on!

155
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:27,084
(kids gasping)

156
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:30,270
- What is that thing?

157
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,520
- It's either the toilet ghost from ep two

158
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
or Reed Richards!

159
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,630
Hang on, I see a rolled-down door

160
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,168
we've never used before.

161
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:38,751
(bright music)

162
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:46,720
- Where is your God?

163
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,757
- [Momoko] He can't hear you!

164
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,174
(Leo shouts)

165
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:54,920
- What kind of supernatural
phenomenon is this, what?

166
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,287
- Hey, how about we stand here
and stare at it some more?

167
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,037
(kids screaming)

168
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:07,019
(ghosts groaning)

169
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,990
Shades of "Spirited Away".

170
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,823
- [Leo] Right.

171
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,700
- [Satsuki] Did you say Ouma or Oprah?

172
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,040
- It seems like he's
trying to exact his revenge

173
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,360
for being put to spiritual
sleep by your mother.

174
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,193
- Prick!

175
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,420
- Here it is.

176
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,880
Ouma, apparently this
Ouma jerk-off is a demon

177
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,050
who's quite pissed off at me and my family

178
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,700
and wants to make us pay for putting him

179
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,990
and a bunch of other
really unattractive ghosts

180
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,910
to spiritual sleep.

181
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,710
Listen, if we get out of this alive,

182
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,543
I want you all

183
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:42,210
to fact check every
single piece of this book.

184
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,100
I mean it.

185
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,930
She better not have made up one
word or exaggerated anything

186
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,810
because when I go on
Oprah to sell this fucker,

187
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,170
I don't wanna be called
back in a week to be berated

188
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,430
by that holier-than-thou bazillionaire.

189
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,330
You got me?

190
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,740
I mean, I think Fry's an asshole too,

191
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,330
but you think Winfrey
never gilded the lily?

192
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,743
She's in the media for
God's sake and she did coke.

193
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,180
- So this hell-beast Ouma has resurrected

194
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,179
and is now controlling
all of these ghosts.

195
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:12,442
- [Hajime] Ouma, Oprah, Ouma, Oprah.

196
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:13,670
- What am I saying?

197
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,503
Knock it off.

198
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:16,528
She's more powerful than
any demon, love Oprah.

199
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:20,528
(speaking in foreign language)

200
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,760
- We need a lotta shit.

201
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,430
Gotta lay our hands on some torches,

202
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,040
some matches to light it with

203
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,490
and a big bell with a 98-pound clapper

204
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,620
that has been used in 20 years?

205
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,430
Holy Mohammad with a missile.

206
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,590
This is worse than "Supermarket
Sweep", no torches.

207
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,280
- [Hajime] And no bell, ya ding dong.

208
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,630
- We do have a bell.

209
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,390
It's just not on us.

210
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,630
It's above us in the tower.

211
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,693
- Hells bells.

212
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:48,286
(kids screaming)

213
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:50,934
(ghost cackling)

214
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:53,899
- No spiritual powers, eh?

215
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:56,406
What a bunch of pussies

216
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,370
and you know what I do with pussies!

217
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,128
Well, if they're clean,
I'm pretty good at oral,

218
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,211
but that's another story!

219
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:09,701
(girl screams)

220
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:12,867
What?

221
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:14,669
- What are you standing there for?

222
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:15,810
Move your ass!

223
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,437
I learned this from Jessica
Alba in "Fantastic Four".

224
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:19,403
- She's hot, movie sucked.

225
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:22,252
- Maybe, but I could work that
ass till the morning time.

226
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:23,227
You know what I'm talking about, sister?

227
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:25,644
(cat laughs)

228
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:30,327
- You son of a bitch.

229
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:31,947
What do you think you're doing?

230
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:34,380
- Why don't you just take
a flying fuck outta here

231
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,970
and leave me and my little friends alone,

232
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,622
you big, stupid, ugly rock head?

233
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:41,298
- You're getting soft
in your little cat suit.

234
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:44,950
I bet you're starting to
like these flesh bags.

235
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,440
How about you take off your fur coat

236
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,410
and let's get down to business.

237
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,420
- Well, if I wasn't
trapped in this cat suit,

238
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,311
I might take you up on your
enticing little offer, jackass.

239
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,308
- I can tell you're lying

240
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:58,793
but if you wanna fight me on all fours,

241
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:01,732
I'm not opposed to
neutering your new form.

242
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:04,232
(ghost roars)

243
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,253
- Big, slow, and stupid, like usual.

244
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:17,615
There!

245
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:21,201
- God damn colored contacts.

246
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,050
(cat shrieks)

247
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:30,483
Goodbye, kitty.

248
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:41,660
- Oh God, that hurt.

249
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,390
I haven't felt this bad
since Star Jones' wedding.

250
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,833
I got a new gay husband.

251
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:51,380
(door creaks)

252
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,610
- [Leo] Ask not for whom the
bell tolls, it tolls for thee!

253
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,480
Is it just me, or does this look amazingly

254
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,270
like Madonna's "Express Yourself" video?

255
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,490
- [Satsuki] Don't go for second best.

256
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,480
Look for torches!

257
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,170
- [Hajime] Yes ma'am.

258
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,230
- You should pray.

259
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:08,691
Pray real fast!

260
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,010
- Thank God they've got
these torches up here.

261
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,480
It's like, they were
just here waiting for us.

262
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,521
- Shut up.

263
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:18,271
(ghost growling)

264
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,654
(ghost roars)

265
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:28,404
(kids screaming)

266
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,926
- But Kaya!

267
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,823
- I'm sorry, what?

268
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:41,611
When are they even gonna
start subtitling what you say?

269
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:44,192
I can only assume that
you're asking about your cat,

270
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:47,170
and if that's the case, he's
waiting for the taxidermist.

271
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,760
- We did subtitles last ep!

272
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,718
- Yeah!

273
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:51,274
- I'm made of rock.

274
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:52,691
- [Kids] Oh yeah.

275
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:56,803
- Any day now, Satsuki.

276
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,666
Hey, stupid!

277
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:06,298
(ghost screaming)

278
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,040
(bell rings)

279
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,163
- The Taco Bell.

280
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,363
What's that?

281
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:15,817
- Looks like Krakatoa,
you stupid (indistinct).

282
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,043
That's my power!

283
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,680
- Oh, get up.

284
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,013
- Game over, game over, man.

285
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:28,761
- Hey girly, my eyes are up here.

286
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,480
- Why am I doing this?

287
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,630
It's not fate or my character arc.

288
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,800
Oh, well, I'm getting paid for this.

289
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
Just better read the script.

290
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,971
It's a livin'.

291
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:43,388
(cat hisses)

292
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:45,311
(kid gasping)

293
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:46,144
- Hello!

294
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,013
- [Amanojaku] Gangway, move aside.

295
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,820
- Kaya, you're still alive, and green.

296
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,010
- Someone needs to give
serious thought to a pedicure

297
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,515
and Odor Eaters.

298
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,100
- Amanojaku.

299
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,980
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

300
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,823
All of a sudden I'm a big softie,

301
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,250
but it's these kinds of scenes

302
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,860
that Golden Globes are made up,

303
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,030
that Foreign Press
Corps and Academy voters

304
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,140
eat this sentimental shit up.

305
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,180
I'm a whore.

306
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,013
- Oh Kaya!

307
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:18,166
- I'm not Kaya, I'm the great Amanojaku

308
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,628
and I do my own stunts.

309
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,378
(ghost growling)

310
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:24,908
No, no!

311
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:38,767
Thank God, Batman.

312
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:42,893
(kids screaming)

313
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,500
- (indistinct) what's happened to them?

314
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,710
- [Keiichiro] Another pet gone!

315
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,470
- I gotta hand it to him.

316
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,700
I'm a tough son of a bitch

317
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,750
and that scene almost moved me to tears.

318
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,583
- Fag.

319
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,653
Butch it up and get the torches.

320
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,270
It's one thing to mess with me.

321
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,580
It's one thing to pick on my
little brother and my friends,

322
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,930
but don't fuck with my cat!

323
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:09,660
- He's not dead yet!

324
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,010
- When are they ever?

325
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,560
- [Satsuki] He killed my cat.

326
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,110
I haven't eaten all day.

327
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,860
Kinda dizzy.

328
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,580
Steady, Satsuki, you can this.

329
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,480
- What time is it?
- Oh, end this.

330
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:25,257
- Mum!

331
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:28,864
- [Kayako] Satsuki!

332
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,203
Kick his ass!

333
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:44,913
- Damn it, I'm a butch motherfucker.

334
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:50,692
(speaking in foreign language)

335
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,240
- About time.

336
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,826
- Oh evil demon spirit who's made of rock,

337
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:57,939
how 'bout you back the hell
off and just suck my cock!

338
00:16:57,939 --> 00:16:59,321
- You little bitch.

339
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:03,499
I'd go all (indistinct).

340
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,951
- Listen buddy, I've been rethinkin'.

341
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:08,648
A lead character's death
scene should last longer.

342
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,398
Work with me on this.

343
00:17:12,436 --> 00:17:13,605
(bell rings)

344
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:15,965
(demon groaning)

345
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:20,710
- Hey Rocky, still waitin' for
my metaphorical blowjob here!

346
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,210
Yeah, choke on it!

347
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,500
(ghost screaming)

348
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:34,633
- [Amanojaku] A bell, please.

349
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,334
- [Keiichiro] Oh, poor Satsuki.

350
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:40,167
- [Hajime] Drama.

351
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:41,334
- [Leo] Queen.

352
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:47,853
(earth rumbling)

353
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:00,183
- Did I just screw all these kids?

354
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,706
(wind whooshing)

355
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,883
- Look, dead cat.

356
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,055
Fucking A!

357
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:17,310
- [Kids] What?

358
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,810
- [Leo] Bashed, bloody,
but still breathing.

359
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,643
- Oh man.

360
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:22,930
I hope the People for the
Ethical treatment of Animals

361
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,040
never find out how we've
totally fucked this cat.

362
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,210
- I think we're gonna be okay

363
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,060
as long as Chrissy Hine
doesn't hear about it.

364
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,630
- Hey Momoko, let me ask you something.

365
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,350
If Kayo would've died,

366
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,907
do you think his little spirit
would've gone to heaven?

367
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,060
- That's a good question, Keiichiro.

368
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,610
Some Christians believe there
are dogs and cats in heaven,

369
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,644
but I don't think so.

370
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:46,977
(kid cries)

371
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:50,540
A feline Lazarus!

372
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,700
- That's one resilient pussy.
- Happy ending.

373
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,463
- Glad to have you back, Kaya.

374
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:56,640
- [Kids] Huh?

375
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,223
- Hey, where's my talking cat?

376
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,620
- A sound effect.

377
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,180
- The real Kaya.

378
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,480
- So Amanojaku's gone?

379
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,780
- God, in His infinite
mercy, has taken Amanojaku

380
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,641
into his loving, forgiving, bosom.

381
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:12,724
- Well, your God sucks and he's mean!

382
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,946
I want a cat that talks!

383
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:21,247
(kid crying)

384
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,030
(melancholy music)

385
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,140
- [Satsuki] Wish we had the budget

386
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,110
for some really savvy pop song

387
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,520
to go over this montage, but, well,

388
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,070
we ain't "Lost" or "Grey's Anatomy".

389
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,930
Okay, here it goes with the lame score.

390
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,217
Keiichiro never did get
his cat that talked,

391
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,720
Dad wouldn't get another pet
after we've killed so many.

392
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,040
- So if there's one guy and four hookers,

393
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,310
how many years in prison?

394
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,303
- [Satsuki] Mr. Sakata was
arrested for feeling up Aya.

395
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:49,860
Leo replaced Hajime's lube with superglue

396
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,840
and, well, haven't heard
much from Hajime after that,

397
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,800
since his voice changed.

398
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,700
- [Hajime] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,460
She's dead, can we go now?

400
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,090
- [Satsuki] Don't talk to Momoko anymore.

401
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,923
- Where's your brother?

402
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:01,772
He hasn't fallen into
an open grave, has he?

403
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,230
- [Satsuki] Goddammit.

404
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,487
- If I've lost him again,

405
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:06,187
child services are gonna screw me.

406
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,000
- Okay.

407
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,648
- [Reiichirou] Hurry up,
this suit's a rental.

408
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:11,651
- Tight ass!

409
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:14,401
(birds chirping)

410
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,750
There you are, depressing service, huh?

411
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,693
How you doing?

412
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,250
- Better, the doctor upped my dosage.

413
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,319
I feel the Paxil has given me
a zen-like clarity somehow.

414
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,069
(wind whooshing)

415
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:42,548
(kids screaming)

416
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:45,548
(suspenseful music)

417
00:20:52,014 --> 00:20:53,347
- What the hell?

418
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,973
That's it?

419
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,563
Show's over.

420
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:30,934
(cat meows)

421
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,093
- Hey, white daffodils!

422
00:21:38,284 --> 00:21:41,034
(kids laughing)

423
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,730
- [Amanojaku] I'd like to
thank my agent, my manager,

424
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,310
Steven Foster, for writing
such a gay friendly,

425
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,010
but still mainstream script,

426
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,683
that spoke to the...

427
00:21:53,093 --> 00:21:58,093
