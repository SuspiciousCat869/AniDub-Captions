1
00:00:01,789 --> 00:00:03,956
(howling)

2
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:10,646
(barking)

3
00:00:10,646 --> 00:00:12,731
(feet clopping)

4
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:14,898
(panting)

5
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:24,221
(dog growls)

6
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:26,086
(barking frantically)

7
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:28,992
(suspenseful music)

8
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:29,825
(whines)

9
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:32,492
(feet clapping)

10
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:38,348
(whines)

11
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:40,415
(gasps)

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,082
(feet slapping)

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,168
(gasps)

14
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:56,266
(screams)

15
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,766
(splattering)

16
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:05,277
("Grow up" by Hysteric Blue)

17
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:35,560
(ominous music)

18
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:38,962
(lighthearted music)

19
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:41,795
(kids chattering)

20
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:52,390
- Joel Osteen's church wouldn't be

21
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,260
my first choice for vacation.

22
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,820
- If you prefer, we could go
to Praise World in Topeka.

23
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,899
- I'll stick with Knott's
Berry Farm, thanks.

24
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:01,115
(shouts in surprise)

25
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,197
(camera shutter snaps)

26
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:03,030
(moans)

27
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,850
(boys laughing)

28
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,280
- So much for Twyla
Tharp calling your ass.

29
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,532
- I hate you.

30
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:11,640
(speaks foreign language)

31
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,870
Laugh it up.

32
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,510
I'd save the developing
costs, if I were you.

33
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,343
Bam!

34
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,176
For the rest of the semester,

35
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:19,300
it's gonna be bike shorts from Nike.

36
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,937
- Damn it, she's on to me.

37
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:23,590
(sighs)

38
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,700
- It's times like this

39
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,540
that I support the Amish mode of dress.

40
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,680
It is on the plain side,

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,690
but it does curtail adolescent directions.

42
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,763
You do agree with me, right, Satsuki?

43
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,660
- Yeah, for once, I do.

44
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,530
- You know, you transferred
to this school months ago

45
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,860
and you trip over that same
damn step every damn day.

46
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,370
You're kinda like Madonna,
on a sketchy horse,

47
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,550
on her birthday.

48
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,360
- According to my statistical research,

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,700
Satsuki seems to trip often

50
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,041
because of the different
size ratio of her ears.

51
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,852
(chuckling)
Either that, or it's cankles.

52
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:53,304
(boy shouts)
- Just shut up, geek!

53
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:55,650
(crying)

54
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,950
- Don't look now, but it
looks like the short bus

55
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,236
just dropped off its number one passenger.

56
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:01,776
(crying)

57
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:06,555
- Keiichirou, what happened to you now?

58
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:07,878
- Mama!

59
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:10,461
(wails loudly)

60
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,140
- Oh, come on, Keiichirou.

61
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,810
They just took your lunch money this time.

62
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,400
They didn't fold you up and
put you in a locker again.

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,980
- You're such a crybaby, Keiichirou.

64
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,437
That's why they pick on you.

65
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:25,640
You gotta be like Cameron
Diaz and the paparazzi.

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,019
Bam!

67
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,020
(sighs)

68
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,510
- It's not right to teach a
child to respond with violence.

69
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,320
He should follow the example
of our Lord and Savior,

70
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,040
Jesus Christ, and forgive his persecutors.

71
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,260
- Yeah, and take a look
at what happened to him.

72
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,280
- You're not helping.

73
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,620
- Maybe Momoko is right
and you should go Gandhi

74
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,060
and show kindness to your enemies,

75
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,170
and by doing so, turn them into friends.

76
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,310
- You're a fag and he should
join the football team.

77
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,143
- That's it!

78
00:04:51,143 --> 00:04:53,290
The school's sports
festival is coming up soon.

79
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,340
You should try out for the relay race.

80
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,640
- But, but I'm not very coordinated.

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,020
- If you can't learn to fight the bullies,

82
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,047
you can at least learn
to run away from 'em.

83
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:02,887
- I can?

84
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:04,630
- [Leo] Keiichirou, maybe
you have a hidden talent

85
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,297
you don't know about, like
Paris Hilton being an actress.

86
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:08,337
Oh, scratch that.

87
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:11,457
- Isaiah 63:1, "Stride
forward in the greatness

88
00:05:11,457 --> 00:05:13,236
"of His strength."

89
00:05:13,236 --> 00:05:14,636
- You can do it, Keiichirou!

90
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,730
Screw this turning the other cheek crap.

91
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,500
Beef up and kick their asses.

92
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,163
- [Boys] Yeah!

93
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:22,213
(chains clank)

94
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:23,668
- Okay.

95
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:28,660
(comical music)
(panting heavily)

96
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,570
- He's so slow.

97
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,293
Mentally and physically.

98
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,590
And don't get me started
on her performance.

99
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,980
- They're both pretty pathetic.

100
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,790
I'll agree with you there.

101
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,750
Maybe cankles run in the family.

102
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,270
- At this rate, those
bullies will make him

103
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,920
their bitch by noon.

104
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,563
I've got an idea.

105
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:47,410
(chains clank)

106
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,331
Time to go "Great Santini" on his ass!

107
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:52,672
♪ You wanna be an Air Force Ranger ♪

108
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:55,123
♪ You wanna live a life of danger ♪

109
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:57,400
♪ You don't wanna get raped by strangers ♪

110
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,233
Come on!

111
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,066
What are you?

112
00:05:59,066 --> 00:05:59,899
Little sidekick?

113
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,030
Jonathan Brandis?

114
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,275
Ralph Macchio?

115
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:03,738
(yelling indistinctly)
(suspenseful music)

116
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,020
Is that who you wanna be?

117
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,168
You wanna be a catcher or
do you wanna be a pitcher?

118
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,600
You wanna be a pitcher!

119
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,350
A pitcher, a pitcher!

120
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,033
That's it.

121
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,262
That's what I'm talking about.

122
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:17,728
Pump, pump, pump.

123
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:19,895
(panting)

124
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,139
Think of a big black man chasing you.

125
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,222
(shouts)

126
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:29,574
(breathes heavily)

127
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:30,530
Well, he's not racist.

128
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,390
- I guess not.

129
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,627
He's only 0.2 seconds faster.

130
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,470
(groans in frustration)

131
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,200
- Failure's not an option.

132
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,060
Come on, Keiichirou.

133
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,019
Remember Carl Lewis.

134
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,260
- Who?

135
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,430
- [Hajime] On your mark, get set, go!

136
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,452
I said go!

137
00:06:46,452 --> 00:06:48,230
(timer beeps)

138
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,570
- God's holy word is like
water to a dehydrated soul.

139
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,403
- Yeah.

140
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:58,584
(feet slapping)
(foreboding music)

141
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:03,990
Nice ass.

142
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,265
- Do not lust in your,
Jesus, you're right.

143
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:09,070
(wind rushing)

144
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,487
(boy shouts in surprise)

145
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,063
- Who is that?

146
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,773
- Huh?

147
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,910
Wow, Jehovah!

148
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,840
All of a sudden, Keiichirou's
two seconds faster.

149
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,673
- What?

150
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:31,480
(panting)

151
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,383
He was like a rabbit at the dog track.

152
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,410
- Where'd ass boy go?

153
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,488
- Get thee behind me, Satan.

154
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:39,321
Behind.

155
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:42,431
(breathing)

156
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:45,190
(bird chirps)

157
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,600
- All right, looking good.

158
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,240
Jock straps and sport bras in place.

159
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,620
The sports festival starts tomorrow.

160
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,830
Let's give it our best.

161
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,578
Now you kids make me
proud; give me a race.

162
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:57,160
- [Kids] Okay.

163
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,645
- [Coach] Let's go check
out our crappy PE equipment.

164
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,935
(door clanks)

165
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:02,768
(whooshes)

166
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:05,435
(ominous music)

167
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,820
- These flags would make
really pretty decorations.

168
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,230
- What's that?

169
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,272
- What's what?

170
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,939
(ominous music)

171
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,170
(scythe gleams)

172
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,882
Sharpest jai alai thingy I've ever seen.

173
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:22,965
(hisses)

174
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:26,495
(boy screams)

175
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:29,508
(students gasp)

176
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:30,781
Now quit playing around, Timmy.

177
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:33,697
(choking)

178
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,530
Whoa, hey!

179
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,558
That's the ahoga sign!

180
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,167
(shouts)

181
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:40,084
(students wailing)

182
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:43,547
(grunting)

183
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,978
Come on, Kelly.

184
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:48,810
I've seen you-- (kids screaming)

185
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,643
Untie it!

186
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:51,158
Put your backs into it!

187
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:53,325
(screams)

188
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:55,929
(feet clopping)

189
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:56,980
- Oh, my god, what the
hell's happening here?

190
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,813
These are the fastest lip
stops I've ever had to sink!

191
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:03,610
I mean, have you heard
about the sports festival?

192
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,850
- Yes, the sports festival.

193
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,530
That's what this whole episode's about.

194
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,310
- Okay, let's stop
breaking the third wall.

195
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,730
They're thinking about
canceling the sports festival.

196
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,768
- They're what?

197
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:12,601
(gasps)

198
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:13,434
(door slams)

199
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:14,267
- [Principal] What do
you think you're doing,

200
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:15,783
barging in here like this?

201
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,880
- I'm sorry, sir.

202
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,000
Is it true you're going to
cancel the sports festival?

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,833
- You're not competing.

204
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,666
What do you care?

205
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,850
- So it's true, then?

206
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,950
You're gonna cancel?

207
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,650
- Some stupid kid always
gets hurt at that damn thing.

208
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,380
And I thought blind saber-tossing
was such a good idea, too.

209
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,920
- What do we do?

210
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,940
- I know who's really behind this.

211
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,202
- Yeah.

212
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:40,880
Amanojaku.
(groans)

213
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,670
- It's not like you kids have
any athletic ability, anyway.

214
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,612
Besides, the insurance
premiums are killing me.

215
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:48,380
- But--
- But what?

216
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,360
(hand slams)

217
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,790
- You can't cancel the festival.

218
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,320
One little retarded boy has
his heart set on this thing!

219
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,800
Not to mention all the hours

220
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,010
and hours his very
handsome personal trainer

221
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,800
has spent helping the little dweeb.

222
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,633
If you won't think of him,

223
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,890
then consider all the Halo-playing

224
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,620
and monkey-spanking I've sacrificed.

225
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,787
(dithers)

226
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,947
- Smooth.

227
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:13,420
(reflective music)
(feet clopping)

228
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,003
(wind rushing)

229
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:17,849
(feet slapping)

230
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:20,766
(reflective music)

231
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:40,508
- Huh?

232
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:48,800
(suspenseful music)

233
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,978
- [Amanojaku] I have no idea
what you're talking about.

234
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:52,950
- Liar.

235
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,120
You're the only one I know

236
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,490
who would think of strangling
people with national flags

237
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,160
and then tying them up
with tug-of-war rope.

238
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,900
You're like the Marquis
de Sade in black fur.

239
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,623
And thanks to you, the sports
festival almost got canceled.

240
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,320
- But it didn't, did it?

241
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,168
- Not for your lack of trying.

242
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,110
- Exactly.

243
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,237
You can go now.

244
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,786
(groans)

245
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:14,770
(leaves rustle)

246
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,430
- Thank you.

247
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,730
So if the cat is telling the truth,

248
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,130
I guess I better look for other suspects.

249
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,100
(pages rustling)

250
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,464
Right before a school sports festival.

251
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:28,753
(gasps in surprise)

252
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:33,060
Datto, a ghost who only cares
about running really fast.

253
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,900
Because of that, he has a habit

254
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,310
of collecting many runners' feet.

255
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,650
Collecting feet?

256
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,610
What the hell is she talking about.

257
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,623
- All that running and now I'm
going to have to walk home?

258
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:46,148
Huh?

259
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:48,815
(ominous music)

260
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,710
(feet clopping)

261
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,030
Pardon me?

262
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,140
I really enjoyed running with you today.

263
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,780
Don't you have any money for shoes?

264
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,790
Did the Crips beat you
up and take yours too?

265
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,360
They took mine and now my dad

266
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,473
only buys me cheap ones from Payless.

267
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,150
But enough about me.

268
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,420
Are you a student here too?

269
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,450
I haven't seen you.

270
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,850
Must be night classes.

271
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,350
You're kinda pale.

272
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,690
- My friend.

273
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,790
- Who?

274
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,990
- A long time ago, I had a friend.

275
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,090
He was at the elementary school.

276
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,050
- Must be nice to have a friend.

277
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,653
Everyone here hates me.

278
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,873
- He died, though.

279
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,780
- Oh, sorry.

280
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,883
Suicide?

281
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,600
- In a traffic accident.

282
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,000
It was on the news.

283
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,920
- Fox, I bet.

284
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,737
- But the sad part isn't
that he was killed.

285
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:45,570
- No?

286
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,993
- It's that he couldn't
run in the sports festival.

287
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,639
Actually, he wasn't a very
good runner, kinda like you.

288
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,267
(introspective music)

289
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:57,650
But he gave it everything he had

290
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,870
until he got blisters
on his feet and corns,

291
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,760
fallen arches, disgusting, really.

292
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,030
And still he kept
practicing, running faster.

293
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,047
And then, on the morning
of the sports festival--

294
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:13,847
(engine roaring)

295
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:14,680
(tires squeal)

296
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,562
Bam!
(metal crunching)

297
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,532
All he wanted to do was run.

298
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,852
- Bummer.

299
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:23,772
Hey!

300
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,813
Not a very motivational speech.

301
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:30,602
(fireworks booming)

302
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:35,602
(audience applauding)
(regal music)

303
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,380
- [Announcer] The morning's
events have now concluded.

304
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,620
Following a lunch break,

305
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,350
we'll begin the afternoon
program at one o'clock.

306
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,183
- [Satsuki] Here.

307
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:46,791
The malt liquor mascot.

308
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,910
- Datto?

309
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,560
- From what mom says, he's
a bull with a foot fetish.

310
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,470
- Oh, dear Lord.

311
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,400
- So that's what happened this morning,

312
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,083
with the crazy PE equipment.

313
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,240
- Yeah, probably.

314
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,653
But get this:

315
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:02,957
"On the day of the sports festival,

316
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:05,637
"at 4:44 p.m., the person running

317
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,567
"in lane four will have
his feet chopped off

318
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,370
"at the fourth corner."

319
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,593
- Oh, dear Lord.

320
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,370
- But the sports festival
ends at three o'clock.

321
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,863
Can't the ghost tell time?

322
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,670
- You're right.

323
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,890
But if there is a ghost here,

324
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,270
I need to catch it and
put it to spiritual sleep.

325
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,090
- Yeah, but we don't even know
what the ghost looks like.

326
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,923
(foreboding music)

327
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:25,920
- Something about that boy

328
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,650
from the other day is bugging me.

329
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,000
- You mean that he was
pale, almost transparent,

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,170
with red eyes?

331
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,290
- What do you think?

332
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,251
- What does bootylicious mean?

333
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,370
(water pouring)

334
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,620
- You leave my friend alone.

335
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,340
He's not a ghost; he's got vitiligo.

336
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,120
- I do have to say he looked a lot better

337
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,950
in a track uniform than this dude.

338
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,986
- [Keiichirou] That's
what I'm telling you.

339
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:46,819
(thunder rumbling)

340
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,652
It's not him.

341
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:48,485
(foreboding music)
(water dripping)

342
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:51,318
(thunder rumbles)

343
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,097
- Of course.

344
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:54,930
- Not rain.

345
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,030
(water sprinkling)

346
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,863
- [Announcer] Because of the rain,

347
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,930
will all children please
go with their parents

348
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,129
and guardians to the
gymnasium for the time being?

349
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:07,129
(thunder cracks)
(foreboding music)

350
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,446
- Looks like the sports festival's over.

351
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,529
(grunts)

352
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,820
- At this rate, everything's
gonna get pushed back.

353
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,653
- To 4:44.

354
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,970
- Hey, principal.

355
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,090
- Oh, god, not you again.

356
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,290
Leave me alone.

357
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,540
If the rain stops, your
little brother can fulfill

358
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,610
his Bruce Jenner dreams.

359
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,443
Now go away.

360
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:32,680
- Change of plans, chief.

361
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,485
You have to cancel the festival.

362
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:35,770
- What?

363
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,700
You're the one who nagged me for this.

364
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,533
- Hold on.

365
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,120
Gimme a sec.

366
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,610
But this hurricane!

367
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,443
What are we gonna--?

368
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:44,000
- Do you know what these
parents would do to me

369
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,100
if we canceled?

370
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,680
I'd have to hear about
little Billy and Suzy,

371
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,130
and there's not enough booze in my office.

372
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,430
- Billy and Suzy are not in lane four!

373
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,361
You have to cancel this damn thing now.

374
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:55,194
(ominous whooshing)

375
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:56,576
- Hey look, it stopped.

376
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,967
- What?

377
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:58,800
(students cheer)

378
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,777
- [Coach] Oh good, the sun's come out.

379
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:04,880
♪ The sun's come out tomorrow ♪

380
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,763
- It's been pushed back 30 minutes.

381
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,210
It'll end by 3:30, so it looks like

382
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,020
your brother's gonna live, after all.

383
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,303
- Mm-hmm.

384
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:14,980
(whistle blows)

385
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,200
- [Announcer] Will all participants

386
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,480
in the first years'
foot race please gather

387
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,191
at the entrance gate?

388
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,730
(crowd chattering)

389
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,210
- All right, Keiichirou, you're on.

390
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,150
Make me proud.

391
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,235
- Remember, you're a pitcher.

392
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,068
- Right!

393
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:32,272
(foreshadowing music)

394
00:16:39,356 --> 00:16:41,980
(girl screams)

395
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,385
- Hey, Satsuki!

396
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:46,384
(eerie music)

397
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:48,801
(wind howls)

398
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:50,975
- Hello?

399
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:52,940
- What are you doing?

400
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,357
- Satsuki.
- What's happening?

401
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:58,550
- I saw him come in here.

402
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,090
- You're hallucinating;
the place is empty.

403
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,923
- He's right.

404
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:05,993
- (gasps) Keiichirou's big
race is just about to start.

405
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:08,225
- Oh, yeah.

406
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,170
(metal screeches)
(door slams)

407
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,415
- No!

408
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:13,463
It won't open!

409
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:14,423
- [Leo] What the hell?

410
00:17:14,423 --> 00:17:15,974
- [Momoko] When God closes a door--

411
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:18,339
(students shout)

412
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,561
(grunting)
(banging on door)

413
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,540
- How could I have been so blind?

414
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,902
This must've been Datto's
evil lair the whole time.

415
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,350
(screams)
(gasping)

416
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,602
Look, by the box with sporting balls.

417
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:34,419
- I'm going to take that boy's feet?

418
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:35,260
(retches)

419
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,750
- So you are Datto.

420
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,155
You're an ass!

421
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:41,072
(laughs ominously)

422
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,670
Let us out, you ass!

423
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,883
- Why are you trapping us in here, anyway?

424
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,780
- Because you're in my way.

425
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,820
Duh.

426
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,843
- He's got a point.

427
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,813
- He does.

428
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:55,335
- [Announcer] Program number 20 is

429
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:58,216
the first years' foot race.

430
00:17:58,216 --> 00:17:59,299
- Keiichirou!

431
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,473
- Don't worry.

432
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:04,230
We've got a long way
to go until curse time.

433
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,290
- Yeah, you're right.

434
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,490
- [Amanojaku] Oh, is he?

435
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,115
- [Satsuki] Amano-jack-off!

436
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:14,726
- Got the time?

437
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,736
(screaming)

438
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:18,569
- Oh, for the love of Pete.

439
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:21,203
4:44 meant the clock
at the old schoolhouse.

440
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,620
- Get set.

441
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,709
Is this thing loaded?

442
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,709
(students cheering)

443
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,027
- (grunts) Keiichirou, stop!

444
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:32,860
(screaming)
(pounding)

445
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,527
(frantic music)

446
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,067
- It's no use.

447
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,333
- Leave him alone, ass.

448
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,559
Leave him be!

449
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,479
Keiichirou believes in you.

450
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,791
Doesn't it mean anything to you

451
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,142
that one lonely little
retarded boy looks up to you?

452
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:51,116
I suggested Jesse Owens,
but did he listen to me?

453
00:18:51,116 --> 00:18:51,949
No!

454
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:54,203
(laughs wickedly)

455
00:18:54,203 --> 00:18:55,953
- I'll take his feet.

456
00:18:57,174 --> 00:18:58,007
- Set.

457
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,891
- Keiichirou!

458
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,105
(gun fires)
(crowd cheers wildly)

459
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,684
(panting)

460
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,851
Open the door!

461
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,313
- Why do you need me, Hebrew?

462
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,873
Can't you read any faster?

463
00:19:09,873 --> 00:19:12,303
- I'm not choosing people.

464
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:15,053
(crowd cheering)

465
00:19:16,964 --> 00:19:19,297
(whooshing)

466
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:21,524
- (shouts) Please open!

467
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:23,700
Open! (shouting)

468
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,983
- [Hajime] Satsuki, stand back!

469
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,683
- What?

470
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:28,052
- We'll use my big pole.

471
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:29,794
- Good one.

472
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,831
- What?

473
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:33,252
(groans)

474
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:34,922
(crashes)
(grunts)

00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:36,843

(panting)
(dramatic music)

478
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,470
(gasps)

479
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,812
- It's the fourth corner!

480
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:52,372
- I hate those who run.

481
00:19:52,372 --> 00:19:53,791
I hate those who run.

482
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,402
I hate those who run!

483
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,532
(panting)

484
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:00,199
(feet clopping)

485
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:05,370
- Hey, I didn't know you
were entered in this race.

486
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,270
Or did you come just to cheer me on?

487
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,103
- [Datto] No.

488
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:10,120
- Oh, okay.

489
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,330
Well, it doesn't matter,

490
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,770
'cause I'm gonna win first place

491
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,933
just for your dead friend.

492
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:18,034
- [Satsuki] Keiichirou believes in you.

493
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:19,372
Nice ass.

494
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:21,663
Keiichirou believes in you.
(shouts in pain)

495
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:22,496
Nice ass.

496
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:27,917
(metal screeching)

497
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,167
(grunting)

498
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:34,930
(gasps)

499
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,611
- I just, I just wanted to run.

500
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,944
(whooshing)

501
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,061

503
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:51,121
(upbeat music)

504
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:52,313
- A car accident.

505
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,300
Must've been hit by an old Chinaman.

506
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,893
I don't mean to be racist,
but those people cannot drive.

507
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,943
- I know.

508
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,813
But that's beside the point.

509
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:06,643
I think he was lonely.

510
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,160
- After all that training,

511
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,973
you're still such a little bitch.

512
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:15,360
- But for a ghost, Datto
wasn't such a bad guy.

513
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,195
- Yeah.

514
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:17,028
Weren't you the one checking out

515
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:18,860
his butt at the track the other day?

516
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,730
- You can shut up, narc.

517
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,080
- [Leo] No, it's okay.

518
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,450
I mean, he had a nice butt.

519
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,470
Even I noticed.

520
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,303
It's okay.

521
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:27,250
- [Satsuki] Just drop it!

522
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,860
- [Leo] I don't know why
you're ashamed about it.

523
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,730
You're a butt chick.

524
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,623
I don't mind.

525
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,743
- What are you doing?

526
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,133
- Datto can have it.

527
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,717
The pin keeps sticking my nipple.

528
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:39,736
Here!

529
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,773
(whooshes)

530
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:44,023
(twinkles)

531
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:46,312
- [Kids] Aw!

532
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:53,716
Little bitch.

533
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:58,342
("sexy sexy" by CASCADE)

534
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:25,610
(eerie music)

535
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,680
- [Ghost] Children shouldn't
go outside on nights

536
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,070
when they're all alone.

537
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,560
Children shouldn't open the door

538
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,260
on nights when they're all alone.

539
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,563
On nights when children
are all alone, I come.
