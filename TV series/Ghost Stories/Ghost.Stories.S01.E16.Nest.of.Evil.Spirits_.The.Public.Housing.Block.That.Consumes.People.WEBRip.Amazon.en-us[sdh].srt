1
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:05,160
(birds squawking)

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,520
- Have you men noticed

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,100
how huge my box looks
in these new uniforms?

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,080
- Well, that's nice to know.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,820
Now, let's just remember to be careful

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,150
about the surrounding land.

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,570
- But how did just this
block of public housing

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,750
remain un-demolished?

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,540
Aren't there people living here?

10
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,330
- Hurricane Katrina evacuees.

11
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,480
They're never going to leave.

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,200
- What? What are you saying?

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,040
- No, I'm just messing with you, buddy.

14
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,090
The only residents who
live there are ghosts.

15
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,400
Place is haunted.

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,920
They tried to demolish
it, but strange accidents

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,010
always seem to keep
that building standing.

18
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,330
- You kinda sound like you've been

19
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,260
hanging around my daughter lately.

20
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,950
I'm not so much worried about ghosts

21
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,340
just how much your crew
drinks on the job. Sober up.

22
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,582
- [Worker] You're the boss.

23
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:45,520
- I can't believe people
would even believe in

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,923
something as stupid as-

25
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,923
(gasps)

26
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,333
- Look out, Ted!

27
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,240
- Hey, are you all right, man?

28
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,120
- I'm fine.

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,810
I know Jim Adler is your brother-in-law,

30
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,920
but why didn't you move? Huh?

31
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,815
- Did you see it? That girl.

32
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,430
- Huh? What are you talking about?

33
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,640
There's nothing there but poles,

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,740
and I don't mean people from Poland.

35
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,440
- But someone was there.
She was smiling at me.

36
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,800
- [Worker] Oh, stop it. Stop it!

37
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,810
- [Boss] See what I mean? Drinking.

38
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:21,242
(upbeat music)

39
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:25,075
(singing in foreign language)

40
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:53,395
(spooky music)

41
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,310
- Your dad's in the hospital again?

42
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,880
Have you never heard of Hazelden?

43
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,248
- Shut up.

44
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,970
(Keiichirou screams)

45
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,370
- Dear Lord, I'll pray for him.

46
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,720
- Dad finally got a job
working for the government

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,140
tearing down public housing

48
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,353
and putting up Starbucks franchises.

49
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:14,792
(Keiichirou screams)

50
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:15,625
- Dad!

51
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:24,190
(ambulance sirens blaring)

52
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,750
- He had an extreme high fever,

53
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,350
and we took him to the emergency room.

54
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,810
But he didn't have insurance yet,

55
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,927
so he had to go to county.

56
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:33,890
Well, then this intern tells us-

57
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,900
- [Intern] I just started here.

58
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,580
I can't read this chart,
but whatever it is,

59
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,483
they wrote a lot.

60
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,570
- Well, I got that loser fired,

61
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,470
and finally found
someone who could tell us

62
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,720
what the hell was going on with my dad.

63
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,040
Seems everyone who worked at that one site

64
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,430
came down with a mysterious
and deadly high fever.

65
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,630
- The haunted hood projects.

66
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,700
We psychical researchers know
about that building well.

67
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,860
It's killed many people in this city.

68
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,660
Your father is probably one of them.

69
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,310
I don't see him making it
through this episode alive.

70
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,440
- [Hajime] Oh, good job, Leo.

71
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,201
- [Leo] What? It's in the script.

72
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,034
- Oh no.

73
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,490
- Oh, he's probably just
got alcohol poisoning.

74
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,740
He'll be back home and
drunk again in no time.

75
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,280
- We have to try to save him.

76
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,320
- If we banish the spirits
of the haunted projects,

77
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,760
Illich- I mean your father,

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,430
may make it to the closing credits.

79
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,120
Yes! That's a great idea.

80
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,911
I think I'm getting a little stiffy.

81
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:22,961
- Thank you everyone!

82
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,933
- Just leave it to us.

83
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,480
- So that's where the minorities live.

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,430
- I'm going to get beat up, aren't I?

85
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,730
- Probably more like robbed and sodomized.

86
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,133
- What a dump.

87
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,880
- I feel sorry for poor people.

88
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,690
- It looks like the West Bank.

89
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:46,227
- What are we going to
do? We can't get in.

90
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:48,930
- "Keep out?" That
never stopped my people.

91
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,550
- So much for that.

92
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,450
- What? So much for what?

93
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,870
- Never let a sign stop you
from illegal activities.

94
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,223
We'll just hop the fence.

95
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,480
- Hey!

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,140
It's dangerous. You can't go in there.

97
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,050
Read it. Says so right here.

98
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,740
Keep away.

99
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,550
- Sorry. I can't.

100
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,330
- You have to let us inside, sir.

101
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,830
- Or my dad's gonna die.

102
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,009
- I've already lost a mother.

103
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,819
You know what my therapy bills are?

104
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,614
- Where is your right wing Christianity?

105
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:18,281
You have to help us.

106
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,770
- Well, if you could put it
that way. For Ron Holden.

107
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,880
But it's an old building,
and it's dangerous.

108
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,880
Crack addicts, whores, maybe
Todd Bridges on skates.

109
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,800
What do I say? You can't go in there.

110
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,723
Get lost. Keep away.

111
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:38,640
(Keiichirou cries)

112
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,213
- How are we going to
break this to Illich?

113
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:42,130
- Geez. What a jackass.

114
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,270
And did you see the way
he was looking at Satsuki?

115
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,050
It almost made me think
he was going to be cool.

116
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,200
- The righteous man is
rescued from trouble,

117
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,810
says Proverbs 11:8.

118
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,520
Looks like your alcoholic, unsaved father

119
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,030
is going to die. Sorry Satsuki.

120
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,350
- What are we going to do if
that guy doesn't let us in?

121
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,460
- Don't worry, Leo. I
have a foolproof plan.

122
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,720
We'll all meet back here
and bust in tonight.

123
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,553
- Tonight?

124
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,343
- Why are we doing this again?

125
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,950
- Oh, what's going to happen?

126
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,600
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot
what show we're doing.

127
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,690
- Yeah.

128
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,870
- What's the matter?

129
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,460
- Hey, wait a minute.

130
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,700
Shouldn't we be able to see

131
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,730
the haunted housing block from here?

132
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,900
- This is not good.

133
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,540
- [Hajime] Guess your dad is good as dead.

134
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,000
- [Momoko] Yes, that's what I said.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,110
- Could we have gone the wrong way?

136
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,483
- Could you possibly be
any more of an idiot?

137
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,970
- These people are poor. No streetlamps.

138
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,620
- God rewards the righteous.

139
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,570
That's why me and my family are loaded.

140
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:38,341
- What the-

141
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:39,633
Damn she's got big feet.

142
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,373
- They at least dress nice here.

143
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,000
- Satsuki, look over there!

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,050
- [Hajime] She's hot.

145
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,943
- Oh no! She's going to kill herself!

146
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,640
- Well, she is poor.

147
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,756
- Yeah!

148
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:58,423
(intense music)

149
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,683
- Dammit Jim!

150
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:04,723
- Come on, we're going to
have to take the stairs.

151
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,930
- Now I know why poor
people bitch all the time.

152
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,730
- I'd hate to be having to
be carrying all those babies.

153
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,277
- If they have to take the
stairs like this every day,

154
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:21,577
why are they all so fat?

155
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,940
- I saw "Super Size Me,"
it's the French fries.

156
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,230
- We need to find someone
to call the police.

157
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,170
Although they're probably
used to getting calls

158
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,583
like that from this place.

159
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,000
- There! The one that paid their bill.

160
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:39,596
(tense music)

161
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,690
- Any day now, welfare Willie.

162
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:53,410
- Go away. What do you want?

163
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,870
- Look, Papa, someone's
going to kill herself.

164
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,700
- Hey, did you pay your phone bill?

165
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,950
- Yeah, but I'm stealing my cable.

166
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,530
- We need to stop one
of your poor neighbors

167
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,020
from killing herself. Help us please!

168
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,853
- So what?

169
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:07,337
Those who want to die should
be able to if they want to.

170
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:08,540
- [Hajime] But this chick's hot.

171
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,430
- If I were you, young fellow,

172
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,430
I'd spend less time worrying
about her and more about you.

173
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:18,857
(man cries)

174
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,000
- Perfect, he's gay.

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,580
- I did notice he looked
at me quite enticingly.

176
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,470
- Probably the Republican
mayor of Spokane.

177
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,440
- Come on, if I save her,

178
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,540
there's no way she wouldn't sleep with me.

179
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,343
- Stay here. Momoko, don't
let the closet mayor get him.

180
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:40,359
(dreamy music)

181
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,577
(Satsuki screams)

182
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:48,910
The poor lady jumped, and our eyes met!

183
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,743
She smiled and she looked right at me!

184
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:52,345
- Why do you always have to
be the center of attention?

185
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,307
- I'm the lead!

186
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:56,050
- Maybe she just bounced.

187
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,580
- She wasn't that fat.

188
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,930
- Looks like things are
picking up around here.

189
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,580
- What are you doing
here? Nobody invited you.

190
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,660
- It's dinner time and
you didn't feel my dish.

191
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,493
And I'm hungry.

192
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:09,500
I tried the cabinet, but
I'm as good with door knobs

193
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,840
as the aliens and signs.

194
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,315
But this, watching this
might be even tastier.

195
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:15,387
- What do you mean?

196
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,720
- Listen to me, Black Morris.

197
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,400
If you know what's going
on here, you better spill.

198
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,260
- You're not very bright, are you Haji?

199
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,410
You've been sucked in by this

200
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,060
good time looking housing project.

201
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,320
- [Momoko] We never found
the haunted housing projects.

202
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,120
- [Hajime] Yeah, this place
isn't haunted. It's just poor.

203
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,653
- Really? Then check out that place again.

204
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,830
- The light's out!

205
00:09:35,814 --> 00:09:37,763
- I thought for sure he'd lock his door.

206
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:42,794
(spooky music)

207
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:44,080
- What is it?

208
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,730
- We know he doesn't have a maid.

209
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,570
I'm glad I'm saved and blessed.

210
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,600
Poor people are disgusting.

211
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,113
- [Hajime] I told you.

212
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,963
- These aren't your
normal apartments, kids.

213
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,025
These are the projects
of the haunted hood.

214
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:02,900
You feel me, bitches?

215
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,110
- Yeah I hear you, you stupid cat.

216
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,180
- That woman was just
a trap to lure you in.

217
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,270
- We gotta get outta here!

218
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,903
- Dyn-o-mite!

219
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,000
- What the hell is going on?

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,122
- This staircase never ends! WTF?

221
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:19,517
- Look, numbers.

222
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:21,780
We came from the 11th floor,

223
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,210
and this is making sense
to me. And I'm dyslexic.

224
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,521
- You're right, Keiichirou.

225
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:28,354
- I gotta take five.

226
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:29,810
- I'm so tired.

227
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,130
- Probably tired from
whining all the damn time.

228
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,940
- We can't use the elevator either?

229
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,923
Where our wings as Eagles?

230
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,170
- Keiichirou, will you
do it for a scooby snack?

231
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,090
- Can I share something with the class?

232
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,923
- [Satsuki] What?

233
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:45,240
- Don't you all feel just
a little bit different?

234
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,200
Less Jewish, perhaps?

235
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,363
- Just a little tired.

236
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,666
- Leo!

237
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,592
- Leo!

238
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,423
- Leo!

239
00:10:58,413 --> 00:10:59,246
- Leo!

240
00:11:00,157 --> 00:11:02,824
(ominous music)

241
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,930
- The situation has
brought him to his knees.

242
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,790
He's accepting Jesus!

243
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,810
- Hallelujah.

244
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,973
- Hey, get up, you stupid
jerk. Let's get outta here.

245
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,233
Come on!

246
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:17,040
- Leo?

247
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,332
- Not giving you mouth to mouth. Get up.

248
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:20,332
- Not in the spirit.

249
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,053
- He's a little stiff, and not Leo.

250
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,153
Oh my God, Leo's a mannequin!

251
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:38,105
(intense music)

252
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:42,326
(Keiichirou cries)

253
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,773
Everyone, stay still.

254
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:57,629
Change of plans.

255
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,157
(intense music)

256
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:06,855
(door creaks)

257
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,950
- Hey, that one looks like Kim Cattrall.

258
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,138
- Would you all like to accept Jesus now?

259
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:25,721
- Sure, sign me up!

260
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:30,355
- Hajime!

261
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:32,823
(Hajime screams)

262
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:34,623
- What the hell are you waiting for?

263
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:41,980
- Keiichirou!

264
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,649
(Keiichirou screaming)

265
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:45,580
I can't understand you.

266
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,687
- Dammit, always in the wrong.

267
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:53,063
- Hajime! Keiichirou!

268
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,661
- [Keiichirou] Satsuki! Satsuki!

269
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:57,411
- Hajime! Keiichirou!

270
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:03,938
Hajime? Keiichirou?

271
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,183
- Are you okay?

272
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,230
- What do I do?

273
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,920
My mother's gone, my father, Keiichirou.

274
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,753
We won't-

275
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:21,521
(Satsuki screams)

276
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:23,010
- Don't cry, Satsuki.

277
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,933
Maybe, before they were killed,

278
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,741
they had a moment to turn to Jesus.

279
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:28,676
- [Satsuki] Go to hell.

280
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:29,700
(Satsuki crying)

281
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,918
- You hear that?

282
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:32,431
- [Satsuki] What?

283
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:34,764
(footsteps)

284
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:39,410
Keiichirou, Hajime?

285
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,150
- Can you not even count?
That's only two feet.

286
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,063
I swear, I have to do
everything for you stupid kids.

287
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,330
- Could it be Leo?

288
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:51,830
(man groaning)

289
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:04,522
(man farts)

290
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,727
You can do it!

291
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:09,910
- I made it.

292
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,830
- You're saying you believe us?

293
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,200
- Afraid I do, kid.

294
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,013
- Do you believe this place
is haunted by the unsaved?

295
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:18,120
- I guess you're right.

296
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,953
But at first I thought they were

297
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:20,720
just bitter environmentalists.

298
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,553
- What?

299
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:24,690
- [Man] The energy of
the earth, earth veins.

300
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,130
Hey, put it this way. That
ortho (beep) really works.

301
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,440
- Have you never seen the
Home and Garden Network?

302
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,429
- You think I can afford cable?

303
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,880
I didn't know what I was
doing. I was new on the job.

304
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,690
You kids need to get outta here quick.

305
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,683
- You did this? Well
then where is everybody?

306
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:41,663
Where's my little retarded brother?

307
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,303
- He's here, trapped with
the other poor bastards.

308
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,870
I'll take care of it.

309
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,650
- Against my better
judgment I'll go with you!

310
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,940
- No, you save yourself!
And I'm kind of lonely.

311
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,320
You shouldn't get too close.

312
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
- Okay.

313
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,900
- You can change your mind if you want to.

314
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,333
- Just a moment, please.

315
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,790
If you know the ghost's
name, wouldn't you please

316
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,923
be kind enough to tell us what it is?

317
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,313
- Soma.

318
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,353
- Well, thanks.

319
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:16,300
Satsuki, what are you
waiting for? Get the diary.

320
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,133
- Right.

321
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,400
August 10, Soma appeared
at Bridgit's house.

322
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,860
Apparently this is a rare Feng Shui ghost.

323
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,090
And the earth has varicose
veins, like Bridgit. Gross!

324
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,430
In order to make Soma
go to spiritual sleep,

325
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,800
you need to make a doll
into a spirit receptacle,

326
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,580
and then chant a spell in the middle

327
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,110
of the earth's varicose vein.

328
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,050
But unless you patch up the disturbance,

329
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,070
a new Soma will take its place.

330
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,910
You're kidding me.

331
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,410
That means this is just a temporary fix?

332
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,653
- Sorry, but your mother was just a bitch.

333
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,560
- Come on, you dumb cat.

334
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,790
- Why do I have to go with you?

335
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,350
What are you looking at me
for? You didn't even feed me.

336
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,920
Why should I do you a favor?

337
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,820
This little black pussy
staying right here.

338
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,653
- Bye!

339
00:15:58,653 --> 00:15:59,620
- Yeah, screw the cat.

340
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,653
- Good luck, chump.

341
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,617
- Let's look for a doll to
use as a spirit receptacle.

342
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:11,820
- Right. But they're poor.

343
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,693
Look for a flour sack, or
something with a diaper on it.

344
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:21,318
- Let's play. Let's play.

345
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,374
Hey. Hey, you there.

346
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:35,607
(Momoko screams)

347
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:38,368
(ominous music)

348
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:41,618
- Found one! It's ugly, but I found it.

349
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,294
Where'd you go? Hello?

350
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,238
Hey, Momoko!

351
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:52,842
Momoko!

352
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:56,311
Oh no. She's dead.

353
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,208
(elevator rumbling)

354
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:10,433
Great. Now you decide to work.

355
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,023
10th floor, hot elementary
girl named Satsuki.

356
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,483
Keanu?

357
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,640
Looks like it's you and me, Raggedy Ann.

358
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,410
- Call me Barbie!

359
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,330
- Okay, fine.

360
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,650
- Looks like it's you and me, Barbie.

361
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,283
I'm going fucking crazy.

362
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,703
Ow!

363
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,381
If I had a better bra and some ammo,

364
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:51,298
I'd pull a bitchin'
Sigourney Weaver right now.

365
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:08,309
Is it fall?

366
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,847
Where's the damn elevator?

367
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,586
Where are you going?

368
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:24,492
From the goodies. Get in
crunch, or munch. Chunk!

369
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:26,742
Hey, I laugh at your jokes!

370
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,007
Where the hell are you going?

371
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,902
Come on, Ann, we gotta save those idiots.

372
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:34,735
You guys-

373
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:37,639
(Satsuki screams)

374
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:40,306
(intense music)

375
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,708
Hey, Annie, come back!

376
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,611
Bitch, don't pull my hair!

377
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:56,444
Ow!

378
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:06,611
Well it's about time!

379
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,080
- Hurry up kid, you can still make it!

380
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,780
You need to get to the root
of this problem, and fast.

381
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,990
- Where's my doll?

382
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,506
Annie! Oh, that's gotta hurt.

383
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,740
- Satsuki, look out!

384
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:26,314
- Watch it.

385
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:27,314
- Warned you before.

386
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,880
But we'll pick this up later.

387
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,900
Do you know how to put this
thing to spiritual sleep?

388
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,980
- Yeah, I'm not here for the
gardening lessons, you dope.

389
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,800
- Good, you stand in the face
of danger. Chant a spell.

390
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,825
- What are you going to do?

391
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:40,658
- I'm going to watch your ass.

392
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:42,640
It's none of your business
what I'm going to do!

393
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,250
Now move it, sweet cheeks.

394
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,780
- Bossy. Okay.

395
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,830
- I hate to interrupt your
little May-December romance,

396
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,537
but will you please move your ass? Go!

397
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,633
- Double, double, soil and trouble.

398
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,383
Leave me alone, you crappy devil!

399
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,237
(intense music)

400
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:14,072
I am power!

401
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:18,813
(spirits scream)

402
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,330
- I can't see. How am I doing?

403
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,163
- Look up there.

404
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:27,023
- Up where?

405
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:32,728
- Where are you going?

406
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:35,190
- I think we both know where I'm going.

407
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,760
- You're going to be
the spirit receptacle?

408
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,250
- Well this was all my fault.

409
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,890
So I guess I better pay for it.

410
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,600
And I'm lonely, horny, and
don't make a lot of money.

411
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,020
What do I have to live for anyway?

412
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,393
Be glad you're young.

413
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:51,821
(emotional music)

414
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:54,045
- That is so nice of you.

415
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,973
Thanks! Mean it!

416
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:00,770
- I hate this neighborhood.

417
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,806
- Shut up, you racist.

418
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:03,639
- Oh, guys!

419
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,280
- Someone please give me my diabetes shot.

420
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,830
- Thanks for the help, fluffy.

421
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,130
- Temporary lapse in judgment, honey.

422
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,394
- This reminds me of Heather's.

423
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:18,061
Remember when Christian
Slater had a career?

424
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:20,400
- We're ready to blow, sir.

425
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,530
- All right, everyone withdraw.

426
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,363
- Sir, yes sir!

427
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:24,880
- My voice isn't usually this bassy,

428
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,060
but it makes the men respect me more.

429
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,010
- Well, yes there is that.

430
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,153
And that you threatened
to urinate on them.

431
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:37,496
(explosion)

432
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,191
- Now the black, poor
people will move to my hood.

433
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:48,024
(emotional music)

434
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:56,995
(singing in foreign language)
