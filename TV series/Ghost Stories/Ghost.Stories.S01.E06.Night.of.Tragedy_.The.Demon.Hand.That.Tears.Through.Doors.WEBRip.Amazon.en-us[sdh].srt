1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:04,929
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:11,590
- [Man On TV] That's right.

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,350
That guy has to be behind it.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,430
- [Guy On TV] That guy?

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,150
I told you not to talk about that.

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,050
- [Man On TV] But only he
could do something like this.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,507
- [Guy On TV] Get a grip man, he's dead.

8
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:22,330
- [Man On TV] That's what I'm saying.

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,041
He's come back to life
from that dark grave.

10
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,400
(pounding on door)
(boy gasps)

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,280
(door creaks)

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,113
- Hello?

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,150
Big hand's on the 11.

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,320
Let's see, that's, that's 4:30!

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,003
- [Mom] I'm home.

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,150
- It's Mom, oh, thank goodness.

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,873
Usually the pastor keeps
her longer than this.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,207
Mother, is Reverend Beeters with you?

19
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:04,424
(boy screaming)

20
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:11,402
(singing in foreign language)

21
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,990
(dramatic music)

22
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:49,020
- [Keiichiro] What then?

23
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,500
- And then when his mother came home,

24
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,550
she found him as dead as
Christian Slater's career.

25
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,930
When his mom asked him what happened,

26
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,320
all he did was tremble in fear

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,700
in a puddle of drool and
you don't wanna to know.

28
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,530
- Initially they thought it
was autoerotic asphyxiation

29
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,040
gone terribly wrong,

30
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,200
but then they found other kids

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,480
suffering from the same thing.

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,100
Something scared them so
bad they became idiots,

33
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,880
and always while their parents were away.

34
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,770
- Huh, say what?

35
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,958
Then what will happen to Keiichiro?

36
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,967
- But, Satsuki, did you forget (crying)?

37
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:20,149
- [All] What?

38
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:21,890
- That's right, tonight
Dad's going to his monthly

39
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,780
fathers without spouses meeting.

40
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,460
- My parents will be gone too.

41
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,120
- And mine will be at synagogue tonight,

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,080
and that always lasts forever.

43
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,710
- You know, even if your
parents pray 24 seven,

44
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,130
they're hellbound unless
they embrace Jesus.

45
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,980
- Hey Momoko, how about an impromptu

46
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,250
Bible study at my place?

47
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,316
- Oh, Satsuki, I would love to.

48
00:03:40,316 --> 00:03:43,030
- (laughs) Scared to be alone, Satsuki?

49
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,770
- No, we're just hanging out, loser.

50
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,920
- Gonna have a little
girls night together.

51
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,270
- Come on, let's paint our nails,

52
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,020
and stuff our training bras with paper,

53
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,833
and watch weird entertainment for women!

54
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,140
- Hey, Leo.

55
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,340
- Well, I was planning on watching

56
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,500
the Stargate SG-1 marathon tonight,

57
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,410
but these are the episodes
without Claudia Black,

58
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,310
and they suck, so I'm open.

59
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,940
- Hey, Keiichiro, if
you're scared, come over.

60
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,895
We'll have guys night.

61
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:07,691
- Really, guys night?

62
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:08,992
- [Hajime] Oh yeah, guys night.

63
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:09,825
- [Keiichiro] Get off me!

64
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:11,283
- [Hajime] Guys gone wild, wild!

65
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:17,474
- [Momoko] Let's pray about this, Satsuki

66
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,300
- Okay, your little dunking
booth for Jesus is ready.

67
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,260
- I'll keep you under until you
come up speaking in tongues.

68
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,570
- [Satsuki] Okay, listen, I
only asked you to come over

69
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,140
so I wouldn't be alone tonight.

70
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,360
I'm not ready to make any
kind of spiritual commitment.

71
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,600
I got some living to do.

72
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,710
- [Momoko] Well, let's
keep the baptismal ready

73
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,780
just in case.

74
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,180
I mean, if a ghost does attack,

75
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,020
you'll want to repent
before you die, won't you?

76
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,320
- [Satsuki] I'm in fifth grade.

77
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,430
Shouldn't take that long.

78
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,810
- [Momoko] Oh, you'd be
surprised how many transgressions

79
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,740
a filthy little sinner like
you can rake up in just a day.

80
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,676
- [Satsuki] Look--

81
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:50,675
- [Momoko] Oh, Satsuki, let's sing.

82
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,490
♪ Jesus loves me ♪

83
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,890
Come on, you know the words!

84
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,690
- [Keiichiro] Damn it
to hell, I died again.

85
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,680
- God, you suck.

86
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,610
That's what's wrong with you Damacy dorks.

87
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,700
Get your hands on some Grand
Theft Auto or Snuffed Three.

88
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,533
Butch it up.

89
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,790
- [Keiichiro] I like guys
night and you're awesome.

90
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:12,327
- Ah.

91
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,360
- [Keiichiro] So when are
the hookers showing up?

92
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,790
- How in the world did kids

93
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,440
ever get laid before the
internet, praise Jehovah.

94
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,200
That's right, I'm 6'1", 180,
brown, brown, nine inches cut.

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,413
Ah, cut, you know, like in, as
in I've been ah, I'm Jewish.

96
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,290
- Well, he sounds hot
in a nerdy kind of way.

97
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,823
But he says he's uncut.

98
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,340
What does that mean?

99
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,562
I've never got that.

100
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:43,810
(electricity crackles)
(girl gasps)

101
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,620
That scared the crap out of me.

102
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,570
Where was I?

103
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,520
Hello, you still there?

104
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,410
She's so rude.

105
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,531
Always hanging up on me.

106
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:51,348
(pounding on door)
(girl screams)

107
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:53,013
Who, who's there?

108
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:55,680
(door creaking)

109
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,701
(pounding on door)

110
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,451
(haunting music)

111
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,116
(girl gasps)

112
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,155
(girl screams)

113
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:34,280
(watch beeping)

114
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,657
- Finally, minute rice, my ass, let's eat.

115
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:39,729
- Let's pray first.

116
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,870
- [Amanojaku] (laughing) You need to pray.

117
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,800
- God don't you have
anything better to do?

118
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,060
- Let me put it this way.

119
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,320
Now I lay me down to sleep.

120
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,640
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep.

121
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,800
If I should die before Dad gets home.

122
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,657
- All right, how'd you hear?

123
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:53,430
- One who walks with the lotus cheetah

124
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,300
seeks the Magnolia Mountain in springtime.

125
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,530
- [Satsuki] Don't screw with me.

126
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,248
If you know something, just say it.

127
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:00,310
- I won't do it.

128
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,360
If you're so smart,

129
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,760
figure it out yourself
or die trying (laughing).

130
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,420
(pounding on door)

131
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,380
- Damn Jehovah's Witnesses.

132
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,270
- It's probably just Keiichiro
coming back after gameathon.

133
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,950
- Oh, yes, he's so stupid,

134
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,680
he knocks on his own door
when he gets home, then again.

135
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,058
- It's that satanic cult.

136
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:20,340
- Let's just ignore them.

137
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,319
- No, I'll handle these freaks.

138
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,012
(dramatic music)

139
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,610
(pounding on door)

140
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,610
- Oh, man, she's eager and
40 minutes early, very eager.

141
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,051
(pounding on door)

142
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:36,429
Okay!

143
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:38,550
- Momoko, let's not do this.

144
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,383
- [Momoko] Why?

145
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:43,110
- Because it might not, it might
not be a Jehovah's Witness.

146
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,640
- [Momoko] Oh, no, you'd be surprised

147
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,920
at how these religious freaks

148
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,500
will push their way on
you, it's disgusting.

149
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,680
- [Satsuki] No.

150
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,090
- That's such a fat knock.

151
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,690
She better look like her pictures.

152
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,119
I hate it when they lie on their profiles.

153
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,638
(pounding on door)

154
00:07:57,638 --> 00:08:00,010
(Leo sighs)

155
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,438
It better not be another
overweight tranny.

156
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:04,271
(electricity crackles)

157
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:05,630
Oh no, the lights went out.

158
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,019
That could be good.

159
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,936
(pounding on door)

160
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:13,225
(Leo gulps)

161
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:16,058
(dramatic music)

162
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,260
- Hello?

163
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,980
- Oh, look a different heathen.

164
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,280
- It's you, get lost.

165
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,090
- Come on, let me see what
happens on girls night.

166
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,770
- Mind your own business.

167
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,055
- Oh my, smells like you bailed on Wii,

168
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:38,123
(sniffs) and switched to
Rachael Ray, love her.

169
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,173
- She's fat.

170
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,713
- She's short.

171
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:47,907
(dramatic music)

172
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:50,407
(Leo screams)

173
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,827
You, you lied!

174
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:56,273
- I died, damn it.

175
00:08:58,433 --> 00:08:59,266
Where's that room where I could

176
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:01,950
have sex with a hooker, get laid.

177
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,120
- This is awesome.

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,130
I thought I was gonna be able

179
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,127
to freeze some panties or something,

180
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,170
but this was much better.

181
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,510
- Let's pray, screw it.

182
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,577
- After you eat you are going
to leave us alone, aren't you?

183
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:15,563
- I am so over my Giada
De Laurentiis phase.

184
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:16,396
- [Satsuki] Oh God.

185
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:19,050
- Satsuki, may I get something to drink?

186
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,710
- Yeah, I think there's some
Miller High Life in the fridge.

187
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,543
- Great.

188
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,710
Empty.

189
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,533
- Yeah, Dad's been lonely.

190
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,750
- I'll go get something non-alcoholic.

191
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,277
- Okay, to each his own.

192
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,458
(electricity crackling)

193
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:43,223
Damn it, he gets loaded and
forgets to pay the bills.

194
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:49,340
- (laughs) Well, knock knock, who's there?

195
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,877
Just another ghost coming to kill you.

196
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:52,930
- Is it really?

197
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,200
Maybe this is a ghost that likes cats.

198
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,410
Maybe it's not some freaky child killer.

199
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,700
Maybe it's a pissed off PETA
volunteer who saw the light

200
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,827
and is in the market for a new fur coat.

201
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:03,530
- (scoffs) Fine suit yourself.

202
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,440
Then don't believe me,

203
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,830
but are the lights and the phone

204
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,720
strangely and suddenly
going out ever a good sign?

205
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,243
I wonder, do you kids ever watch TV?

206
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,620
(Leo gasping)
(dramatic music)

207
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,080
- Ghosts in the chat rooms.

208
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,580
This is a bunch of crap
is what this is (screams).

209
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,680
If she was fat at least I
could outrun her (screams).

210
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:30,300
- Look, the little Jew boy.

211
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,999
(dramatic music)

212
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,690
(Leo screaming)

213
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,740
Hey, Leo.

214
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,407
(Leo screaming)

215
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,517
- He didn't pay the phone bill either?

216
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:45,450
- Huh?

217
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,003
- I told you.

218
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,913
(mysterious music)

219
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:53,930
Damn it, I wish the microwave was working.

220
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,764
I'd love some popcorn while I watch this.

221
00:10:55,764 --> 00:10:58,206
(pounding on door)

222
00:10:58,206 --> 00:10:59,039
(both gasp)

223
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,940
(pounding on door)

224
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,020
- Get the door.

225
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,770
- Huh, why me?

226
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,400
- It's probably just Momoko.

227
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,233
- So?

228
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:10,728
(dramatic music)

229
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:12,740
(pounding on door)

230
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,280
Why am I doing this again?

231
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,350
- Because if it's not
Momoko and it is a ghost,

232
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,987
better you than me, do it.

233
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:22,167
(Hajime groans)

234
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,867
(all screaming)

235
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,480
- [Satsuki] Leo!

236
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,960
- It's coming, bad ghost
internet dating 10 o'clock!

237
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,915
- Bad what?

238
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:32,095
(Leo screaming)

239
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:34,928
(dramatic music)

240
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:44,385
Close the door!

241
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:47,135
(all screaming)

242
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:57,485
- That was Attila.

243
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:00,456
- Babasare, the Babasare is here!

244
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:02,467
- Barbra Streisand?

245
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:03,934
(glass crashing)

246
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:07,000
(wind whooshing)

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,220
I guess it left.

248
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,620
- Let's not take any chances.

249
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,363
Where's your mother's ghost diary?

250
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:15,020
(dramatic music)

251
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,410
- December 27th, during
the town assembly's retreat

252
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,850
this girl named Mia was home
alone when Babasare showed up,

253
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,610
and so I came running up chanting

254
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,540
old hag, hit the road three times,

255
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,493
and put it to sleep in a Shinto shrine.

256
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,740
- All right, now we know how
to take care of that bitch.

257
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,000
- That will work.

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,440
I read the same thing in a book once,

259
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,230
so I tried chanting it
while I was running away,

260
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,573
but it kept chasing me all the way here.

261
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:39,770
Kind of hoped it would take
Momoko out, but no dice.

262
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,770
- [Hajime] Good try though.

263
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,830
- It probably can't be
put to spiritual sleep

264
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,400
using the same method anymore.

265
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,670
- What, maybe you just did it wrong.

266
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,510
- Aren't you a little
young for Alzheimer's?

267
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,700
Don't you remember?

268
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,330
New construction's
destroying the hillside.

269
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,990
Because of that, all those
precious little seals

270
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,720
your mother used to trap the ghosts

271
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,570
are as good as a service
merchandise warranty (laughing).

272
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:04,410
(sighs) There's no way you skibby dotes

273
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,620
are gonna be able to stop
Babasare, too bad, so sad.

274
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,833
- Well that and you just suck.

275
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:12,310
- Hey, the lights.

276
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,740
- Lights on, we're good to go.

277
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,890
- [Amanojaku] Hmm, interesting shop talk.

278
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,460
But the lights coming on simply mean

279
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,490
that Babasare's target has changed!

280
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,200
- [Satsuki] It's shopping at Target, what?

281
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,033
- [Amanojaku] Know any kids

282
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,520
who are all alone right now in the dark?

283
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,224
- [Satsuki] Hey, where's Keiichiro?

284
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,270
- [Hajime] He's playing
games at my house all alone.

285
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,330
- Oh no, that's the last time

286
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,720
I let you babysit, you stupid idiot.

287
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,050
Leo, make yourself useful,

288
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,270
and try to figure out some way

289
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,670
to keep that Barbra
Streisand bitch off our back.

290
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,450
Play the Yentl soundtrack or something.

291
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,274
I'll go get Keiichiro.

292
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:43,191
- Oh, okay.

293
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:45,130
- That is so awesome.

294
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,290
You'll risk your own life

295
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,410
to save your little retarded brother.

296
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,025
- You're coming with!

297
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:50,858
(Hajime groans)

298
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:52,220
And if he's dead don't even think

299
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,980
I'm paying you for watching him!

300
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,180
- [Hajime] Ow, ow, I said ow!

301
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,750
- [Satsuki] I heard you the
first time and I don't care!

302
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,483
- Yeah, take it bitch, like that?

303
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,700
Ah, didn't get to shoot her.

304
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,810
What the fizzydyuck?

305
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,690
(pounding on door)

306
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,357
(Keiichiro crying)

307
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:11,850
The cops, man, this game is realistic.

308
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,413
(pounding on door)

309
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,377
(gasps) The slammer (crying).

310
00:14:21,464 --> 00:14:24,343
- [Satsuki] Open up, sweetie.

311
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:25,626
Open the door.

312
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:29,709
- Satsuki, is that you (crying)?

313
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:32,673
- Move your ass.

314
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:36,623
- (crying) It is you (giggles).

315
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:39,790
(Keiichiro screaming)

316
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:42,243
- [Satsuki] Keiichiro, calm down.

317
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,223
It's me, the real me, not Babasare.

318
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,263
(Keiichiro screaming and crying)

319
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:47,096
Calm down!

320
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:50,969
(Keiichiro babbling)

321
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:51,802
(pounding on door)

322
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:52,760
- [Hajime] Man, she's pissed off.

323
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,833
What a hag.

324
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,039
- Yeah, guess her and Brolin
are past the honeymoon stage.

325
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,213
(glass crashing)

326
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:04,046
(timber creaking)

327
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:08,175
(Keiichiro crying)

328
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:11,008
(timber creaking)

329
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,630
- [Hajime] Come on already.

330
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:18,680
(mysterious music)

331
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:26,897
(Keiichiro screaming and crying)

332
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,792
(Hajime grunts)

333
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,001
(Hajime screams)

334
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,668
(all screaming)

335
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:42,710
(groans) Oh man, you're fat.

336
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,837
- [Satsuki] Shut up!

337
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:46,599
As for you, cat, can't you help us at all?

338
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,960
- [Amanojaku] Maybe.

339
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,480
- [Satsuki] The neighbors
Doberman is right next door.

340
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,313
- [Amanojaku] Maybe not.

341
00:15:51,313 --> 00:15:52,962
- That's it, come on!

342
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:54,121
(Amanojaku scoffs)

343
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,462
(electricity crackles)

344
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:58,379
(thunder crashing)

345
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,720
- [Hajime] Oh rain.

346
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,008
- [Leo] It's really coming down.

347
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:10,890
(Amanojaku laughing)

348
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,060
- [Satsuki] So what, the stupid ghost

349
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,200
made it rain, that's retarded.

350
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,568
- [Leo] It's Babasare,
not Storm from the X-Men.

351
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:19,760
- Hey, do you guys think maybe

352
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,210
the rain made Babasare go away, answer me.

353
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,608
- Yeah, just like signs?

354
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,618
(pounding on door)

355
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,022
(all groan)

356
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:29,939
(thunder crashing)

357
00:16:34,262 --> 00:16:36,321
- [Amanojaku] They're here.

358
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:39,102
(all scream)

359
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:41,631
(dramatic music)

360
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:44,048
- Back, evil spirit, be gone!

361
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:46,942
What do you think of that?

362
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:49,010
I made a talisman!

363
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,651
(dramatic music)

364
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:51,484
You bitch.

365
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,671
(all groaning)

366
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:58,421
(dramatic music)

367
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:09,078
(all screaming)

368
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:21,465
- Take that!

369
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,520
(Babasare moaning)

370
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,523
Yeah, I hate minestrone too!

371
00:17:28,523 --> 00:17:31,273
(dramatic music)

372
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,470
- Hey, what are you doing?

373
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,175
Let's get out of here.

374
00:17:43,175 --> 00:17:45,660
- Yeah, I don't think this
is the time for a bath.

375
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,360
- Like I'm ever gonna take my clothes off

376
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,840
with you two pervs around.

377
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,290
Didn't you notice what
happened when Babs got all wet?

378
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,190
She got meltier.

379
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,640
Haven't either of you ever
seen the Wizard of Oz?

380
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:59,027
(all gasps)

381
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:01,860
(timber creaking)

382
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,405
Better have paid the gas bill,

383
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:18,970
and matches, keep out
of reach of children.

384
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,943
I don't think so.

385
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:25,604
- Geez, it's coming.

386
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,354
(haunting music)

387
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:32,466
- It's here!

388
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:36,895
(Babasare moaning)

389
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:38,897
(Hajime gasping)

390
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:39,903
- Good, good luck.

391
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:42,300
- Yeah, I'll go it alone again!

392
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,185
Thank you so much, Leo.

393
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:47,102
(Babasare moaning)

394
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:50,651
- We got a fire!

395
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:54,250
(Babasare moaning)
(Hajime screaming)

396
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,620
- Here's Johnnie!

397
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,960
- Get the bitch in the bathtub.

398
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,057
- [Leo] What if she likes showers?

399
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:02,207
(dramatic music)

400
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,063
- Him so over this old hag.

401
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:08,626
Finally, this stupid
Swiffer's good for something!

402
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:13,626
(dramatic music)
(Babasare moaning)

403
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,498
(all sigh)

404
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:30,472
- [Satsuki] Bye bye, Babs.

405
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:33,070
- [Hajime] That is the worst
bathtub ring I've ever seen.

406
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,700
- [Leo] I don't even
think Scrubbing Bubbles

407
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,460
are gonna get that out.

408
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,130
- [Amanojaku] Pardon me,
anyone want my opinion?

409
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,120
- [Satsuki] God, now you
decide to give us advice?

410
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,570
- Babasare is a ghost
manifested by children's fears,

411
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,540
so adults who don't believe in ghosts

412
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,360
in the first place don't see it!

413
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,170
You listening to me?

414
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,200
If you don't get scared, it won't appear.

415
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,570
If you crap your pants, go city.

416
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,420
Your little water sports have
no effect on Babs at all.

417
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,698
Are you listening to me?

418
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:02,531
- Oh no.

419
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:12,088
(all screaming)

420
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:18,195
Calgon, take me away!

421
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:21,891
- [Reiichirou] I'm home!

422
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:27,031
- [Keiichiro] Dad (crying)!

423
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:30,031
(mysterious music)

424
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,723
- She disappeared.

425
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,630
- Thank you so much, Calgon.

426
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,700
- Crap, just when things
were getting interesting.

427
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,080
- Oh God, well, on the way there,

428
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,720
I had the worse attack of diarrhea,

429
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
so I had the bus drop
me off and I came home.

430
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,220
I swear, I almost didn't make it.

431
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,880
I tried to call.

432
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,040
What's the matter with you all?

433
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,830
You look like you've just seen a ghost.

434
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,770
- Okay, so like nothing happened to you?

435
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,020
- No, on my way to the store
I ran into Mr. Miyanoshita,

436
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,930
and we just got caught
up talking about Jesus.

437
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,467
His shirt, it's a sign.

438
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:05,590
(all groan)

439
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,010
- [Satsuki] What do you mean?

440
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,700
You didn't see it?

441
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,570
- [Momoko] No, only Leo running
like a scared little girl.

442
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,270
- [Leo] Yeah, thanks for the help.

443
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,610
- Hmm, so Babasare is a ghost

444
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,290
you don't see if you're not scared.

445
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,003
That makes no sense at all to me.

446
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,450
- That's why it went
away when Dad came home.

447
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,110
Adults are only afraid
of checking the mailbox.

448
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,380
- Maybe it was just mass
hysteria, a kind of group panic.

449
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,860
You know how one group of
people think one thing happened

450
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,760
when actually that thing
they think happened

451
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,610
didn't happen at all.

452
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,197
Like Ashlee Simpson
singing at her concert.

453
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:42,140
- [All] What, you saw Ashlee?

454
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,065
- You told me you went to Hoobastank.

455
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:47,982
(mysterious music)

456
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:52,052

457
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:58,187

00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:24,087
- [Leo] Hello, Satsuki.

468
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:25,710
There's something going on with my mother.

469
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,980
I can't describe it very well,

470
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,910
but it's like, like she's a
completely different person.

471
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,450
Something's different about her.

472
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,167
Something, Satsuki, help me!

473
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,834
(phone beeping)
