1
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:04,324
(birds cawing)

2
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:10,588
(suspenseful music)

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,749
(door clicks)

4
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:19,653
(wheels creaking)

5
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,236
(piano creaks)

6
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:26,413
(suspenseful music)

7
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,478
(piano creaks)

8
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:37,286
(note plays)

9
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:40,286
(suspenseful music)

10
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:44,898
(Ghost laughs)

11
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:51,257
(singing in a foreign language)

12
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:19,368
(chilling music)

13
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:27,240
(whimsical music)

14
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:31,505
(wind blows)

15
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:32,338
(Satsuki screams)

16
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:35,420
- Sweet, it looks like a little
peppermint panty wonderland.

17
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,610
- You open that window again

18
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,587
and I'm gonna push you out of it.

19
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:38,650
- If I were you,

20
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,500
I wouldn't wear horizontal
stripes like that,

21
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,211
it makes your butt look big.

22
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:43,563
- I'll kill you!

23
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,570
(Hajime laughs)

24
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,730
- You'll have to catch me first, fat ass!

25
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,787
- Come back here, you coward!

26
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:52,130
- If you lose weight, you'd move faster!

27
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,633
- Hold it right there.

28
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,880
- [Hajime] Oh, the music
teacher, what a bitch.

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,650
- How would you like a trip
to the principal's office?

30
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,970
- [ Satsuki] Not too much.

31
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,120
- I didn't think you would.

32
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,540
Now remember this little moment

33
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,482
when you vote for teacher of the year.

34
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:09,280
- Bush one, bush two, you're
not getting my vote either.

35
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,113
- Good girl.

36
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:11,950
Now you and your future delinquent friend

37
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,070
can help me carry some boxes.

38
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,888
Dammit, where'd the beast go?

39
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:16,792
- What?

40
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,670
I hate him.

41
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,700
- [Music Teacher] You're strong.

42
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,230
I'm gonna have to remember
that when I move offices.

43
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,480
- Hopefully offices in another school.

44
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,720
- I'm sorry, what?

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,674
- You're pretty.

46
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:27,660
- Thanks?

47
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,990
All right, let's go.

48
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,031
- Fine.

49
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:32,473
- [Music Teacher] Matthew
Greenfield and little Donny Rush,

50
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:33,360
- Awe, man.

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,170
- I expelled you two last week!

52
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,390
Come back here!

53
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,410
You take those boxes
inside, I'll be right back.

54
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,243
- What?

55
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,250
- [Music Teacher] If
Gin Chung is here too,

56
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,883
you're in big trouble!

57
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,379
(birds cawing)

58
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,430
(ominous music)

59
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,620
- [Satsuki] Subtle, nice.

60
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,683
Why don't you just draw a target on me?

61
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,262
(floor creaking)

62
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:59,390
(wind blows)

63
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,179
The music room, the music room.

64
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:03,134
(distant crashing)

65
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:05,801
(Satsuki gasps)

66
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:10,220
(Satsuki giggles)

67
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,663
Girl alone in haunted
school house, I'm an idiot.

68
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:17,147
(suspenseful music)

69
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:19,840
- [Ghost] Do you have any
books written by black people?

70
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,062
Yeah.

71
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:23,053
("Für Elise" begins)

72
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:26,303
(floor creaks)

73
00:04:26,303 --> 00:04:29,636
("Für Elise" continues)

74
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,502
(floor creaks)

75
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,270
(Satsuki breaths deeply)

76
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,603
("Für Elise" continues)

77
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,173
(floor creaks)

78
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:05,331
(music intensifies)

79
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:13,741
(floor creaks)

80
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:22,508
(door rumbles)

81
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:28,059
("Für Elise" continues)

82
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,641
(Satsuki whimpers softly)

83
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:38,974
("Für Elise" continues)

84
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,550
(floor creaking)

85
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,631
(piano creaks)

86
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:04,677
(Satsuki breathes heavily)

87
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:06,516
(suspenseful music)

88
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,565
(muted piano note taps)

89
00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:11,482
(Satsuki whimpers)

90
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,673
(Satsuki cries)

91
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:22,648
(door shuts)

92
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,776
(piano key plays)

93
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:27,776
(ominous laughter)

94
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,624
- [Ghost] Three more times.

95
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,480
(piano bangs)

96
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,318
- [All] What?

97
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:37,210
- You mean you actually heard it?

98
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,043
Get out.

99
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,990
- It's the piano ghost of the music room,

100
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,110
all the kids are talking about it,

101
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,810
that and the head cheerleader
getting pregnant, big story.

102
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,300
- Piano ghost, what?

103
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,990
- [Hajime] If you hear
him playing, you die,

104
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,889
like the Ring and that tape,
or something else from Japan.

105
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:51,722
- What?

106
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:52,930
- [Leo] To put it accurately,

107
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,687
a person who hears the music
piece the piano ghost plays,

108
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:58,850
"Für Elise", four times all
the way through will die

109
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,670
and the cheerleader is carrying twins.

110
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,650
- [Hajime] I think the tempo
changes each time you hear it,

111
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,070
that's when you know you're screwed,

112
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,380
or he's just getting tired.

113
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,470
- I also heard that during
the fourth performance,

114
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,733
the music piece is played
with a mercilessly slow pace.

115
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:15,956
- I see, at least it's
not Creed's Greatest Hits.

116
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:17,873
(thud)

117
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,340
- [Hajime] Scott Stapp rocks!

118
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,220
- Don't yell at me!

119
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,490
I'm gonna die, I have
enough pressure on me!

120
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,273
- [Keichirrou] Are you gonna die?

121
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:28,475
(Keichirrou mumbles)

122
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,462
(Keichirrou cries)

123
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:33,768
- I'm just kidding, I'm
fine, I've got mom's diary.

124
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:36,430
(Satsuki whimpers)

125
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,406
There's nothing written about it here.

126
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:40,090
I am gonna die!

127
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,740
- [Leo] We all gotta go sometime.

128
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,310
- Perhaps when your
mother was still alive,

129
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,310
the piano ghost wasn't around.

130
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,395
You could be meeting your
savior sooner than you thought.

131
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:49,228
(Keichirrou sobs)

132
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:50,061
- Let me ask you something.

133
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:53,280
How about you not smile so
much when you're saying that?

134
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,810
- Oh, sorry about that.

135
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,425
- Poor Keiichirou, I
feel so sorry for him.

136
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:59,290
(Keichirrou cries)

137
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,057
- Hey, hold the phone a sec!

138
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:02,940
I'll be fine, all I have

139
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,910
to do is avoid hearing

140
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,350
that damn piano song for a couple of days.

141
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,330
I'm not a classical music fan anyway.

142
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,690
- [ Hajime] What's your plan exactly?

143
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,787
- Stay away from the school house.

144
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,210
So for the next couple of weeks,

145
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,140
it's Howard Stern, Rush
Limbo, and Paul Harvey

146
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,540
if he stays alive that long.

147
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,983
- Just stay away from Michael Savage.

148
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,793
- You're gonna die.

149
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,453
- [Satsuki] I'm not gonna die.

150
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,600
- [Keiichirou] Are you
sure you're not gonna die?

151
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,471
- Are you talking about the piano ghost?

152
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:36,840
(Keiichirou screams)

153
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,060
I'm sure I'll live a long, miserable life

154
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,070
of heartbreak and alcoholism
before a ghost takes me out.

155
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,944
- If you're lying, thank you.

156
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:46,777
(Keiichirou sobs)

157
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,700
- I told you I'm going to be fine.

158
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,500
Why are you still crying?

159
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,360
- Because (indistinct)

160
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,193
- Yeah.

161
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,179
- You think so too?

162
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,012
(Keiichirou sniffs)

163
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:01,630
Thanks, I thought it was just me.

164
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,580
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, cowboy.

165
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,520
- He might have a good
night, but you won't.

166
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,850
- You shut the hell up.

167
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,230
I haven't fed you yet.

168
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,966
- [Cat] Heard any good
piano concertos lately?

169
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,076
(cat snickers)

170
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:15,760
(ominous music)

171
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,519
- I hate that cat.

172
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,030
(telephone rings)

173
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,453
Now telemarketers.

174
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,030
Milk Tan here!

175
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,400
That never gets old.

176
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,500
Hello?

177
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,333
Hello?

178
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:32,050
(phone rings)

179
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,644
Hello?

180
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:37,513
(ominous music continues)

181
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:38,688
(Satsuki grumbles)

182
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:40,590
(telephone rings)

183
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,423
(Satsuki groans)

184
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,350
(telephone rings)

185
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,366
At least give me some heavy
breathing or something.

186
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:46,730
("Für Elise" begins)

187
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,987
(Satsuki gasps)

188
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,320

190
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:11,581

(telephone button clicks)

196
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,845
Disconnecting.

197
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,159
Disconnecting.

198
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:26,992
(Satsuki sobs)

199
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:27,825
(telephone clatters)

200
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,682
(Satsuki grunts)

201
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:32,010
(Satsuki yells)

202
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,495
(music begins)

203
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:35,878
What?

204
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:39,525
(piano music continues)

205
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:41,560

Ah!

218
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:06,273
(batteries clatter)

219
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:08,940

Oh man, I wish I was deaf.

227
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,215
(toy creaks)

228
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:47,520
- [Ghost] Two more times

229
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:51,601
(ghost laughs)

230
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,530
- [Hajime] For real?

231
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,500
- [Satsuki] Yeah for real.

232
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,317
- If you listen to "Für Elise"
two more times, that's it.

233
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:05,077
- You promised you
weren't gonna die, liar.

234
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,544
(Keiichirou sobs)

235
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:09,520
- Keiichirou fear not.

236
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,670
The Lord God is with thee.

237
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,503
- [Keiichirou] What do you know?

238
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:13,900
- And God will wipe away
every tear from their eyes,

239
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,700
Revelations 21:4.

240
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,150
- What are you gonna do now?

241
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,410
Obviously you are staying away

242
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,230
from the schoolhouse only talk radio plan

243
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,350
isn't gonna cut it.

244
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,183
- And apparently,

245
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:24,410
the ghost's musical delivery
system isn't limited

246
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,280
to piano playing.

247
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,940
The song could come from anywhere.

248
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,800
- Hey how about you stuff
cotton or clay in your ears?

249
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,910
- [Satsuki] Shut up.

250
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,850
- Fine, die, see if I care.

251
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,300
- Hey, that's it.

252
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,670
I must have been preoccupied

253
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,212
with the cheerleader story.

254
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:38,859
I should have thought of it.

255
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:39,692
- [Satsuki] I don't think so.

256
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,140
- They're not what you think they are,

257
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,180
they're ear plugs.

258
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,030
Just shove them in when
you hear the piano.

259
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,447
Or Momoko (indistinct).

260
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,810
- [Teacher] Take this triangle ABC.

261
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,444
- From point A,
(Hajime yawns)

262
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:54,100
draw a perpendicular line down to line BC.

263
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,399
We'll call this line Suzie.

264
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,828
(crickets chirping)

265
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:02,161
(ominous music begins)

266
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,120
- [Ghost] Two more times.

267
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:11,759
(Ghost chuckles)

268
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,193
- [Leo] If you listen

269
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,690
to "Für Elise" two more times, that's it.

270
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,480
Just shove 'em in when you hear the piano.

271
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,283
Or Momoko (indistinct).

272
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:21,116
(door knocks)

273
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:22,500
(Satsuki gasps)

274
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,899
(ominous music intensifies)

275
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:26,845
(doorknob creaks)

276
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:29,370
(Satsuki screams)

277
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,430
- What in the world are you doing, Satski?

278
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,670
You got a phone call.

279
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,350
He says his name is Leo.

280
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,519
Is he your boyfriend?

281
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,357
(Dad laughs)

282
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,240
- Dad, don't be gross!

283
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,230
What is it, Leo?

284
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,860
- [Ghost] Yes, it's me Leo.

285
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,930
After doing some checking
on the piano ghost,

286
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,554
I discovered some new facts.

287
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:45,820
- What?

288
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,890
What new facts?

289
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,440
- [Ghost] Oh, the facts.

290
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,950
Well, we probably shouldn't
discuss it over the phone.

291
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,290
Hey, I've got an idea.

292
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,348
Why don't you come to the
scary isolated payphone

293
00:13:54,348 --> 00:13:56,760
on the bad side of town alone, yeah.

294
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,333
- Okay, give me a minute.

295
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,692
(phone dial tone)

296
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:04,359
(ominous music)

297
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:09,975
(crickets chirp)

298
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,860
- Come on Leo.

299
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,310
Matter of life or death here.

300
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:22,414
("Für Elise" begins)

301
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:25,081
(wheels squeak)

302
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:31,568
(Satsuki whimpers)

303
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:34,944
Oh!

304
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:39,906
("Für Elise" continues)

305
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:40,739
What?

306
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:41,718
Where'd you get these things?

307
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:43,135
The dollar store?

308
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:48,736
(Satsuki pants)

309
00:14:50,163 --> 00:14:52,083
All I need to do is not
hear the whole song.

310
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,600
Then I'll be fine.

311
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,080
I'll have to run all the way to Asaka,

312
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,744
but at least I'll be alive.

313
00:14:56,744 --> 00:14:59,327
(Satski pants)

314
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,242
God, this is what I get
for skipping PE class

315
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:06,619
and now look what (indistinct) happened.

316
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:09,286
(Satsuki pants)

317
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:15,917
(music plays)

318
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,177
Ah!

319
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:20,177
(music intensifies)

320
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:24,281
(Satsuki screams)

321
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,989
(Satsuki pants)

322
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:31,489
(music continues)

323
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:32,322
Ah!

324
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:34,755
Crap.

325
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:41,092
(wheels squeak)

326
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:44,343
(music continues)

327
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,010
(piano rumbles)

328
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,176
(Satsuki screams)

329
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:57,176
(piano music fades)

330
00:16:11,632 --> 00:16:12,752
(haunting music)

331
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:14,121
(Satsuki screams)

332
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:16,954
(music continues)

333
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:20,456
No!

334
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:24,970
(doorbell rings)

335
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,803
- Hello?

336
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:26,636
Who is it?

337
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,563
Oh, it's you.

338
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:29,810
You're still alive.

339
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,190
Lighten up, it's just a joke.

340
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,963
Oh crap, I'll get my coat.

341
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,330
(ominous music begins)

342
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,810
- [Hajime] Everyone, all set?

343
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,980
- [Leo] Lock and load.

344
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,570
- [Momoko] Be strong in the
Lord and the power of his might.

345
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,370
- [Leo] That ghost was impersonating me!

346
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,048
Well of course he was, I'm the best actor.

347
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,540
- Thank you.

348
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,840
- Don't sweat it, baby.

349
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,194
Toss me a couple pairs of
those panties and we're even.

350
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:55,144
Now let's rock and roll!
- Play ball!

351
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,811
(ominous music)

352
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,800
- [Satsuki] What's the plan?

353
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,520
- We find the music room
and go all Rachmaninoff

354
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,800
on his ass.

355
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,273
If we smash his piano,
he can't play now can he?

356
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:08,157
(Hajime shouts)

357
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,860
(items rattle)

358
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,870
Dammit, who left a stupid box in the hall?

359
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,383
Oh no, my bike headlight.

360
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,088
- This must be the place.

361
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:19,146
("Für Elise" begins)

362
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:21,370
- It's the piano ghost!

363
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,693
- [Hajime] All right, let's go!

364
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,750
- A Steinway.

365
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,240
- Yes, but there's no one playing it.

366
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,983
- All right, knock it off
you cheap shot show pan.

367
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,640
If you're not gonna play Tori Amos,

368
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,203
you got no business at those keys.

369
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:36,119
Ah!

370
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,298
(Hajime yells)

371
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:42,764
(Hajime scream)

372
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:43,597
(Hajime groans)

373
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:44,430
- [All] Hajime!

374
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,990
- Oh man, that really hurt!

375
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,150
- It's a force field.

376
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,190
If they're anything like the
ones I've seen on Star Trek,

377
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,270
Satski's a goner.

378
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,226
This is so sad.

379
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:53,450
- What?

380
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,846
As friends, you guys suck.

381
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:57,290
(foreign language) do something.

382
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,580
- I'm not gonna let you die.

383
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,780
- [Momoko] Good.

384
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,214
- I got a couple pair of
panties riding on this.

385
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,738
- Good luck, Hajime.

386
00:18:03,738 --> 00:18:06,488
(Hajime screams)

387
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:08,415
Oh good job.

388
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:09,500
If I thought you were gonna half-ass it,

389
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
I would have made Leo go do it.

390
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,360
- I'm not gonna let some
out of tune Tchaikovsky

391
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,780
get the best of me, shut up.

392
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,960
- The recital's almost over.

393
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,200
I'd hustle if I were you.

394
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,720
- I'll go in first again.

395
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,640
You guys follow.

396
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,245
Got it?

397
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:22,140
( Hajime yells)

398
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,148
- Bang bang.

399
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:24,010
- Batter up!

400
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,175
- God protect us.

401
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:26,519
- Go get em.

402
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,852
(all groan)

403
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,420
(Keiichirou screams)

404
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,479
- Keiichirou!

405
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,331
Try it again!

406
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:38,320
- Man down.

407
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,840
- [Hajime] Well this plan isn't working.

408
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
Anyone got any bright ideas?

409
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,410
- [Leo] I'm thinking.

410
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,670
- [Hajime] Think faster!

411
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,210
- [Leo] Stop yelling, I can't concentrate!

412
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,349
- [Hajime] Come on Mr.
Psychical researcher.

413
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:48,420
- [Leo] Oh, don't start that again.

414
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,483
- The piano's not it I'm afraid.

415
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,795
The real piano ghost is there!

416
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:58,326
(music intensifies)

417
00:18:58,326 --> 00:19:00,211
- A portrait of Antonio Banderas?

418
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:02,010
- So all we need to do
is destroy the painting,

419
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,540
is that what you're saying?

420
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,384
- The metronome.

421
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:05,480
- Huh?

422
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,610
- Look for a damn metronome, you nitwit.

423
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,960
- [Leo] Gotcha, let's look.

424
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,080
- That's what that damn clicking thing was

425
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,320
in that stupid box.

426
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,233
- I got your back.

427
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:18,161
(door slams)

428
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:20,180
Hey, what's the big idea?

429
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,247
- Come on, you little weakling.

430
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,080
Pull.

431
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,153
- Look out Keiichirou, behind you!

432
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:25,986
- What?

433
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:26,819
Ah!

434
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:28,805
(Keiichirou screams)

435
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:30,420
(ominous music intensifies)

436
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,130
- There, you owe me one.

437
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,920
And as for you, take that and that.

438
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:38,570
- What?

439
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,403
- Oh no.

440
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:40,236
- Hurry!

441
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:42,636
Hurry children, he'll start
playing "Für Elise" again.

442
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:45,303
(Hajime grunts)

443
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,803
(ghost moans)

444
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:50,886
- Here it is!

445
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,664
- Get back.

446
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:54,497
Ah!

447
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:55,330
(Satsuki screams)

448
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,247
- Look out!

449
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:01,276
- Now only one more phrase.

450
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:04,609
("Für Elise" continues)

451
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:09,263
(Satsuki screams)

452
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:12,596
("Für Elise" continues)

453
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:20,108
- Sleep here, oh ghost,
to spiritual sleep.

454
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:20,941
(Ghost gasps)

455
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:23,880
(metronome ticks)

456
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,980
(Ghost moans)

457
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,577
(metronome ticking continues)

458
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:30,657
- It's not stopping.

459
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:33,992
- Hurry, they're only a few
more notes left in the piece.

460
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:35,800
- It's past your bed time!

461
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,467
(Ghost screams)

462
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,290
- Kick his ass.

463
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,201
(Ghost moans)

464
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:49,868
(Ghost screams)

465
00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:54,337
(metronome ticks)

466
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:58,630
- God, thanks.

467
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,860
That guy was terrible.

468
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,433
- Hasta la vista, baby.

469
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:07,200
(all sigh)

470
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,870
- Satsuki, hey what's the matter?

471
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,780
- Man down.

472
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,940
- [Hajime] For crying out loud,

473
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,760
we do all the work and she's
the one who passes out?

474
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,593
Lame.

475
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:16,050
- [Momoko] She was so
frightened of the ghost,

476
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,400
she probably didn't get
any sleep last night.

477
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,930
- [Leo] Hey Momoko,
lemme ask you something.

478
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,590
How did you know how to put
that ghost into spiritual sleep?

479
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,100
- Oh, don't give me any credit.

480
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,490
- It was all the Lord Jesus.

481
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,750
- Okay, whatever.

482
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,950
How did the Lord Jesus tell
you how to put it to sleep?

483
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,700
- Not me, I was just an
instrument of the Lord,

484
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,790
though I'm a little fuzzy on the details.

485
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,840
- [Hajime] I don't
understand it but it worked,

486
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,880
so I'm cool.

487
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,330
- [Leo] She's not answering my questions.

488
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,400
She's not helping.

489
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,590
- If you really wanna help
you could help carry her,

490
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,150
she's fatter then she looks.

491
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,502
- [Leo] If you really wanna help.

492
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:49,085
(gentle music)

493
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:57,014
(singing in foreign language)

494
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:22,968
- [Satsuki] What?

495
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,068
The school's sports day is being canceled?

496
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,440
There's a boy who's practicing

497
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,910
with everything he's got.

498
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,860
- [Woman] All he wanted to do was run.

499
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,247
- [Boy] I just, I just wanted to run.
