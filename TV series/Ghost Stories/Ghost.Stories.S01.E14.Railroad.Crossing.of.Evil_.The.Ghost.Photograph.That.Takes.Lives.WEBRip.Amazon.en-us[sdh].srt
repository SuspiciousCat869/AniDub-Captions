1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,591
(rain pouring)

2
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:13,670
(yawning)

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,904
- Guess it's about time to head back.

4
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:18,487
(rain pouring)

5
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:23,360
(suspenseful music)

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,374
(screaming)

7
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:27,291
(tires screeching)

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,947
Oh man, is Geico gonna screw me now.

9
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:34,588
(seat belt clicks)

10
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:37,398
(door slams)

11
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:38,231
Huh?

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,583
That's weird.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,270
No dent.

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,650
Maybe I hit Kate Moss.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,400
(signal blaring)

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,363
(door slams)

17
00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:59,555
(siren blaring)

18
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:02,555
(suspenseful music)

19
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:06,758
(screaming)

20
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:09,465
(train whooshing)

21
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:13,382
(singing in foreign language)

22
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:21,504
(upbeat music)

23
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:25,421
(singing in foreign language)

24
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:37,164
(upbeat music)

25
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:42,514
(singing in foreign language)

26
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:43,766
(suspenseful music)

27
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:48,465
(train rattling)

28
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:49,298
- What?

29
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:50,627
The ghost of a woman, what?

30
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,070
- Do, do I stutter?

31
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,760
Yes, I heard a cab driver
saw a pale faced ghost

32
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,190
at this railroad crossing.

33
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,780
Why the supernatural evidence
is directly in front of us.

34
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,960
Look, right there, even now.

35
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,374
A stain in the shape of a person.

36
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:06,520
(shouting)

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,900
- Oh good Lord, it's just a puddle.

38
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,520
You're even getting on my nerves.

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,370
- Geez, you know what a baby he is.

40
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,203
- Shut up!

41
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:14,490
I know what I'm talking about

42
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,150
and I'm going to prove it to you.

43
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,200
Oh, you'll see.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,750
According to my investigation,

45
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,640
many reliable witnesses have testified

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,800
that they saw a ghost on this spot.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,370
There are a lot of accidents here

48
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,930
and the residents in the area call this-

49
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,440
- You interrupted Girls Gone
Wild Backwoods of Kentucky

50
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,860
for this?

51
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,710
- Hey, is that the limited incest edition?

52
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,750
- If you're going to do
your physical research,

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,700
do it by yourself.

54
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,420
- Listen, this is our civic duty.

55
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,650
We have to stop it.

56
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,110
Are you telling me you don't care

57
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,370
if the people crossing here

58
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,360
are in danger of losing their lives?

59
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,390
When a ghost shows up,

60
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,770
we always rush there
and dispel the spirit.

61
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,740
If you won't help,

62
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,720
I'm going to kick you out of
the Psychical Research Club.

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,880
- Oh, damn anime.

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,360
Look what's happened to my eyes.

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,660
- Not to mention, ghosts don't
come out in the afternoon,

66
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,493
do they? (chuckles)

67
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:58,740
I said, come out.

68
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,390
- Oh, you don't need to
worry about waiting for them.

69
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,040
Ta da!

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,593
Here, here, here, here.

71
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,870
- What the hell are these?

72
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,400
- These specially designed cameras

73
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,430
capture images that the
human eye can't see.

74
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,830
You guys just keep shooting
everywhere and everything

75
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,520
and we're bound to snap a ghost.

76
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,465
All right everybody, aim and fire!

77
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:24,140
(camera clicking)

78
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,600
- You know, I got a
better use for my camera.

79
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,433
- [Leo] Shut up.

80
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,470
- I got one word for you, photo shop.

81
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,303
- [Leo] You shut up too.

82
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,160
(camera clicks)

83
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,230
- Poor little thing.

84
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,220
- [Leo] You shut, what?

85
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,650
- The spirits here should
be in Heaven right now

86
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,483
and I'm sorry,

87
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:39,420
it'd piss me off of kids were
bothering my spiritual rest.

88
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,393
I think we should just
leave them alone, okay?

89
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,223
- Okay.

90
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,569
Just my luck, the Greta Garbo ghost.

91
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,628
I want to be alone.

92
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:54,878
(laughter)

93
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,388
Oh!

94
00:04:57,388 --> 00:04:58,503
(suspenseful music)

95
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:01,120
How'd she get her hand like that?

96
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,910
That's not easy to do.

97
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,239
Wait a minute, that's not her hand!

98
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:08,239
(suspenseful music)

99
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,759
(birds chirping)

100
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:17,399
(speaking foreign language)

101
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,911
Wait a minute, that's the Japanese.

102
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:20,760
There is a ghost at the railroad.

103
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,630
I knew it.

104
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,170
Wait till I show Hajime,

105
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,143
he's going to crap his pants.

106
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:28,599
(laughter)

107
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:29,780
- And then my mom walks in.

108
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,950
- Hajime!

109
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,040
- What?

110
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,659
- Hey, check this,
- [Satsuki] You guys listen!

111
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,477
(shouting)

112
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:39,650
- Why don't you watch where you're going?

113
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,150
- Sorry.

114
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,983
Get up.

115
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:44,270
We gotta go see Momoko.

116
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,220
- [Hajime] What?

117
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,340
Momoko collapsed or did you say relapsed?

118
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,330
- What?

119
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,890
- Well, apparently she got
sick all of a sudden last night

120
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,493
and was taken to the hospital.

121
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:53,450
- Why, why?

122
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,283
- I don't know,

123
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:57,560
even the doctors don't seem
to understand what's going on.

124
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,890
Thorough examination,
that's what she's getting.

125
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,740
- You know, I could give
her a thorough examination.

126
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,573
- No you can't.

127
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,760
I'm going to the hospital
and I'll check on her later.

128
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,810
- I'll go too.

129
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,560
Leo, I'll need my rubber gloves back.

130
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,850
- You don't want them back,
but that's a long story,

131
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,500
but that's beside the point.

132
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,133
Momoko might be cursed from
the photo I took, look.

133
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,929
(shouting)

134
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,410
- Oh, I'm fine, really,

135
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,583
just a little tightness in my chest.

136
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:30,240
I think I need a bigger bra.

137
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,587
Satsuki, do you have any?

138
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:32,920
Oh, what am I saying?

139
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,380
- [Leo] It could be
supernatural paralysis.

140
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,213
- Huh?

141
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:37,046
- Hey!

142
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:38,170
- What, what are you not telling me?

143
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,400
- Well, Leo,

144
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,769
Leo thinks the reason
you collapsed is that,

145
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,269
are you gonna tell her or not?

146
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,420
Well, they say a picture's
worth a thousand words, so.

147
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,940
Hey, your hair looks really good though.

148
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sure no one will
notice your third hand.

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,760
- This isn't going to
show up on the internet

150
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,740
or anything, is it?

151
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,210
- No, only the ones of
Satsuki in the locker room.

152
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,280
Praise God.

153
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,460
Well, if you think that's weird

154
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,830
wait 'til you see this.

155
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,467
Seriously, this ought to
get a rise out of you.

156
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,253
(Leo screams)

157
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:14,086
- Excellent.

158
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:15,000
- Hey, what meds are you on?

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,333
- Don't panic, but you have to see this.

160
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:21,457
(Leo screams)

161
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:22,736
- Leo, you fag.

162
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,210
Two words, right breast left breast.

163
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,380
- Cover those puppies up,

164
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,239
I'll ask the nurse for
some Creme De La Mer.

165
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,739
(door clicks)

166
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,569
(dramatic musical score)

167
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:35,652
(suspenseful music)

168
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,533
- It's the ghost of a woman.

169
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,060
For the life of me,

170
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,020
I can't figure out why
I attract these types.

171
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,583
I mean, is it me, something I'm doing?

172
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,070
She came to my bed last
night, just staring at me.

173
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,540
I can't tell my parents.

174
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,313
I wasn't going to tell the doctor.

175
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,600
Hey, wait a minute.

176
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,490
Why did you guys bring me any candy?

177
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,113
Or flowers, are you even my friends?

178
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,380
Get out.

179
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,660
(Leo panting)

180
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,327
(ominous music)

181
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:13,465
(dramatic musical score)

182
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:14,298
(Leo yelps)

183
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:16,279
(train whooshes)

184
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,984
(Leo screams)

185
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,761
(tires screech)

186
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,253
- Watch out, stupid Jew.

187
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,960
(bell rings)

188
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,443
- Stupid gentile.

189
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,360
- [Amanojaku] I'm betting
it's a zip code spirit.

190
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,790
- 90210?

191
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,730
- A human soul that
couldn't rest in peace.

192
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,790
So they stay in the place
where they bit the big one,

193
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,120
causing all kinds of trouble.

194
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,830
You know, as in zip code.

195
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,680
- Are you sure?

196
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,010
I think the skin cream's going to help.

197
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:44,920
It's expensive.

198
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,360
You're telling me it's
not a rash, it's a ghost?

199
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,508
- [Amanojaku] God, you are so smart.

200
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:51,049
- But that's not right.

201
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,537
She, Momoko hasn't done anything wrong.

202
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:54,480
- And you're retarded.

203
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,540
Life isn't fair, is it?

204
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,040
Zipcode spirits have a huge case

205
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
of sour grapes over how they died.

206
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,920
And they just love to share
their misery with the living.

207
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,170
If you bother them, they'll
curse you just for spite.

208
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,823
Poor little Cathy Christian.

209
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:10,041
(match strikes)

210
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,500
(ominous music)

211
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,841
- Hang in there, Sister Christian.

212
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,520
(sings softly)

213
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,503
Focus, Leo.

214
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:27,290
(sings) God that song is addictive.

215
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,730
Come on, Leo, you just have to save her.

216
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,561
Be gone imprinted shadow!

217
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:32,820
Yeah.

218
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,487
(ominous music)

219
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,870
- [Momoko] Whoa!

220
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,450
- I command you, imprinted shadow,

221
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,165
be gone in the name
Kentax and Podak, be gone!

222
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,720
(table rattles)

223
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,310
Wow, I always knew photographic companies

224
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,750
were named after semi-satanic deities.

225
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,120
Good, let's see.

226
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,220
In the name of Nanon,
in the name of Likon,

227
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,020
and Jupee and Fossilhad,

228
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,720
and that cheap one from
Falgreens my mom buys me.

229
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,393
And, I don't know, Etch a Sketch.

230
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:05,200
(Momoko gasps)

231
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,060
Be gone in the name of crayons,

232
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,050
and number two pencils,

233
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,364
and Hell, number one pencils.

234
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:13,031
(ominous music)

235
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:15,877
- Jesus, help!

236
00:10:15,877 --> 00:10:16,960
Lord, please!

237
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:20,708
(glass breaks)

238
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,208
(Leo screams)

239
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:24,882
(fire roars)

240
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:26,758
(Leo screams)

241
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:29,322
(glass shatters)

242
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,260
(wind blows)

243
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,093
(door clicks)

244
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:33,600
- God, dammit, Leo.

245
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,183
What the hell are you doing?

246
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,247
- Is she grabbing her boobies?

247
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:44,080
(dramatic musical beat)

248
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,290
What is it about that girl and lesbians?

249
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,840
Wait a minute.

250
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,910
Gasp, oh, no, Momoko.

251
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,560
- Leo, Leo, Leo, God dammit,
God dammit, God dammit.

252
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,020
(Leo pants)

253
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,770
(dramatic music)

254
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,030
(muffled speech)

255
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,049
- [Nurse] What?

256
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,799
(muffled speech)

257
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,519
- [Nurse] I can't understand you.

258
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,269
(muffled speech)

259
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,190
- [Nurse] This girl's going to die.

260
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,919
- Momoko, darling.

261
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,752
- Ow!

262
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:26,640
- Darling.

263
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,120
- Darling, sorry, the meeting ran late.

264
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,320
- You never sleep with me, either.

265
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,588
That goddamn company!

266
00:11:31,588 --> 00:11:32,930
(muffled speech)

267
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,073
- Oh, what?

268
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:36,823
(muffled speech)

269
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,249
- My poor little darling.

270
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:43,887
- I'm leaving you Harold.

271
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:45,494
(rapid footsteps clatter)

272
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:46,327
- [Leo] Momoko!

273
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:49,580
- Wait, are you a very
close friend of hers?

274
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,537
- Yes, I am, what's
happened to my chicken?

275
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:53,700
(bed rattles)

276
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,400
- Oh, you precious little lamb.

277
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,393
She's a goner.

278
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,193
- She is?

279
00:11:58,193 --> 00:11:59,940
- [Momoko's Father] Darling, darling.

280
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,902
(dramatic musical beats)

281
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:03,753
- Samara?

282
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:07,288
(wind whistles)

283
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:09,871
(Leo whimpers)

284
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:13,882
(footsteps clack)

285
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:18,106
- Dumbass!

286
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:21,433
(Leo screams)

287
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,520
You think "I did the spell wrong,"

288
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,020
is going to work on me?

289
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,330
I'm a sexually frustrated fourth grader

290
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,210
and you've ruined my boob
flash chances once already.

291
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,790
If Momoko dies, I'll kill you.

292
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,950
- [Keiichirou] Leave him alone!

293
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,940
- Stop it, Leo's only trying to help.

294
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,210
He's failing miserably, of course.

295
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,780
But he's trying to help.

296
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,823
- Sorry, Leo.

297
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,470
- [Amanojaku] Don't beat yourselves up.

298
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,142
That's my job.

299
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:44,028
(Leo gasps)

300
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,040
- I hate you!

301
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,530
- You kids did what you could.

302
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,224
The zip code spirit's curse is too strong.

303
00:12:49,224 --> 00:12:51,960
- No, no, this is all my fault.

304
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,840
I was trying to take pictures of a ghost

305
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,093
and she's way too camera shy.

306
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:57,164
- [Satsuki] Suck it up.

307
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:58,897
- Amanojaku, you're a great spirit

308
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:01,190
who knows about things.

309
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,020
Please tell me what to do.

310
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:05,630
I'm begging you.

311
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,550
- Oh my heavens, I'm
like the wailing wall.

312
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,000
Get up, I can't stand to
see the Jews suffer anymore.

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,520
This curse isn't your fault.

314
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,000
This zip code spirit has a
serious grudge against somebody.

315
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,430
- You mean like in the movie?

316
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,470
- Exactly, is Ms. Freddie Prinze Jr.

317
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,800
the worst actress or what?

318
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,450
But if you really want to
help out the zip code chick

319
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,390
you just need to ask her
what needs to be done

320
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,120
to soothe her feelings.

321
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,363
- How about cash?

322
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,840
(bird warbles)

323
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,260
Eggs, juice box, and
three kinds of flowers,

324
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,890
and none of it on sale.

325
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,760
If Momoko lives, she's
going to pay me back,

326
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,170
with interest.

327
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,340
Don't look at me like that.

328
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,193
Remember, I bought all those
disposable cameras, too.

329
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,284
- Leo, might want to take a look at this.

330
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:53,117
- What?

331
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:01,181
(bowl rings)

332
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:02,014
- [Leo] Order up.

333
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:03,431
I'm just kidding.

334
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,130
- My daughter's dead and
you're making food jokes?

335
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,760
Many people have said they've
seen her there, you know?

336
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,110
- [Satsuki] She's busy.

337
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,207
- Very, it's been three years now.

338
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:17,810
Shizuko was a tragic hit and run victim

339
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,380
near that very railroad crossing.

340
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,530
She was engaged to be married.

341
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,830
I don't know why she was trolling

342
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,982
around the railroad tracks.

343
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:28,530
Shizuko was quite a little tramp.

344
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,860
Not my fault, I tried to raise her right.

345
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,683
I, guess once a slut,
always a slut. (sobs)

346
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,673
We never found her engagement ring.

347
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,160
- Was it expensive?

348
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,680
- I don't think so, he got it at Jared's.

349
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,460
It never really fit right.

350
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,260
Her fiance was engaged once, before.

351
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,770
Probably, probably to some
ugly fat girl, you know?

352
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,113
Wynonna Judd or Carnie
Wilson, maybe Nell Carter.

353
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,820
Where's the justice?

354
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,550
Here this loser finally finds

355
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,770
an attractive, thin girl to marry

356
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,660
and she has to die.

357
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,610
She never got to do the
things she wanted to do.

358
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,920
Cure cancer, win the Nobel peace prize,

359
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,260
have a four way with Jude Law,
Clive Owen, and Denny Glover.

360
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,000
- [Satsuki] Why didn't you
tell her about the photo?

361
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,600
We were there for hours listening

362
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,070
to that woman go on,
and on, dead daughter.

363
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,180
- [Leo] what am I supposed to say?

364
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,230
Your daughter's being a little bitch

365
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,660
and is trying to kill our friend?

366
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,110
I don't want her comin' after me.

367
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,800
- [Satsuki] Yeah, I
guess you can't say that.

368
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,950
- [Hajime] Sure he can.

369
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,279
- That does it, I'll find the ring.

370
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,696
- [Together] Huh?

371
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:39,706
- [Satsuki] Leo!

372
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:40,539
- [Hajime] Don't you
think about pawning it

373
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,420
if you find it!

374
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,753
- [Satsuki] Leo!

375
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:50,112
(ominous music)

376
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,950
(dramatic music score)

377
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,617
(grass rustles)

378
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,320
- Leo, just give it up.

379
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
- It's been three years
since the accident.

380
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,730
I'm sure some other Jews found it

381
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,190
and melted it down by now.

382
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,800
- You know, you're pissing me off.

383
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,343
You'd do the same thing
and you're not Jewish.

384
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,860
- [Satsuki] He's right, you would.

385
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,250
- I have to find that ring
to save Momoko's life.

386
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,310
You could get down here
and help me, you know?

387
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,323
- I think you want it for yourself.

388
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,770
- Where do you think you're going?

389
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,330
- Are you going home?

390
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,760
- Good God his people
wanted the desert for years.

391
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,310
I'm going home to get him my flashlight

392
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,510
if that's okay with you.

393
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,563
- Excellent.

394
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,660
- Oh!

395
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,930
(dramatic musical score)

396
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,810
Hey heads up.

397
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,643
- Huh?

398
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,820
(high pitched whistle)

399
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,653
What the hell are you doing?

400
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:46,010
- [Leo] Look at her pupils!

401
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:46,843
- [Hajime] K-hole!

402
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:50,680
- No way, but Momoko
doesn't even own a cat.

403
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,513
Hold it.

404
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,599
(paper rustles)

405
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,490
(Leo gasps)

406
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,380
It's the Ring, I mean the Grudge,

407
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,735
what movie are we ripping off again?

408
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,524
- [Hajime] Grudge.
- [Satsuki And Keii] Ring.

409
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:04,410
(train signal chimes)

410
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,410
(suspenseful music)

411
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,420
- Amtrak.

412
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,853
- She'll get run over.

413
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,800
- [Satsuki] Move, dammit!

414
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,730
- Samara, I mean Shizuko,

415
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,760
I'm sorry you never got married,

416
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,319
but that's no reason for this.

417
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,340
- Get out of the way, stupid.

418
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,740
- Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

419
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,869
- God, how much weight did
you gain in that hospital?

420
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:25,839
(Hajime grunts)

421
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,850
(Satsuki yelps)

422
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,310
- Man down.

423
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,620
(suspenseful music)

424
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,116
- Momoko, stop!

425
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:37,783
(train rumbles)

426
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,690
My god, isn't that hurting your feet?

427
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,250
I'm sorry I took your picture,

428
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,380
and while were at it, I apologize
for Jennifer Aniston, too.

429
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,260
(Leo grunts)

430
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,871
And while I'm apologizing for things,

431
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,420
let me say I'm sorry for
this erection I have.

432
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,253
I know it's weird,

433
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:57,039
but it tends to happen a lot when I jog.

434
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,150
I'd be a natural for track,

435
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,840
but I experience terrible wind shear.

436
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,719
The baton relay's entirely
out of the question.

437
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,930
(train whistles)

438
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,391
- Keiichirou has to pee!

439
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:06,990
- Hello!

440
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,520
- Oh my god, does this
make me a necrophiliac?

441
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,980
Or am I a coma-philiac?

442
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,470
I mean, is there such a thing?

443
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,265
There hasn't been a talk show about this.

444
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:17,079
Oh, what do I know?

445
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,831
(suspenseful music)

446
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:21,029
(tires screech)

447
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,446
(wind blows)

448
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,143
- You all right?

449
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:26,065
Hey?

450
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:28,049
(heart beat thumps)

451
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,632
(man whistles)

452
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:40,919
(man gasps and screams)

453
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,079
(thunder crashes)

454
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,412
Not another one.

455
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:49,311
(ring clangs)

456
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:52,252
(man whistles)

457
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,399
(Momoko screams)

458
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,066
(train rumbles)

459
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,067
- [Satsuki] Momoko, you're all right!

460
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,336
(Leo sobs)

461
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:07,667
- Yeah.

462
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:08,580
- [Keiichirou] Nice to have you back.

463
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,560
You really want fast.

464
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,240
I don't have to pee anymore.

465
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,783
- Leo, shut up.

466
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,444
- Quit crying, big pussy.

467
00:19:18,444 --> 00:19:19,343
- I'm confused!

468
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,990
- Thank you, thanks Leo.

469
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,260
You see everything's clear now.

470
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,050
- [Satsuki] Say what?

471
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,190
- I saw the ring.

472
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,583
I know where it is now.

473
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:33,365
(dramatic music)

474
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:35,380
- [Satsuki] You're telling me

475
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,790
we're going to find the
ring in a place like this?

476
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,743
- [Momoko] Yes, Shizuko told me.

477
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,877
In that taxi.

478
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:45,710
- Right.

479
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,457
- [Satsuki] It's gonna be locked.

480
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,610
(lock clicks)

481
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,960
- [Hajime] What's there
to steal, spare turban?

482
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,720
Told you so.

483
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,949
- [Momoko] Hajime, I want you to look

484
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,950
under the seat and see if you can find it.

485
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,103
- [Hajime] Yes, missus.

486
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:05,720
(cloth rustles)

487
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,553
- Well?

488
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:10,117
- Hello.

489
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:11,783
- That's it.

490
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:14,030
I know this is Shizuko's lost ring.

491
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,300
- But hey, Shizuko was
a hit and run victim,

492
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,410
wasn't she?

493
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,580
Why was her lost ring in
the bottom of a smelly cab?

494
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,300
- You're not that bright, are you?

495
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,630
Okay, the hit and run
driver tried to put Shizuko

496
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,660
into the car to take her to the hospital.

497
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,330
But when he saw that he killed her,

498
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,430
he didn't repent on his knees to the Lord,

499
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,557
probably due to his half
Pakistani bloodline,

500
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:35,290
those poor judged to hellbound heathens.

501
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,930
Her ring then fell into the cab.

502
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,280
- So then the Pakistani half-breed cabby

503
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,640
is Shizuko's murderer.

504
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,387
- Hey, I'm not Pakistani.

505
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:44,220
(all gasp)

506
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,299
What the hell do you think
your kids are doing here?

507
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,793
- Turban hunting?

508
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:53,190
(all scream)

509
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,290
- [Driver] Why don't we
get a lock on this lot?

510
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,103
For crying out loud, brats these days.

511
00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:01,645
(lock clicks)

512
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:03,467

00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:16,060

517
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,056
Stupid trains.

518
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,397
- [Ghost] I found it.

519
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:30,026
(man yelps)

520
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:30,859
- My ring.

521
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,763
See?

522
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,627
