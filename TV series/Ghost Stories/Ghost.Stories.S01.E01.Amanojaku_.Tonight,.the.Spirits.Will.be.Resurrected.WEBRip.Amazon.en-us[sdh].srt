1
00:00:02,216 --> 00:00:04,880
(wind whistling)
(door creaking)

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,313
- Hey, is someone here?

3
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:09,789
(clock tolling)

4
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:13,039
(light bulb crackling)

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,307
Hey, quit messing around!

6
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:23,512
(eerie rattling)

7
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:29,185
(eerie whooshing)

8
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,247
(man gasping)

9
00:00:35,247 --> 00:00:37,938
(man gasping)

10
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,294
(man gasping)
(eerie music)

11
00:00:40,294 --> 00:00:43,354
- [Ghostly Voice] Behind you.

12
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:46,021
(man screaming)

13
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:53,394
(singer singing in Japanese)
(energetic upbeat music)

14
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:22,302
(ominous music)

15
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:27,816
(bright upbeat music)

16
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,575
- Hey, there it is!

17
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,244
(truck rumbling)

18
00:02:35,244 --> 00:02:37,837
Is that the new school we'll go to?

19
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:39,160
- You know, a long time ago

20
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,830
your grandmother was the principal here

21
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,510
and this is actually the place

22
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,883
where your mother and I first met.

23
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:47,274
- I kinda like the old school better.

24
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:48,337
(Kaya meowing)

25
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:50,630
- No no, you're looking
at the old schoolhouse,

26
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,832
the school you two are gonna
be going to is next door.

27
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:53,915
- [Both] Huh?

28
00:02:56,973 --> 00:03:00,047
- [Keiichirou] Awesome,
it's a brand new building!

29
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,200
- That's great!

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,280
I was kinda worried there
weren't gonna be any,

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,320
you know, modern bathrooms.

32
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,843
- So you were scared too then, huh?

33
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:10,171
- Well, I wasn't scared exactly.

34
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:13,295
(eerie whooshing)

35
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:14,310
- [Keiichirou] Whatcha lookin' at?

36
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,560
- [Reiichirou] Satsuki, get back in here,

37
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
you'll get your head cut off!

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,526
- [Satsuki] Oh, Dad, you worry too much!

39
00:03:18,526 --> 00:03:21,359
(eerie whooshing)

40
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,350
- [Reiichirou] Put that in the back room.

41
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,210
- [Mover] You got it.

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,970
- The rest of them will be all right,

43
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,610
the movers will take
care of it, don't worry.

44
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,190
- Why you wanna live in your dead wife's

45
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,570
old house is beyond me.

46
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,599
It's sick, you're sick!

47
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,056
- Wow, Dad!

48
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:43,246
Grandpa, this place is so big!

49
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:44,333
Can we go upstairs?

50
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,150
- Sure but don't bother them.
- Yeah!

51
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,376
- When this bitch kicks,
I'm moving to Vegas.

52
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,756
(Reiichirou chuckling)

53
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:54,700
- Wow, all ready for us to move in!

54
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,533
- Wow, hey!

55
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,780
You think it's okay if we
make this our game room?

56
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,930
- Well, let's ask Dad about it later.

57
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,649
(Satsuki chuckling)

58
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:04,056
- Ooh, white panties!

59
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:06,072
(Satsuki yelping)

60
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:07,910
(Satsuki screaming)

61
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,560
Yo, my name's Hajime.

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,620
You're the new transfer
student, aren't you?

63
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,250
- Yes, but it's none of your business!

64
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,860
I guess you're the new pervert?

65
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,693
- Whatever!

66
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,370
I was here first you know!

67
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,266
Listen, you flashed me, remember that!

68
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:21,780
- [Reiichirou] Satsuki, Keiichirou?

69
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,600
Help me with your mother, will you?

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,090
- [Both] Okay!

71
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,880
- Just grab her picture.

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,713
- Okay.

73
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:29,692
Bleh!

74
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,200
- So she doesn't have a mother.

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,033
Sad!

76
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:41,422
(traffic humming)
(birds chirping)

77
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:44,412
(students chattering)

78
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:45,710
- You sure you both are okay?

79
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,830
- [Satsuki] It'll be all
right, don't worry about us!

80
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,960
Just don't be late for
your first day of work.

81
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,793
- I won't.

82
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:53,420
Now remember you two,
just say no to everything.

83
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,846
- [Satsuki] Okay.

84
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:56,846
- [Both] Goodbye, Daddy!

85
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:58,840
- All right, Keiichirou-
- Hey!

86
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,740
- Out with it!

87
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,931
Ah-ha!

88
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:02,424
(Kaya meowing)

89
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:04,560
(sighing) Why did you bring him with you?

90
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,280
- Well, because I don't
have any friends here yet.

91
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,980
The teacher's gonna get mad at you.

92
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,924
Take him back-
(Kaya meowing)

93
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:10,757
Hey!

94
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,813
- Kaya!

95
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,730
- Kaya, no!

96
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:19,045
(Kaya meowing)

97
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:22,603
Kaya!

98
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:24,063
Kaya!

99
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:29,063
(leaves rustling)
(birds chirping)

100
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:30,432
- Hey, there he is!

101
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:31,265
(Kaya meowing)

102
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,015
- He went in the old schoolhouse.

103
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:36,014
Let's go.

104
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:46,436
(wind whooshing)
(both screaming)

105
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:49,512
It, it, it was just the wind, yeah.

106
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:52,142
(eerie tense music)

107
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:54,400
(eerie whooshing)

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,567
(Keiichirou babbling)

109
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:02,962
(Satsuki gulping)

110
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,581
(eerie whooshing)

111
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:08,364
There's nothing to be
afraid of, Keiichirou,

112
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:10,522
monsters only get evil
people like Republicans

113
00:06:10,522 --> 00:06:11,539
and we're not old enough to vote!

114
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,971
(doors slamming)
(both screaming)

115
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:17,113
(boys yelling)

116
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:18,520
(Satsuki and Keiichirou screaming)

117
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,032
- White again! Well!

118
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:20,865
(boys snickering)

119
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:22,230
- [Satsuki] (sobbing) Pervert!

120
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,980
- Well, I've been called worse than that.

121
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,220
- You're stalking me.

122
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,530
- You flatter yourself way too much, baby.

123
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,620
Look, I just came here
to give you a warning

124
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,490
and that's all I came here for.

125
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,510
- What warning?

126
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,893
- No trespassing in the old
schoolhouse, with good reason.

127
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,100
- But Kaya came in here.

128
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,070
- What's a Kaya?

129
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,400
- It's our cat, idiot.

130
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,570
Now be a good neighbor
and help us look for him.

131
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,991
- No thanks, I'm getting
the hell outta here!

132
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,170
(Hajime yelping)
- What's your problem?

133
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,564
We're just looking for our cat.

134
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:50,440
(eerie whooshing)

135
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,149
- Well, this place is haunted.

136
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,210
- [Both] Huh?

137
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,600
- Allow the school's
top psychical researcher

138
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,760
to explain it to you.

139
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,690
Oh, the name's Leo by the way.

140
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,970
You see the numerous-
- Don't be stupid!

141
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,420
Just because we're new to town

142
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,080
doesn't mean we're from the sticks.

143
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,410
- I hear non-believers tend
to get targeted even more.

144
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,506
They come after you and
get you from behind!

145
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:13,140
(Satsuki gasping)

146
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,554
What, what is it?

147
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:16,612
(eerie whooshing)

148
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:19,604
(Hajime and Leo yelping)

149
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:21,193
- I'm sorry.

150
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:22,973
I didn't scare you, did I?

151
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,920
(Hajime and Leo sighing)

152
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,055
- You're an older classman.

153
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:30,693
- Giggity-giggity.

154
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,400
- Oh, there's no need to apologize.

155
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,930
I'm the one who's just moved to town,

156
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,180
I should be introducing myself to you!

157
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,673
I'm Satsuki Manshita.

158
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:40,890
- Manshita?

159
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,723
- That's right.

160
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:45,760
- Hm, I'm Momoko, I think I'm
in the class ahead of you.

161
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,440
- Really? A little older?

162
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
How do you do?

163
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,410
- Not too good, actually.

164
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,590
That big gust of wind blew my hat off.

165
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,444
It flew in here, I came to find it.

166
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:55,390
(air whooshing)

167
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,440
- I can help!

168
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,186
- Yes, why don't you let us
look for your hat for you?

169
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:01,520
- Oh, that's so nice of you!

170
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,560
- [Hajime] Allow me to
introduce myself, I'm Hajime.

171
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,460
- [Leo] And my name is, uh, call me Leo.

172
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,610
- [Momoko] Hi, Leo.

173
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,220
- Okay, you'll find a hat but not a cat?

174
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,200
- [Hajime] Mind your own
business, panty girl!

175
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,040
Now I believe you said it flew in here?

176
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,620
Don't be afraid, Momoko, it's all right,

177
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,950
I'm right here with you.

178
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,980
- [Leo] Yeah, and, uh, me too.

179
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,290
- You're such brave, strong, handsome men.

180
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,060
Have you accepted Jesus
as your personal savior?

181
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,420
- No, I'm Jewish.

182
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,150
- I just wanna make
sure that you're saved.

183
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,200
I am and ever since I was
saved I've had the gifts

184
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,360
and I can sense this place is haunted.

185
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,520
As a matter of fact, I
feel a very strong sense

186
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,482
of evil right now, just around the corner.

187
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:43,146
(floorboards creaking)
(eerie music)

188
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:44,061
(Leo screaming)

189
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:46,063
(all except Momoko screaming)

190
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:48,440
- It's that the statue
of Kinjiro Ninomiya?

191
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,286
- Why, yes it is, and he
looks really cute in my hat.

192
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:52,140
(blow thudding)
(Leo yelping)

193
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,110
- You stupid idiot!

194
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,090
The only thing that scared me

195
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,080
was you screaming like little girl!

196
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,930
Ass.

197
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,777
- But wasn't that statue
outside a while ago?

198
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:01,777
(eerie whooshing)

199
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:03,940
(all yelping)
- Christ!

200
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,833
(all screaming)
- Run!

201
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,559
(all panting)

202
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,610
- Sweet Jesus, that was scary!

203
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,270
- Yeah, moving statues are.

204
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,447
- The stories of paranormal-
- Here.

205
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:20,280
- Activity in the old-
- God bless you!

206
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,700
- Schoolhouse are true!

207
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,820
- Hey, Hardy Boy, let's
just get outta here.

208
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,410
- [Keiichirou] We can't
leave, Kaya's still-

209
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,310
- I don't care about your
cat, he's probably dead.

210
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,143
- Shut up!
(Keiichirou sobbing)

211
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:29,937
Kaya's a very special cat!

212
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,830
Kaya just showed up on the
day of our mother's funeral.

213
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,310
Our dead mother!

214
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,820
You feel bad now?

215
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,210
- I can only hope she knew about Jesus.

216
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,230
- But what if you're-
(Kaya meowing)

217
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,438
- Hey, it's Kaya!

218
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:45,271
(Kaya meowing)

219
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:46,104
- [Satsuki] Dead mother!

220
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:46,963
- [Hajime] Oh, all right.

221
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:48,130
- [Leo] But...

222
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:50,714
(water dripping)

223
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:53,002
- Kaya!
(Kaya meowing)

224
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:54,178
Where are you?

225
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,046
(tense spooky music)

226
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:57,421
(Kaya meowing)

227
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:58,707
- There he is!

228
00:09:58,707 --> 00:09:59,820
- What's the matter?

229
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,244
What is it, Kaya?

230
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,944
(dog snarling)

231
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:04,523
- [Keiichirou] Uh-oh!

232
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:06,130
- So that's why he's afraid.
- It's just a stupid dog.

233
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,017
- But what's a dog doing-
- Hey dog, leave our cat alone

234
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:12,055
he didn't do anything to you!
- In the old schoolhouse?

235
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:12,888
- Shut up!

236
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,216
Who you calling a dog?

237
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:16,111
- What the hell?
- Oh my goodness!

238
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:17,136
- Kids!

239
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:19,379
(eerie whooshing)

240
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:21,261
(Kaya meowing)
- Kaya, come back!

241
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,541
Let's follow him!

242
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,479
- [Leo] What if we meant
to follow our own path?

243
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:27,595
(door rattling)

244
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:28,533
- [Satsuki] Kaya?

245
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,163
- Fear not, the Lord God is with thee.

246
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,030
- But someone else isn't!

247
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,080
- That's the girl's restroom
and I don't have to go.

248
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,930
- I do have to go, but I'm
pee shy so I need my privacy.

249
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,120
- Shut up and get inside!

250
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:43,035
- Bully.

251
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:44,780
- They say Hanako the
Bathroom Ghost live here.

252
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,320
- In the name of Jesus-

253
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,153
- What are you doing?

254
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:48,340
Will you stop that?

255
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,299
- [Momoko] I'm casting her out.

256
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,548
- Yes?
(all except Momoko yelping)

257
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:53,109
(door creaking)

258
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:53,942
(air whistling)

259
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:56,033
- It worked, wow.

260
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:58,183
- [Satsuki] When you
gotta go, you gotta go!

261
00:10:58,183 --> 00:10:59,016
- [Hajime] Huh?

262
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:00,789
- What should we play today?

263
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:03,446
(Hajime and Leo screaming)

264
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:08,446
(engine revving)
(dramatic music)

265
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:13,947
(both screaming)
(motorcycle whooshing)

266
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:15,830
- What? What did we miss?

267
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,570
- He, he needs some head.

268
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,730
- And I don't wanna find out why.

269
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,585
Please, God, can we go now?

270
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:23,502
(eerie chittering)

271
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,193
- I wanna go home now.
(Keiichirou sobbing)

272
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:30,009
(eerie chittering)

273
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:32,676
(all screaming)

274
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:38,934
(eerie chittering)
(all screaming)

275
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:47,140
(bucket clanging)
(Hajime yelping)

276
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,706
(all grunting)
(all crashing)

277
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:49,539
- Huh?

278
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:52,456
(eerie chittering)

279
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:57,501
Ah?

280
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:58,334
(all sighing)

281
00:11:58,334 --> 00:11:59,630
- Oh, Hallelujah.

282
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,870
- I remember now.

283
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,620
I read in a book once that when
being chased by a Teke Teke,

284
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,553
you should crawl down
onto the ground, yeah.

285
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:06,386
(blow thudding)
(Leo yelping)

286
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:08,640
- You could've shared that with
the class a little earlier!

287
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,963
Come on, let's get out
of this stupid place.

288
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,910
Oh no.
(doorknob rattling)

289
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,010
- What's the matter?

290
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,100
- What do you think's the matter?

291
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,234
- We're locked in?

292
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:19,783
Help, somebody help!
(Keiichirou sobbing)

293
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:21,483
Is anyone out there?
- I haven't even

294
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:22,858
bar mitzvahed yet.
- Hey, somebody open

295
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,110
the damn door!
- Dear Lord.

296
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,140
- Somebody please help us!
(Keiichirou babbling)

297
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,690
- [Hajime] Not in my ear, please.

298
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,139
- Shut up.
- Is that you, Lord?

299
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,510
- [Leo] I can't take it anymore!

300
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,293
- [Hajime] Would you get a
hold of yourself, you big baby?

301
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,126
- We're not alone.

302
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:36,876
(eerie laughing)

303
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,325
(Satsuki gasping)

304
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:42,158
Huh?

305
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:44,908
(ghost laughing)

306
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,980
What is that?
(pensive music)

307
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,260
- A really ugly ghost?

308
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,656
- Obviously a demon straight
from the pit of hell.

309
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:52,489
(camera clicking)

310
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:53,740
- Let's you and I be friends, Satsuki.

311
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,310
- What? You gotta be kidding me!

312
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,760
- Dead mother, you're
lonely, you need a friend!

313
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,090
- No orphan's that lonely!

314
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,730
- Believe it, you'd rather have me

315
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,000
as a friend than an enemy.

316
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,079
(eerie whooshing)

317
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,790
(chandelier crashing)
(all yelping)

318
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,520
(ghost laughing)

319
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,573
- No way!

320
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,662
(cabinet crashing)
(Leo yelping)

321
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,162
(glass shattering)
(Satsuki yelping)

322
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:21,937
(Keiichirou babbling)

323
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:24,118
(ghost snickering)

324
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:27,440
- Okay, and now it's a bigger ugly ghost.

325
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,850
- Come on, Satsuki, let's be friends.

326
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,122
- Me and you friends?

327
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:33,400
(Keiichirou sobbing)

328
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,168
- Hello!

329
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:38,537
(objects crashing)

330
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:39,428
- Look out!

331
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:41,303
(umbrellas whooshing)
(Satsuki yelping)

332
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:43,033
(umbrellas crashing)

333
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,920
(Keiichirou babbling)

334
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,417
- This friend deal is off.

335
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,770
(ghost cackling)
(grim music)

336
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,720
- [Hajime] Oh crap!

337
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:56,793
- Who'd wanna be friends with you anyway?

338
00:13:56,793 --> 00:14:00,010
Especially after the grudge
I've held against you for years!

339
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,879
- But I just met you.

340
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,047
- Keiichirou, do you
know the sinner's prayer?

341
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:06,112
- I believe its size is
increasing in direct proportion

342
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,540
to our rising level of fear, yeah.

343
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,749
- Keiichirou, don't be afraid!

344
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,776
(Satsuki gasping)

345
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:14,276
(ghost snarling)
(Keiichirou whimpering)

346
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:15,452
(ghost roaring)

347
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:17,296
(all screaming)

348
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:19,809
- [Ghost] Look at you run!

349
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,297
- I said don't be afraid!

350
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:23,220
- Why the hell would I listen to you?

351
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,484
(all panting)
(Keiichirou panting)

352
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:26,734
Close the door!

353
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:29,607
- [Ghost] Where are you?

354
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:32,607
(suspenseful music)

355
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,818
(all sighing)

356
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:41,401
(Kaya meowing)

357
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:44,520
(Kaya meowing)

358
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,563
- This is the principal's office.

359
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:50,248
(Kaya meowing)

360
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:52,589
(Satsuki gasping)

361
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:53,422
Kaya!

362
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,973
Principals always look like lesbians.

363
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,470
Mom?

364
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,007
No, it can't be!

365
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,300
- And this is actually the place

366
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,690
where your mother and I first met.

367
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,710
- I heard they looked alike

368
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,550
but I didn't think they
looked this much alike.

369
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,018
- What is that?
(Kaya meowing)

370
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:17,460
- Well-
- She looks like-

371
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,943
- Careful!

372
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:20,640
- No, that picture.

373
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,420
When I volunteered at the wonderful

374
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,630
Exodus Homosexual Conversion Camp,

375
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,300
I met this woman who was there who looked

376
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,580
a lot like that lesbian, I mean woman.

377
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,070
- By any chance, you don't
remember what her name was?

378
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,140
- Kayako?

379
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,370
- That's our mother!

380
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,590
- What?

381
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,690
I'm so sorry.

382
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,040
I mean, praise God.

383
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,873
- No way!

384
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:41,170
- What a blessed coincidence
from the Lord, amen.

385
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,020
- I think it's not coincidence.

386
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,160
I mean, maybe Mom is kind
of bringing us all together.

387
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,496
- What's a lesbian?

388
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:49,900
(Keiichirou gasping)
(ghost cackling)

389
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,761
- [Ghost] Found you!

390
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:52,566
(wall crashing)
(all screaming)

391
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,720
(tense dramatic music)

392
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,590
- Take that!

393
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,480
(Hajime grunting)

394
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,250
- Why won't it break?

395
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,920
- [Ghost] You won't be able to leave here

396
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,591
for the rest of your lives!

397
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:05,262
(all screaming)
(ghost laughing)

398
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:07,064
(Keiichirou babbling)

399
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:08,981
Gee, aren't we friends?

400
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,050
- No, we're goners!

401
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:18,500
- Hey, this is that ghost.

402
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,550
- Satan.

403
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,683
- [Hajime] Shut up, it says Amanojaku.

404
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,787
- "March 15th, the Amanojaku appeared.

405
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:28,177
"When I enclosed a flame
inside a magic circle

406
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:30,597
"and began chanting
'Jaku, Jaku, go to sleep,'

407
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:32,357
"It went into the big camphor tree

408
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:34,110
"on the mountain behind the school."

409
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,770
- [Momoko] She bound it
in the name of Jesus.

410
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,600
- That's one way of putting
it, spiritual sleep is another.

411
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,480
- [Hajime] So if we do the same
thing that's written there,

412
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,535
then we can put that ghost to sleep!

413
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,747
- [Amanojaku] (cackling) This is fun!

414
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,360
- Let's just try it!

415
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,060
I'll go draw the magic circle, yeah.

416
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,233
- Or a cross?

417
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:54,430
- (gasping) The science room!

418
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,690
We need to go to the science room.

419
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,374
- That's right, they've
got Bunsen burners!

420
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:59,957
(air warbling)

421
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:06,598
- You can't escape!

422
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:08,367
(Momoko yelping)
(intense music)

423
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:09,200
- Is this enough?

424
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,375
- No, why don't you knock down a wall?

425
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,794
Yes, it's fine!

426
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:14,961
(Keiichirou babbling)

427
00:17:16,664 --> 00:17:17,497
- Got it!

428
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:20,595
- It's done, yeah!

429
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:21,907
(wall crashing)
(Amanojaku roaring)

430
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,215
- Get inside the magic circle!

431
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:25,565
That's not a Bunsen burner!

432
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:26,910
- [Hajime] What do you want from me?

433
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,000
(table crashing)
(Keiichirou screaming)

434
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,443
- Lord, forgive me for
this satanic ritual.

435
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:35,251
(Amanojaku chuckling)
(Keiichirou yelling)

436
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:38,668
(grim suspenseful music)

437
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:41,508
- Got it!

438
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:46,329
- Let's start the magic spell.

439
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:47,481
(Amanojaku roaring)

440
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,692
- [All] Jaku, Jaku, go to sleep!

441
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,692
Jaku, Jaku, go to sleep!

442
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,724
(Amanojaku groaning)

443
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:54,314
(all yelling)

444
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:58,112
(Amanojaku grunting)
(triumphant music)

445
00:17:58,112 --> 00:18:00,199
- [Amanojaku] No!

446
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,334
- [All] Jaku, Jaku, go to sleep!

447
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,077
Jaku, Jaku, go to sleep!

448
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:06,077
(Amanojaku yelling)

449
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:10,525
- [Amanojaku] That book!

450
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:11,950
No!

451
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,029
(Amanojaku groaning)

452
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,189
- [All] Jaku, Jaku, go to sleep!

453
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:16,970
Jaku, Jaku, go to sleep!

454
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,438
(Amanojaku yelling)

455
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:24,438
(Keiichirou babbling)
(Kaya meowing)

456
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:30,760
- Is it gone?

457
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
(all groaning)

458
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,500
- [Leo] Looks like the spell worked.

459
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,333
- We did it.

460
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,190
We got rid of him, we did it!

461
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,470
- Thanks to that somewhat satanic book.

462
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,750
- I guess you're right,

463
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,273
but why was this inside a picture frame?

464
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,533
It's Mom!
- What?

465
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:48,287
- Mom's name is written
right inside of it!

466
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:51,020
"Fifth Grade, Group One, Kayako Kamiyama,"

467
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,999
that was mom's name
before she married Dad!

468
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,570
(Keiichirou babbling)
(somber music)

469
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,610
That's right, Keiichirou,
Mom's looking after us,

470
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,872
even from heaven.

471
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,238
(Keiichirou sobbing)

472
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:05,405
(Keiichirou babbling)

473
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,130
- [Leo] Thank goodness we're outside.

474
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,990
- [Hajime] I'm never going back

475
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,680
in the old schoolhouse again.

476
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,609
Ever. Ever!

477
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,696
(school bell chiming)

478
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,070
- Oh, the bell.

479
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,320
- The school bell.

480
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
School bell?

481
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,710
- Oh no, we're late!

482
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,120
Let's go!
- But wait!

483
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,291
But we were only in the old-
- It's time

484
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,550
to leave school-
- schoolhouse for 20 minutes.

485
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,574
- Students still on campus-
- Was the magic space

486
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:31,880
trapped in time?
- Please leave immediately.

487
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,184
- [PA Announcer] I repeat,
it is time to leave school.

488
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:37,558
Students who are still on-
- I don't suppose any of you-

489
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:38,520
- Campus, please leave-
- Can come up with

490
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,690
a believable excuse?
- School immediately.

491
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,680
- Skipping my first day
of class, I'm screwed!

492
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,000
- Who's gonna believe us?

493
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,330
We missed a whole day of class

494
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,058
because of paranormal activity!

495
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:48,740
(all except Momoko sighing)

496
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,770
- My friends, today we
answered to a higher calling.

497
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,350
We bound an evil spirit

498
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,740
and placed it back in
the big camphor tree.

499
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,770
Hallelujah!

500
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,603
- Hey!

501
00:19:57,603 --> 00:19:58,783
- Oh, what is it now?

502
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,100
- Leo, didn't they chop
down the big camphor tree

503
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
on the mountain the
other day, or am I high?

504
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,180
- You're not high.

505
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,030
Not only was the camphor
tree chopped down,

506
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,470
the whole mountain site is being turned

507
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,140
into residential developments!

508
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,010
- Well, then where's that stupid ghost,

509
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,580
inside one of those condos?

510
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,630
- How would I know?

511
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,830
- Well, he better be gone,

512
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,220
because if he's not he's
gonna be pissed off!

513
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,385
- Oh I'm pissed off all right!
(all gasping)

514
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,689
(Keiichirou babbling)
(suspenseful music)

515
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,385
- [All] Amanojaku!

516
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:25,292
- [Leo] Duck and cover!

517
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,125
- But where,

518
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,466
where's he coming from?
- Where are you?

519
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:29,540
(Keiichirou whimpering)
(Amanojaku cackling)

520
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,630
- I'm here.

521
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,810
Don't think you've gotten the best of me!

522
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,330
It's gonna take a lot more than

523
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,180
five prepubescent
pipsqueaks to get rid of me!

524
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,180
In fact, I'll drag all the
children in this school

525
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,360
into a world of fear and
get my ghostly powers back!

526
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,230
What are you looking at?

527
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,427
I'll strike you down with my...

528
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,344
What the hell?

529
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:52,013
What the hell did you brats do to me?

530
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:53,301
- He's in our damn cat.
- What kind of trick is this?

531
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:54,292
Wait til I get my hands on you!

532
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:55,850
- [Leo] A case of
demonic possession, yeah.

533
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,730
- What are you looking at?

534
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,150
Go away or I'll turn you
into a toad or a snake!

535
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,983
- Black cats have always been evil.

536
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:01,050
- I got an idea!

537
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,460
Why don't you just kill the cat

538
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,890
and that will release my spirit

539
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,700
and I can go back to haunting that school!

540
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,980
- Not an option, but neutering is!

541
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,880
- Of all the forms that
could be banished into,

542
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,270
this is the worst!

543
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm gonna make you pay for this, girly!

544
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,080
- Hey there, what are you kids doing here?

545
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,270
School's over!

546
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,500
Go home, you sillies!

547
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,690
- Oh, thanks!

548
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,073
- Oh, nice cat!

549
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:22,465

(tense music)

551
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,167
- [Man] Yeah, such a pretty cat.

552
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:29,270
- That jerk, pretending to be our cat!

553
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,100
- Don't make him mad!

554
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,730
It's no use, we'll just have
to keep an eye on things

555
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,638
until we find a way to turn
your cat back to normal.

556
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:38,088
- [Satsuki] Well, that blows!

557
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,580
- Interesting, the mountain
where everyone written about

558
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,340
in that diaries is spiritual sleep.

559
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,050
Two generations of your family

560
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,380
have stolen my freedom
and ruined my plans.

561
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,403
You'll pay for this!

The toilet at the old schoolhouse?

573

574
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,388
it looks like a teacher
fell victim too, yeah.

575
