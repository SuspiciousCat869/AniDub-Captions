1
00:00:00,835 --> 00:00:03,024
(flame crackling)

2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:05,691
(ominous music)

3
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:10,747
(girl gasping)

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,647
(wood creaking)

5
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:30,525
(flame roars)
(girl gasping)

6
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:36,512
(ominous music)
(creature growling)

7
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:40,562
(girl whimpers)

8
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:43,145
(girl screams)

9
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:48,418
(flame crackles)

10
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:52,251
(singing in foreign language)

11
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:22,304
(ominous music)

12
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,240
- [Misono] Oh my God, did
that spell work, you know,

13
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,870
like the one where you write
your name in an eraser?

14
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,928
I hear the head cheerleader's
having an abortion.

15
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:32,096
The slut!

16
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:32,950
- [Tomomi] It worked.

17
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,100
- Shut up! Get out!

18
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,290
- [Tomomi] You shut up. Get out.

19
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,610
He talked to me at my locker
and tried to feel me up.

20
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,600
- Wow!

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,093
Worshiping Satan is awesome.

22
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,800
I can't wait to try a spell.

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,980
- God, will you stop
huffing your nail polish?

24
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,630
Remember, Misono, you're the one

25
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,740
who recommended Tomo use that spell.

26
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,615
- Did I? Oh God, you're right.

27
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:52,970
(Misono laughs)

28
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,630
- [Aya] I hate your
laugh, Misono, stop it.

29
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,080
Anyway, did you hear about what happened

30
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,487
between Wade and Honda?

31
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:00,150
[Tomomi] I knew it had to be a spell,

32
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,110
because he is so not into her.

33
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,810
And I hear he is huge.

34
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,310
- [Aya] Yeah, like an elevator button.

35
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,660
- That makes me wonder.

36
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,910
What kind of spell do you
think she used on him?

37
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,860
- [Misono] I know, right?

38
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,660
- [Shinobu] You want me to tell you?

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,153
- Hey, Shinobu.

40
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,290
- You know, I know what spell
she used on him. (giggles)

41
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,740
- It's like "The Craft."

42
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,110
Fairuza Balk.

43
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,070
What the hell kind of name is Fairuza?

44
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,648
Fairuza!

45
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:31,010
Fairuza!

46
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,980
- Knock it off.

47
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,850
- Like I said, they're using spells.

48
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,090
- Doesn't work.

49
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,230
I used a Ouija board once

50
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,140
to contact a dead hooker
I saw on the news,

51
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,640
and she never showed up.

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,473
Bitch.

53
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:43,335
- But what's wrong with little spells?

54
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:44,506
- Hmm?

55
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:46,696
You, you're doing it too!

56
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:48,490
Good Luck Heathcliff key chain!

57
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,070
Pinky manicure!

58
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,320
You're doing spells, too!

59
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,356
- These, these are just-

60
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:54,538
(wind howls)
Woo!

61
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:58,110
(Hajime and Leo gasping)

62
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,970
- And even Good Luck Hello Pussy panties.

63
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,578
You're going straight to hell, young lady.

64
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:04,138
(dramatic music)

65
00:04:04,138 --> 00:04:04,999
- Pervert!

66
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,503
You sick-
- Hey, it's kind of weird

67
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:07,720
you're always hitting!
- Twisted, inconsiderate,

68
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,788
blowhard, disgusting-
- Kaki here is just

69
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:12,038
as guilty as I am!
- Big-time douchebag!

70
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:16,080
- Tony Orlando Good Luck ribbon

71
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,980
for good grades to come to me.

72
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,939
Paris Hilton Foot Kilt for a tighter ass.

73
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:24,690
And a suppository for
a flatter tummy, hmm.

74
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,776
There, I'm good to go.

75
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:30,987
(playful music)

76
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:31,820
- [Boy] Well, Dad calls her a whore,

77
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,248
but I like to call her Mom.

78
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:35,915
(playful music)

79
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,670
- There's the cute, little coven.

80
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,410
Maybe those whorey, little Heathers will

81
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,253
finally let me join their club.

82
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:49,486
Good morning!

83
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:50,710
(Tomomi and Aya gasp)

84
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,770
Thanks for telling me
about that diarrhea spell.

85
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,060
I haven't seen Hajime, all day.

86
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,270
What's the matter? What'd I say?

87
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,103
- [Misono] Gotta go.

88
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:58,936
Late.

89
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,357
- [Shinobu] You sure
know how to clear a room.

90
00:05:04,357 --> 00:05:05,203
- Sorry.

91
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,171
(alarm chimes)

92
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:09,921
(Shinobu scoffs)

93
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,650
- [Tomomi] Are we really gonna do it?

94
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,410
- [Aya] Yeah, black magic.

95
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,360
And I look great in black.

96
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,390
- [Tomomi] No, you don't.

97
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,710
- Relax, what's the
worst that could happen?

98
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,650
US Weekly said that J-Lo
sold her soul to the devil.

99
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,950
- [Tomomi] She married Marc Anthony.

100
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,230
- [Aya] Oh, you're right.

101
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,650
Well, we'll just be smarter.

102
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,072
- [Tomomi] Right.

103
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:35,820
(solemn music)

104
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,210
- So the Bitches of
Eastwick are doing a spell

105
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,950
behind my back, are they?

106
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,788
- Hey there.

107
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:43,100
- (gasps) Don't sneak up on me like that.

108
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,374
- What are you doing?

109
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:46,223
- Nunya ya business, hit the road.

110
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:52,801
(suspenseful music)

111
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,650
- [Shinobu] Ready?

112
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,483
Here we go.

113
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:15,162
(Tomomi gulps)

114
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:19,443
(Tomomi groans)

115
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:20,765
- [Misono] Like, oh my God.

116
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:22,652
(Shinobu laughs)

117
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:25,841
(suspenseful music)

118
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:27,099
- [Tomomi] Hurry up.

119
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:30,238
(Shinobu gasps)

120
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:33,410
(girls gasp)

121
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,870
- I just knew it!

122
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,190
Shame on you, going off

123
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,490
and doing another spell behind my back.

124
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,324
What are you doing?

125
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:40,783
- (scoffs) Nothing!

126
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,901
(ominous music)

127
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,463
- (gasps) Really?

128
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,120
- Hmm?

129
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,953
Mm-hmm.

130
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:50,329
- What?

131
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,610
So what is going on?

132
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,580
- [Misono] Oh, it's just a wish.

133
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,530
- [Satsuki] A wish?

134
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,403
- Yeah, wanna see?

135
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,423
Come on, it'll be fun.

136
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:13,733
(cork squeaking)

137
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,890
(eerie music)

138
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,640
O spirit of bitches, O soul of skanks,

139
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,220
and the fanboy spawn whose breath is rank,

140
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,580
hear my prayer, O powers that be.

141
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,440
With Curious by Britney

142
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,881
and glitter from Claire's Boutique.

143
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,460
Oh my God!

144
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,942
(beep) me, Satan! (beep) me, Satan!

145
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:31,457
(beep) me, Satan!

146
00:07:31,457 --> 00:07:32,396
- [Satsuki] What?

147
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:34,410
- Oh, sorry about that.

148
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,440
I mean, grant our wishes and deep desires.

149
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,220
To hell with right and wrong.

150
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,987
Bitch, I'm on fire!

151
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:44,827
Mm.

152
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:45,857
Heil, Hitler.

153
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:48,926
(ethereal music)

154
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,025
(explosions popping)

155
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:57,025
(solemn music)
(blood splatting)

156
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:58,958
Oh yeah!

157
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:03,226
(fire roars)

158
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,680
(Shinobu sighs)

159
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,340
I wanna cigarette.

160
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,653
A Doral.

161
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,950
- That's weird.

162
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,980
I could've sworn I felt
something prick my finger.

163
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,400
- [Tomomi] Word.

164
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,943
- You're just imagining it.

165
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,730
Maybe it's only that you
want to get preg-satski?

166
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,310
- I was just wondering.

167
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm not gonna get a big ass

168
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,626
and marry some acne-faced rat, am I?

169
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:35,520
- (groans) Hey, I had nothing
to do with that J-Lo thing.

170
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,900
And no, Nervous Nancy,
you'll be just just fine

171
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,440
as long as you don't speak
to anybody about this.

172
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,877
- Like what'd you mean?

173
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,320
- Ah, I told you!

174
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,200
I mean, I told you.

175
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,380
This is a spell that'll
grant you any wish,

176
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,060
but if you talk to anybody
else, or Star Magazine,

177
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,960
before your wish comes true,

178
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,490
all of you dumb bitches will be cursed.

179
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,550
- [Aya] That'd be bad.

180
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,850
- [Tomomi] Worse than bad.

181
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,820
- It'll be all right.

182
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,890
Just make sure none of
you say anything about it.

183
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,890
But if you decide you don't like this,

184
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,202
there's a way to quit in the middle.

185
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:08,035
Okay?

186
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:11,282
(all sigh)

187
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:16,711
- [Amanojaku] Hey, Satsuki.

188
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:18,265
- [Satsuki] What? What do you want?

189
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,930
- [Amanojaku] What did you do?

190
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,580
- What do you mean what did I do?

191
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,640
- Fine, be that way, don't tell me.

192
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,473
I don't care.

193
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:28,230
I'm already in black, so if you die,

194
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,670
I'm good for your funeral.

195
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,147
(Amanojaku yawns)

196
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:37,064
(Amanojaku grunts)

197
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,419
(Satsuki laughs)

198
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:43,336
(Amanojaku laughs)

199
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:48,105
(creepy music)
(Satsuki groaning)

200
00:09:48,105 --> 00:09:51,022
(creature hissing)

201
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:01,985
(Satsuki gasps)

202
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:04,485
(tense music)

203
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:11,445
(air whooshing)
(tense music)

204
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,032
(creature growls)

205
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,699
(Satsuki gasps)

206
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:25,070
(creature panting)

207
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,630
- I can't move.

208
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,544
I can't even say anything.

209
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:34,544
(suspenseful music)

210
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:41,649
It's all right.

211
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,606
Maybe I just left the fan
on, and it's paralyzed me.

212
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:47,370
Wait a minute.

213
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,868
I don't have a fan.

214
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:51,760
(creature growling)

215
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,080
And why do I have the
feeling I'm being watched?

216
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,540
Who is it?

217
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,533
Is someone there?

218
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:03,900
Crap!
(creature roars)

219
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,567
(Satsuki yells)

220
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:10,830
(Satsuki whimpering)

221
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,140
I can move.

222
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,373
And that feeling's gone.

223
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,323
No one's here.

224
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,988
I guess I must've just been imagining it.

225
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,609
Whew!

226
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:29,220
(dramatic music)

227
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,930
(gasps) What?

228
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,763
Oh no!

229
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:34,462
(Satsuki groans)

230
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:36,991
(ominous music)

231
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:38,074
Ooh, Luminol.

232
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,800
(birds twittering)

233
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,330
(Satsuki sighs)

234
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,670
Something was here.

235
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,850
But I don't even know its name.

236
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,880
Looking it up is like
trying to find out how

237
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,740
to spell a word in the dictionary.

238
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,823
I never got that.

239
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,024
(door creaks)

240
00:11:58,024 --> 00:11:59,480
(Satsuki gasps)

241
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,590
- Well, let's go.

242
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,923
If we don't hurry, we'll
be late for school.

243
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,270
- Don't sneak up on me like that.

244
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,330
Go get me my coffee.

245
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,353
Be my bitch!

246
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,803
Can't forget this.

247
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,880
So it showed up at all your places, too?

248
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,120
Jeez, what's she thinking?

249
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,290
The next thing you know,
she'll have us skin a goat.

250
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,470
- [Misono] What should we do?

251
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,950
That blood thing was so gross.

252
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,950
- We abort this like an unwanted child.

253
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,920
Shinobu said we can quit
in the middle of it,

254
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,883
if we wanted to.

255
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,803
- Yeah, but Aya and Shinobu are late.

256
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:39,861
(Satsuki gasps)

257
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:40,760
(Satsuki groans)

258
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,740
- All right, good morning, everybody.

259
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,720
Let's see who's cut class, today.

260
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,293
Aoyama?
- Here!

261
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,830
- Harris?
- Here!

262
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,320
- Tubman Funkowitz?
- Here!

263
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,423
- Bashir?
- Here!

264
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:55,600
- Fister.
- Mr. Sakata?

265
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,380
- You're not Fister. Be quiet.

266
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,230
- I mean, what about,
you skipped Aya Etou.

267
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,380
- Etou?

268
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,860
What are you talkin' about?

269
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,640
There's no girl named Etou in our class.

270
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,473
- Huh?

271
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:09,029
(class laughs)

272
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:09,862
(eerie music)

273
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:10,768
- What?

274
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:12,440
Aya's desk is gone.

275
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,377
This is like that Julianne Moore movie.

276
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,823
(door rattles)

277
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:18,323
(eerie music)

278
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:22,544
(Shinobu laughs)
(Satsuki gasps)

279
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:23,377
(Misono and Tomomi gasp)

280
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:25,340
- [Sakata] All right, let's move on here.

281
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,880
Girardi?
- I'm here!

282
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,975
- Campbell?
- 'Sup!

283
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,399
- [Sakata] Imoonchuk?
(Imoonchuk clicks)

284
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,360
Sprectum Meganki?
(Sprectum warbles)

285
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,102
Crapper?
(Crapper flatulates)

286
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:34,370
(eerie music)

287
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,230
- [Satsuki] What the hell are you doing?

288
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,360
- [Shinobu] What do you mean?

289
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,410
- Look here, Aya's missing,
and I know you're behind it.

290
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,600
What kind of spell are we doing here?

291
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,890
- [Shinobu] I can't help it if she failed.

292
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,370
- [Satsuki] Failed?

293
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,370
- Last night, I got a call from Aya.

294
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,263
She said she wanted to quit,
so I told her how to do that.

295
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,573
- But I guess the fact

296
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:56,140
that she disappeared means
she must've screwed it up.

297
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,378
Or she opened her big trap.

298
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,650
- You are such a bitch!

299
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,360
Stop being such a freakin'
skank and get her back!

300
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,150
- [Shinobu] Don't blame me, ho.

301
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,090
I didn't force you into this.

302
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,130
You're the ones who said
you wanted to do it.

303
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,480
So there.

304
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,053
- Sometimes, yes means no.

305
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,023
- And sometimes, you're a bitch.

306
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,860
What do you wanna do?

307
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,143
You wanna quit or stay in the game?

308
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,530
- I'm gonna quit.

309
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,620
I'll get bigger breasts

310
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,350
and a tighter ass, the old-fashioned way,

311
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,473
plastic surgery.

312
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:29,790
- [Misono And Tomomi] Uh-huh.

313
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,788
- Your call.

314
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:33,205
(wind howls)

315
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,990
- What is with you?

316
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,380
- Huh?

317
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,080
- You're like an afterschool special.

318
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,540
Are you pregnant?

319
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,980
- Oh please.

320
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,360
Oh please!

321
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,823
- [Shinobu] If you tell
anyone, you'll be cursed.

322
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,860
- Yes, that's it. I'm pregnant.

323
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,310
- You can have an abortion, if you want.

324
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,840
My mother says wished
she would've had one.

325
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,360
- Leave me alone.

326
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,393
It's none of your business, Hajime.

327
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,330
- Uh, what? (sighs)

328
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,060
It's that frosted Vic
Mignogna lookalike, isn't it?

329
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,980
I know it!

330
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,999
God, I thought you had
better taste than that!

331
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:09,380
Fullmetal disgusting is what that is.

332
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,047
(clock ticking)

333
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,070
- [Shinobu] There is one
way to negate the contract.

334
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,980
Stand at your front door at 2 a.m.

335
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,010
and hit these comma beads
against one another,

336
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,760
while you chant the spell.

337
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,254
Yeah, that's it.

338
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:25,454
(clock ticks)
(suspenseful music)

339
00:15:25,454 --> 00:15:28,970
(wind whistling)

340
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,700
- Magic comma beads are glowing.

341
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,770
Magic comma beads are green.

342
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,980
Save my ass from satanic forces unseen.

343
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,083
Let me live until I'm
a drug-addicted teen!

344
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:41,920
(dramatic music)

345
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,219
- Stop that!
(Satsuki grunts)

346
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:45,217
(dramatic music)

347
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:48,470
- Ah, hey, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

348
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,030
- That's what I should be
asking you, Suzy Suicide.

349
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,910
You were performing
the ritual of darkness.

350
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,070
It's a spell to erase your very existence.

351
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,763
And I just saved your ass.

352
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:57,800
- [Satsuki] What?

353
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,770
- Whoever told you to do this, well,

354
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,454
she's either a bitch or a ghost.

355
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:04,062
(dramatic music)

356
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:05,480
(Satsuki gasps)

357
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,313
- Oh no.

358
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,440
(Satsuki speaks in foreign language)

359
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,520
I mean, hello.

360
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,820
I'm sorry to call you at this hour.

361
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,453
Can I speak to Tomomi?

362
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,780
- Tomomi?

363
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,650
Ain't no Tomomi girl
living here, say what?

364
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,750
Get yo' crackhead ass into some rehab.

365
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,969
I ain't got time for this bull-

366
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:23,685
(phone clacks)
(Satsuki gasps)

367
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:24,626
(phone beeping)

368
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:26,187
- Mother (beep)!

369
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:27,850
- Hey, Satsuki,
(phone beeping)

370
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,902
I believe you've got
another call coming through.

371
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:30,735
(static crackles)

372
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:32,251
- [Shinobu] Why didn't you do it?

373
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:33,520
(Satsuki gasps)

374
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,678
The other two did as they were told.

375
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,051
(Satsuki gasps)

376
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:39,620
(dramatic music)

377
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,130
- Shinobu, you don't look so good.

378
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,963
- Run! She's a ghost and a bitch!

379
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:45,796
(Shinobu grunts)

380
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,653
- Good cat!
- What, get off me!

381
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:48,486
Ah!

382
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:51,030
Fleabag!

383
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,400
Why are you siding with the
humans, you backstabber?

384
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,430
- Don't you look at me
with those hepatitis eyes.

385
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,550
I may hate humans,

386
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,042
but I hate sneaky, underhanded
ghost bitches even more!

387
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,093
Nyah!

388
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:03,503
- Nyah yourself.

389
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:04,946
(Shinobu grunting)

390
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:05,779
Oh yeah.

391
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:08,127
(Shinobu growls)

392
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,935
(Amanojaku hissing)

393
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:10,869
(Amanojaku grunts)

394
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,119
- [Amanojaku] Oh, ya bitch!

395
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:16,080
- Now you.

396
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,689
(Satsuki panting)

397
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:21,651
(tense music)

398
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:23,918
(Shinobu sighs)

399
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,751
(Satsuki gasping)

400
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,432
Whee!

401
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,213
- No good.

402
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:34,112
I don't know its name, so I can't check.

403
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:35,512
What should I do?

404
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,952
Oh no!

405
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:39,430
And I've not had a hep C shot.

406
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,062
(fist banging)

407
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:43,750
(Satsuki gasps)

408
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,300
(dramatic music)

409
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,508
(Satsuki gasps)

410
00:17:46,508 --> 00:17:47,341
(Satsuki yells)

411
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:50,091
(hands thumping)

412
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,001
Well, that's kinda cool.

413
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:04,068
What the, what?

414
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:07,233
(door rattling)

415
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,150
Ya, mi, me.

416
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:10,245
Yamime?

417
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:11,787
(Yamime gasps)

418
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:14,454
(Yamime growls)

419
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:17,697
Yamime, here it is.

420
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:18,530
That's her.

421
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,080
May 12th, Shinobu Matsuda,
grade sixth, class four,

422
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,660
summoned Yamime from another
world and got possessed.

423
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,970
What a dumb bitch.

424
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,582
This Shinobu, could it be?

425
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:30,540
(door thumps)

426
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,110
(Yamime hisses)

427
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,390
God, she just keeps writing,

428
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,040
and her penmanship is just awful.

429
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,600
Where's the damned Cliff notes?

430
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,240
Oh, here it is.

431
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,113
Bind her with red string
and bathe her in sunlight.

432
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:44,564
(Yamime grunting)

433
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:46,222
Okay.

434
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:49,285
(suspenseful music)

435
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:52,386
(Yamime humming)

436
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:53,219
- [Yamime] Whee.

437
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:55,190
- Maybe she'll see
Keiichirou in the top bunk

438
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,090
and eat him first.

439
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,383
That'd buy me some time.

440
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:03,405
(dramatic music)

441
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:06,155
(Yamime hissing)

442
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,750
I just cleaned these stupid windows, too.

443
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,583
Goddam her!

444
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:15,430
I could just escape.

445
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,090
- It's time for you to pay,

446
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,811
and I don't mean your
Foley's card, Satsuki.

447
00:19:19,811 --> 00:19:20,644
Mm-mm!

448
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,373
Oh, I need to floss.

449
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:30,313
(dramatic music)
(Yamime roaring)

450
00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:35,397
(Yamime gasps)

451
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:37,516
- Later!

452
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:40,271
(Yamime gasping)

453
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:41,964
(Yamime yelling)

454
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:42,916
Let's see.

455
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,645
Sunlight, I'll just have to improvise.

456
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:47,404
(Yamime yelling)

457
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:50,088
Hash stash, body glitter, boots.

458
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,419
(Yamime grunting)

459
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:53,391
My ELPH!

460
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:56,609
(Yamime grunting)

461
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,559
(camera clicks)

462
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,265
(Satsuki gasps)

463
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,035
(both yell)

464
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,716
(camera clicking)
Aw, come on!

465
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:06,958
Oh my God.

466
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,085
What kind of skank (mumbles)?

467
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,831
This is disgusting!

468
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:13,331
I'm disgusted, ow!

469
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,288
(flash clicks)

470
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:18,205
(Yamime screeches)

471
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:22,463
(energy crackling)

472
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,130
- [Amanojaku] Morning, sunshine.

473
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,063
Come on, get up.

474
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,360
And you might want to do something
about your three friends,

475
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,260
sleeping like drunk
sorority sluts on the porch.

476
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,090
That's my space!

477
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,610
- Where's the long-armed skank?

478
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,120
- [Amanojaku] I don't sense her anymore.

479
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,870
I guess you put that hag down.

480
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,320
- [Satsuki] Amanojaku, thank you so much.

481
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,013
So my three friends
wound up being just fine.

482
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,750
I never talked to Aya again.

483
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,490
She had the worst body odor.

484
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,730
I hate that.

485
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,960
Misono had that obnoxious laugh.

486
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,760
And one day, after sixth
period, I just got sick of it

487
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,830
and smacked her in the face.

488
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,070
That ended that friendship.

489
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,880
And Tomomi was sent off to
military school, because she-

490
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,713
- Hi, Hajime!

491
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,644
Hey, what are you doing here, Hajime?

492
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:14,140
- Nunya.

493
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,610
- Keiichirou, move your but.

494
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,490
We'll be late.

495
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,730
Don't talk to him.

496
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,563
- Hey!

497
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:22,233
- [Satsuki] Oh yeah, uh, thanks, Hajime.

498
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,430
- Huh?

499
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,044
Oh, sure,

500
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:27,294
(chuckles) Mrs. Mignogna.

501
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,762
Hey, are you gonna name the
kid Vicky or Vic II or Obi.

502
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:33,603
(chuckles) Obi.

503
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,360
- [Satsuki] Actually, I
never really dated Vic.

504
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,600
I heard he got this really
awful copper crotch rocket.

505
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,400
And one day, when he
was out on a road trip,

506
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,300
he got abducted by some gay Hell's Angels

507
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,720
and was never seen again.

508
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:54,314
(solemn music)

509
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:58,147

510
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:03,107

511
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:05,047

(Amanojaku laughs)

517
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,490
(creature growls)

518
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,230
- [Amanojaku] This building is alive.

519
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,540
You've already been sucked in by it.

520
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,630
What will you do?

521
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,763
After all, this is a
haunted housing block!

522
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:37,667
(Amanojaku laughs creepily)
