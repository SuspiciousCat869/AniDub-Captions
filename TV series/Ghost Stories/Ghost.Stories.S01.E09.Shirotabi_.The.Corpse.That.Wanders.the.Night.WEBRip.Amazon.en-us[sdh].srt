1
00:00:01,021 --> 00:00:03,771
(rain pattering)

2
00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:07,739
(suspenseful music)

3
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,922
(storm raging)

4
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:29,689
(lightning crashing)

5
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,689
(suspenseful music)

6
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:44,898
(lightning crashing)

7
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,890
(eerie tense music)

8
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,483
(singing in Japanese)

9
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:27,589
(eerie tense music)

10
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:33,754
(whimsical upbeat music)

11
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:36,117
- Mio mi.

12
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:38,166
Is she that fat girl?

13
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,459
Or the slut?

14
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,876
(whimsical upbeat music)

15
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,510
- [Hajime] Come on, you
know, she's that freak

16
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,410
who always sits in the corner
of the classroom by herself.

17
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,570
You'd know her if you say her.

18
00:02:58,747 --> 00:02:59,580
- Oh, her.

19
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:02,642
Oh.

20
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:04,999
You.

21
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,550
- Five years running,

22
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,730
the president of the Happy Paws
Feather and Tails pet club.

23
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,180
- The Animal Planet freak.

24
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,320
- Mr. Sakata says he's
gonna hold elections

25
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,130
for the president of the club this week.

26
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,340
There was a little bit of a problem

27
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,080
with the electoral college last year

28
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,140
but once again, Mio was
elected to the post.

29
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,080
She greases more palms than you know who.

30
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,500
- We need more weirdos
like her in this school.

31
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,530
She's like a Mexican doing all the jobs

32
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,990
white people don't want.

33
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,870
- [Leo] She has no friends,

34
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,130
but I think she's kinda hot.

35
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,009
- [Satsuki] Why don't the
three of you get a room?

36
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:37,842
- [Hajime] Uh?

37
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,200
Yeah.

38
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,300
- Will you talk to me?

39
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:42,190
- Oh, hey there, Mio.

40
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,130
Didn't see you.

41
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,870
And I was this close.

42
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,063
So what's that?

43
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,940
Are you still playing with dolls?

44
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,773
- No.

45
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,606
Well, yeah kinda.

46
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:54,060
- That's so sweet.

47
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,140
In a you scare the crap
out of me Emily Rose

48
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,370
kind of way.

49
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,203
Oh look.

50
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,130
Huh.

51
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,130
No wonder you're sitting here all alone.

52
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,120
Well, good talking to you.

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,973
Gotta go.

54
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,140
What?

55
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,930
- Here, you can take pooki poo.

56
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,370
He used to be my man but we broke up.

57
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,730
- Great, please don't hurt me.

58
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,717
Wow, look at the time.

59
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:17,293
Pooki and I gotta go.

60
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,430
- The V on my sweater
stands for very big deal

61
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,690
but that's besides the point.

62
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,970
Now, any nomination--

63
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,803
- Hi!

64
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:28,893
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!

65
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,140
- Are you trying to
tell me you want to run?

66
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,560
- Hell no, I don't want to run.

67
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,790
I'd like to nominate Satsuki Miyanoshita.

68
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,063
- Say what?

69
00:04:38,063 --> 00:04:39,820
I don't want to go into politics.

70
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,880
- She can't!

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,806
She can't, I mean, the animals
really want me to do it.

72
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:45,639
(chuckles nervously)

73
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,920
I mean, candidates take priority, right?

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,347
- Mio's right, candidates do take priority

75
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:53,670
and frankly, everyone who
disagrees with Mio dies.

76
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,560
So I nominate her.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,040
- She's been the animal caretaker

78
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,400
longer than I've been
spanking my own monkey

79
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
but if Satsuki's afraid of doing it,

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,685
then fine, elect the incumbent.

81
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:03,820
- I can Jane Goodall as good as she can.

82
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,653
- I said she can't!

83
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:06,646
I mean, she could get rabies or ticks.

84
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:07,479
- What?

85
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:08,870
(chuckling nervously)

86
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,540
Sorry, forgot who I was dealing with here.

87
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,630
Jobs all yours.

88
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,643
- Well, let's hold on a minute.

89
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:15,363
I forget to mention.

90
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,750
We've got more bunnies.

91
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,040
There's no way Mio will be able

92
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,690
to do the job herself.

93
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,020
So, for the first time
in our school's history,

94
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,610
we're going to have two,
young sweet animal caretakers.

95
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,740
I mean girls.

96
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,165
(chuckling nervously)

97
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:30,630
- [Boy] I didn't approve that.

98
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,011
- [Satsuki] What the hell?

99
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:33,030
Is that the time?

100
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,560
Keiichirou, you're gonna
have to Poptart it today.

101
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,340
- But there's a hole in my gym shirt

102
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,390
and there's a really weird
sticky stain in my shorts.

103
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,510
- God, you're making me sick!

104
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,780
- I didn't do it on purpose.

105
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,120
- I wish Mom was still alive.

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,670
Then she'd deal with this crap.

107
00:05:57,254 --> 00:05:58,087
(grunting)

108
00:05:58,087 --> 00:05:58,970
I'm so late.

109
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,533
She's probably up to her
eyes in rabbit crap by now.

110
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:03,704
Huh?

111
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:09,123
- [Satsuki Voiceover] God, she's so weird.

112
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,070
(eerie tense music)

113
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:14,786
Freak!

114
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:24,910
- I don't want to go in there.

115
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,133
Probably full of fleas or crabs
or chlamydia or something.

116
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:32,555
(shouting)

117
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:34,055
Fluffy, come back.

118
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,630
(grunting)

119
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,600
Stupid rabbit.

120
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,543
- Come on, jump.

121
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,853
I said jump!

122
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,120
- Holy crap.

123
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,660
- All the little animals really like me.

124
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,520
They all tell me so.

125
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,250
And I'm really sorry I was late.

126
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,970
I feel bad you got here first.

127
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,133
- [Satsuki Voiceover] But
she got here before me.

128
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:56,007
Oh my god.

129
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:00,230
(Satsuki screaming internally)

130
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,730
(eerie music)

131
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:14,737
(upbeat music)

132
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:15,650
- Ew!

133
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,163
He's too young to be having wet dreams.

134
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,453
- Hey.

135
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:22,286
(shouting)

136
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:23,119
- Don't do that.

137
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:23,952
What are you doing here?

138
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:24,950
Oh wait, you're feeling guilty

139
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,210
about putting me with
little Miss Watership Down.

140
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,231
- Keiichirou told me was
sick of eating Poptarts,

141
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:31,073
that you were too busy
to fix him breakfast.

142
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:34,431
I thought I might help you out a little.

143
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,657
- You'll help out a little?

144
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,097
Do you know how much rabbits crap

145
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:39,290
in a 24 hour period?

146
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,577
- I said I was sorry.

147
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,700
Damn it woman, what do you want from me?

148
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,780
My lunch money?

149
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,670
- It's a start.

150
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,280
- Hey, you remember a couple episodes ago

151
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,620
you promised me some panties

152
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,720
if we went in that house?

153
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,930
Well, I'm still waiting for them

154
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,530
and I'm not getting any younger.

155
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,363
(grunting)

156
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:54,196
Hey, watch where you're going.

157
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:55,029
- Hush.

158
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,920
- She's weird but I'd still do her.

159
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,753
What's she doing?

160
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:57,830
- She did that yesterday.

161
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,663
Do we want to know?

162
00:07:58,663 --> 00:07:59,760
- Maybe she's paying her respects

163
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,100
at the animal cemetery.

164
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,583
- The animal cemetery?

165
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,050
- Yes, the animal cemetery.

166
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,620
Hear the plot point bells going off?

167
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,680
- Of course.

168
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,028
Hope Stephen King never sees this.

169
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:13,028
(eerie tense music)

170
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:29,590
- [Sakata] So, what do you think?

171
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,800
Cute, huh.

172
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,490
Bend over and look at that one.

173
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,423
Hold still.

174
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,510
- One pill makes you larger.

175
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,840
- Let's see Hadley's cow club beat us now.

176
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,780
- And one pill makes you small.

177
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,542
And the ones that mother gives you.

178
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,003
- We didn't laugh the first time,

179
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:47,836
we're not laughing now.

180
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:48,780
- [Hajime] Not a Heart fan.

181
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,764
- [Sakata] Isn't he gay?

182
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:51,724
Oh no, that's the guy in Styx.

183
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:56,724
(wolf howling)
(eerie music)

184
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:11,580
(roaring)

185
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,903
(birds chirping)

186
00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:17,000
- One, two, three.

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,100
Stop moving, you little bastards.

188
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,930
One, two, three.

189
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,379
- Four comes after three.

190
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,190
- The laws of arithmetic didn't change

191
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,160
over night, did they?

192
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,361
- What happened, warden,
did one get away again?

193
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,750
- I wish.

194
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,900
I knew we got more but somethings wrong.

195
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,470
- What are you talking about?

196
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,400
Didn't you go to Petco and get
those little bunny rubbers?

197
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,290
One, two, three, four,

198
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,440
five, six, seven.

199
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,087
Seven?

200
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:41,240
- See?

201
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,220
- I see.

202
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,000
The screwing like bunnies thing is true.

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,210
- Yeah.
- Hold on.

204
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,050
I flunked math.

205
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,900
One, two, three, four, five, six...

206
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:52,702
Shirotabi?

207
00:09:52,702 --> 00:09:53,687
- Huh?

208
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:55,484
(grunting nervously)

209
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:57,984
(eerie music)

210
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,370
- It looks just like him, that's weird.

211
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,180
- So you're telling me
that Shirotabi died?

212
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,950
- God gave mankind
dominion over the animals

213
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,340
and they all look alike, anyway.

214
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,060
- Maybe, maybe you just
didn't close the gate

215
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,180
to the cage good enough.

216
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,400
- I locked their cell.

217
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,580
I've seen Oz.

218
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,840
- Oh, I used to love that show.

219
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,080
All those sweaty tattooed men

220
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,340
locked together in cells with guards

221
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,870
holding big clubs.

222
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,770
Did I say that out loud?

223
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,080
I mean, hey what a cute little pink bear

224
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,913
you got there.

225
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,018
- Oh that?

226
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:33,700
Mio made it and gave it to me.

227
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,340
I couldn't say no to her.

228
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,388
You never know what that freak would do.

229
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:40,471
(eerie violin music)

230
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:44,668
- [Satsuki Voiceover] Violins, oh no.

231
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:47,800
- [Satsuki As Kayako]
Dad, no reading the paper

232
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,060
at the dinner table.

233
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,893
(clearing throat)

234
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:50,783
- [Satsuki] Excuse me.

235
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:54,140
- Wow, you sounded so much
like your mom just now.

236
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,870
Say, Satsuki, Barney
Frank Elementary School

237
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,510
is a school that's very near where you

238
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,790
and your brother go, isn't it?

239
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,400
- Isn't that the special
school we were going

240
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,660
to send Keiichirou to?

241
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,240
- USA Today has an easy to read

242
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,550
color graphic showing how many

243
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,010
of their rabbits were killed last night.

244
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,060
Check it out.

245
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,871
- Wow, how gruesome.

246
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:13,487
And rabbits killed at
Condaleeza Rice Elementary, too.

247
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:14,770
Jesus.

248
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,890
- I hope Jocelyn Elders
Elementary's rabbits are okay.

249
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,020
- Instead of losing some,

250
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,890
ours are rapidly multiplying.

251
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,930
- Multiplying?

252
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,120
- Oh rabbit crap, I'm late.

253
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,953
Gotta go.

254
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,610
Hey, maybe we should arm the
rabbits with little guns.

255
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,830
- Sometimes, I wish all people
could marry the animals.

256
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,663
- Huh?

257
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,333
Me?

258
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:42,410
(shushing)

259
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,243
- Don't you?

260
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,076
- Yeah, if Siegfried and Roy can do it,

261
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:44,909
why can't everybody?

262
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:45,990
- I know, right?

263
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,180
- Well, I'm just gonna
drop off the droppings.

264
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,770
BRB.

265
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,260
- Now, where were we?

266
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,263
- What do you want?

267
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,070
- Over here, this way.

268
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,540
I met BJ Bridget in the woods

269
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,720
for our Wednesday usual

270
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,370
and I found something
even more interesting

271
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,720
in the animal graveyard.

272
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,380
- You're a rabbit necrophiliac?

273
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,213
- Look.

274
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:03,774
(gasping)

275
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:06,774
(eerie tense music)

276
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,420
Ever see The Serpent and the Rainbow?

277
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,010
- Wait, don't tell me the
rabbit came back to life.

278
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,190
- I don't know.

279
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,023
What's that?

280
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,933
- A Nick Nolte voodoo doll.

281
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:20,933
(eerie tense music)

282
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:30,718
(roaring)

283
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:39,898
(roaring)

284
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,980
Oh my god.

285
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,350
- This is disgusting.

286
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,483
- It's like rabbit Jonestown.

287
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,056
(screaming)

288
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:00,889
Shirotabi.

289
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:04,460
All dead but you, it's a miracle.

290
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,620
- That's not Shirotabi.

291
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,800
Shirotabi's dead.

292
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,100
- What?

293
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,980
Don't listen to him.

294
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,040
He's just jealous.

295
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,210
- The sheds been destroyed
and your favorite rabbit

296
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,770
is the only survivor.

297
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,771
- So what?

298
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:16,980
- The entire shack is blown to bits.

299
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,160
I'm smelling a rat or
a fox in the henhouse

300
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,020
or something...

301
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,960
- [Satsuki] This isn't my fault.

302
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,592
I better still get an A.

303
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:26,068
(gasping)

304
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:26,901
- Blood.

305
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:28,290
- What?
- Blood!

306
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,123
Don't look.

307
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:31,160
- Aunt Flow's timing is terrible.

308
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,480
- I'll just clean up the blood.

309
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,822
I mean carnage here.

310
00:13:35,822 --> 00:13:38,322
(eerie music)

311
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:48,262
(booming footsteps)

312
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:00,884
(screaming)

313
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:07,490
- That was the best Asian
massage parlor ever.

314
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,850
They gave me a little parting gift.

315
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,613
Such nice girls.

316
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:16,611
(screaming)

317
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,880
- They say the people were attacked

318
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,583
by some strange creature.

319
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:37,497
(eerie tense music)

320
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,577
- Found it.

321
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:43,000
If you chant the spell at the grave,

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,440
this doll actually resurrects the dead

323
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,480
but the bad news is the resurrected spirit

324
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,600
is really pissed off.

325
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,990
- So then Shirotabi really was resurrected

326
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,350
by that ceremony.

327
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,730
You think Shirotabi was the culprit?

328
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,420
- Does a duck fart underwater?

329
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,870
- You're saying he came back to life?

330
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,140
- Well Bugs didn't climb
out on his own, Leo.

331
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,257
We need to find Gerdy Graverobber.

332
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:04,177
- Before we leap to conclusions,

333
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:07,530
we should make sure the
Beelzebub bunny is Shirotabi.

334
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,113
- [All] Hai.

335
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:11,613
(tense music)

336
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,199
- No satanic activity yet.

337
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,860
- (yawning) I'm sleepy.

338
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,840
- This oughta wake you up.

339
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,673
- What?

340
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:28,713
- Maybe it isn't the rabbit.

341
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,820
- You guys.

342
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,140
She's looking straight at us.

343
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,703
I don't think we hid very well.

344
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,290
- Shirotabi, my friends over there

345
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,210
think you're a rabbit serial killer

346
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,573
and in the movies,

347
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,610
this would be the part
where I foolishly trust you

348
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,500
not to kill me

349
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,747
and stick my hand in the cage--

350
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,450
You son of a bitch.

351
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,871
(tense music)

352
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:56,808
(screaming)

353
00:15:56,808 --> 00:15:58,908
- Dumb ass.
- Didn't see that one coming.

354
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:00,964
(roaring)

355
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:01,797
- Coming this way now.

356
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:02,958
- Time to go.

357
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,316
- Give us wings of angels.

358
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:06,472
(screaming)

359
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:09,472
(eerie tense music)

360
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:18,284
(screaming)

361
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,524
- Ew, ew.

362
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,810
Of all the places to run,

363
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,170
why did we end up here?

364
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,610
- Because it was the only place

365
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,023
and we're terminally stupid.

366
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:35,416
(sobbing)

367
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,249
- Oh god.

368
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:38,806
Get it together!

369
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,443
- That son of a bitch.

370
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,478
So I drag my happy ass
out in the pouring rain,

371
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:51,038
come bring me back to life, he says,

372
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:54,120
I'll be good, I promise, he says.

373
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,920
I'm not gonna turn into a big red eyed

374
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,797
flesh eating monster rabbit.

375
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:02,191
He says!

376
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,667
(roaring)

377
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,246
(wet squishing)

378
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,400
- [Satsuki] What were you thinking?

379
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,880
- The dead can be resurrected.

380
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,430
You shouldn't play John Edwards.

381
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,263
- Yeah.

382
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,096
Hey, I got an idea.

383
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:26,180
How bout you guys rub
it in, why don't you?

384
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,060
I suppose none of you ever
resurrected a killer rabbit.

385
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,550
I mean, I have no friends.

386
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,923
No one talks to me.

387
00:17:34,056 --> 00:17:35,140
- I feel evil.

388
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,063
- Come on, Leo.

389
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,872
(screaming)

390
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:42,782
(roaring)

391
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:43,615
- On three.

392
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:44,835
Three!

393
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:45,668
- I'm a genius.

394
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:46,696
- [Mio Voiceover] Oh, Shirotabi.

395
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:49,731
I brought you back from the dead.

396
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:51,793
Thought you'd be a little more grateful!

397
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:55,641
(grunting)

398
00:17:57,654 --> 00:18:01,811
- Hey, what if we sacrifice the two boys?

399
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:03,790
(screaming)

400
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,623
- Satsuki, damn it.

401
00:18:04,623 --> 00:18:06,920
Will you hurry up and put
the thing to spiritual sleep?

402
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,813
- Oh yeah, that's right.

403
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:10,131
Okay, Mio, you're gonna have to gut up.

404
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,552
You've got one big do-over.

405
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:14,628
(roaring)

406
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:15,512
(screaming)

407
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,531
You did some little happy song

408
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:18,110
to bring this bunny
back, so start singing.

409
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,067
Those three to four cardboard boxes

410
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:21,614
aren't gonna hold him for long.

411
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:23,250
- Lord, reveal your salvation

412
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,550
since I am your favorite
among these heathens.

413
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,688
That wicked charm!

414
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:30,260
(sobbing)

415
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,012
- [Satsuki] Toss the
arts and crafts, move it.

416
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:32,845
- [Mio] I can't do it!

417
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:33,970
- [Hajime] And why not?

418
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,140
- Because none of the other animals

419
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,340
would be my friend but Shirotabi.

420
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,920
Sometimes, when we were together,

421
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,510
I feel he would actually talk to me.

422
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,694
- You are pathetic.

423
00:18:43,694 --> 00:18:45,880
- One he died, I was so sad

424
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,900
that I would never hear that voice again.

425
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,927
His laugh.

426
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,400
(deep laughter)

427
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,340
His funny little requests.

428
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,275
- [Shirotabi] Touch me.

429
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:55,810
- [Mio] His reprimands.

430
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,073
- [Shirotabi] Touch me harder.

431
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,936
- I had to bring him back to life!

432
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:03,870
(roaring)

433
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,306
- [Leo] Come on.

434
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:07,483
- You stupid selfish slut.

435
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:09,332
Does he look happy to be back?

436
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:10,165
Huh?

437
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:14,734
(screaming)

438
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:17,370
(roaring)

439
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,090
- Sentimental flashback time is over,

440
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,590
you stupid bunny loving bitch.

441
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,094
If you don't throw that thing,

442
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,174
I'm tossing you.

443
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:27,494
(sobbing)
(somber music)

444
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:32,077
(roaring)
(screaming)

445
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:35,473
- [All] Throw it!

446
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,680
- Shirotabi, please
forgive me for bringing

447
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,894
you back to life.

448
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:42,990
I know now that it could
never work between us.

449
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,774
As much as we want it
to, it could never be.

450
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:48,150
(somber music)

451
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,540
Not because you're a rabbit

452
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,353
but because you're black.

453
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:57,519
(somber music)

454
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:00,939
(gasping)

455
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,163
Wow.

456
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:16,696
- [Satsuki] Ew.

457
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:18,270
(all laughing)

458
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,510
- My bunny.

459
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,103
My little dead bunny.

460
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,060
- It's no Frank Lloyd Wright for bunnies,

461
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,000
but it will do.

462
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,300
- Yeah, genius, but all
the rabbits are dead.

463
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,730
We should get our best
stationary and our pens

464
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,050
and ask Amy Grant for those three wishes.

465
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,430
- [Sakata] Look what I've got.

466
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,660
- Yo, Sensei, what's haps
on the craps with snaps?

467
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,940
- Cracker.

468
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,523
Aren't they cute?

469
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:53,342
- Shirotabi.

470
00:20:53,342 --> 00:20:57,150
- The biology teacher told me
they're Shirotabi's children.

471
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,610
- Shirotabi's what?

472
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,443
- Children.

473
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:01,220
- Guess this as good a time as any.

474
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,690
You see, kids, the boy bunny
has a thing called a penis

475
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,160
and he puts that into
the girl bunny's vagina.

476
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,010
The girl bunny then starts acting

477
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,210
like she owns that penis.

478
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,720
Anyway, don't they look just like him?

479
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,130
- Yes, they do.

480
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,383
- This reminds me of a story.

481
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,240
You know how sometimes the man

482
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,810
totally screws the woman over?

483
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,910
- Yeah.

484
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,010
- Well this friend of mine
doesn't want another kid

485
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,340
but her husband does.

486
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,940
They're not using any birth
control 'cause they're married

487
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,574
and the guy actually
finishes inside of her.

488
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:36,434
Needless to say, she was pissed.

489
00:21:36,434 --> 00:21:39,060
Isn't that awful?

490
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,296
- Yes.

491
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:42,640
You two timing son of a bitch!

492
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,947
Who's gonna take care of
these little bastards?

493
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:45,160
- Hey, I got an idea.

494
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,820
Let's end this episode with a happy moral.

495
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,240
- Like if you leave children behind,

496
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,750
pay your child support on time.

497
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,718
- Deadbeat dads are not cool.

498
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,920
(all laughing)

499
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,003
- [Leo] Yeah!

500
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:01,762
(singing in Japanese)

501
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,660
- [Announcer] Yo dude
there's this dark tunnel

502
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,950
and once you get up in there,

503
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,200
you aint ever coming out.

504
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:34,370
Think I'm lying?

505
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,110
Hell no this nigga aint lying.

506
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,359
Think I'm messing with you?

507
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,030
(bleep) you, man.

508
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,916
What am I talking about?

509
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,999
(speaking Japanese)
