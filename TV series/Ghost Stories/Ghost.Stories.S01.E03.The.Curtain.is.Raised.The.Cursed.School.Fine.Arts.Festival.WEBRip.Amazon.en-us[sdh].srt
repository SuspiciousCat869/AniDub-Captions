1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,690
- [Hajime] What do you
want to talk about Keita?

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,830
It's not that rash again, is it?

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,630
- [Keita] I was just wondering
if they were gonna cancel

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,840
the Fine Arts Festival.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,230
- Oh good God. You're the lead.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,780
Who are they going to
replace you with, Tom cruise?

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,940
- It's a role where I
get cursed by a ghost

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,290
and almost die.

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,450
I read about this actor once.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,180
He got a part just like that,

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,480
and then died under
mysterious circumstances.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,220
Hajime, would you take my
place for the lead role?

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,070
- Me? No way.

14
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,810
Have you seen the female lead? No thanks.

15
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,010
- That's what I thought.

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,540
Hey, maybe if the gymnasium catches fire

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,290
they'll cancel the show.

18
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,600
- What?

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,820
- I hope it does catch fire.

20
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,653
- Pyro.

21
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,678
(thunder rumbling)
(lightning crashing)

22
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:53,719
Oh man, I got to walk home today.

23
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,802
(lightning crashing)

24
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,380
Holy crack addict, it hit the gym!

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,213
- No way.

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,190
You don't think it happened

27
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,957
because I said something, do you?

28
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:11,349
(intense music)

29
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,184
(singing in foreign language)

30
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:18,767
(upbeat music)

31
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,760
- [Kid] It's black.

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,510
- I guess the school Fine Arts
Festival's not gonna happen.

33
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,980
- I can't believe it.

34
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,143
And I stayed up all night
working on my costume and props.

35
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,000
- Oh my, what a gifted seamstress.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,597
I hope you're not a homosexual.

37
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:12,790
- A dude who can act and
sew so obviously I'm gay.

38
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,290
I'm not gay you born
again, homophobe, halfwit

39
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,740
but I am gonna be the lead in
the Phantom of the Ghost Opera

40
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,213
I can tell you that, yeah.

41
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,490
- I've seen him act Keita.

42
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,240
You don't have a thing to worry
about, trust me on this one.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,060
- What do you think? You're the principal.

44
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,650
- I hate the Arts Festival.

45
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,285
Audit pays for the football team.

46
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:36,103
This year's festival will
be at the old school house.

47
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:41,103
- What?
- What?

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,910
- Keita, where you been?

49
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,120
I've been looking for you everywhere.

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,560
Aren't you going to the play rehearsal?

51
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,690
They're waiting for you.

52
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,400
This isn't about the trailer thing, is it?

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,760
- You know, there are rumors about ghosts

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,430
at the old school house.

55
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,723
I mean, what if those
stories are true Hajime?

56
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,220
What if some accident happened to me?

57
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,260
Then someone else would
have to take the part.

58
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,220
- No, that part is yours Keita.

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,943
No little dreidel spinner's
gonna take your place.

60
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,260
Keita?

61
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,203
- I'm just gonna go to rehearsal.

62
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:25,004
(intense music)

63
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,690
My fingers are bleeding, look!

64
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,923
So, have I been cursed
by the ghost after all?

65
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,000
- Bravo, somewhere Keanu
Reeves is getting nervous.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,040
Good job. G rated play, PG 13 violence.

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,604
Let's see Hadley beat this one.

68
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:48,320
- But if something bad happens to him

69
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,420
I get to do it, right?

70
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,660
- Bet the PTA's gonna
freak, but I like it.

71
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,493
- Word.

72
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,503
- Uh? Huh?

73
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:05,559
Ah!
(loud crashing)

74
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,059
- Keita! Keita!

75
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:07,892
- Keita! Somebody do something!

76
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,912
- Call an ambulance and
find me the damn understudy!

77
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:12,745
- It's me!

78
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:19,174
- [Keita] Can any of you
bastards get this off me?

79
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,643
- Are you for real?

80
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:25,860
- Uh, yeah.

81
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,610
Keita wished the gym
would catch fire. Boom.

82
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,650
Hoped he'd get hurt. Smack.

83
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,950
The stairs are cursed.

84
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,540
- Cursed stairs? You're
kidding me, cursed stairs?

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,300
- God is bigger than any demonic curse

86
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,910
and true believers like me
don't believe in curses.

87
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,710
We have Jesus. If we ask
stairs, nothing will happen.

88
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,980
Only prayers get answered.

89
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,843
- Oh good God.

90
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,880
- I think that's a great idea.

91
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,023
- Cool. Let's test this out.

92
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,170
I want a huge allowance and
breasts when I get older.

93
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,150
- And when I get older, I
want to fondle said breasts.

94
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,420
- I pray that all my friends

95
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,360
will become born again Christians.

96
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,250
- I hope Keita recovers, but not soon

97
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,840
and I get the lead in the play.

98
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,673
- [Group] What?

99
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:07,360
- The lead? You remember what
happened to the first one.

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,700
- That's fate. I was always
the right choice for the lead.

101
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,290
Everybody knows Keita got that
lead on the casting couch.

102
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,230
And besides, who better
to take the lead role

103
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,240
in a play about a ghost

104
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,670
than the school's resident
psychical researcher?

105
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,920
- [Amanojaku] You get a free wish

106
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,750
and that's what you're going for? Loser.

107
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,150
- What do you want?

108
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,200
- All humans are idiots and
human children are even worse.

109
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,703
And you four are the most
pathetic I've ever seen.

110
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,880
- [Hajime] Keita's dead.

111
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,900
- [Satsuki] I wish something
like that would happen to me.

112
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,770
I've got finals.

113
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,673
- [Leo] I got it.

114
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,370
- [Satsuki] Oh, hi Leo.

115
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,530
- I got the lead in the play

116
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,850
and I didn't have to spend one
minute on the casting couch.

117
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,410
I don't care what you see
Tammy Faye those stairs rock.

118
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,570
- No, I don't think so. I'm
still poor and flat chested.

119
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,580
- So?

120
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,990
- So, I don't think this
curse stair wish thing

121
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,910
is legit at all.

122
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,170
And you haven't touched
my breasts, have you?

123
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,470
- No.

124
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,080
- And the way all of you are still acting,

125
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,130
you're going to hell.

126
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,330
- Oh, I get it.

127
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,860
Your wishes didn't come true
because you're all selfish.

128
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,530
My wish came true because my talent

129
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,230
deserves a wider audience.

130
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,750
- I don't know, something doesn't
seem right about all this.

131
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,762
- What do you mean?

132
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,530
- Obia's supposed to be
this really hot dude,

133
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,700
with an enormous schlong
all the chicks dig.

134
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,543
And look who got cast.

135
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:18,500
- What are you saying? That
I'm so physically repulsive

136
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,650
no girl would want me?

137
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,430
- Yeah, pretty much tiny.

138
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,530
- I'm hung like a mule.

139
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,033
- Uh, Leo, you're no DiCaprio.

140
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,520
I think you're just being paranoid.

141
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,317
- If you want something to
happen you just need to pray.

142
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:35,040
And not be a Muslim or Jewish.

143
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,960
- Wait a minute, you don't
think it's just things

144
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,640
that are associated with that play

145
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,783
are the only ones that come true, do you?

146
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,140
If that's the case, I'm worried.

147
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,327
In that terrible script
there's a line which goes,

148
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:46,940
"Break my neck and die."

149
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,830
- [Amanojaku] Now that's
a play even I'd check out.

150
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,770
- All right, cat, where are you?

151
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,820
- So every line the
nerd speaks in the play

152
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,120
is going to come true, huh?

153
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,980
This'll be the first R rated bloodbath

154
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,793
to ever be performed at an
elementary school. Sweet!

155
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,230
By the time he figures out he's cursed,

156
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,210
his parents will be childless
well before the second act.

157
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,070
Oh my stars and garters.
I do love show business.

158
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,630
- Shut up cat and listen.

159
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,230
You don't know Leo well enough
to be mean to him, just us!

160
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,810
- What if curses are true?

161
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,260
Leo will be killed and go to hell.

162
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,690
- The rehearsals are cursed too.

163
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,270
It might be curtains even
before opening night curtain.

164
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,310
- You can be such a prick, you know that?

165
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,210
- By the way, did I ever tell you

166
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,520
the more scared you dumb meat sacks get

167
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,377
the more powerful this
little black kitty becomes.

168
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:35,492
- Tonight, Leo's family will
have sukiyaki for dinner.

169
00:08:35,492 --> 00:08:36,325
- What?
- What?

170
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:37,640
- I have faith in my Lord Jesus.

171
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,270
I don't believe in cursed stairs

172
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,153
and this test will prove it.

173
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,660
- Good one, if they don't have sukiyaki

174
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,170
then our theory is as
bogus as Scientology.

175
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,950
- All right, let's go.

176
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,020
(doorbell ringing)

177
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,149
- [Group] Trick or treat, just kidding.

178
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:51,410
- Well hello.

179
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,450
Leo didn't tell us we were having company,

180
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,220
but it's always good to see you.

181
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,390
- Perfect timing kids.

182
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,333
We just started cooking sukiyaki.

183
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,640
- What are you doing here?

184
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,320
You're supposed to go through my agent.

185
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,410
- Leo, listen to me.

186
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,440
Quit the damn play and hold
out for something better.

187
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,273
Like Cats Two.

188
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,350
- I'm sick of you all.

189
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,010
You're just jealous of my talent

190
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,840
and envious I'm a mega celebrity.

191
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,360
Get out. Take your
autograph books and go home.

192
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,193
- Leo.

193
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:17,290
- Hollywood.

194
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,293
- Unbelievers.

195
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,280
- Oh cursed hanging clouds of black

196
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,460
in oppressive sky of blue.

197
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,090
Hang on. Let me get myself aligned in it.

198
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:28,923
Okay, got it!

199
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:30,440
Oh, cursed hanging clouds of black

200
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,180
in oppressive sky of blue

201
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,230
unleash your dark lightening fury.

202
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,640
Let your rage be true.

203
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,392
Bring on your mighty wind!

204
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:40,230
(suspenseful music)

205
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,210
Let anger burn from Eastern
sea and rage from other coasts.

206
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,070
I may have never been to
me but I have been a ghost!

207
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,270
And all of the others of my kind will die

208
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,864
and when I fall so shall I!

209
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:57,030
Ah!
(loud crashing)

210
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,863
- Leo!

211
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,640
- Leo!
- Are you all right?

212
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,360
- Damn it you guys.

213
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,900
You're supposed to drop Leo

214
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,010
after he finishes saying his next line.

215
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,660
- Don't yell at us. It's not our fault.

216
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,580
We didn't do it.

217
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,403
- Leo's fat ass broke the beam.

218
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:13,530
(boy screaming)

219
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,420
- You guys probably sabotaged that beam

220
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,830
to give credence to your
ridiculous haunted curse story!

221
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,156
That and the fact that you're jealous.

222
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:21,761
- Huh?
- Huh?

223
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:25,770
(lighting crashing)
(girl screaming)

224
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,320
- What the fizzity-uck was that?

225
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,247
- Let's fizzity-uck and find out.

226
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,610
- Why couldn't it have
hit the math building?

227
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,220
- Or science. I hate science.

228
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,850
It's the stairs I'm telling
you, man, the stairs are cursed.

229
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,360
- Those stairs are not cursed.

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,320
We may have seen certain
spiritual phenomena lately,

231
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,950
but a simple thunder struck
is not proof of another.

232
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,990
This is a simple meteorological occurrence

233
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,097
that happens all the time.

234
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:49,900
"The Today Show" said it would rain.

235
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,430
- Look here white Al Roker,

236
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,620
a lightning bolt just
struck the stupid gymnasium

237
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,600
two days ago.

238
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,970
This is not a natural
meteorological occurrence

239
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,452
and Leo, I have to break it to
you. This play really blows.

240
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:04,880
(cat laughing hysterically)

241
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,130
That damn cat, I'll bet you're
behind this, aren't you?

242
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,350
You're the one who said
you fed off our fears.

243
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,160
Are you the one causing this? Fess up!

244
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,193
I hope you choke on a hairball.

245
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,150
- See there? There's no such thing

246
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,490
as a bunch of cursed
stairs paranoid Patty.

247
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,010
It's your cat. Now I want you
to put him under lock and key.

248
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,010
I go on tomorrow night and
I've already sent an invite

249
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,910
to The Times. I'll be in my trailer

250
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,530
and I don't want to be disturbed.

251
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,370
- Sorry. Look at Jennifer Lopez go.

252
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,240
- Dumb actors.

253
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,570
Anyway, we just need
to make sure he's safe.

254
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,194
Then when he makes it
big, we take our 15%.

255
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:41,194
(suspenseful music)

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,610
- Let me out of here!

257
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,670
I've lived in castles in royal kingdoms.

258
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,560
How dare you put me in a kitty carrier.

259
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,890
- Don't push it. I've got
the muzzle in my pocket.

260
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,563
- But I'm telling you I
haven't done anything.

261
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:07,760
- Satsuki, my class is all finished.

262
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,840
- Take the cat and don't let him out.

263
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,740
- Okay.

264
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,420
- Come on, Leo Olivie's about to go on.

265
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,253
- Right.

266
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,367
- We must save him.

267
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:20,297
- Well, look who's here.

268
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,390
- Where the hell are those morons?

269
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,410
I'm about to start and I need my crew.

270
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,420
I told Hajime not to be
late with my blood squibs.

271
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,320
- [Teacher] Leo!

272
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,230
- What?

273
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,380
- Hadley's here. Break a leg.

274
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,213
- Right.

275
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,450
Today fifth grade, tomorrow
"Inside the Actor's Studio. "

276
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,320
- [Announcer] The Phantom
of the Ghost Opera.

277
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:46,101
- Shalom Leo!
- My baby!

278
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,800
- I'm telling you kid, you
gotta let me outta here.

279
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,170
An old buddy of mine just showed up

280
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,903
and that's never a good sign.

281
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:59,100
- Don't listen to him
Keiichirou, shut up cat!

282
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,900
I'll cover up those air
vents with duct tape

283
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,190
if you say one more word.

284
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,403
All right, let's go.

285
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,840
- Okay. You're going to be
a good kitty, aren't you?

286
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,760
- Me? Oh, I'll be just perfect.

287
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,730
But don't come crying to
me when the understudy's

288
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,412
gonna need an understudy.

289
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:15,377
- Oh, behold from my fingers, blood!

290
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:19,894
But I don't have my blood squibs.

291
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:23,403
I must be a better method
actor then I thought.

292
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,970
Wait, somethings wrong.
My body won't move.

293
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,520
- Somewhere Keanu Reeves-

294
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,293
- Must be getting nervous.

295
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:35,730
- What do you think you're
doing? You can't be back here.

296
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,700
- Look stage hand, I don't
have to listen to you.

297
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,330
Leo's not dead yet. We're not late.

298
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,540
- Wait, something smells.

299
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,600
- Besides the play?

300
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,183
- I've got his props. Leo's
not a sudden hemophiliac is he?

301
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:50,360
- What?

302
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,260
He's bleeding like a stuck pig
out there. What's going on?

303
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,400
- Maybe it's just ketchup.

304
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,910
It couldn't be real blood, could it?

305
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,333
- Stigmata.

306
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,003
- Oh Jesus.

307
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:03,770
I don't get it. We
locked up that damn cat.

308
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,640
- This'll be the first R-rated blood bath

309
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,240
to ever be performed at an
elementary school. Sweet.

310
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:15,150
- Oi freaking vey, I'm
cursed by a ghost after all!

311
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,270
- By the time he figures out he's cursed,

312
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,720
his parents will be childless
well before the second act.

313
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,940
- Leo's going to die.

314
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,030
I should've given him the
number of Jews for Jesus.

315
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,603
Huh?
- Hey!

316
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,200
- Remember what the cat said?

317
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,390
He told us he saw a ghost earlier.

318
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,223
- Yeah.

319
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:32,750
- I bet that fur ball
could pick out which one

320
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,793
in this book of supernatural mugshots.

321
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,224
- Hey kid, come here.

322
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:41,590
- Huh?

323
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,943
- I'm getting a little lightheaded.

324
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,320
I think I'm running out of air.

325
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,338
You don't let me out, you're a cat killer.

326
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:49,290
- But I, they told me not to do that.

327
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,970
- Pussy. I guess you always do

328
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,913
what your big sister tells you to do.

329
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,320
- Okay.

330
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,768
- Later!
- Hey!

331
00:14:58,768 --> 00:14:59,851
- Keiichirou!

332
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,864
Where's the damn cat?

333
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:04,375
- But he.

334
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,393
- What?

335
00:15:05,393 --> 00:15:07,376
Keiichirou, what are you, retarded?

336
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:08,209
- Kinda.

337
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:10,125
- Obviously. Which way did he go?

338
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,574
(speaking gibberish)

339
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:12,750
(speaking gibberish mockingly)

340
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,820
Now we'll never find out who the ghost is.

341
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,267
I hope to God you're adopted.

342
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:18,670
(boy crying)

343
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,560
- It's all right Keiichirou darling.

344
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,620
- What?

345
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,863
- Satsuki, look there in the ghost diary.

346
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
- Oh cursed hanging clouds of black

347
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,350
in oppressive sky of blue.

348
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,543
Unleash your dark lightning fury.

349
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:39,399
- Oh.

350
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,630
- Aren't you glad we came Howard?

351
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,590
They're so cute.

352
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,423
- They're not that cute.

353
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:45,040
And for the last time we are
not having kids together.

354
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,330
- I put Kutabe in spiritual sleep.

355
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,880
A statue of Gizo was his resting place.

356
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,870
It resided on the fourth
step of the stairs.

357
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,210
And it was a scary ghost,

358
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,760
who would turn the words
spoken there into reality.

359
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,823
- That's it.

360
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:04,730
- Damn it.

361
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,100
The fourth step is the
only one that works.

362
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,160
That's why our wishes weren't granted.

363
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,200
And I'm still in a training bra.

364
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,530
- We need to put that thing
to spiritual sleep in a hurry.

365
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,423
- Well duh!

366
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:24,137
What? Who took the damn steps?

367
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:25,320
Hey, hold it!

368
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,153
- What?

369
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,080
- That staircase is gone. Don't
suppose you know anything?

370
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,670
- Yeah. Some drama teacher
paid us to tear it down.

371
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,810
Now, if you don't mind, I got
to get home to my trailer,

372
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,160
wife and kids. Bet you
can't wait to get older.

373
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,477
- Aw, hell!

374
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:46,560
- Hey, look, this is Gizo.

375
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,393
- You're right.

376
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,890
- [Satsuki] There's a talisman on it.

377
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,880
I wonder if that's what mom used.

378
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,936
- Someone chopped off his head.

379
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:56,410
- (boy laughing) He said head.

380
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,513
- Hey, here it is.

381
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,220
- Don't just stand there, fix it.

382
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,160
- I was gonna use this
glue for your big mouth,

383
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,712
but I guess masonry will do.

384
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,050
(cat laughing loudly)

385
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,820
- That's so sad, I could cry.

386
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,280
And just when you finally learn

387
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,640
how to put Kutabe to sleep too.

388
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,740
- There you are.

389
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,110
Listen to me you stupid
cat. Where is Kutabe?

390
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,960
If you don't tell us,

391
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,010
Leo's gonna break a lot
more than a leg tonight.

392
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,250
- So? I'm a ghost, I don't care.

393
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,550
One less human kid running around

394
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,780
isn't gonna break my heart.

395
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,410
- Oh, you're just bitter
because you're dead

396
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,243
and in the body of a cat.

397
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:29,617
If you don't help, I'm
taking you to the SPCA

398
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:30,640
and put you down.

399
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,510
- Fine, I'll still have eight lives left.

400
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,210
This cat thing definitely
has its advantages.

401
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,610
- Amanojaku.

402
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,443
- You.

403
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:39,500
- So you're telling us
that you don't mind?

404
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,180
- [Amanojaku] Not at all.

405
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:45,610
- So then you're familiar with
all the lines in the play?

406
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,800
- Let anger burn from Eastern sea

407
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,610
and rage from other coasts.

408
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,970
I may have never been to
me but I have been a ghost

409
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,970
(suspenseful music)

410
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,160
Let anger burn from Eastern
sea and rage from other coasts.

411
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,400
I may have never been to
me but I have been a ghost.

412
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,123
And all of the others of my kind will die.

413
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:09,150
- What?

414
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,180
I thought that piece of crap

415
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,500
was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber.

416
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,220
- If all the ghosts are to cease to exist.

417
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,170
What do you suppose will happen to you?

418
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,530
Now, If there's anything
you know cat, spill it!

419
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,310
- Fine, it's the stairs.

420
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,893
The ghost resides inside the damn stairs.

421
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,510
- They're onstage. The
steps are on the set.

422
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,190
- Wow. She must've been tired.

423
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,672
- Momoko! Is that you?

424
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:38,740
- Huh? Where am I?

425
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,250
- Heaven, get up.

426
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,670
- Aw, quit making fun of the Christian.

427
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,063
We got to save Leo.

428
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:46,530
- Gotta go, move it Haji.

429
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,940
- That was freaky.

430
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,773
- What?

431
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:50,990
- You sounded like mom. I
didn't know you did impressions.

432
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,100
- What are you talking
about? Oh my goodness.

433
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,223
Do I need to get back on my
medication? Are my eyes red?

434
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,810
(boy laughing maniacally)

435
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:03,843
- That bad huh?

436
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,490
- Oh it's awful but the real puzzler is

437
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,153
we're not pulling on the rope
and Leo's still floating.

438
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:12,703
- That's him. I mean it.

439
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,070
- How's the play?

440
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,000
- Awful.

441
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,135
- Here. And don't dare complain
if they're not in your size.

442
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:23,968
(suspenseful music continues)

443
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,980
Okay, I like you the least
so I nominate you, go.

444
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,813
- Damn it.

445
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:33,910
- Okay, hit it!

446
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,224
- Right.

447
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:37,488
- [Group] Kutabe, Kutabe, kick the bucket.

448
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:39,729
Kutabe, Kutabe, you can suck it.

449
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:42,060
Kutabe, Kutabe, kick the bucket.

450
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,724
Kutabe, Kutabe, you can suck it.

451
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:46,842
Kutabe, Kutabe, kick the bucket.

452
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:49,250
Kutabe, Kutabe, you can suck it!

453
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,161
- [Keiichirou] Kutabe,
Kutabe, oh, are we done?

454
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:56,371
- And now lightning
strike, lightning strike!

455
00:19:56,371 --> 00:20:00,038
(lightning crashing loudly)

456
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:04,439
(boy screaming)

457
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:14,120
(crowd murmuring softly)

458
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,243
- You must've done something wrong.

459
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,883
- What happened? Did I win the Tony yet?

460
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,040
I get it! The curse was
lifted by my acting.

461
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,330
I'd like to thank God and my parents.

462
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,199
You like me, you really like me.

463
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,211
(crowd cheering)

464
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:37,628
- Leo.
- You're so wonderful.

465
00:20:38,977 --> 00:20:41,688
- [Announcer] Fifth grade,
group B, the play was-

466
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:42,556
- Leo!

467
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:43,600
- Praise God.

468
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,210
- Hey, my posse.

469
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,530
- Now that's a play.

470
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,290
- I just give God all the glory.

471
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,560
- Oh no, no.

472
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,210
I was only thanking God because
all the celebrities do it.

473
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,300
He didn't do anything.

474
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,590
Besides if I really want my
acting to kick into high gear,

475
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,040
I got to go Kabbalah.

476
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,007
- Huh?
- Huh?

477
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,460
(teacher clapping loudly)

478
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,210
- Nice job, Leo. I'm very impressed.

479
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,440
I don't usually go in for improvisation,

480
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,960
but you made it work.

481
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,790
- Huh? You really think so?

482
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,860
Maybe I should write, direct and star.

483
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,363
I can be Kevin Smith but
I talk more in my roles.

484
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,960
- God, when did he go maniac?

485
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,887
- He even makes Chris Patton look humble.

486
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:20,304
- Or Greg Ayres.

487
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:24,250
- Hah, don't get too full of yourselves.

488
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,900
Remember, if it wasn't for me,

489
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,890
your friend would be headlining in Heaven.

490
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,590
Or according to born again Betty, Hell,

491
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,031
since after all, he is Jewish.

492
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:31,864
- Kaiya!

493
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:35,180
- You. What do you want?

494
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,422
- Thanks a lot man.

495
00:21:36,422 --> 00:21:37,255
- Huh?

496
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:41,071
(excitedly speaking gibberish)

497
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:43,540
I think she's right, you are retarded.

498
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,626
- What'd I say? Where you going?

499
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:48,043
