1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,540
(birds singing)

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,540
(clanging sound)
(birds chirping)

3
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:22,838
(clanging continues)

4
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:35,173
(siren ringing)

5
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,958
(crashing)

6
00:00:50,986 --> 00:00:53,986
(suspenseful music)

7
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,851
- [Man] You still haven't told me what to

8
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,587
do with these boards.

9
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:03,480
- [Man 2] Just move the boards
over there, board mover.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,703
- [Man] Okay, jackass.

11
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,777
Oh, splinter, oh!

12
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,828
- [Man 3] Hey man, if you
squint, it looks like a clown.

13
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:14,633
- [Man 2] You are here,
and you're an idiot,

14
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:17,448
and that does look like a clown.

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,713
- Ow, another splinter.

16
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,931
(switches clicking)

17
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:32,151
- That tunnel looks fine.

18
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,030
What the hell are they talking about?

19
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,273
- It is one creepy looking tunnel.

20
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:38,170
- Kind of reminds me of
your sister for some reason.

21
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,503
- Yeah, jackass.

22
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:44,845
(suspenseful music)

23
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,277
(singing in Japanese)

24
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:06,313
(singing in Japanese)

25
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:24,496
(suspenseful music)

26
00:03:29,112 --> 00:03:31,543
- [Man] So why'd they close
off the tunnel anyway?

27
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,560
- Years ago, people went in there but

28
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,360
they didn't come out,
not unlike your sister.

29
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,440
- Hey man, let's get off the sisters,

30
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,604
especially since I just got off of yours.

31
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:44,560
(laughs)
- [Man 3] I like his sister,

32
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
she is one hot (speaks Spanish).

33
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,565
- I know that you're gay.

34
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:52,210
Oh great, you'll like this.

35
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,950
Someone's on my ass.

36
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,530
- [Man 3] Slam on your breaks, eh?

37
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,050
Let him hit us, threaten his car.

38
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,540
- With my luck, he's probably your cousin,

39
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,163
with no damn insurance.

40
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:05,994
(wind blowing)

41
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,840
- 2.2 celsius metric system.

42
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,890
Who thought this was a good idea, again?

43
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,221
I'm just gonna put 100,
no one' gonna know.

44
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:20,250
(birds screeching)
(whimpering)

45
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,589
Damn, ever since Lost.

46
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:26,340
Trees move, can't see nothing.

47
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,060
Show me the damn monster!

48
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,220
And Loche, Loche is a freak.

49
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,460
I mean, I like Terry O'Quinn and all,

50
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,640
but that guy is a freak.

51
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,010
Is Naveen Andrews still
screwing Barbara Hershey?

52
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,400
Remember her lips in Beaches?

53
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,860
And why do fags like that movie so much?

54
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,450
Oh perfect, it's in Japanese.

55
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,050
(imitates Japanese)

56
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,310
Wait, that's Chinese.

57
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,983
Luckily I can read barricade.

58
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,571
(birds chirping)

59
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,360
Man!

60
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,750
I better hit a road or a
rest area or a Stucky's soon.

61
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,153
I gotta pee.

62
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:01,472
(suspenseful music)

63
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:07,320
Hmm, looks like the tunnel
in Grand Theft Auto.

64
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,870
I could beat up a couple of hobos,

65
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,470
snag some Molotov cocktails.

66
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,053
I love those things, boom!

67
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,877
(echoing)
Boom!

68
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:20,460
BOOM!

69
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:25,555
(whimpering)

70
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:30,055
(screaming)
(panting)

71
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:39,559
(whimpering)

72
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:47,483
(whimpering)

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,860
- Hello, little boy.

74
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,910
Would you like for me to give you a ride?

75
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:55,622
(whimpering)

76
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,240
DOn't be dirty, I meant my cab.

77
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,660
(screaming)

78
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,517
- No thanks, I'll take the bus!

79
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:10,249
(panting)

80
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:20,080
(engines rumbling)

81
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,503
- [Worker] Hey you!
This area is off limits!

82
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,453
What's the matter, kid?

83
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:33,286
Didn't you see that road sign?

84
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:35,490
I know it's in Chinese,
but red letters are

85
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,056
kind of universal, don't you think?

86
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:39,430
You think you could
just go where you want,

87
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,620
do what you want?

88
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,990
What am I gonna do with you?

89
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,060
Huh, huh, huh?

90
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,893
- Arrest me.

91
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:48,185
(upbeat music)

92
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:53,530
(mumbling)

93
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,410
- [Girl] The cafeteria
workers go on Strike,

94
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,432
and we have to do the work?

95
00:06:57,432 --> 00:06:59,112
What the hell is that about?

96
00:06:59,112 --> 00:07:01,530
(mumbling)

97
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,810
I don't even like milk.

98
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:07,573
(mumbling)

99
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,737
Here.

100
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,987
(mumbling)

101
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,703
Come on!

102
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,247
See, milk does do a body good.

103
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,660
(laughing)

104
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,110
(upbeat music)

105
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,330
- Well it's not the tunnel
of love, I'll tell you that.

106
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,210
- It's the Momiana tunnel.

107
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,710
- [Girl] So there is a tunnel?

108
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,310
- Yeah, but it's been
closed for construction.

109
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,690
I guess they must have opened
it for hurricane evacuees.

110
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,520
You remember what happened
on the highways in Houston.

111
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,550
- See there?
- What?

112
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,070
- How'd you make up trying to tell me this

113
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,315
hole just opened up in front of him?

114
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:46,558
Doesn't he wish?

115
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:48,710
So sad, someone praying for
something so bad he imagines it.

116
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,930
- That's not what I said, liar!

117
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,030
- Yes you did.

118
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:54,543
- I did not!
- Did so!

119
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,450
- I did not!
- You did so!

120
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,060
- Shut up! You're giving
more acid reflux than

121
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,253
my damn lunch.

122
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,437
- He started it.
- She started it.

123
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:05,160
(birds chirping)

124
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,200
- If there's a cliff at
the end of this mountain,

125
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,270
I'm pushing both of them off it.

126
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,240
- You did so!
- Did not!

127
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,218
- Don't you two think you
should give this a rest?

128
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:15,520
- [Both] No, we don't!

129
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,790
- Your hostility is aggravating
my shingles condition.

130
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,624
- That's gross.

131
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:23,207
(wind blowing)

132
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,020
- So why'd they close the tunnel anyway?

133
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,610
Was it like the big dig?

134
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,510
- What a rip off that was.

135
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,330
- Lo, many years ago, a terrible
accident took place inside

136
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,440
that cursed tunnel, cause unknown.

137
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,950
- So it was like the big dig.

138
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,140
- The last time anyone
went inside there was

139
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,550
Jennifer Love Hewitt
researching her new role and

140
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,430
trying to rediscover her career.

141
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,747
- See, it really is a ghost
tunnel, I told you so.

142
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:51,570
And it almost got me, too.

143
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,690
- Hey, where'd Kitchuro go?

144
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,220
- And Momiko's gone, too.

145
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,725
- You just know she's
witnessing to him, goddamn it!

146
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:02,560
- They're protected by fruit,
and they knew they were-

147
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,433
- Kitchuro, you're not going to hell!

148
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:05,984
- Sinful and naked without Jesus.

149
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:07,201
- Hello, sinner.

150
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,440
- God, can you bomb an
abortion clinic or something?

151
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,273
- You just wait.

152
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,820
When that wonderful President
finishes stacking the

153
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
Supreme Court, we won't have to.

154
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,180
Ont forget what I told
you about pre-marital sex.

155
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,488
- Abstinence only, got it.

156
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:21,488
(suspenseful music)

157
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,050
- Now, the ghost tunnel that's waiting to

158
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,230
kill us is that way, and
the road that goes around

159
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,990
the mountain won't get
us home before dark.

160
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,823
Suggestions?

161
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,600
- I have to get home before dark.

162
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,030
If I miss the E True
Hollywood Story on Sean Young,

163
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,863
I'll be pissed.

164
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:38,120
I vote tunnel.

165
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,310
- Oh dear, that doesn't
sound like a good idea to me.

166
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,400
- Never thought I'd say this,

167
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,510
but I'm with Momiko on this one.

168
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,593
(crying)

169
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,399
(all talking)

170
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,942
(brakes screeching)

171
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,410
(screaming)
- That's it, the creepy cab!

172
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,204
- Would you kids like a lift?

173
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:01,400
(whimpering)

174
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,240
That tunnel's as dark and scary and has as

175
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,340
much bad juju around it as my ex-wife's...

176
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,173
Nevermind.

177
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,300
- [Boy] Why'd we get in this car, again?

178
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,740
- Hey, you're the little
boy I saw yesterday?

179
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,573
- Me, no?

180
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,300
- I know what you're thinking.

181
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,460
Why aren't I Pakistani or some
stoned dread-locked Jamaican?

182
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,320
Well, you're all being racists.

183
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,600
Creepy Japanese men can
be cabbies too, you know.

184
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,650
But women should never
be allowed to drive.

185
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,703
- Don't say it.

186
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,013
- Okay, idiot.

187
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:35,551
(suspenseful music)

188
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,810
- I hope they don't
expect me to pay for this.

189
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:48,650
Hey, can I walk from here?

190
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,940
- No, and don't worry about the cab fair.

191
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,113
This ride is given out of
the generosity of my heart.

192
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,103
- [Boy] Sweet.

193
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:58,750
Hey, when did you buy this car?

194
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,170
And did you get a good deal on it?

195
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,280
- [Cab Driver] Just
two months ago, and no.

196
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,960
Damn hybrids haven't saved a cent on gas.

197
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,971
- [Boy] Two months? But...

198
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:10,460
- [Cab Driver] Well, well,
well, it looks like we're here.

199
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,293
- [Boy] Already?

200
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,711
- The entrance to another tunnel!

201
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:16,378
(all screaming)

202
00:11:24,998 --> 00:11:26,973
(all groaning)

203
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:28,201
- Kitchuro.

204
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:29,479
- What happened?

205
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,944
- I don't know, but that's why
I just hate paying for cabs.

206
00:11:31,944 --> 00:11:32,993
- Look!

207
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,079
(all whimpering)

208
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,899
- What the hell is that?

209
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,118
- Run!

210
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:41,618
(all panting)

211
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:47,278
(whimpering)

212
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,844
(screaming)

213
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:02,121
(screaming)

214
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:29,222
- Where, oh perfect.

215
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:33,171
- It looks like a cemetery.

216
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,869
- Where is everybody?

217
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:36,376
- I don't know.

218
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,610
- Obeying horror movie rules,
I'm going to go out alone.

219
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,600
You stay here while I
go out looking for help.

220
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,433
- Okay.

221
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,680
God bless him, leaving me here alone and

222
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,380
defenseless in a cemetery.

223
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,213
What a guy.

224
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,090
Huh.

225
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,312
- [Cat] I don't mean to
interrupt your beauty sleep,

226
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:04,012
God knows you need it, but get up!

227
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:06,625
- Where's Kitchuro?

228
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:11,850
Kitchuro, are you all right?

229
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,450
- Post traumatic stress
disorder is my diagnosis.

230
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,100
- Oh, thank you, Dr. Cat.

231
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,320
Where are we?

232
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,951
- This is obviously an Nominecki.

233
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:20,784
- Nominecki?

234
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:23,070
- The ghost of those
who died in the tunnels.

235
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,670
Poor lonely bastards.

236
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,450
I mean, wouldn't you be lonely
too after being trapped in

237
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,883
a dark, damp hole, year after year?

238
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:34,126
They're going to drag you down with them.

239
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:37,320
(laughing)
Sucker!

240
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,530
- In school, with
adults, with dead people,

241
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,713
I am just too popular for my own good.

242
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,079
- Glad to see you're
looking on the bright side.

243
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,693
- Okay.

244
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,860
I tried to put the tunnel ghost to sleep,

245
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,780
but the regrets tying them
to the living world were

246
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,330
so strong they wouldn't.

247
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,880
And they were so bitter and pissy that

248
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,030
they almost dragged me down with them.

249
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,100
It was almost as scary
as being trapped in the

250
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,380
Lincoln tunnel that time after

251
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,130
seeing Sarah McLachlan at Lilifair.

252
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:07,360
Their dark energy was more threatening and

253
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,273
life-sucking than a group
of frustrated granola dykes.

254
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,920
Oh, no, we're screwed!

255
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,560
- She's no J.K. Rowling.

256
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,409
- We've gotta find everybody
and get the hell out of here.

257
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:22,084
Kitchuro, wake up, Kitchuro!

258
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:23,053
(groaning)

259
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:25,952
- Good morning.
- Don't be cute.

260
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:28,369
(door opens)

261
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,585
- [Girl] Hi daddy!

262
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:32,418
- What the hell?

263
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:33,950
- You're home early.

264
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,085
Were the bars closed?

265
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:35,918
- No, I stopped by.

266
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,640
Oh, I've gotta sit down.

267
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,050
- Remember that test I flunked and

268
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,700
you beat me so hard I
couldn't sit down for a week?

269
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,780
Look now!

270
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,250
- Wow, that's my girl!

271
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,365
- I cheated off Bobby Simmons
just like you told me to.

272
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:50,483
- Help me to my chair.

273
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,111
- It's no blossom.

274
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:56,520
- [Cat] The Nominecki's
memories, you moron.

275
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,487
- Why do I have to watch it?

276
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:00,515
- I don't know!

277
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,848
(screaming)

278
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:06,844
(suspenseful music)

279
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,215
(screaming)

280
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,188
- Shh!

281
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:17,660
- Don't scare me like that.

282
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,380
- [Boy] Thank God they
didn't hear your loud scream.

283
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,740
Where are the others?

284
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,210
- Don't know, these people were heading to

285
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,260
this barbecue house, and I followed them.

286
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,500
(suspenseful music)

287
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,417
It's the cab driver with
the bad skin condition.

288
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,101
I forgot my hourly devotional.

289
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,157
(water dripping)

290
00:15:56,561 --> 00:16:00,811
- Hello, are you one of
dad's friends from the spa?

291
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,600
- Sorry, I don't want to get too close.

292
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,960
That skin thing may be hereditary.

293
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,330
- Fine.

294
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,270
You and dad must've been close.

295
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,850
You know he likes sweet, young fruit.

296
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,747
And I can tell you're used to being on

297
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:16,407
your knees when you're around him.

298
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,870
- Sochi, I'm sleepy.
- Me too.

299
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:23,090
- It's like a life-force BJ.

300
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,290
Wake up!

301
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,047
- Daddy, Cinnamon called and
she said you should get tested.

302
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:30,508
- (laughs) That Cinnamon, what a kidder!

303
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:32,570
- [Cat] While he's
consuming your life-force,

304
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,249
he's replaying memories of his
past, bad memories, ew bad!

305
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:39,438
- (laughs) Hey, maybe you
can cheat on the test.

306
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:41,383
- I'm clean, I promise.

307
00:16:44,142 --> 00:16:46,541
- [Girl] I got something for you, daddy.

308
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,790
- AZT?
Oh goody.

309
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,005
- It's a good luck charm/air
freshener, pina colada scent.

310
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:56,821
- I would've preferred new
car smell, but this is nice.

311
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,988
(giggles)

312
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:04,388
(rain falling)

313
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,772
(groaning)

314
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:14,980
- It looks like this
is it, my dear Hachimi.

315
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,644
- I'm not giving you a reach around.

316
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:20,616
(suspenseful music)

317
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:24,610
- [Voice] Momiko, Momiko open your eyes.

318
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,610
Ooh, look for the Jesus Christ
super-star looking graphic.

319
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,933
Ooh!

320
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:35,820
- [Momiko] Lord, is that you?

321
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,960
- [Voice] Yes, it is.

322
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,223
Nah, I'm just kidding.

323
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,350
Oh, I don't have much time,
I better get on with this.

324
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,930
Sorry about this little spiritual
possession thing lately.

325
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,390
I hate taking things
without asking permission,

326
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,800
but well, you know me.

327
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,760
Okay, right now you're in the

328
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,030
threshold between life and death.

329
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,530
Sucks being you.

330
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,380
Anyway, I can speak directly
to you right now instead of

331
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,879
through you, get it?

332
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:02,970
- Huh?

333
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,673
- [Voice] It's a nominecki,
long story. Look up!

334
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,400
- What, you want what?

335
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,380
- [Voice] Hang on, let
me put on my glasses.

336
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,707
Ooh, that's better.

337
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,920
All of you need to wake up,

338
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,470
then destroy your own tombstones.

339
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,830
- You're making me dizzy.

340
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,880
- Yeah I know, the afterlife is a trip.

341
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,687
Okay, destroy the tombstone
illusions any way you can.

342
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:30,845
- Illusions?

343
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:32,550
Where's the light of the Lord?

344
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,902
Hey, I'm not supposed to be dead yet.

345
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:39,068
(yelling)
(crashing)

346
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:41,550
Wake up, everybody! Satan
is trying to kill us.

347
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,770
You need to destroy your
tombstones, or you're going to die.

348
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,883
Any way you can, just imagine it.

349
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:51,083
- I don't have a good
imagination, but whatever you say.

350
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:56,091
(yelling)
(crashing)

351
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:59,186
(grunting)
(crashing)

352
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:01,794
- Fire in the hole!
(crashing)

353
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:06,794
- Go go, Godzilla!
(crashing)

354
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:10,311
(all panting)

355
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,400
- What was that about?

356
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:21,152
(screaming)

357
00:19:21,152 --> 00:19:22,916
(suspenseful music)

358
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,583
(all screaming)

359
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,070
- What the hell kind of plan was that?

360
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,140
- Your bad one!

361
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:35,075
- Huh?

362
00:19:35,992 --> 00:19:38,810
(screaming)

363
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,980
- Hurry up and get in the damn car!

364
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,620
- Oh, you can kiss my ass!

365
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,740
- I should've been
suspicious when it was free.

366
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,310
- Just shut up and get in the car.

367
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,660
- What?

368
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,143
- Yeah, I know it smells bad, they all do.

369
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,173
- Check this out.
(revving engine)

370
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:57,095
(laughing)

371
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,407
Oh, 50 points.
(laughing)

372
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:05,632
Jay walkers are last!
(laughing)

373
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,970
- We gotta tip this guy.

374
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,720
- [Cab Driver] Well, I wasn't
paying attention to the road.

375
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,330
I was really nervous
about my test results.

376
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,550
You have a couple of drinks,

377
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,760
bang one dirty hooker on a bad day,

378
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,580
and let me just tell you,

379
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,436
there may be something to
this abstinence business.

380
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,390
Anyway, I guess my kid's good

381
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,546
luck charm/air freshener worked.

382
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:27,963
(soft music)

383
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,610
My results came back
negative, I was clean.

384
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,477
And then...

385
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:41,609
Yep, wouldn't you know?

386
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:44,185
Bam!

387
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:46,602
(soft music)

388
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:56,679
(birds chirping)

389
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,240
- Okay, that is the most
depressing story I've ever heard.

390
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,330
- And I missed E!

391
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,830
- I mean, what was that all about?

392
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,510
He's negative, and then
gets hit by a semi?

393
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,477
Where is God?

394
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,237
(soft music)

395
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,413
- Over there.

396
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,063
- Shouldn't we have helped her?

397
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,050
- No.

398
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,600
- Do you think maybe my
parents taped my show for me?

399
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,870
I wanted to find out if
that baby thing was true.

400
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,990
I kind of feel sorry for her,

401
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,970
she was so good in Blade
Runner, and Stripes.

402
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,410
Remember how good she was in Stripes?

403
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,327
Coke is bad.

404
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,667
(singing in Japanese)

405
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,023
(screaming)

406
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:35,722
- Let go of me!
(screaming)

407
00:23:35,923 --> 00:23:36,756
Stop it!
