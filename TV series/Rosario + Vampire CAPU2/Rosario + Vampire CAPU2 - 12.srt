1
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,041
All you wives out there,
we're talking earthquakes,

2
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,125
lightning and fires, not
to mention husbands...

3
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,833
It's insane, you just
never know what

4
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,583
kinda crazy catastrophe's
gonna happen next.

5
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,875
Oh my gosh, this sure is scary.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
An earthquake?

7
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,958
What the...?

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,625
The sky...

9
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:49,833
What the heck is that?!

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,375
The great barrier that
gives protection to

11
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,166
Yokai Academy is
breaking apart!

12
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,625
Most likely, it's
leaking huge amounts of

13
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,541
monster energy into
the human world.

14
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,208
Didn't we seal
Lilith's Mirror away...

15
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,541
...so that wouldn't happen?!

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,250
She's right, why is
this even going on?

17
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,625
Because...

18
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,583
There's a rosary that
regulates the great barrier,

19
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,875
but it cracked under the sudden

20
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,500
and powerful onrush
of monster energy.

21
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,208
Wait... a rosary?

22
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,000
What happens if that
thing breaks apart?

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,833
A flood of monster
energy will call

24
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,166
forth an army of
savage beasts...

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,583
The entire human world will
be plunged into deadly chaos.

26
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,041
We're gonna die!

27
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,541
I knew it!

28
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,500
I knew you freaky monsters
were something to be afraid of!

29
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,625
And now, Tsuki, Auntie, and me!

30
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,583
We'll be eaten alive by a
horde of ravenous monsters!

31
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,875
I can't let this happen.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,083
Moka, hold on!

33
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,708
Hey, where are
you running off to?!

34
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,583
No way!

35
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,750
It looks exactly
the same as mine.

36
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,750
Stop!

37
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,541
Tsukune!

38
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,041
I need you to help me!

39
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,333
I can't...

40
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,416
Listen: I want you to take
my rosary off of me,

41
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,166
and put it in place
of the broken one.

42
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,208
No, if I do that, then you'll
change into the other Moka...

43
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,375
Yes, I know, but...

44
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,791
You can trust Tsukune all that
you want, but you're not strong

45
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,916
enough to protect him on
your own now, are you?

46
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,166
I can protect Tsukune.

47
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:36,875
I'm begging you!

48
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,250
Please, hurry up...!

49
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,250
I just...

50
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,875
I wanna protect you...!

51
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,000
You and Kyoko...

52
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:42,875
And of course...

53
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,166
Your mother, too!

54
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,750
I can save you all!

55
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,291
Hold on, Moka...!

56
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,000
The school director's gotta
be working on a plan right now!

57
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:51,708
No...

58
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,750
There's no more time!

59
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,208
Tsukune.

60
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,458
Oh, Moka!

61
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,333
Oh, Tsukune.

62
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,958
No, don't do it, Moka!

63
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,791
Tsukune...
I'm sorry...

64
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,416
We'll meet again...

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,041
Trust me...

66
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,000
I promise you.

67
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,333
I did it...

68
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,458
I really fought hard...

69
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,791
I fought just as hard as
the other me would've...

70
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,750
Oh, Tsukune.

71
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:42,250
Moka!

72
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:48,250
♪ opening song ♪

73
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,583
A week has passed since then...

74
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,833
The great barrier
was fully restored...

75
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,125
And the commotion
on campus died down...

76
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:32,125
As for Kyoko, she made it back
to the human world just fine.

77
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,041
Life at school really seemed
to calm down after that...

78
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,250
Things were almost the
same as they always were.

79
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,666
Meow, meow...!

80
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,250
Hello, you guys...!

81
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,166
How is everybody today?

82
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,250
All right then...!

83
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,041
How about we go
ahead and take roll...

84
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,208
Miss Aida?

85
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,541
Here.

86
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,625
Mister Aono?

87
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:52,833
Here.

88
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,083
Miss Akashiya?

89
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,291
Umm, excuse me, Miss Akashiya?

90
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,125
Yeah, I'm here.

91
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,041
All righty then, moving on...

92
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,125
Okay...

93
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,583
...let's see who's
next on the list.

94
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,583
Mister Inoue?

95
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,041
Here.

96
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,791
Hey, Yukari, I'm wondering
what we should focus on for

97
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,333
"The Yokai Gazette's" next
feature, whaddaya think?

98
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,250
Hmm, maybe one about questions
that might be on the mid-terms?

99
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,583
I was thinking we
could do something on

100
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,916
stalking without getting
caught, how 'bout that?

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,291
None of those ideas
really do it, do they?

102
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,541
Moka, what about you?

103
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,583
What kinda feature do
you think we should do?

104
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,416
A big story on kicking ass.

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,875
Huh?!

106
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,791
Flying kicks.

107
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:40,958
Roundhouse kicks...!

108
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,458
Spinning kicks...!

109
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,166
There's a ton of different
ways to kick someone's ass...!

110
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,375
If you want me to,

111
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,916
I can perform all of
them for you right now.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,833
That's very helpful, but I
think we'll probably pass.

113
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,208
Actually, kicks could
be a really nice piece...

114
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,541
Maybe it could help some
students lose a little weight.

115
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,750
I think it's perfect, Moka!

116
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,291
Aww, man...!

117
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,458
Having to do P.E.

118
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,125
first thing in the
morning really sucks!

119
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,833
Kurumu, you are seriously
lazy, you know that?

120
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,000
Tsukune!

121
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,250
The boys are in the
gym today too, huh?

122
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,166
Yeah, we're playing
basketball today.

123
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,583
Ya-hoo-hoo...!

124
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:17,333
Be sure to watch us real
good when we exercise, okay?!

125
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,708
Now, don't you go trying
to get the jump on us.

126
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,625
Umm, guys!

127
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,791
Hey stop.

128
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,250
You can't rub on me
in public like this.

129
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,750
Come on, guys, can everybody
please just knock it off?!

130
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,625
Hey, everybody!

131
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,708
Wha-What do you want?!

132
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,875
You lookin' for a fight?

133
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,208
No, I wanna piece
of this action, too.

134
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,458
So it's like this?
Am I getting it?

135
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,458
Is this the right motion?

136
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,208
Uh, Moka, what are you doing?

137
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,291
This is actually a lot
harder than it looks.

138
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,750
How am I doing now, huh?

139
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,750
Ok then, who'd like to
give it their best shot

140
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,291
and try to translate this poem?

141
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,833
Mister Aono?

142
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,250
Hey, Tsukune...
You listening?

143
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,291
Earth calling Mister Aono!

144
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,625
I'll try it.

145
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,958
"It is yet because I sleep
while thinking of you.

146
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,041
That every jet black
night, without fail,

147
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:15,416
I see you in my dreams,
though it helps not." That it?

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,166
What an amazing job...!

149
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,958
Absolutely perfect!

150
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,791
Hey...! Tsukune!

151
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,208
Moka, you're the best!

152
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,291
What are you doing for lunch,
you wanna eat with us?

153
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,333
I brought you some special
tomato juice I made myself!

154
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,458
Enough, you dumb groupies!

155
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,958
Moka is my big sister,
which means you should back off!

156
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,875
So you better not try
and move in on her!

157
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,416
Damn right!

158
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,750
Miss Kokoa's already got dibs
on Moka's popularity, whee!

159
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,833
Aww, come on...
No fair, Kokoa!

160
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,416
Please, just let us call
her our big sis too, okay?

161
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,875
Not a chance...

162
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,500
I finally got her changed
back into my real big sis,

163
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,125
so she's all mine, you got it?

164
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,958
Kokoa, you're so stingy!

165
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,875
Come on, let's go.

166
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,291
You really showed them
who's boss, Miss Kokoa!

167
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, Moka, now we can eat
our yummy wummy wunch,

168
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,208
just you and me to--...

169
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,500
Tsukune.

170
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,500
Is everything okay...?

171
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,833
It seems like you're down
in the dumps or something.

172
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,333
Oh, really, you think so?

173
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,083
I wouldn't say I feel
down in the dumps.

174
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,500
Are you hungry,
I've got some food?

175
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,833
Tsukune, listen to me.

176
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,125
Should we gaze at each other?

177
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,833
Like you two used to.

178
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,875
You and the other
Moka did it all the time.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,666
In that case...

180
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,291
Oh, Moka.

181
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,750
Tsukune.

182
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,916
Oh, Moka.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,375
Tsukune.

184
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,333
Oh, Moka.

185
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,791
Tsukune.

186
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,625
Moka.

187
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,166
Oh, Tsukune.

188
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,833
Oh, Moka.

189
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,958
So that's it, huh?

190
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,250
What?

191
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,083
The simple fact is,
you can't stop thinking

192
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,416
about the other Moka,
even though she's gone...

193
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,000
Am I wrong?

194
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,583
Tsukune.

195
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,666
Moka, what are you...?

196
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,750
Don't you understand?

197
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,291
This hand you're holding
belongs to the

198
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,833
Moka you've known
this entire time.

199
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,291
It just isn't the same!

200
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm tellin' you both, this other
Moka creeps the hell out of me!

201
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,291
No shit.

202
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,791
I take pride in my talent
for never being able

203
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,875
to take a hint, but this
girl even tops me.

204
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,208
Uh, yeah...

205
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,541
I don't know if that's
really a "talent" per se.

206
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,583
What are they doin' up here?

207
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,375
You've heard all this
stuff from my sister,

208
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,041
so I'm sure you know...

209
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,416
But back when
I was a little girl,

210
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,541
this is what I looked
like all the time.

211
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,250
Yeah, that's right.

212
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,791
I guess what I'm
really trying to say is:

213
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,875
the other Moka you've
spent all this time with

214
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,583
and grown to care about is
nothing more than a phantom.

215
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,125
Do you see what I mean?

216
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,750
This is fun, huh?

217
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:15,666
Hey, Tsukune...!

218
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,041
You and I should
study together!

219
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,916
"Chomp, slurp"...

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,583
That's what she
used to do, right?

221
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,875
Since the other
Moka can't be here...

222
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,708
I'll suck your blood for
you like she did.

223
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,250
That's far enough!

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,583
Don't you dare move
any closer to Tsukune!

225
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,625
Guys, what are you...?

226
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,666
Come on, stop it, you two!

227
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,458
Fighting's no good for anyone!

228
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,541
--So just calm down okay.
--All right, fine.

229
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,708
Please, just don't forget
what I told you, Tsukune.

230
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,458
You need to accept the
fact that the other Moka

231
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:57,125
you knew isn't ever
going to come back.

232
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,791
I'll go now.

233
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,625
She's gone...
Forever.

234
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,125
Oh, Tsukune...

235
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,875
I'm worried about you.

236
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,875
I've gotta help him somehow...

237
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,750
What if Tsukune never recovers?

238
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,125
Right now, I need to help
Tsukune get through this.

239
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,041
And there's only
one way to do it.

240
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,375
Tsukune Aono.

241
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,916
He could be trouble...

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,041
I'd better watch him.

243
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,583
We haven't had any
issues with the new rosary.

244
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,500
There's no need to fear the
collapse of the great barrier.

245
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,625
Moka Akashiya.

246
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,458
She certainly saved us
from peril this time, eh?

247
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,250
Umm...

248
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,875
Listen, about the rosary.

249
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,458
I've seen the broken one
and compared it to Moka's...

250
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,041
And as far as I can tell,
they seem to be identical...

251
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,708
Why is that?

252
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,500
The answer to that is simple.

253
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,041
They were crafted by
the same person, Rubi.

254
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,500
What does that...?

255
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,750
What I'm about to tell you
right now must remain

256
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,583
a secret between the two
of us, do you understand?

257
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,625
I... I will do whatever
you ask of me.

258
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,000
And that's everything.

259
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,458
So this is it for homeroom.

260
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,333
But remember, folks,
tomorrow we're having

261
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,750
the Future Paths
Information Session.

262
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,125
Oh, that reminds me.

263
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,708
So the good news is,
you only have class until noon.

264
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,541
What's the matter, Tsukune?

265
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,708
I don't know...

266
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,666
It's nothing, I just...

267
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,000
I guess I just wanted
to hear your voice.

268
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,791
Well, well!

269
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:35,458
Ah...!

270
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,666
Come to think of it,

271
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,333
we had some excitement
here the other day!

272
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,666
We had a big earthquake and a
huge storm at the same time...

273
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,666
Were you guys okay over there?

274
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,458
Uhh...

275
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,666
Yeah.

276
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,708
Well, I'm certainly
glad to hear that...!

277
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,708
Oh, that's right...

278
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,958
I meant to ask you!

279
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,125
What?

280
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,625
It's about that girl
who came to visit,

281
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,083
Moka Akashiya, how is she?

282
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:55,708
Oh...

283
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,750
Well, you know...

284
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,041
She's doing fine...

285
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,250
Why do you ask?

286
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,250
It's something Kyoko
said when she got back.

287
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,916
She keeps crying on
and on about how

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,625
she did something
terrible to that girl.

289
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,875
Everything's fine...

290
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,083
Just tell Kyoko...

291
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,125
There's nothing for her
to feel upset about.

292
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,375
All right, will do...!

293
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,250
By the way...

294
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,791
I wanted to tell you, Tsukune,

295
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,125
you should bring that nice young
lady back for another visit.

296
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,625
Kyoko would love
to see her again.

297
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,708
I'm sure she would.

298
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,083
Tsukune.

299
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,833
Oh, Moka.

300
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,416
I just...

301
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,166
I just want to see you.

302
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,250
One more time.

303
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,791
Rubi?

304
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,958
It's kinda late, you know?

305
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,083
Is something wrong?

306
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,083
I'm just...

307
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,666
...having some regrets.

308
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,541
"Regrets" about what?

309
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,000
It's a long story about
how I came to be here.

310
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,166
The director's been
taking care of me...

311
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,291
In return, I've been managing
the great barrier for him...

312
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,875
But in the end, I failed.

313
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,333
I couldn't keep it intact.

314
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,833
And it was because of
my failure that Moka had to...

315
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,625
Hold on, Rubi,
that wasn't your fault!

316
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,083
It was!

317
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,875
Listen, Tsukune...

318
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,375
I'm disobeying a direct
order by doing this.

319
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,750
Rubi?

320
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,541
There's something I'm not
supposed to tell anyone,

321
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,208
but I'm gonna tell
you, Tsukune...

322
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,666
We can bring her back...

323
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,000
The other Moka
we all knew and loved...

324
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,750
But there's only one way.

325
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,333
We can bring Moka back?

326
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,083
Back for yet another visit
because duty calls at Yokai!

327
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,500
What was that...?
Did you say "doodie and balls?"

328
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,416
No! You know
that isn't what I said!

329
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,666
When you scream like that,

330
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,833
the crow's feet on your
face look much worse.

331
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:27,666
Please!

332
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,125
On my soft and supple skin?

333
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,625
I defy you to point
out a wrinkle...!

334
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,666
And look at my big,
beautiful, bouncing boobies.

335
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,375
Milk cow.

336
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,416
What did you call me?!

337
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,333
Eh...?

338
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,500
You're saying we should forget
about this middle-aged snow hag,

339
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,916
and go to the
Future Paths session?

340
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,958
Well...
My Mizore's "future path"

341
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,541
has already been well
decided as of now.

342
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,875
And what do you mean by that?

343
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:55,750
Papa...!

344
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,625
Mama...!

345
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,083
Over this way!

346
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,291
You guys sure got
here early, didn't you?

347
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,916
The information session
isn't until later today.

348
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,041
There's nothing wrong
with being early.

349
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,958
"No time like the present,"
right, darling?

350
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,625
Hey...!
What does that mean?

351
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,958
What do you think?

352
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,291
It's time for my Mizore

353
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,291
and that nice Tsukune boy
to have their wedding!

354
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,625
To have their wedding?!

355
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,916
Now, wait a second...

356
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,625
By wedding, do you
actually mean that

357
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,208
you and Tsukune are
getting married?!

358
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,708
Mizore...!

359
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,291
What kinda crazy bullshit is
your mom talking about, huh?

360
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,416
Well, last night...

361
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,541
My mother and I
made a decision.

362
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,916
We couldn't just let
Tsukune go on like that.

363
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,583
We need to do something
to get him out of his funk...

364
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,250
And this is the best way.

365
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,333
"The best way;"
who are you to decide?!

366
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,000
Listen, I know what I'm doing...

367
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,250
In my own way,

368
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm trying to think of
what's best for Tsukune.

369
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,291
We've worked everything out;

370
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,666
once Tsukune graduates
from Yokai Academy,

371
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,041
he'll live with us
in our village

372
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,625
and be accepted as
Mizore's fiancé.

373
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,666
Th-That's insane!

374
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,416
In that case, I'll marry
Tsukune, as well!

375
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,250
What?

376
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,041
Not you, too, Kurumu!

377
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,208
I have to...!

378
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,291
Only one of us
can cheer Tsukune up...

379
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,875
And that person is me!

380
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,291
And what makes
you think it's you?

381
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,000
Because I've been there.

382
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,750
You've got nothing on me...

383
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,041
I've wanted Tsukune
from the very beginning...

384
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,166
I mean...

385
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,375
There've been times
when I thought

386
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,291
I could never top
Moka in his eyes.

387
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,333
But now that Moka's
gone for good!

388
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,208
And I'm the best one left!

389
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,291
That's the way to stand
up for yourself, Kurumu,

390
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,250
I just knew my daughter
had it in her!

391
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,291
Do you really think...

392
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,750
I'll stand by and let
you get away with that?!

393
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,416
It's not a question of "let'...

394
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,375
Whichever one of us wins walks
away with Tsukune as the prize!

395
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,666
Mama, what are you doing?

396
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,708
Huh...?

397
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,750
You're saying you're
ready to fight

398
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,208
to protect my claim
to Tsukune...?

399
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,833
Please, stop all this!

400
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,625
Did anyone ask
what Tsukune wants?

401
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,583
We can't just decide
without asking him!

402
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,083
You know what, I
think she's right;

403
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,750
we should just go ask Tsukune
directly, shouldn't we?

404
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,333
We all know who he's
going to pick, don't we?

405
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,041
Oh, Tsukune-woonie,

406
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,583
this is your future mommy
dearest calling you!

407
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,041
Hi, I'm your future
mother-in-law!

408
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,458
It is no laughing matter...

409
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:10,000
"Mother-in-law, daughter-in-law"
problems are rough.

410
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,208
What do you think,
all you housewives?

411
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,750
Oh, dear...
I got a shiver up my spine.

412
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,083
Not here?

413
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:17,875
Ah...

414
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,208
Now that I think about it,

415
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,208
I guess I haven't seen
Tsukune all morning long.

416
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,166
What did you just say?

417
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,666
Tsukune, come out!

418
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,375
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

419
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,958
Miss Kokoa!
Miss Kokoa!

420
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:31,833
Big trouble, whee!

421
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,625
That Tsukune Aono's gone ...!

422
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,416
Start talking bat, what do
you know about Tsukune?

423
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,958
You better tell us, or I'll turn
you into a block of ice and

424
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,000
smash you into tiny bits with
this hammer, you understand?!

425
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,458
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

426
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,125
No, whee!

427
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,666
All right!

428
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,333
Where do you think
you're going, Tsukune?

429
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:09,916
I...

430
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,291
I just...

431
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,875
You're supposed to be at
the information session now.

432
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,000
Then after, we've got our
Newspaper Club meeting.

433
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,083
I thought that maybe you and I

434
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,125
could walk to the
clubroom together.

435
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,416
But, Moka, I...

436
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,625
Oh, that's right,
since we're on the subject.

437
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,083
I had a great idea for a new
feature for the newspaper...

438
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,000
Maybe you could give
me your opinion on it.

439
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,958
Moka, I...

440
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,583
I can't go with you today.

441
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,208
Am I not good enough for you...?

442
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,083
Tell me the truth.

443
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,500
I'm sorry, Moka, I have to go!

444
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,041
So I guess that's
goodbye then, isn't it?

445
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,375
The three Dark Lords?

446
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,875
Yes.

447
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,666
The three Dark Lords are a
group of elite Supermonsters,

448
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,000
one of whom is the
school's director.

449
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,541
Those three are the
founders of Yokai Academy...

450
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,875
...and that's not all...

451
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,000
One of the lords
crafted a rosary.

452
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,875
The one that was used
for the great barrier...

453
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,416
That same Dark Lord
made Moka's too.

454
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,333
So, if I could find
that Dark Lord...

455
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,750
Then it's very possible
you might be able

456
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,208
to obtain a new rosary
for Moka from him.

457
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,416
Where can I find him?

458
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,708
Tell me!

459
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,750
Far from here,
on the northern barrier.

460
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,208
But, you need to be prepared,
Tsukune; it's said that people

461
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,583
who venture near the
Dark Lord's castle...

462
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,750
They're destroyed
without mercy!

463
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,333
Who cares?

464
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,750
If there's even a chance I'll
be able to see Moka again...!

465
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,666
Whoa, you sure seem
to be in quite a hurry, kid.

466
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,541
That's right, I am...

467
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,666
I'm headed straight for
the northern barrier.

468
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,833
If you'd like me to,
I can give you a lift.

469
00:21:58,916 --> 00:21:59,666
No.

470
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,833
This time, I'm on my own...

471
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,041
This is my journey.

472
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,458
Suit yourself...

473
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,041
If you wanna get to
the northern barrier,

474
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,375
turn left at the cross inside
the tunnel and go from there.

475
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,666
Good luck, you've gotta
long road ahead.

476
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,916
Thank you very much...!

477
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,333
See ya!

478
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,500
Hey, kid...!

479
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,916
After all you went
through at this school,

480
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,291
do you ever regret coming here?

481
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,166
No, not a bit!

482
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,416
Good answer, kid.

483
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,208
But still...

484
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,958
The real question is whether
or not he'll manage

485
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,625
to make it back from that
castle in one piece.

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,625
Moka...

487
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,541
Don't worry, I'll get
you a new rosary and

488
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,541
bring it back here if it's
the last thing I do...!

489
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,666
I won't let you down!

490
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,875
Kill me now, whee...!

491
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:49,708
Really...

492
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,375
Kill me, whee!

493
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,166
There's no way in
hell I'm gonna let

494
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,708
you ruin everything, Tsukune!

495
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,916
Not while I'm still breathing.

497
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:42,458
In the days after an eternal
farewell, the path that

498
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:46,083
leads us to reunion seems
so endlessly long...

499
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:49,291
But will you follow that
path even then, Tsukune...?

500
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,291
Next time...

00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,625
"Cross and Family
and a Vampire."
