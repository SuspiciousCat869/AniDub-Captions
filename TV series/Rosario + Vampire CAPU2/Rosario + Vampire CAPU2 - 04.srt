1
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,666
Tsukune, wait up!

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,291
Moka!

3
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,666
Good morning!

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,583
Good morning, Tsukune! 

5
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,291
Unless I'm mistaken,
it looks like Tsukune

6
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,125
just ran away
from you, didn't he?

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,958
No he didn't...! 

8
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,916
Ha!  He obviously doesn't
take you seriously...

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,958
I mean, why would he?

10
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,791
You are just
a little kid, after all.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,125
Not everything is about
being big, you know?

12
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,083
No one ever told you
a woman's feminine appeal

13
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,291
is in her breasts...?

14
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,041
Her...

15
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,375
breasts... 

16
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,625
But come on, I can't
believe you don't know that.

17
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,500
You may be little,
but you're not a baby!

18
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:04,541
See what I mean? 

19
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,291
You're a kid! 

20
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,458
I don't have
to listen to this!

21
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,750
Pay attention, now.

22
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:15,000
Anastrophe is when we
invert the normal word order...

23
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,833
--Tsukune.
--Tsukune?

24
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,583
Here.

25
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,208
Tsukune's never
looked at me that way before...

26
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,333
Not the way he's
looking at her.

27
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,833
I wonder...

28
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,125
Could it really be
that I'm just too little?

29
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,916
Soon as I fill this out,
he'll notice me.

30
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,625
Oh, wow.

31
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,625
That dress is beautiful. 

32
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,375
Would you do me the honor
of giving me this dance?

33
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:00,416
Yukari...!

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,833
We can do this... 

35
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,083
yeah! 

36
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,708
Tsukune. 

37
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,375
Oh, Moka. 

38
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,541
Oh, Tsukune. 

39
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,000
Moka.

40
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,500
You really do smell delicious. 

41
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,250
The fact that he lets
her do that is weird.

42
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,000
But she does have those... 

43
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,250
and Kurumu too!

44
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,041
Mine are so small...

45
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,875
Gosh! 

46
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,375
I want tits!

47
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,458
Hello, is anybody in here? 

48
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,333
Awesome! 

49
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,750
Looks like the coast is clear! 

50
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,958
Before someone shows up...

51
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,875
I haven't grown
one bit since last year!

52
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,500
He obviously doesn't
take you seriously...

53
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,416
I mean, why would he? 

54
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,333
You're just a kid! 

55
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,833
Just wait!

56
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,541
One of these days, I'm gonna
grow up and have a hot body,

57
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,166
and Tsukune won't be able
to take his eyes off me!

58
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,250
You're tired of
being small, eh?

59
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,083
The school nurse...!

60
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,250
I'm really sorry! 

61
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,666
Don't worry,
I'm not sick or anything!

62
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,333
There's no need to run away.

63
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,958
My name is Mako Yakumaru...

64
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, now... 

65
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,708
You wanna grow up, right? 

66
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,666
I'm sorry to eavesdrop, but I
happened to hear you back there.

67
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,916
If you want, I could help you
out with your little problem.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,875
But it's impossible,
there's no kinda magic that

69
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,875
can turn a kid into an adult!

70
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,458
Oh, I don't know about that. 

71
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,375
Don't worry, Yukari, I'm gonna
make you all grown up...

72
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:17,916
Right...

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,375
Now. 

74
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,125
A-am I in the nurse's office? 

75
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,583
What happened? 

76
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,041
Did I lie down in here and
go to asleep at some point?

77
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,208
How strange. 

78
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,833
I think I'll just
go home early today.

79
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:38,625
Holy shit!

80
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,375
That girl is super sexy! 

81
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,416
Oh, I wanna do
terrible things to her!

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,125
Why is everybody
looking at me like that...?

83
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:45,916
Oh...! 

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,458
Moka must be back there! 

85
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,958
--This girl's the real deal!
--She is smokin' like a chimney!

86
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,833
What the heck
is going on here...?

87
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,125
How weird! 

88
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,083
And then...!

89
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,000
Who is that? 

90
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,458
Beats me. 

91
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,791
Somehow, I get the feeling
I've seen her before, but...

92
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,000
Hey Tsukune! 

93
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,041
How are you today? 

94
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:05,750
Eh... 

95
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,791
Umm, well... 

96
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,916
Who are you?

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,083
What's her deal, huh? 

98
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,458
Who does she think
she is, acting all fresh

99
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,750
with Tsukune like that?

100
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,750
Tsukune's mine.

101
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,083
I told you, he's mine! 

102
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,166
All right! 
Come on, guys, take it easy! 

103
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,500
Uh, excuse me, but that's
Yukari's seat you're sitting in.

104
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,041
Duh...?! 

105
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,541
I know that! 

106
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,416
Yeah, but you're
not Yukari, you're...

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,541
Huh...?! 

108
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,041
What in the world
has gotten into you?

109
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,291
I am Yukari Sendo, don't you
recognize your own friends?

110
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,625
Watch this! 

111
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:34,541
She's right! 

112
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,416
That move is...! 

113
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,750
Yukari's favorite... 

114
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,250
Magic trick! 

115
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,041
It's not like
it's a big deal...

116
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,583
What the...?

117
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,833
Oh no... 

118
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,875
My skirt's so short everyone
can see my little bear-y!

119
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,000
The next class period is...

120
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,250
15 minutes 

121
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,166
This body...!

122
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,250
I can't believe
it's actually me!

123
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,583
What was that Tsukune...?

124
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,208
Well... 

125
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,958
Thank you. 

126
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,333
So...? 

127
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,333
Tell me, Yukari, how do you
like being all grown up?

128
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,083
Oh it's great! 

129
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,125
I love it! 

130
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,083
That's wonderful. 

131
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,125
Thank you so much! 

132
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,500
It was my pleasure. 

133
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,083
How can I ever thank you? 

134
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,041
You really made this
thing happen for me...!

135
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,875
You're the best nurse ever! 

136
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,083
I'm glad I was able
to help you out.

137
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,583
Hey, Moka!

138
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,666
Let's take a bath
together again tonight!

139
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,333
Hurry up!

140
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,291
Let's get going! 

141
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,833
Eh? What? 
Hey, hold on a sec! 

142
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,458
Is something wrong?

143
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,875
Nothing.

144
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,041
Wha-what are you...?

145
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,333
I'm looking at your boobs. 

146
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,375
I always remembered them being
so much larger than that,

147
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,458
but I guess they're really
not that big after all, huh?

148
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,333
But, your skin is
so smooth and silky,

149
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,083
I can't help but
love those things!

150
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:06,875
What are you doing...?

151
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,708
Yukari, cut it out! 

152
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,500
No doubt about it,
this is Yukari.

153
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,041
Hey, Moka...

154
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,166
I was wondering,
where do you buy your bras?

155
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,041
Wait, are you saying
you don't have a...?

156
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,041
Yep!

157
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,291
I'm totally
bra-less right now!

158
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,958
So.  In other words you... 

159
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,916
No, that's not good
at all, Yukari!

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,416
It's really, really dangerous!

161
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,791
We'll buy you some tomorrow! 

162
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,791
But until then,
you cannot leave the dorm!

163
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,583
I don't get it, why not? 

164
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,791
Because I told you not to! 

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,583
Okay?

166
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,416
Okay, you got it. 

167
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,666
Wow! 

168
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,333
They're so cute! 

169
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,708
Judging by how large Yukari
is right now, I think her

170
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,083
under bust is probably
about this size...

171
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,750
How do you suppose she got
so huge all of a sudden?

172
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,958
She probably slept for
about ten thousand years;

173
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,083
I hear that makes kids grow.

174
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,458
I'm betting it's magic,
don't you think?

175
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,041
Ask.

176
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,458
Hey!  I bet you're not even
really Yukari, are you...!

177
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,916
No way she could
grow those melons!

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,541
Nice try, but wrong... 

179
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,291
I am Yukari, and my boobs are
one hundred percent magic-free!

180
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,666
It's the real deal;
I'm a true woman now.

181
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,291
It's so amazing...!

182
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,458
I'm amazing... 

183
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,958
these are so amazing! 

184
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:51,083
Now that I'm all grown up, I'm
the most popular girl in school!

185
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,916
I can wear the
raciest outfits I want!

186
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,583
And as for sex appeal...

187
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,458
I totally rock! 

188
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,166
Yukari, no. 

189
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,041
My poor sweet darling. 

190
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,291
My eternal rosebud is gone. 

191
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,666
My Yukari's gone
away from meeeeee!

192
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,458
You'll never guess
what happened next.

193
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,375
All of a sudden he started
gushing blood out of his nose.

194
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:44,250
Well, Yukari, that stuff's gonna
happen now that you're so sexy.

195
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,708
Come look. 

196
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,416
You are a sexy young woman... 

197
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,041
There's not a sexier girl
in the whole school.

198
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,625
Mako. 

199
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,291
Hey Tsukune!

200
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,666
Oh, catch me

201
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,250
What the he-...?! 

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,041
Yukari, I...!

203
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,541
Oww, that really hurt! 

204
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,958
You could've killed me. 

205
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,166
Tsukune... 

206
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,916
Look at you, acting
all bashful n' stuff.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,708
With the way I look
now I can't fail...

208
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,125
Take my hand.

209
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,958
Oh Thank you very much. 

210
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,708
Boom-bidda-bidda-boom
bidda-bidda-boom-bid...

211
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,166
Uh, look: I gotta be
somewhere, okay?

212
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,708
Boob fail!

213
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,125
Don't look at her...!

214
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,083
Don't look at her...! 

215
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,208
Don't look at her! 

216
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,500
Dude, check it out! 

217
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,208
She's hot!

218
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,875
She's babe-alicious! 

219
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,916
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
does everybody have one?

220
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,333
Don't forget
these handouts, now!

221
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,125
Oh, Tsukune. 

222
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,500
What is up with him?

223
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,250
Tomorrow we're doing body
measurements for the

224
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:58,250
whole school, and everyone
is required to participate.

225
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,458
So let's all be accurate
and precise about logging

226
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,791
our growth, okay?

227
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,291
Okay, ma'am! 

228
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,375
Finally!
This is my chance.

229
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,583
Why's this taking so long.

230
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,416
We'll be measuring soon, so
just a little bit longer, okay?

231
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,375
But you know that
whatever we weigh today...

232
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,083
will stay on our
permanent record!

233
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,416
When you think about it that
way, what difference does...

234
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,458
With this amazing new
figure of mine, these body

235
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,541
measurements'll be a
walk in the park...!

236
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,750
Now I'll have documented
proof that my gorgeous body

237
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,916
is the best in
the whole school!

238
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,833
But hold on a sec...

239
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,000
Is it possible this
body's not very sexy?

240
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,000
Yukari, let's go! 

241
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:53,791
Right behind you!

242
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:54,791
Hey!  There's Yukari!

243
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,666
And Moka, too! 

244
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,916
It's a "two-fer!"

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,916
What the hell...?! 

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,833
And what am I? 
Chopped liver! 

247
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,875
Okay, people...!

248
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,666
Everybody line up in an orderly
fashion to get measured!

249
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,791
What are you doing here? 

250
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,666
It looks like
the gang's all here!

251
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,333
You're a doctor now, huh? 

252
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,708
No, I'm just helping out
with the measurements.

253
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,125
Actually, it's
a real long story.

254
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,666
You're full of those,
aren't you?

255
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,250
Yes and this one's so long. 

256
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,791
Where's Yukari? 
Is she here? 

257
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,458
What, you can't see?

258
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,333
I finally grew up!

259
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,666
Yeah, she did.

260
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,208
We have no idea how. 

261
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,125
But it's her.  Yukari. 

262
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,791
Looks like
I found you, big sis!

263
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,958
Just like always you're there
with that wimpy-ass gang

264
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,875
of girls.

265
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,500
Where'd the little runt go?

266
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,208
When you say "little runt,"
do you mean Yukari...?

267
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,208
To tell you the truth, I don't
think she's that different

268
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,625
from you in terms
of size, whee!

269
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,041
At any rate, I'm gonna spy
on my sister, and...

270
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,916
Hey, why are you all fighting
like little sissies?!

271
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,125
Hi...!

272
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,708
It's not time for the
first-year students quite yet!

273
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,416
You haven't heard the last
of me, o' sister of mine!

274
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,750
Let go of me! 

275
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,833
It's seventy-five centimeters.

276
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,125
All right, next
is Moka Akashiya.

277
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,291
What's the matter with you?

278
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,458
Rubi, it's just
showing you my...

279
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,500
My breasts... 

280
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,500
I'm just a bit... 

281
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,125
Nothing to be
embarrassed about.

282
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,666
We're both girls,
aren't we...?

283
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,666
Don't worry;
it'll be over in a flash.

284
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,916
Okay...

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,291
now let's see here. Wow, I can't
believe they're really...

286
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,708
We haven't seen
much of Gin lately.

287
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,583
Yukari Sendo, you're next! 

288
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,833
I'm right here! 

289
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:50,958
Dear god!

290
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,333
They're huge! 

291
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,791
Yeah.

292
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,875
What's that smirk? 

293
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,500
Some kinda dumb
challenge or something?

294
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,750
You don't get to call me
"flat-chested" anymore!

295
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,958
Hey, lemme see that! 

296
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,375
Wow...!

297
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,583
That's really big! 

298
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,583
With these kinda numbers,
Tsukune's as good as mine!

299
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:11,833
So, who's next? 

300
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,125
--Ah, Kurumu Kurono, you're up! 
--Please...! 

301
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,041
No way I'll lose
to the likes of you!

302
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,625
What?

303
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,500
Can't you see the
numbers on this card...?

304
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,125
Well, I'm awfully sorry 'bout
this, but it looks like...

305
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:23,666
I... 

306
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,250
win. 

307
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,500
All right, Mizore,
you're next...

308
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,333
Uh, Mizore? 

309
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,708
Where's Mizore? 

310
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,458
You rock, Tsukune.

311
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,125
Rock that forward bend. 

312
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,791
--Come on, show me! 
--I don't wanna! 

313
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,708
How come?

314
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,791
That's one fifty
two point nine.

315
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,208
No, that can't be right... 

316
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,708
Look, I wanna be
measured again, okay?

317
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,416
Meow?

318
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,375
Hey!  Are you deaf? 

319
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,583
Measure me again! 

320
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,291
Y-you're too close, meow. 

321
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,041
One fifty three, on the dot.

322
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:56,666
Yeah...! 

323
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,541
One fifty three! 

324
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,458
Even a millimeter is crucial... 

325
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,041
Those jerks don't understand!

326
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,625
I guess if I wanna win,
I'm gonna need to be

327
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,291
a whole lot bigger, huh...?

328
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,458
What if I was even
bigger than this?

329
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:09,833
Oh, wow!

330
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,333
Yukari, you're the sexiest! 

331
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,083
Are you all right?

332
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:15,666
Oh, yeah...

333
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,666
Sure... 

334
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,250
I'm totally fine,
it's nothing!

335
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,291
Wait Yukari.

336
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,750
Hey, where are you going? 

337
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,166
To the bathroom! 

338
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,083
That's it!

339
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,500
Mako can help me out!

340
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,083
Mako, I need you...!

341
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,041
Please, I want you
to make my breasts bigger...

342
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:53,708
If they were bigger
then--If they were bigger,

343
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:54,416
Tsukune would...

344
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,125
Stupid little girls. 

345
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,000
"Stupid?"

346
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,000
That's right... 

347
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,583
You're so naive... 

348
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,208
You all think if you
change your appearance,

349
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,791
that'll fix everything...

350
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,458
Do you actually think
things are that simple?

351
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,041
Of course... 

352
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,666
If every single one of you were
smart enough to realize that...

353
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,000
I'd be left on my own,
without any prey to feed on.

354
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,416
What are you talking about...? 

355
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,416
I don't get it. 

356
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,625
What a nice expression
on your face...

357
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,541
So much negativity
swirling around in there...

358
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,500
All the foolish hopes... 

359
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,625
All the unfulfilled desires. 

360
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,208
Mako, no...!

361
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,291
What's wrong with you? 

362
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,958
Oh no, there's
nothing wrong with me.

363
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,125
This is who I am. 

364
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,458
No, I don't believe you! 

365
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,333
The real Mako is a sweet
and caring person who...

366
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,750
You don't get it, do you...?

367
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,166
Wow, you really are stupid. 

368
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,625
When I decided to make
your wish come true...

369
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,375
I didn't do it
out of kindness.

370
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,875
The thing about me is:
my favorite food is

371
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,416
negative feelings
from other monsters...

372
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,208
When you came to me,
you were positively swirling

373
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,625
with selfish and
negative emotions.

374
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,791
Tsukune won't be able
to take his eyes off me!

375
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:00,833
Don't you see? 

376
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,500
That's why I
made you a woman...!

377
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,000
Even grown up like this, your
appearance may have changed,

378
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,750
but your situation hasn't!

379
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,250
I knew once you realized
that you couldn't have him;

380
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,958
your despair would
grow even deeper

381
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,791
and more delicious
than it already was!

382
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,708
It's what I've been
waiting for!

383
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,083
No, it can't be true... 

384
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,208
No way...! 

385
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,625
How can you be so... 

386
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,500
so evil? 

387
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,083
I really believed in you... 

388
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,625
I trusted you! 

389
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,708
And that is exactly why I was
so kind to you, Yukari...

390
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,125
That's right. 

391
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,833
I can taste all of your
unbearable feelings...

392
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,916
pain, despair,
betrayal, anger...

393
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,041
It's all there. 

394
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,708
Wow, you look so
delicious right now.

395
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,541
And from now on, you
belong completely to me!

396
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,208
Remember, Yukari, if you defeat
me, then you'll turn right back

397
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,166
to the way you used to be.

398
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,250
And don't worry,
after I'm finished,

399
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,916
you won't feel
negative emotions anymore!

400
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,208
Oh, no.

401
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,875
Yukari, no! 

402
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,833
You let her go, right now! 

403
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,041
Moka! 

404
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,125
Tsukune! 

405
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,958
I thought if my body
was grown up...

406
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,916
Then everything in my life
would suddenly be great...!

407
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,166
I thought it was just
my body that was small,

408
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,250
and that my heart and mind were
the same as everyone else's...

409
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,541
That's what I believed. 

410
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,791
That if my body
would just grow up...

411
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,750
Then I would be a real woman. 

412
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,500
But... 

413
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,125
The simple fact
that I believed it...

414
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,291
That's the surest proof
that I'm still a child.

415
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,333
I may be in high school
as far as classes go...

416
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,541
But inside... 

417
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,041
I'm a complete mess... 

418
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,375
Aren't I...? 

419
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,125
All I am is big headed... 

420
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,166
And selfish... 

421
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,083
And clueless about life... 

422
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,958
I'm nothing but a huge idiot. 

423
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,333
Who am I kidding? 

424
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,541
Tsukune's not
gonna notice me...

425
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,541
Not like this. 

426
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:20,333
Wow... 

427
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,541
Look. 

428
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,583
I'm, uh... 

429
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,458
Yukari? 

430
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,458
Are you all right? 

431
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,625
Can you get up? 

432
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:27,708
Yeah...

433
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,291
I'm fine now. 

434
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,291
That's right, because witches
have kick-ass healing powers,

435
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,375
huh?

436
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,958
Tsukune already went back
to finish up the measurements.

437
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,250
I finally understand.

438
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,541
Now I know what's
missing in my life.

439
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,125
Running into a
monster like that,

440
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,708
that's just terrible
luck, isn't it?

441
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:45,750
You're telling me... 

442
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,000
Preying on other
people's weaknesses!

443
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,333
Next up...!

444
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,666
Yukari Sendoooo! 

445
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,250
Ready when you are! 

446
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,208
You...

447
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,791
Yukari, you're... 

448
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:23,666
Hey, you know what? 

449
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,500
Aww, no! 

450
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,750
Oh man, I am so jealous! 

451
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,875
So what exactly's
going on, huh?

452
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,875
Come on, fess up,
you totally used magic

453
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,791
to make yourself grow... But
it was some half-baked spell,

454
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,916
and halfway through you
changed back, didn't you?

455
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,208
Better luck next time. 

456
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,250
I'm okay with who I am. 

457
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,875
Because it looks like
it's still gonna be a while

458
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,166
before I'm all grown
up on the inside.

459
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,625
Besides, compared to last
year, I've grown almost

460
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,333
half a centimeter,

461
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,125
Hey, what do you think
is wrong with Yukari?

462
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,625
Normally, she would've jumped
all over me for that one.

463
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,750
I think she's one step
closer to being a woman,

464
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,083
unlike you, of course.

465
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,125
Huh? 

466
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,625
What exactly are you
trying to imply?

467
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,583
All right, take it easy, guys!

468
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,666
Why the hell are you always
telling me to take it easy, huh?

469
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,166
I'm sorry; I was just
trying to help out.

470
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,291
That's sorta like the pot
calling the kettle black.

471
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,375
Like you have any room
to talk, going around...

472
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,083
I know Tsukune doesn't think
of me like that just yet.

473
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,875
But someday I want him
to notice me as a woman.

474
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,583
So I'm gonna work
on becoming that person...!

475
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,791
I'm gonna work on
my heart and my mind...

476
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,500
And on my womanhood... 

477
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,750
so... 

478
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,750
Please wait for me,
okay, Tsukune?

479
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,500
Wow, she seems different...

480
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,250
Like something inside
of her has changed.

481
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,666
Tsukune, guess what? 

482
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,375
Uh... 
Yukari, you...? 

483
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,166
Come here...

484
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,541
Why you?!

485
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,583
Yukari! 

486
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,291
That kiss was
supposed to be mine!

487
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,208
I've been waiting
this whole time, too!

488
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,416
That wasn't blood. 

489
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
You snooze, you lose, guys!

490
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,458
Being the occasional
lead is exhausting!

491
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,125
Next time I think
it's my turn.

492
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,166
Well, what the hell? 

493
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,416
When is it gonna be
my turn, huh?

494
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,833
And on that note, next time! 

495
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:48,916
Don't ignore me! 

496
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,500
"Curry and a Vampire,"
and a lot more!
