1
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,750
When the rosary seal
over her breast is removed...

2
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,875
Moka's innocent self vanishes...

3
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,750
and her inner vampire awakens!

4
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,833
Now that's my big sis!

5
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:39,916
The real deal, and not
that lame, wimpy version of her!

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,666
'Scuse me...

7
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,750
Miss Kokoa?

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,375
I apologize for
interrupting like this.

9
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,500
But with all due respect,
maybe this whole analyzing

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,541
film archives thing
isn't the best strategy

11
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:48,666
on how to get the real Moka--

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,208
Who asked you?!

13
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,250
Why didn't I see it before!

14
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:58,583
Ko-buddy, our new plan
is to steal that rosary!

15
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,208
Gotcha, whee!

16
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:05,708
Ohhh...! I'm gonna
get her back!

17
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,958
You won't if you stay here
drooling, so let's go, whee!

18
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,375
Listen up, Sis!

19
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,458
I'm gonna rip that
rosary from your chest

20
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,041
and toss that stupid
thing in the trash!

21
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,708
Hah!

22
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:17,875
Uh...

23
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,458
A ski trip...!
This should be fun!

24
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,041
I'll say!

25
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,375
Um, Tsukune?

26
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,166
Huh?

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,208
Well, once we get
to the resort, you and I

28
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,416
are gonna ski together,
aren't we?

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Of course...

30
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,250
Oh, Moka...

31
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,208
Oh, Tsukune...

32
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,125
Oh, Moka...

33
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,416
Oh, Tsukune...

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,541
Oh, Moka!

35
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,625
Oh, Tsukune!

36
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,750
What the hell is this?!

37
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,250
Whoa!

38
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,083
It's so pretty!

39
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,708
--This place is awesome!
--Wow!

40
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,125
So this is the ski lodge
where we're gonna be staying?

41
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,750
Yeah, it sure looks like it.

42
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,291
Hello, everyone...

43
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,083
We welcome you!

44
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,750
What, by freezing us?!

45
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,916
I've missed the feel of my
hometown's traditional welcome.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,333
"Hometown"?

47
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,500
Oh...

48
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,458
You mean this place
is where you're-...?

49
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,083
From?

50
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,125
Yes.

51
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,583
So welcome to
Snow Woman Village.

52
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,166
Hello again, Tsukune.

53
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,375
It's good to see
the rest of you as well.

54
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,916
There you are...

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,291
Hi...

56
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,708
Mrs. Shirayuki is the reason
that we came here...!

57
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,416
She was able to get us
an incredible deal...!

58
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,333
So all of you...

59
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,000
Say thanks!

60
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,458
Don't mention it...

61
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,416
I just want everyone here
to have an enjoyable time...

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,916
That'll be thanks
enough for me.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,375
And that you nab
Tsukune while you're here.

64
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,250
I'm way ahead of you, Mother.

65
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,666
We're on our home turf here,
so we've got to take advantage

66
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,500
of the situation.

67
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,416
Almost...

68
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,125
there...

69
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,625
Just a little further!

70
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,500
Mistress!
Over here, whee!

71
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,416
It looks like I might have
stumbled upon a shortcut, whee!

72
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,583
Great, Ko-buddy...! Nice job!

73
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,000
Hey!

74
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,500
Now listen up...

75
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,375
You're all free to ski wherever
you want on the course...

76
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:08,666
but no going off-course
under any circumstances, okay?

77
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,000
So, Rubi...

78
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,041
I guess you're working as
a ski instructor today?

79
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,041
Yup!

80
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,791
And it's a very
long story, right?

81
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,458
Um...

82
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,625
What is it?

83
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,875
My line...

84
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,833
I only get a few each
episode and you just-...

85
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,125
Uh...! Oh, Rubi, I'm so sorry!

86
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,708
Hey, why don't we just do it
over and take it from the top?

87
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,625
Okay then...! It's a long story,
but right now I'm filling in

88
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,625
where needed for
the school director.

89
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,000
These mountains sure are
pretty, aren't they?

90
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,791
Yeah.

91
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,250
Big, too...

92
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,750
One time on a junior high
ski trip, we'd yell at them

93
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,208
to hear our echoes.

94
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,250
Ya-ho...! Ya-ho...! Ya-ho!

95
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,291
Ya-hoo...! Ya-hoo...! Ya-hoo!

96
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,791
Wow, that's a really
long echo, isn't it?

97
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,583
Ya-hoo-hoo!

98
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,583
Tsukune, help me...!
I can't slow down at all!

99
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,833
I'm so sorry...! I'm
a total klutz on these skis...!

100
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,041
Please teach me...! I want
you to be my ski instructor,

101
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,541
Tsukune, 'kay...?!
Pretty please?!

102
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,416
Help, I can't stop!

103
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,166
Um...

104
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,666
Hey there, Tsukune...

105
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,000
Instead of Kurumu, will you
teach me how to ski instead?

106
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,166
I suck at it.

107
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,375
Really...? So you're
a genius at school,

108
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,250
but when it comes to skiing,
you're a total doofus, huh?

109
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,625
Well, you're one to talk!

110
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,833
You not only suck at school,
but on the slopes, too!

111
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,500
Quiet, you...!
Besides, I have an excuse;

112
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,375
my breasts are so big
that they get in the way.

113
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,541
Why don'tcha just take those
gi-normous sweater snowballs

114
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,083
of yours and ski on 'em?!

115
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,541
Hah!

116
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,083
You should do that yourself!

117
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,500
You'd slide a whole lot better
since there's nothing there!

118
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,041
See?

119
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,541
Whoa, you're right!

120
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,583
Um, I mean...

121
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,083
How dare you insult me
like that?!

122
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:00,875
So then...

123
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,041
Tsukune...

124
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,458
Who you gonna ski
down the slopes with?

125
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,875
With me, dummy!

126
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,500
No...! He's not...!
Tsukune's doing it with me!

127
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,375
Wrong.

128
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,166
Tsukune's going down with me.

129
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,333
She just took Tsukune!

130
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,916
Hey, you can't
steal him from us!

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,458
That's right,
you psycho stalker...!

132
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,750
And there's no way we're gonna
let you get away with this!

133
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,541
Well, if you think you
can catch me, then go ahead

134
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,875
and give it a try, girls!

135
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,291
Um...! Mizore...! Stop...!
This really hurts!

136
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,333
Yeah...

137
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,875
It really hurts
inside for me, too,

138
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,583
whenever I think
of you, Tsukune.

139
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,500
No, wait, that's not
what I meant!

140
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,958
Those are the ski runs...!
We finally made it, Ko!

141
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,291
Get your ass back here!

142
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,083
Bring Tsukune back now!

143
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,000
Everything went
as planned, Mother.

144
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,750
Great, and I've got all
the preparations in place.

145
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,833
As you can see.

146
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,458
Operation Sunrise
Snowcone can begin.

147
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,541
Wait a minute, Mizore...

148
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,041
It can't begin at all without
Tsukune, so where is he?

149
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:15,791
Oh...

150
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,416
He's inside here.

151
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,375
Tsukune!

152
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,791
I'm so glad I found you...!
Are you okay?

153
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,916
Sure am...

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,291
But it was
a really close one, though.

155
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,666
I finally found you!

156
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,833
Huh?

157
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,250
Yo!

158
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,333
Say goodbye to that
rosary on your chest,

159
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,958
Big Sister,
because I'm takin' it!

160
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,416
I take this... and
I get my sister back!

161
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,541
Ow-ow-ow...! Kokoa, please
...! That hurts...! Let it go!

162
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,125
What the...?! Why isn't
this thing coming off?!

163
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,625
Kokoa, stop pulling on that...

164
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,625
Can't you see how much
it's hurting Moka?

165
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,208
Spill it, you!

166
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,666
Just how do you get this
stupid thing off all the time?

167
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,750
Uh, what do you mean "how?"
It just sorta comes off.

168
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,333
Stop lying to me, wiseguy...!

169
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,875
a pathetic wimp like
you can pull it off

170
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,500
but a vampire can't...?! You
really think I'm stupid enough

171
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,166
to fall for something
like that?!

172
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,041
No, but like I was saying-...

173
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,708
don't you dare give
me any more crap...!

174
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,375
You better tell me right
now, mister, or else...!

175
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,375
Don't mess with me...!
Hey, do you even know

176
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,666
who you're dealing
with here...?

177
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,875
I'm the real Moka Akashiya's
younger sister...!

178
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,875
The name's Kokoa Shuzen,
idiot...! get on your knees...!

179
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,375
kneel before Kokoa...!
kneel before Kokoa...

180
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,166
kneel before Kokoa...

181
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,208
kneel before Kokoa...

182
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,291
kneel before Kokoa...

183
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,625
It's an avalanche!

184
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,791
Tsukune...! Where are
you...! Can you hear me...?

185
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,041
I've just gotta find you, and
if you're freezing right now,

186
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,458
don't worry; I'll warm you up
tonight in ways that only

187
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,333
a snow woman can!

188
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,833
Kokoa...?! Tsukune?!

189
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,250
Oh, no...! Not down there!

190
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,083
Let them be alright!

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,333
Kokoa...! Tsukune!

192
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,375
Relaxing in a hot spring
in the falling snow...

193
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,458
Isn't it the most
romantic thing?

194
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,250
You sound...

195
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,125
just like a little kid!

196
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,958
And you sound
just like an old lady.

197
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,333
I love celebrating the end
of a long day with a cold beer!

198
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,291
I wouldn't know because I'm
under the legal drinking age,

199
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,416
so I'm gonna
celebrate with juice.

200
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,958
That stalker skank may
have gotten the jump on us

201
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,833
back there and made
off with Tsukune...

202
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,291
But you and me are gonna kick
the ice cubes out of her!

203
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:28,541
So who's this stalker
skank you just mentioned?

204
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,291
Tell me, how's the
water feeling tonight?

205
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,958
Well, to be honest with
you, Mrs. Shirayuki,

206
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,916
it was perfect until
a few seconds ago.

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,458
Yeah, now it's really cold.

208
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,041
Oh...

209
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:48,833
Hey...!

210
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,125
what're you looking at?!

211
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,041
Stop, you're embarrassing me!

212
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,000
Mother...! There's
a big problem!

213
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,125
Oh, Mizore...

214
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,958
You came at the perfect time.

215
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,708
You win head and shoulders
over these girls when

216
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,333
it comes to delicate,
porcelain-like skin.

217
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,541
We don't have time
for that nonsense right now!

218
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,416
Quick, we need
everybody's help!

219
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,291
But why, Moka?

220
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,083
Because of Tsukune and Kokoa!

221
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,583
They got caught in an
avalanche and fell to

222
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,333
the bottom of a ravine!

223
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,500
Then let's go and get
'em out of there!

224
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,250
But not naked, okay?!

225
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:18,750
Take...

226
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,125
that!

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,166
Well, that's enough for today.

228
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,625
Wait, come back...!
I can still keep fighting!

229
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,875
Let's do this, Sis!
Don't leave!

230
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,583
You shouldn't fight again
until that bruise is healed.

231
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,458
See you later...

232
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,083
'Kay, Kokoa?

233
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,458
But Sis...

234
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,958
I promise I'm gonna get way,
way stronger than this!

235
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,583
So just wait until I do, okay?

236
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,166
Just wait Sis...

237
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,166
Um, Kokoa?

238
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,791
You're awake...! I was
starting to get worried!

239
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,333
Where the hell are we?!

240
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,208
In a cave...

241
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,875
At the bottom of a ravine.

242
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,791
Oh, dammit, this is just
great...! It would happen

243
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,916
right when I almost got
her back! where is she?!

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,416
You can't go out there!

245
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,583
When I finally
came to in here...

246
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,750
It was already
snowing like crazy.

247
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,541
Well, who cares?!

248
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,125
It's only snow!

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,166
Kokoa!

250
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,916
I've gotta get that rosary so
I can get my sister back...!

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,458
I've just gotta!

252
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,375
This storm's too strong; we've
gotta get back to the cave!

253
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,083
What was that?!

254
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:43,791
Crap...

255
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,791
It sounded...

256
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,250
Like a monster...

257
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,416
C'mon, Kokoa...

258
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,125
We need to get back.

259
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,541
Hey, why's your hand on me?!

260
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,291
To protect you!

261
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,833
Uh...! Oh... well Okay.

262
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,625
Now nobody do anything
without at least

263
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,458
one other person there,
and don't go near

264
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,208
any dangerous spots
on your own, okay?

265
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,000
Right!

266
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,083
Search and Rescue Team...

267
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,041
Let's do it!

268
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,458
Go!

269
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,750
You guys just
stay here and wait.

270
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,416
And don't you worry;
once we find Tsukune,

271
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,166
we'll be sure to give him the
special hands-on attention

272
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,416
that only we can provide.

273
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,583
Uh-oh...

274
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,666
I better hurry up
and find him first then!

275
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,375
Hey, don't touch me...!
Go find someplace else to sit!

276
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,541
Oh, I'm sorry...

277
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,583
It's just kind of tight
in here, you know?

278
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,916
Geez!

279
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,041
Um, excuse me, Kokoa...

280
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,333
Yeah, what?

281
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,458
I've been wondering...

282
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,541
Why do you hate me?

283
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,708
Huh?

284
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,166
Honestly...

285
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,416
I was hoping that you and
I would have become friends

286
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,333
by now but that
hasn't happened.

287
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,916
What, are you crazy
or something...?

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,541
Become friends with you?
I don't think so!

289
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,166
But why not?

290
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,625
You mean you
really don't know why?

291
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,833
Huh?

292
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,000
Because Moka always
gives you everything!

293
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:18,708
Everything?

294
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:19,791
What do you mean?

295
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,291
You, a human,
can take her rosary off,

296
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,833
but I can't even
make it budge.

297
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,583
I also heard that my
sister gave you some

298
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,375
of her vampire blood once.

299
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,916
Is that story really true?

300
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,750
Yeah...

301
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,416
But she had a good reason...

302
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
It's because...

303
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,625
I would have died...

304
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,541
see?

305
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,958
But why?

306
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,125
Hm?

307
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,208
I said "why?!"...

308
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,333
Why is it always you,
but never me?!

309
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,500
Kokoa?

310
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,208
Somehow you get to
take off her rosary...!

311
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,041
And she winds up
giving you her blood!

312
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,500
It's always you and never me!

313
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,000
Uh...

314
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,666
So why is it...?
How come I'm not good enough

315
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,208
for her but you are?

316
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,916
Kokoa, it'll be okay...

317
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,750
Don't you dare touch me!

318
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,458
You think if
you're nice to me...

319
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,000
I'll be just like
the others...

320
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,791
That I'll fawn all over you like
the rest of your dumb harem!

321
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,333
Well, I'm sorry to tell you...

322
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,375
That it's never...

323
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,875
ever gonna happen!

324
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,375
There's no way in hell I'd
ever fall for a jerk like you!

325
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,166
Kokoa...

326
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,583
That's not what I'm after.

327
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,833
Someday soon...

328
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,041
I'm gonna be
together with her again...

329
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:26,500
And...

330
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,916
go home...

331
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,708
we'll go back to the house...

332
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,500
where we used to live...

333
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,416
Kokoa?!

334
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,333
So...

335
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,750
cold.

336
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,375
I've gotta get you warmed up.

337
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,000
Hold on, Kokoa.

338
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,166
Oh, no...! Miss Kokoa...

339
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,375
where are you...?!
Can you hear me, whee?!

340
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,041
Uh-oh...! That sounds scary...!
I hope it's not headed

341
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,041
in Miss Kokoa's
direction, whee!

342
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,833
Oh, crap, whee!

343
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,500
It's getting closer!

344
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,083
An Abominable Snowman?!

345
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,083
Grargh rargh...

346
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,250
Rargh rargh rargh.

347
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,541
Get away!

348
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,625
I won't let you hurt her,
you big furry freak!

349
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,333
Are you alright, Tsukune?!

350
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,500
Mizore!

351
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,416
I'll take care of him;
get out of there!

352
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,791
But-...!

353
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,375
Trust me, just go...!
I couldn't live with myself

354
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,583
if I let something happen
to you in my hometown!

355
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,083
And besides...

356
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,791
You've got someone in there
who needs help, don't you?!

357
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:06,541
Yeah...

358
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,416
I guess you're right.

359
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,625
Thanks!

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,583
Don't you lay
a finger on my Tsukune!

361
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,583
Holy crap...

362
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,166
He strong!

363
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,875
I hope we lost him!

364
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,250
Tsukune!

365
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,375
Moka, it's you!

366
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,125
Oh, Tsukune!

367
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,916
Oh, Moka!

368
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,625
Oh, Tsukune!

369
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,541
Moka!

370
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,250
Tsukune!

371
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,708
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Tsukune.

372
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,125
Grargh...! Grargh rargh
rargh rargh rargh!

373
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,916
You need to learn
your place!

374
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,208
This episode's
showdown took-...

375
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,125
Ah, who cares!

376
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,000
Miss Kokoa, whee!

377
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,208
Tsukune's alive!

378
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,541
Sorry it took
so long to get here!

379
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,500
Is everybody okay?!

380
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,541
We will be...

381
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,708
As soon as we
get Kokoa warmed up.

382
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,625
Moka's rosary...!
It's ... mine!

383
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,500
Kokoa, wait!

384
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,750
I'm taking it...

385
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:33,708
so I can...

386
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,000
keep...

387
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,666
big sis.

388
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,041
Hold on, 'kay...?
We'll get you to the lodge.

389
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,375
Look, I'm sorry
to tell you this, Kokoa...

390
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,708
But this rosary of mine...

391
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,208
I can't just leave it off
and be without the seal.

392
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,250
But why...

393
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,166
Why not?

394
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,458
See you later...

395
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,375
'Kay, Kokoa?

396
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,291
Moka, no...

397
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,541
Um, Moka, are you alright?

398
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,041
Somebody grab her!

399
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm sure you did
your best, Mizore.

400
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,166
Uh, Mother...

401
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,458
Yeah, I did.

402
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,458
Even so, I guess it
wasn't enough against

403
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,916
such a formidable
opponent as this one...

404
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,125
Was it?

405
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,583
Guess not...

406
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,458
But eventually, I am gonna
beat her one of these days.

407
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,333
Forget that stuff...!
What was that snow beast?!

408
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,166
Yeah, with dangerous
things like that around...

409
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,750
How could you
let us go skiing?!

410
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,125
Dangerous...? I can assure you
there are no dangerous beasts

411
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:27,875
in this valley.

412
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:28,416
Huh?!

413
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,250
Grargh rargh!

414
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,375
Rargh rargh rargh
rargh rargh rargh!

415
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,125
Tsukune, you stay back!

416
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,625
We'll take care
of this monster!

417
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,875
We'll make a rug
out of his hide!

418
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,666
Wait, now that I get a better
look at him, he looks familiar.

419
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,291
Hey, that yeti is my father.

420
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,166
Huh?!

421
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,666
What...?! You mean that thing...

422
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,208
is your daddy?!

423
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,208
Well, if that information
disturbs you so much, Tsukune...

424
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,083
How about this?

425
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:53,958
Thanks...

426
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,833
but that's okay Mrs. Shirayuki!

427
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,583
So that yeti...
and her mom...

428
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,291
They did it?!

429
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,958
Yeah, I guess they did!

430
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,166
Uh-huh!

431
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,375
Grargh...! Rargh...!
Rargh rargh...! Mrargh!

432
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,125
Oh, is that so...? He says
that he found some lost skiers,

433
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,791
but when he tried to help,
one of them called him

434
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,666
a big furry freak and ran.

435
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,000
What...?! Crap...

436
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,291
Oh...

437
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,250
I'm sorry, sir...!
I'm just not fluent in Yeti!

438
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,583
Grargh rargh, mrargh
rargh rargh rargh rargh.

439
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,000
Don't worry, Tsukune...

440
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,958
My father says that he
won't hold that against you...

441
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,833
And besides, in the middle
of that blizzard...

442
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,416
his very own daughter
didn't even recognize him

443
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,625
at first glance.

444
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,875
Oh, Mizore...

445
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,625
You're such a goofball,
dear...! You might have

446
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,541
grown up, but you're still
our silly little girl!

447
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,625
Mother, you're
embarrassing me!

448
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,875
Thank you so much
for having us!

449
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,458
And we're sorry, Mr. Shirayeti,

450
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,041
I mean, Shirayuki!

451
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,041
Bye, everyone!

452
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,791
Come back again
sometime, okay?

453
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,208
But next time it'll be
for an engagement party!

454
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,875
Brye-brye!

455
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,708
Darling, don't you think
it's about time you took

456
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,541
that ridiculous suit off?

457
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,666
So, That Tsukune Aono boy...

458
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,000
Tell me...

459
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,125
Don't you think he'd make
a terrific son-in-law

460
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,833
for both you and I, sweetie?

461
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,250
You know, I still can't
get over the fact that

462
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,166
Kokoa ran off this morning...

463
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,291
With that fever...

464
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,458
I'm really hoping
that she's okay.

465
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,083
Somehow I get the
feeling she's just fine.

466
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,250
Huh?

467
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,166
I wonder if Kokoa and
I will ever be good friends

468
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,958
like normal sisters should be?

469
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,416
I hope so...

470
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,875
I hope that Kokoa
and I can become closer...!

471
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,416
Kokoa?!

472
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,750
No way, come on, forget that
bitey little brat, Tsukune...!

473
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,083
Pick me...! 'Kay?!

474
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,625
Nuh-uh...! I'm the love
of his life, so back off!

475
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,958
There's only one person on this
bus that he's in love with...

476
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,291
And that person is me...! Plus
he's already been to meet

477
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,791
my parents and everything!

478
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,208
I'm the love of his life...!
Not the three of you...!

479
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,666
I love, love, Tsukune
so much...! You'll see!

480
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,208
I've had about as much
love as I can take!

481
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,166
Kurumu, come look!

482
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,583
Some totally hot pretty boy
just transferred to our school

483
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,750
Yeah, who cares!

484
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,333
We've already got
a pretty boy: Tsukune!

485
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,666
But this guy's weird!

486
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,333
We still need to make him
feel welcome, though...

487
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:51,458
Next time: "Pretty Boy and
a Vampire" and another!
