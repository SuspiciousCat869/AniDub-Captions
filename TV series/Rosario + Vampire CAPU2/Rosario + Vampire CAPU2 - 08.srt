1
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,833
Hello there, my name
is Rubi Tojo...

2
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,458
It's a long story, but
the people at Yokai Academy

3
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,500
have let me stay here.

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,416
You wanna hear
the long story, huh?

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,666
Well...

6
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,000
It's such a very long story...

7
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,958
So much stuff has happened,
I couldn't possibly

8
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,125
tell everything.

9
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,375
Hey, Rubi...

10
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,916
Morning!

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,833
Tsukune...?

12
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,416
Morning to you.

13
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, Tsukune...

14
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,166
Will it ever happen for us?

15
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,083
Will you ever gaze
deeply in my eyes?

16
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,875
Morning, Tsukune!

17
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, hey there, Moka...!

18
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,125
Good morning to you!

19
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,458
Tsukune...!

20
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,708
Good Morning!

21
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,708
Whoa...!

22
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,416
Wh-wh-wh-what are
you doing, Kurumu?!

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,375
Hey, Tsukune!

24
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,625
Good morning, Yukari.

25
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,416
Tsu... ku... ne.

26
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,833
I feel dizzy.

27
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,041
Oh, Mizore!

28
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,333
What's the matter?

29
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,458
That's enough, you guys!

30
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,291
Hey...

31
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,458
Good morning, Rubi.

32
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,500
Good morning.

33
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,500
Hello there.

34
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,375
Hi, Rubi...

35
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,666
A very good morning to you.

36
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,041
Oh, uh, hey, Yukari!

37
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,666
Good morning to you!

38
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,791
Now, listen up, everybody...

39
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,291
I've been thinking
about this for a while...

40
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,000
And today I'm gonna
give it to you straight...

41
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,500
You...!

42
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,500
Your skirts are
all way too short!

43
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,916
You think so?

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,958
I mean, this is how all
the girls are wearing them...

45
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,416
Right?

46
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
No, Don't pull them up!

47
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,375
You're all such pretty
young high school girls...

48
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,125
Why do you dress like tramps...?

49
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,375
Oh, right...

50
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,500
You're doing it
because you're trying

51
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,250
to seduce my Tsukune, huh?

52
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,291
That's rude...!

53
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,041
We're not trying to seduce him!

54
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,416
Rubi, you...

55
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,833
You love the way I dress...!

56
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,000
Come on...!

57
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,333
Our skirts aren't
that short, are they?

58
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,416
They're too long...

59
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,333
Right?

60
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,750
It's just like I said...!

61
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,291
Knock it off, you two...!

62
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,958
You're such a disgrace!

63
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,333
A 'disgrace?'...

64
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,041
Hey, hold on, aren't you
trying to do the same thing?

65
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,541
Yeah... Right.

66
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,083
Elegant, elegant, elegant...

67
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,416
Hey, guys...

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,000
Not to be a bitch,
but long skirts are lame, right?

69
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,708
Yea they are!

70
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,208
That's it!

71
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,208
Well...

72
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,583
I believe
I've heard enough...!

73
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,833
As of this moment,
I'm the dress code monitor,

74
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,583
and I'm going to check your
outfits every single day...!

75
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,458
Your skirts now have to be
ten centimeters below the knees!

76
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,333
No way!

77
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,875
This is nuts!

78
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,375
So, as we see here...

79
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,583
The majority of the time,
haikus contain what's called

80
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,958
a 'season' line.

81
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,416
Or a phrase that holds
a sense of the natural seas-

82
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,250
Stand up!

83
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,625
Bow!

84
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,083
Hi there, my name's
Shizuya Nekonome...

85
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:30,250
You may have heard of me,
I teach here at Yokai Academy.

86
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,583
Hey, guys, did you
hear the news?

87
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,000
Wait, what news?

88
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,541
It's about Rubi...

89
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,375
Apparently, tomorrow, she's
gonna start checking the length

90
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,000
of everybody's skirt
at the front gate.

91
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,416
I mean, can you believe that?

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,208
No way...!

93
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:41,958
That's nuts!

94
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,541
It's so stupid!

95
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,958
It's something about how short
skirts are for hussies and...

96
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,333
Short Skirts? But...

97
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,166
You know what?

98
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,375
I've always thought this...

99
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,750
But Rubi is seriously
too uptight, I mean,

100
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,375
it's like she's old
fashioned or something.

101
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,083
I'm screwed...

102
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't even own
a skirt longer than this.

103
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,666
Well, tell me what
you think about this one...?

104
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,208
Meow.

105
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,125
Maybe it's
a little too risqué.

106
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,208
Oh...

107
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,250
I just don't know.

108
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:33,625
Ne...

109
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,125
Ko...

110
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:34,833
No...

111
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:35,750
Me...

112
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,250
What's...

113
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,500
this?

114
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,000
Meow.

115
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,375
What in the world do you
think you're doing, huh...?

116
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,541
A teacher is supposed
to set an example...

117
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,333
Not dress like some trollop.

118
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:51,166
Oh, uh, nothing, it's just
that I was uh, well, I uh...

119
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,833
This simply will not cut it...

120
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,875
What will your students think
when they see their own teacher

121
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,625
dressed up like
a two-bit hooker?

122
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,916
Come on, that hurts!

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,041
Oww, please don't pull on them!

124
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,958
That'll be one thousand, seven
hundred and fifty three yen!

125
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,250
I'm so ashamed, meow.

126
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,416
Yokaiiiiii!

127
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,791
Fight ho!

128
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,541
It's been a while since
we've seen him, hasn't it?

129
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,875
Seen who?

130
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,458
What do you mean, who are
you talking about, huh?

131
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,625
Gin!

132
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,291
Hey, my name's Ginei Morioka...

133
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,416
I'm president of the Yokai
Academy Newspaper Club.

134
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,833
I used to run around
campus day and night...

135
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,250
Chasin' down any
scoop I could find.

136
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,291
I refused to be silenced by
that damned Security Committee.

137
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,208
Whoa, there.

138
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,208
Keep those...

139
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,583
Yep.

140
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,416
There were times
I felt like givin' up...

141
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,583
But then...

142
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,916
These guys gave me
my pride back.

143
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,958
Tsukune!

144
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,166
But how come this guy
gets all the chicks?

145
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,833
What's he got
that I don't...?

146
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,750
What makes him
so damn special?!

147
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:25,708
Hey, guys!

148
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,458
Good morning everyone!

149
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,958
Tsukune!

150
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,208
Good morning.

151
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,250
Umm, Ginei?

152
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,625
Sorry to tell ya, but you've
got some major bed head today.

153
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,500
What a complete tool!

154
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,500
If we take the three sides of a
right triangle and call them...

155
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,000
Hello, my name
is Ririko Kagome...

156
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,416
I'm on the faculty here
at Yokai Academy,

157
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,208
where I teach mathematics...

158
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,666
Tsukune...

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,750
That little tramp!

160
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,000
All right then, people,
that's all for now...

161
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,125
And everybody better
do their homework...

162
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:13,750
Or...

163
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:14,125
You...

164
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:14,750
Know...

165
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,291
What.

166
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,666
Moka!

167
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,916
Moka!

168
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,916
Aww, look who's here.

169
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:36,958
Tsukune...

170
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,208
I'm sorry...

171
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,916
I couldn't.

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You see, I didn't wanna get
kicked around like last time,

173
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,166
so I took a few precautions.

174
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,208
This can't be!

175
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,625
Well...

176
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,750
I do hope you're fully prepared
for our study session.

177
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,333
That's far enough!

178
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,625
I don't care that you teach...

179
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,875
Forcing kids
to study is just evil!

180
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,791
Who are you?!

181
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,333
Well, I think it's time for...

182
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,250
My...!

183
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,250
Deadly catnip fist!

184
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,125
You must save her,
Mister Aono!

185
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:34,833
Wait!

186
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:35,750
How do you know my name?

187
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,291
Who cares?

188
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,166
Hurry!

189
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,708
Yeah, right, okay!

190
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,291
Uh, could you
be gentler, please?

191
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,583
'Cause this really doesn't
feel good at all, Tsukune!

192
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,958
Yeah, of course, I'm really
sorry about that, Moka!

193
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,041
Whee!

194
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,541
Uh...! Um, no!

195
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,958
Please stop looking
at them, meow!

196
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,125
"Meow?"

197
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:06,666
No...

198
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,916
It isn't me...

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,375
Really, I'm not Miss Nekonome,
I swear I'm not!

200
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,291
You, Mister Student, get that
girl home safe and sound...!

201
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,916
And you, Miss Snake Lady,
stop picking on students...

202
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,333
With that, it looks like
my work here is done...

203
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,541
Farewell, meow!

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,916
Tsukune...!

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,833
Let me suck...!

206
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,875
Hey, there lover...

207
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:34,791
I brought some candy...

208
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,291
Chop!

209
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,500
Chop!

210
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,541
Tsukune, look...!

211
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,791
I made some
delicious lunch for us!

212
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,375
You're just so doggone cute!

213
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,416
Kurumu, stop!

214
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,541
Watch where
you're touching, okay?

215
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,333
Sweet buns from
Ikaho are yummy!

216
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,208
Gold leaf sponge cakes
from Aizu rock...!

217
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,041
I just love Maezawa beef...!

218
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,875
Tsugaru apples are juicy!

219
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,250
Miss Kokoa, we're already
way past Tokyo, whee!

220
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,750
Wait, they left this morning?

221
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,958
As you can see, last time
we were seriously late

222
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,916
getting to Tsukune's-

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,583
You keep making
snide comments like that,

224
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,250
and I'm gonna hafta punish you!

225
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,291
But you just did, whee!

226
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,291
Yokaaaaiiiii...!

227
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:18,625
Fight...!

228
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,083
Ho!

229
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:19,875
Fight-ho!

230
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:20,833
Fight-ho!

231
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:21,625
Fight-ho!

232
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,375
Fight-ho!

233
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:24,916
Whoa...

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,666
Whoa...!

235
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,541
Whee!

236
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,500
Ow, ow, ow, oww!

237
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,791
What's your problem,
you jerks...?!

238
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,625
Can't even stop
to say I'm sorry...?!

239
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,208
Ko-buddy, hammer time...!

240
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,666
What the...?

241
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,541
What's the deal, Ko-buddy...?

242
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,541
Where are you?

243
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,083
Ko...

244
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,750
If you don't come out right now,
then you'll be in deep shit!

245
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,708
Uh...

246
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,916
Miss Kokoa...?

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,958
I'm right here...

248
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,666
That voice is coming
from down below.

249
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:53,958
Whew!

250
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,000
Now it's all
bright again, whee!

251
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,958
But, Miss Kokoa,
where are you now?

252
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:58,916
Whee!

253
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,916
Shut up.

254
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,958
Eh...?

255
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,333
Miss Kokoa...?

256
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,958
What the hell
is going on, whee?!

257
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,000
Just stop talking...

258
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:05,833
It's itching me!

259
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,875
But, Miss Kokoa?!

260
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,208
God, that itches!

261
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,000
You taste really fruity today.

262
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,125
He tastes like milk.

263
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,041
Tastes kinda sour.

264
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,625
Spicy!

265
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,875
It's way too sweet!

266
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,875
I can't hold out much longer.

267
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:48,875
Go!

268
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,333
Yeah...

269
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,958
Good morning, Tsukune.

270
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:58,625
Hey!

271
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,625
Good morning, Moka!

272
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,833
So umm...

273
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,666
Would it be all right if I...

274
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,083
Uh...

275
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,750
Oh, never mind,
I'm not thirsty.

276
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,041
Well, I'd better go...

277
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,875
If I were you,
Tsukune, I'd go too...

278
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,833
You don't wanna be late!

279
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,375
But, Moka, you...

280
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,458
Yuck...!

281
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,166
Tsukune totally
stinks like b.o.

282
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,541
today!

283
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,333
If you smell like b.o.
then none of the girls

284
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,541
will like you...

285
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,458
So be sure to
check those arm pits...

286
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,625
This is me saying
pretty please.

287
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,333
Hello there,
my name is Rubi Tojo...

288
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,291
I'm the dress code monitor
here at Yokai Academy.

289
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,416
Stop right there, you three.

290
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,666
Your skirts are
entirely too short.

291
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,250
Oh...

292
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,500
Come on!

293
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,416
It's super hot out here,
we'll sweat to death!

294
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,541
Besides, we'll
look real geeky!

295
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,791
Nobody messes with this witch!

296
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,375
Take this!

297
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,458
I'm Tonko Oniyama.

298
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,416
I'm Shijimi Chono.

299
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,375
And I'm Sumae Mizuno.

300
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,041
We're just glad we
got to say our names

301
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,583
before the last episode.

302
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,833
That's enough...

303
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,125
This girl's gettin' in
the way of my "scoops."

304
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,541
You said it was important,
what exactly do you want?

305
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,750
Rubi, look...

306
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,750
You've gotta lay off
this dress code thing.

307
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,500
Dress code thing...?

308
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,500
Ah...!

309
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,583
All those lost photo
opportunities spell trouble

310
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,708
for your collection, eh?

311
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,250
I guess I nailed that one.

312
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:52,875
N-no...

313
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,125
That's not it...!

314
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,708
It just doesn't make
any damn sense!

315
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,458
I'm thinkin' of you here, Rubi.

316
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,375
Thank you, I appreciate
your concern...

317
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,958
But, Ginei...

318
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,250
Do you think you could look the
other way a little bit longer?

319
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,541
If you do that for me,
I might feel inclined to do

320
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,083
a little private
photo session for you.

321
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,375
It'll be just the two of us.

322
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,166
I see where you're
comin' from...

323
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,708
I'll stay outta
your way for a bit.

324
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,458
Thanks a lot, Gin.

325
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:25,125
I think maybe I'll
buy me a new camera.

326
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,958
He fell for that one,
hook, line and sinker!

327
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,791
Now, all that's left is...

328
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,166
Well, isn't that the truth?!

329
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,333
I require full cooperation
from the teachers, too!

330
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,041
Hey, Rubi, morning!

331
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,916
And a very good morning
to you, Tsukune!

332
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,333
Oh brother!

333
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,333
I hate how this thing
gets caught up in my legs...!

334
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,416
It's too long!

335
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,833
You wanna borrow my cape?

336
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,041
Oh, I have one, too,
if you need it!

337
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,500
This thing is so heavy.

338
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,541
Hey, guys, what's up?!

339
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,791
Hi there, Tsukune!

340
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,916
Good morning!

341
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,333
Good morning, Tsukune...!

342
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,500
You, too, Rubi!

343
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,166
Hi...

344
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,125
Good morning.

345
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,375
Good morning, you guys...!

346
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,833
Tsukune and Rubi!

347
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,500
Good morning, Tsukune.

348
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,666
Yes!

349
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,000
This is more like it...

350
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,833
Just some high school kids
saying good morning...

351
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,083
Boys and girls saying hello...

352
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes...

353
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,625
This is it!

354
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,750
It's the brilliant
flower of youth!

355
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,125
And then it happened.

356
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,375
'Sup?

357
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,416
That's about enough of that...!

358
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,166
Right here
in front of Tsukune!

359
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,041
Meow!

360
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,833
Wow, that was a strong breeze.

361
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah...

362
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,583
That breeze sure was
naugh... ty, right.

363
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,166
You there!

364
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,375
Teachers!

365
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,708
Why are you wearing
school girl uniforms?!

366
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,875
Well!

367
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,333
This was the only
long skirt I had, meow!

368
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,916
Yeah, same here.

369
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,666
I won't allow it!

370
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,041
I won't allow it...!

371
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,708
As dress code monitor,
I can't allow those outfits!

372
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,166
Whoa...!

373
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:06,875
Rubi.

374
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:07,583
Wow!

375
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,791
Look at those!

376
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,250
Now, that's something.

377
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,625
Well, whaddaya know.

378
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,125
A shocker.

379
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,416
Did you guys see?

380
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,583
I can't believe someone
with that underwear...

381
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,000
Goes around lecturing
people about morals!

382
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,416
So scandalous.

383
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,541
This hurts your credibility.

384
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,666
Yep, sure does.

385
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,375
But...

386
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,416
You...

387
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,791
All of you...

388
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,625
All you guys ever do
is flirt with Tsukune

389
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,875
and hang all over him!

390
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,166
When is it my turn, huh?!

391
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,083
I see...

392
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,458
So it's about that.

393
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,041
Even though you're
not a classmate, Rubi,

394
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,833
that doesn't mean
you're not our friend...

395
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,791
You should feel free to talk
to us about anything.

396
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,750
Oh, thank you, Tsukune...

397
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,208
This does mean you want
the two of us to get hitched...

398
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,916
Right?

399
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,666
Well, my answer is yes!

400
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,833
No, I uh...
Um, that's not what I...

401
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:00,875
Hey!

402
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:01,583
What are you trying
to pull, huh?!

403
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,833
Rubi, no!

404
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,375
Crazy bitch...

405
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,083
At least that's
the end of that.

406
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,625
Still, I feel like
we're forgetting something.

407
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,333
Oh, just leave that one to me.

408
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,750
Ginei, what are you...?

409
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,416
Tsukune, wait...!

410
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,250
Woohoo!

411
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,458
She is smokin' hot!

412
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,625
Moron...!

413
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,083
You think you can
call me for this...?!

414
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,250
You stupid asshole!

415
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:41,333
Like I said, this dress code
makes no sense.

416
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,166
Big Sis!

417
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,208
It's you!

418
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,500
That was the showdown...

419
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,666
It took thi-...

420
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,041
Hey...! Everything went
black again, whee!

421
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,916
Today was the same,
I didn't see anything unusual.

422
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,666
You're doing an
incredible job...

423
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,833
thank you.

424
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,000
I see it as my duty
to watch over this.

425
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,583
We need the great barrier...

426
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:40,333
It is the key to the whole
existence of Yokai Academy.

427
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,750
If something were to happen
that would result in a breach

428
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,583
of the great barrier,
then the human world...

429
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,625
It would be inundated with
a flood of monster energy...

430
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,458
Without a barrier between
the human world and

431
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,375
the monster world, our entire
existence would be plunged

432
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,166
into endless chaos.

433
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,458
And then things would be
just like before...

434
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,875
Monsters and humans
at each other's throats...!

435
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:03,666
An endless cycle of violence,
death and destruction.

436
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,125
Managing the barrier is of
the utmost importance...

437
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,458
And you've done excellent work.

438
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,000
Your praise does me great honor.

439
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,625
Even though we've done it to
hide your true purpose here,

440
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,041
I still feel bad about
making you take odd jobs

441
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:20,916
around campus. I'm sure it's
a source of constant difficulty.

442
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,041
Not at all...

443
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,583
You've kept me safe, sir...

444
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,166
And now, thanks to you,
I even have a new talisman,

445
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,416
Mister Director.

446
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,041
I owe you nothing but
my sincerest gratitude.

447
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:34,041
I continue to rely
on you, Rubi.

448
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,041
Thank you...

449
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,916
I'll do whatever you ask of me.

450
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,708
Mizore, here...

451
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,333
Next time, Tsukune and I
are getting married...

452
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:42,041
Got it?

453
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,083
No one better miss it.

454
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,458
Mizore, what are
you talking about?!

455
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,416
Watch it and find out.

456
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,458
Yeah, what I mean is...

457
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,708
Next time...

458
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,416
"Skiing and a Vampire,"
Tsukune and I will...

459
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,416
She meant to say
"and another ..."
