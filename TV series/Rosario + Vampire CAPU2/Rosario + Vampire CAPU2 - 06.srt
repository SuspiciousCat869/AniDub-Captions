1
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,125
Is everyone here?

2
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:40,041
The Wraith of Sanuki, Deputy
Minister of Monster Industries--

3
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,416
Present.

4
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:47,333
The Sea Monk of Awa, and Captain
of Special Forces is here.

5
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,166
The Ghost Brat of Iyo,
and Captain of the Guard

6
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,250
is present as well!

7
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,083
Now, thanks to the three of you,
we have finally managed to

8
00:00:56,166 --> 00:01:01,000
conquer all of Shikoku... I,
the Goblin of Tosa, am grateful!

9
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,541
So, starting tomorrow,
we begin our long awaited push

10
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,250
into Kansai, right?

11
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,791
Oh, yes!

12
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,916
That whole area must be crawling
with crazy, scary monsters,

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,291
wouldn't you agree?

14
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,875
With the combined power
of us four fighting together,

15
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,750
nuthin's gonna stop us!

16
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,041
It's been a while,
but shall we?

17
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,208
All hail, Monster Industries!

18
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,166
Fight!

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,291
Fight!

20
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,375
Fight!

21
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,875
All right, folks!

22
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,958
First, look on your left, where
you can see the Nijo castle...

23
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,666
And next, please look
over here at the right hand.

24
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,166
On my right hand, that is.

25
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,500
Whoa, that's one gorgeous hand!

26
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,291
Oh!

27
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,791
Well, thank you very much.

28
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,333
What is Rubi doing here?

29
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,000
Wait a sec, when did you
become a tour bus guide?

30
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:36,875
Well it's...

31
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,583
such a long story.

32
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,000
Not again.

33
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,291
It's true...

34
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,166
And this one is the
longest story of them all.

35
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,000
Hey, jack ass, where do you
get off making our Rubi cry?!

36
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,250
She won't be the only one crying
when we're done with you!

37
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,458
Now that we're on this trip
together, Tsukune and I can...!

38
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,666
All right everyone!

39
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,708
Please quiet down
inside the bus!

40
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,458
If you think you can get away
from me, just by running off

41
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,375
into the human world, you've
got another thing coming!

42
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,916
All right...!

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,750
Now that we've arrived,
it's time for us to break up

44
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,625
and start our
group activities...

45
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,875
I want to remind all of you,
that revealing your monster

46
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,541
identity is strictly forbidden,
even on a school trip,

47
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,500
and that rule applies till
we get back to the academy.

48
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,500
Yeah, but Miss, your tail?

49
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:25,541
Meow.

50
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,708
Last time it was
that snow bitch...!

51
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,291
Then before that Yukari...!

52
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,875
It won't be long now before
it's my turn to play a lead...!

53
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,291
Hell yeah...!

54
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,500
And now that Tsukune and I
are on this trip together

55
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,000
we can finally...!

56
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,166
Wait up...!

57
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,291
Come on now, you guys;
don't leave me here!

58
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:45,958
Wow!

59
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,791
Those fish sure look hungry!

60
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,166
Um, I...

61
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,625
Hey, let's give it a try,
Tsukune, whaddaya say?

62
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,166
Yeah, sure, why not?

63
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,083
Well, gosh, I was really
hoping I'd get more chances

64
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,625
to be alone with
Tsukune on this trip.

65
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:04,375
I can't believe we've gotta be
in groups the whole time!

66
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,708
Check it out!

67
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,041
Oh, awesome!

68
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,541
They're eating it like
they really like it, huh?

69
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,750
Way to go, Captain...!

70
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,875
That fish looks delicious!

71
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,250
There sure ain't nuthin' like
eatin' em' raw is there...?

72
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,375
Hey...!

73
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,458
you guys gonna have
a go at it or not?

74
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,333
Yes!

75
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,500
Who in the heck are those guys?

76
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,541
Who knows...?

77
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,958
Maybe they're on
a school trip, too.

78
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,541
Yes, I finally
caught up to them!

79
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,458
Close one, whee!

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,208
This one's a charm
for love and marriage...

81
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,500
Oh, Tsukune, look!

82
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,666
Yahoo!

83
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,291
Tsukune, check out
this souvenir I got you,

84
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,000
you're gonna love it
more than anything!

85
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,833
No way, my souvenir's
way better.

86
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,208
Uh-uh, mine's totally cuter!

87
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,500
Well, they all look
pretty nice to me.

88
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,500
Come on, that's stupid,
it's not cute!

89
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,833
You're the one that's stupid!

90
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,458
If I'm so stupid,
how come I know Tsukune

91
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,041
likes retro stuff, huh?

92
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,250
--You're a moron!
--Wow...

93
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,833
It's so cute.

94
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,500
Do you really
think that's cute?

95
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,375
Get real Moka,
that thing is...

96
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,458
In terribly poor taste.

97
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,333
C-come on, you guys.

98
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,958
Wait, Moka!

99
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:30,791
Forget her...!

100
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,791
Pick one!

101
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,125
Ooo, pick mine!

102
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,375
Mine's gotta be a lamp,
don't you think?

103
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,541
I'm so sorry!

104
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,708
Hey...!

105
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,833
Why don't you watch
where you're going?!

106
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,416
I got some news
for you, pipsqueak,

107
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,083
"sorry's" not gonna cut it!

108
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,000
But I really didn't mean to.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,375
Oh, no, don't you worry;
it's no problem at all.

110
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,625
Yeah, it was as much our
fault as it was yours.

111
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,875
All right then, I'll be going.

112
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,083
That was one wicked
piece of ass, huh?

113
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,666
I wonder if she's
a local broad?

114
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,541
Those chicks from the
capital sure do smell like

115
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,583
a million dollars.

116
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,958
Cut the shit!

117
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,708
Did we tell you to day dream?!

118
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,708
W-we're sorry, sir.

119
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,333
Look at the uniform
she's wearing.

120
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,333
Of all the crazy places.

121
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,333
And we run into
the Yokai crowd.

122
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,458
Yokai Academy, huh?

123
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,041
Can you believe that babe?

124
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,416
She's the hottest girl
I've ever seen!

125
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:29,625
I won't stop!

126
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,416
Not till the day I die!

127
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,625
Oh, my goodness,
look how cute it is!

128
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,833
Oops!

129
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,500
So sorry about that!

130
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,375
Hey...!

131
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,750
Watch where you're going, huh?!

132
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,375
I got news for you, girlie,
'sorry' don't cut it!

133
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,708
Want me to rip off your face?

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,708
Some pretty nice digs, huh?

135
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:04,250
Umm...

136
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,583
Tsukune, I uh...

137
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,041
Hey...! So...!

138
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,541
I know we're in
separate rooms, but don't be

139
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,833
too disappointed, okay?

140
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,333
Oh, I think I can manage.

141
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,625
You can sneak into my room
tonight if you want...

142
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,833
I can always leave
the door open for you.

143
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,250
Uh, that's not gonna happen.

144
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,416
Come on you guys!

145
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,083
That is way too naughty!

146
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,458
Please...

147
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,333
We should all have some fun
together, whaddaya say?

148
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,250
Maybe we can play cards.

149
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:28,875
Eh...?

150
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:29,958
Cards are boring.

151
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,791
How about we do
something else, Tsukune?

152
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,666
If we're gonna do "something
else," we should all do it!

153
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,125
I guess I could get into that.

154
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,375
Wait, what are you
talking about?

155
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,041
These hot springs are
wonderful, aren't they?

156
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,833
They sure are...
But not as wonderful

157
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,833
as they would be if
they were coed though.

158
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,333
Hold on a second: do hot
springs always smell like this?

159
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,833
Moka...!

160
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,291
Hey, what are you
doing over there?

161
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,750
Oh, sorry, I can't get in
unless it has herbs in it.

162
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,625
Well, so much for relaxing
in the hot springs, huh?

163
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,666
What an idiot I am.

164
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,416
I shoulda waited for
them in this stupid inn

165
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,291
'till they got here!

166
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,458
Palling around with
those low level monsters...

167
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,833
My whimpy ass, watered down
version of a big sister

168
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,541
is nothing but a joke!

169
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,791
If I'm not mistaken,
you're Kokoa Shuzen.

170
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,333
Shit!

171
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,750
Why're you here?

172
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,750
I'm sorry, but we've only
got enough food and rooms

173
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,083
for the people who are supposed
to be on this trip...

174
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,541
Meow.

175
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,000
Which means, I'm sending you
back to school right away.

176
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,916
Get back here, young lady!

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,916
Stop chasing me!

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,500
You listen up!

179
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
You can't just go running around
the inn half naked, you know?

180
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,041
Oh, look who's talking?!

181
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,875
Wow, this place sure
is lively, isn't it?

182
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,541
So much for the
damned hot springs!

183
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,750
Hey, what's all that commotion?

184
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,000
Stop!

185
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,000
You are gonna pay for
putting me through all this...!

186
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,916
You mark my words!

187
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,083
Kokoa!

188
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,208
Yep, these hot springs
sure are wonderful.

189
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,500
Yeah, they sure are...

190
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,083
It looks like things
are finally calming down.

191
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,708
Does it feel chilly to you?

192
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,541
It's totally freezing.

193
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,375
Mizore...?!
What are you doing over there?

194
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,416
Oh, adjusting the
temperature...

195
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,166
It's much more
pleasant now, right?

196
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,750
I c-c-can't stop sh-sh-shaking!

197
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,333
That's it, I've had enough!

198
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,666
Actually this is pleasant.

199
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,208
Moka.

200
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,250
Hey there...

201
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,666
I'm so sorry
to startle you, Tsukune.

202
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,916
Oh, Moka.

203
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,791
She smells so nice,
fresh out of the bath!

204
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,583
Can I ask you
something, Tsukune?

205
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,208
Of course, Moka.

206
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,625
It's just...

207
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,541
Maybe after lights out...

208
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,666
If you want...

209
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,916
We could...

210
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,791
You mind?

211
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,666
No way...!

212
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,166
Oh, Moka, that sounds amazing!

213
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,208
I'm so glad.

214
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,375
Okay, see you later!

215
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,416
Bye-bye, Moka.

216
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,458
Hey, Kurumu!

217
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,500
You're not really gonna sleep
in that slutty outfit, are you?

218
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,208
I don't know what you mean,
these are just my regular pj's.

219
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,958
And look at you,
don't you look cute!

220
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,791
Like a little biddie kiddie.

221
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,750
That is totally uncalled for!

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,541
See?

223
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,791
You do the cutest little kiddie
widdie things too, don't you?

224
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,666
Hey, Mizore,
what are you doing?

225
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,625
I can't sleep when
it's hot like this.

226
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,041
Yeah, but if you do that,
the whole room will get cold.

227
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,416
Not again!

228
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,125
I'm starting to
like this place.

229
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,208
You're not gonna get
the jump on me, Moka.

230
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,666
Damn straight.

231
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,500
Moka, what's going on with you?

232
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,875
Are you not having
a good time on this trip?

233
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,125
No way, I'm having
a great time here.

234
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,375
What made you ask that?

235
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,916
Oh, I don't know, it's just...

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,166
You kinda seem like
you're down in the dumps.

237
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,875
No, uh...

238
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,458
it's...

239
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,125
it's cause I haven't gotten to
spend any time alone with you!

240
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,583
Moka, you...

241
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,625
I'm sorry...

242
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,208
I'm being selfish...

243
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,416
It's like I just want to have
you to myself the whole time.

244
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,250
Hey it's ok.

245
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,583
It's stupid.

246
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,583
No, it's not stupid at all,
I feel the same way!

247
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,125
Oh Tsukune.

248
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,916
Oh, Moka.

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,291
Oh, Tsukune.

250
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,125
Oh, Moka.

251
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,791
Oh, Tsukune!

252
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,458
Moka!

253
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,708
Well, lookie what I found!

254
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,625
I know you from this afternoon!

255
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,708
You two...!

256
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,875
You're from
Yokai Academy, right?

257
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,708
Sorry, but I'm afraid we're
gonna be taking you hostage.

258
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,916
Run!

259
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,708
Guess I'll have to
make do with only you!

260
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,333
Moka, help me!

261
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,625
Tsukune!

262
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,708
Oh, Kurumu, it's you!

263
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,000
I get it, so these goons
are monsters, huh?

264
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,791
If you ever want
your little friend back,

265
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,833
then you'll have
to come looking for us!

266
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,041
What the...?

267
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,125
Oh, Tsukune.

268
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,291
Pull it together!

269
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,125
Kurumu.

270
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,458
We'll hunt them down...

271
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,541
and we'll find him.

272
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,166
You're damn right!

273
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,625
Hold your horses!

274
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,083
It's Rubi!

275
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,500
You're planning on
going out in those outfits?

276
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,083
I've had a lot more experience
with the human world

277
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,500
than you have...

278
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,625
Take this...

279
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,208
It'll come in handy.

280
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,000
You don't seem very
worried, pip squeek.

281
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,916
I'm soaking wet, at this rate,
I'm gonna catch a cold!

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,125
Well now...

283
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,041
it looks like our guests
have arrived, boys.

284
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,333
Moka, it's you!

285
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,875
Don't worry; we've
come here to rescue you!

286
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,875
Those outfits...?

287
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,416
What's up with that, huh?

288
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,541
I knew wearing this
was a terrible idea!

289
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,333
Yeah, but...

290
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,916
Rubi said we looked good!

291
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:23,541
Rubi...

292
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,125
That...

293
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:24,958
Idiot.

294
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,458
All right!

295
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,875
But now's not really the time
to worry about it, is it?!

296
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,458
We need to save Tsukune,
and get the hell outta here!

297
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,375
Hey, you over there!

298
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,416
Why'd you kidnap
Tsukune anyway?!

299
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,833
Because little girl.

300
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,708
In order for Monster Industries
to conquer the nation,

301
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,333
and rule with an iron fist...

302
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,375
We must first put an end
to your pesky Academy!

303
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,333
Wait, 'conquer the nation?'...

304
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,208
Is that all you want?

305
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,708
then go ahead!

306
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,958
I guess it's a territorial
thing for you gangs, isn't it?

307
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,083
Besides, it's not a fair fight,
us against all of you?!

308
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,416
Oh, don't worry...

309
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,833
They're just here to
watch us kick your ass...!

310
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,000
The one's you're gonna
be fighting are us, the

311
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:03,333
'Four Mighty Monster Bosses!'
The number works out perfectly!

312
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,916
Start the fight!

313
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,541
How come I always get
the fat disgusting ones?!

314
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,291
Sorry I'm fat
and disgusting...

315
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,416
You flat-chested little bitch!

316
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,000
My boobs are huge!

317
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,708
Unless you're bigger
than an H cup I don't

318
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,541
even bother
callin' 'em titties!

319
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,541
You sick, perverted lard-ass!

320
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,416
From the looks of you,
it appears that you're

321
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,916
a snow woman...

322
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,833
That would make a fire monster
like me your true nemesis.

323
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,291
Try this out, you Snow Bitch!

324
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,666
Shit...

325
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,208
This is super hot!

326
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,458
Hey there, 'shorty'!

327
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,833
You Yokai witches
sure have stunted growth!

328
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,250
Now, eat my
'Iyo Pillow Throw!'

329
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,541
Ouch! That is a lot of pillows!

330
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,916
Now my 'Awa Dance
Improvisation! Break it down!

331
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,958
do your thing...!

332
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:01,833
Oh, yeah!

333
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,833
What the...

334
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,666
This guy's not serious, is he?

335
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,666
Don't be jealous...!

336
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,833
You wish you had
moves like this!

337
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,083
I've had enough of you!

338
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,166
Ha...!

339
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,291
Who's dancin' now?

340
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,083
But snow beats fire too...

341
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,708
So, in other words,
if you flip it around,

342
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,041
that makes me your
true nemesis, as well.

343
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,375
Wait, what?

344
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,166
You big jerk...!

345
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,583
I'm small because
I'm just a little kid,

346
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,500
you're the one with
the stunted growth...!

347
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,083
Take this!

348
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,583
You've defeated us all!

349
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,833
What are you people,
some kind of demon horde?

350
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,250
Actually, they're just
regular ole monsters, whee!

351
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,666
You there!

352
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,916
I'm expressing my utter
disbelief, what are you doing?!

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,666
Oh darnit, I got caught!

354
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,000
Just save yourself!

355
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,041
No way...!

356
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,666
I won't run off
and leave you here!

357
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,541
Thank you, Moka.

358
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,916
Listen up...!

359
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,791
Prepare yourselves to witness
my ultimate attack!

360
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,791
Tosa...!

361
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,416
Time to go fishing!

362
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,708
Reel it, reel it,
reel it, reel it!

363
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,333
I'll keep on reeling
till I rip it all off!

364
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:33,250
I'm Moka Akashiya, a second year
student from Yokai Academy!

365
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,916
I'm on a school trip
with my friends,

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,333
trying to have some fun!

367
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,333
But that's pretty much
gone out the window now,

368
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,250
because I'm stuck here
fighting you stupid jerks,

369
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,625
because of some
world domination plot!

370
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,041
Yeah, tell 'em Moka!

371
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,083
You idiots are getting in
the way of my love plans,

372
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,083
and I will not
allow that to happen!

373
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,958
Say that to my face!

374
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,041
Gosh, he looks
exactly the same.

375
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,250
Are you serious?

376
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,500
You really don't get
why he wears the mask?

377
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,375
Oh...

378
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,500
The wind is hitting my cheek...!

379
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,416
Since she knocked my mask off,
that must mean I lost...!

380
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,250
I lost to a Yokai girl!

381
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,375
What the hell is going on here?

382
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,000
Mi...

383
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,041
Mister Minister.

384
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,208
What about conquering
the nation?

385
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,125
You're right...!

386
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,000
Our dream's far from over...!

387
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,500
It's time to bring in
our heavy hitter!

388
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,416
They have a 'heavy hitter?'

389
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,333
No way, that's...

390
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,458
You have got to be kidding me.

391
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,750
Defend us my master...!

392
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,541
Use your mighty power
that knocked us all out

393
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,333
with one kick,
to kick their asses!

394
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,583
I'll use this opportunity
to beat the crap outta

395
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,208
my weakling sister!

396
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,041
Hey, guys...

397
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,416
That's obviously...

398
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,000
Kokoa...

399
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,291
Of course.

400
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,333
That bitch.

401
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,333
Now, listen up...!

402
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,041
Losers, runts, and sissies...!

403
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,458
Seems ta me ya been
pickin' on my associates,

404
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,250
whaddaya have to
say 'bout that?!

405
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,625
I'm not really sure how
I'm supposed to respond here.

406
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, just ignore her.

407
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,916
...serve up a plate
of ass-kicking

408
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,583
Ma-master, they're uh...

409
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,916
Let's go have some fun, yahoo!

410
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,875
Guys, if we don't hurry back,
we're not gonna make it

411
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,416
in time for breakfast!

412
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,625
Oh, Kokoa, if you're planning
on eating breakfast with us,

413
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,833
you better not be late either.

414
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,208
Hey, where do you
think you're going?!

415
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,583
I told you,
I'm the heavy hitter!

416
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,416
When the rosary seal over
her breast is removed...

417
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,916
Moka's innocent self vanishes...

418
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,250
and her inner vampire awakens!

419
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:01,625
Oh...!

420
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,750
My sister, it's you!

421
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,250
Acting up again, eh...?

422
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,333
I told you to learn your place!

423
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:10,791
She's so amazing!

424
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,333
I just love my real sister!

425
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,958
She's totally the best!

426
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,666
Th-that chick is radical...!

427
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,416
She is a total bad ass!

428
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,916
She defeated the Master
who defeated our Minister,

429
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,625
and so quick!

430
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,500
So, do you still wanna fight?

431
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,250
We're so sorry!

432
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,375
Moka.

433
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,541
Untill we get back
to the academy...

434
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,375
Nobody is allowed to be
in their monster form.

435
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,208
Come on, Kurumu, you've seen one
shrine, you've seen them all.

436
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,916
Yeah, but this one's
really famous.

437
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,750
It's called 'Enmusubi no
Kami,' it symbolizes marriage

438
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,416
and love...

439
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,833
Hey! Tsukune, you...

440
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:51,666
What the...

441
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,583
Where'd he go?

442
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,708
You guys, Moka's
not here either.

443
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,791
No! How could she?!

444
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,583
Finally.

445
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,333
We have some time alone.

446
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,708
I'm so sorry about
yesterday, Moka.

447
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:07,500
No...

448
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,416
It's fine...

449
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,458
I mean, look...

450
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,250
We're here...

451
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,375
Aren't we?

452
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,333
Moka.

453
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,125
Tsukune.

454
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,666
Let me guess, you guys're here
for payback from this morning!

455
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,208
All hail, Moka!

456
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,208
You are indeed the one...

457
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,625
A worthy commander
with the power to lead us.

458
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,541
You shall be our new minister.

459
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,375
Our rosary ringleader!

460
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,875
All hail, Moka!

461
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,208
All hail our Rosa-Ring!

462
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:47,708
All hail our rosary ringleader

463
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:48,250
Wow...

464
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,208
Beautiful!

465
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,000
This is so exciting!

466
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,875
It's unbelievable!

467
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,708
What is going on...?!

468
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,916
Oh! Tsukune!

469
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,208
Aww, more sucking?

470
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,541
Why does this always happen?!

471
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,291
Yukari, it's time for
the decisive battle,

472
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,458
and where will it happen?

473
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:43,500
You tell me.

474
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,583
In the bathroom!

475
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:46,791
I can hardly stand it!

476
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,208
What will happen?

477
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,375
Next time...

478
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,208
"Bathroom and
a Vampire" and another...!
