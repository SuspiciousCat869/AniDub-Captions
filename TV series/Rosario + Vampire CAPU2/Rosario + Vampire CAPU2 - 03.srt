1
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:20,916
Good morning!

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,166
How's it goin'?

3
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,125
Man, am I tired.

4
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,916
Hey, good morning
to you, Tsukune.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,625
Oh, 'morning, guys.

6
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,166
So, are both of your parents
showin' up today or just one?

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,041
Huh?

8
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,125
My parents?

9
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,708
Hold on, what are
you talking about?

10
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,375
'Kay?

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,250
And since tomorrow is
Yokai Academy's Parents' Day...

12
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,541
All of you need to show your
folks what a great school

13
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,916
this is, so let's do it
and I'll see you and them

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
in the morning!

15
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,791
Right...

16
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:53,791
Neither.

17
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,375
Huh?!

18
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,041
Uh, I mean "neither 'cause my
parents are way too super-busy

19
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,291
to come!"
Yeah, that's what I meant!

20
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,666
Dude, that rocks!

21
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,166
Huh?

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,666
This guy's parents trust him
so much that they don't need

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,083
to come see him at school...!
I wish my parents

24
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,666
treated me like an adult!

25
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,208
I'm really lucky!

26
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,291
And a human with
human parents...

27
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,166
That's why I didn't
tell 'em about today!

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,458
I really would've liked
to have met your mom, though.

29
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,041
Huh?

30
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:18,875
Yeah, me, too!

31
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,625
You wanna meet my Mom?!

32
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:21,666
I sure would!

33
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,916
Huh?!

34
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,083
I really would've liked to have
met your mother, too, Tsukune;

35
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,833
it would have been so nice.

36
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,333
I really would've liked to have
met your mother, too, Tsukune;

37
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,041
it would have been
so nice; I'd say...

38
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,791
No, I'll take care of
dinner, Mrs. Aono,

39
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,041
and do you mind
if I call you "Mom?"

40
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,125
Quit it...

41
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,833
You're making me blush...
Don't look at me like that

42
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:52,083
in front of my
future mother-in-law!

43
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,166
Tsukune?

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,041
Uh...!

45
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,041
Yeah, that would be nice, huh?

46
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,666
How lovely...

47
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,208
I'll say...

48
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,541
Shit.

49
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,666
Wow, Saizo's even grumpier
than he usually is.

50
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,333
Do you think Parents' Day
could be upsetting him

51
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,708
for some reason?

52
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,000
Dunno; maybe no one from
his family is coming today.

53
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,083
Hah, who gives a crap
about parents, anyway?!

54
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,625
Saizo!

55
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,500
Hi, sweetie!

56
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:04,875
Mommy!

57
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:05,625
Daddy!

58
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,333
--"Mommy?"
--"Daddy?"

59
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,833
You're late!

60
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,041
I was worried you'd gotten into
a boo-boo and was about to

61
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,291
cry my eyes out!

62
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,583
Ha, ha, sorry 'bout that, son.

63
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,416
Who's coming from your family?

64
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,000
It's just me, so I better
get to Kokoa's classroom

65
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,458
and spend some time with her.

66
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,958
Just you?

67
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,250
Yeah, you see, the truth
is, I've never once had

68
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,708
anyone come and visit
me on Parents' Day...

69
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,875
it's the same for Kokoa
so I thought I'd go visit her.

70
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,333
Oh, Moka...

71
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,083
I don't need your charity!

72
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,333
Ya hear?!

73
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,500
If you even think of
coming to my classroom,

74
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,208
you're gonna meet the
business end of my little

75
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,833
Ko hammer here,
and you're so gonna regret it!

76
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:44,708
Hmph!

77
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,250
Well, I certainly regret it...

78
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,666
Agh! Tsukune!

79
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,041
Are you okay...? I'm sorry;
you got hurt because of me.

80
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,291
It's not your fault...

81
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,333
But what was that stuff
you were saying before?

82
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,458
About how no one ever came
to see you on Parents' Day?

83
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,291
It's been like that
since I was little.

84
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm used to it.

85
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,208
I'm always the only one
nobody comes to see.

86
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,083
But Moka...

87
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,166
Not this year.

88
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,208
Huh?

89
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,250
Nobody's coming
to see me, either...

90
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,416
We're in the same boat.

91
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,750
Oh, Tsukune...

92
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,958
Oh, Moka...

93
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,750
Oh, Tsukune...

94
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,166
My blood, huh?

95
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,750
PDA's are against
school rules, you know...?

96
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,208
Do you mind telling me
what you're doing here, Moka?

97
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:50,083
I should be asking you what
you're doing here, stalker!

98
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,541
It's because I want
to ask Tsukune a favor.

99
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,708
Huh?

100
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,166
It's my dumb mother;
she keeps nagging me

101
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,833
to introduce you to her.

102
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,375
Me? Um, sure.
Where is she...? Well?

103
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,291
She's been here
the whole time?!

104
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,083
Now I see where
Mizore gets that from!

105
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,916
Mizore really takes after
her mother, doesn't she?!

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,125
Yeah...!

107
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,750
Hey, it's okay to
come out now, Mother...

108
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,000
This guy is my boyfriend.

109
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,791
What?!

110
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,000
Hey, hold on a second here!

111
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,500
I'm not your-...!

112
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,875
Sorry, but could you please
play along and pretend to be

113
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,625
my boyfriend for now...?
'Cause I kinda accidentally

114
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,416
told my mom that you
and me were an item.

115
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,291
You what?!

116
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,333
Pleased to meet you...

117
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,541
I'm Mizore's mother, Tsurara.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,083
And you must be the
famous Tsukune, huh?

119
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,041
You're even more handsome
than Mizore described.

120
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,666
Uhhh!

121
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,916
Wow!

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,875
Mizore's mom seems
really classy and nice...

123
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,375
Not to mention gorgeous!

124
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,625
I can see where Mizore
gets her looks...

125
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,291
But I don't think
Moka's as impressed!

126
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,708
Geez, it was going so good
there for a second.

127
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,791
Why does this always
happen to us...?

128
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:58,208
Still, it was sweet how Tsukune
said we were in the same boat...

129
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,041
And who might this
nice young lady be?

130
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,375
Huh?

131
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,500
Oh! It's such a pleasure
to meet you, ma'am. I'm--

132
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,416
She's just this
super clingy groupie girl.

133
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,916
Huh?

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,083
She's always spying on Tsukune
like some creepy stalker.

135
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,791
You're the stalker!

136
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,500
Oh, Tsukune...! I found
you...! Yes...! Finally...!

137
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,541
Hey, Mom, quick,
he's over here!

138
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,083
This is my mother.

139
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,583
Please, call me Ageha...! So
you're Kurumu's fiancée, huh?

140
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,791
--He's a fiancée this time?!
--I'm a fiancée this time?!

141
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,250
And who might you be, dear?

142
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,416
His wannabe lover?

143
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,958
Oh, I do certainly
hope so, Ms. Kurono!

144
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,000
I see!

145
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,208
I can't believe how
soft these things are...!

146
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,875
Man, they're even
softer than Kurumu's!

147
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,500
That daughter of mine...

148
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,166
Huh?

149
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,500
You know, Kurumu...

150
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,250
She might act suggestively...

151
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,041
but in actuality, she doesn't
have any real experience

152
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,083
underneath the sheets,
now does she?

153
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,458
So then...

154
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,041
I'd appreciate it if you
gave her a roll in the hay.

155
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,416
Wait, you mean
you want me to-...?!

156
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,666
What do you say
to dinner sometime?

157
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,416
You seem to need
some lessons in love

158
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,041
and I could give you
some hands-on instruction.

159
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,500
There he is!

160
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,625
Hey, Tsukune!

161
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,458
Pardon us, please...

162
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,125
And this, folks, is one of
our sophomore classrooms.

163
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,291
Hey Rubi?

164
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,250
why are you...?

165
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,416
Huh?

166
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,666
Fellow witches!

167
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,333
Oh, I'm so happy to meet you!

168
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,666
I don't know how many
years it's been

169
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,541
since I've seen adult witches!

170
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,791
Hey, paws off, you cougar!

171
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,791
Tsukune's all mine!

172
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,541
Tsurara?!

173
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,958
Huh?!

174
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,958
Well, is everyone having
an enjoyable Parents' Day?

175
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,750
Not her again...

176
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,000
Terrific; it's her!

177
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,875
That brings first period to
a close; now it's time for PE...

178
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,750
Parents, if you'll head out
to the tennis courts, please!

179
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,541
Hey, that girlfriend stuff
you guys were saying...!

180
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,750
What the heck
is going on here?!

181
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah, exactly.

182
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,375
What was the deal with
all that "fiancée" crap?

183
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,333
Well, if you have to know,
my mom kept pestering me

184
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,916
about my love life, and
that's just what came out...!

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,916
And you pretty much
did the same thing!

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
I guess...

187
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,291
But I know that me and Tsukune
are gonna hook up any day now.

188
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,791
No way, he's gonna marry me!

189
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,791
Whoa, wait, stop it! Just
hold on a minute and listen!

190
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,208
Both of you guys need to go tell
your moms the truth right now!

191
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,958
Quiver, quiver;
quiver quiver...

192
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,583
You've just gotta
be my boyfriend!

193
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,125
Please be my fiancée! He's
mine, abominable snowwoman!

194
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,166
And now it's the second period
of Parents' Day, whee!

195
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,958
Did you guys
just see my swing?!

196
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,458
Nice save, Moka...!
That was great!

197
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,000
Dang!

198
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,416
Hey, a little effort
would be nice!

199
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,750
I melt when I run.

200
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,666
"Melt?"

201
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,791
--Mizore!
--Honey!

202
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,083
--Huh?
--Huh?

203
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,291
What I want to know is how far
you've gone with Tsukune,

204
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:18,916
Kurumu!

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,916
Uh...

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,166
What do you mean, Mom?!

207
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,958
Do it with him!

208
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,916
Right here and
right now, okay?!

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,958
What?!

210
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,958
But we're in the
middle of PE right now...

211
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,166
And besides that, I've really
been trying to get Tsukune

212
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,250
to like me without having to use
any of my succubus powers...

213
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,666
Plus he and I haven't
even really kissed yet.

214
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,125
It sounds like your
relationship with him

215
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,625
is over before it even started.

216
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,708
Mom!

217
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,916
If you want him,
do it with him, got it?!

218
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,291
Uh!

219
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,500
Now Tsukune's gonna be
Kurumu's for sure.

220
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,250
I want to talk to you about
the relationship that

221
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,708
you have with Tsukune.

222
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,750
There's something I need
to tell you about that.

223
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,625
I want you to
freeze him, dear.

224
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,083
Well, that wasn't what
I expected you to say.

225
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,291
Mizore, if you freeze him
right now, then Tsukune

226
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,541
will remain your
boyfriend forever.

227
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,541
But, Mother, I made a promise
to him that I wouldn't

228
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,416
do stuff like that anymore.

229
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,708
Really...? In that case,
don't be surprised if

230
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,291
he ends up with Kurumu.

231
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,000
No!

232
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,250
I can't let that happen!

233
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,708
There's only one way to
make sure that it doesn't...

234
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,541
And that's by freezing him
and keeping him close.

235
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,541
That's the proper form
of love for a snow woman.

236
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,208
Then...

237
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,458
That's what I'll do.

238
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,333
Now Tsukune's gonna
be Mizore's for sure.

239
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,458
I will not lose
to that woman...

240
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,000
I refuse to lose to her...

241
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,625
Boy, these are some
scary mothers, whee!

242
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,000
Tsukune, c'mere.

243
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,083
Uh...

244
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,041
What's keeping you,
Tsukune...? Hurry up.

245
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,875
There's something
I want to do to you.

246
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,208
Oh, yeah, and
what might that be?

247
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,250
Oh, just this!

248
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,583
No...! Oh, Tsukune!

249
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,083
Hey, just what are you

250
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,250
--Hold on, I'll get you out...
--trying to do, kill him?!

251
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,791
--It was love.
--Yeah, in what universe?!

252
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,750
If I hadn't done it,
I might've lost him.

253
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,375
Just hold on
a little bit longer, Tsukune!

254
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,958
Oh, thank goodness!

255
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,041
I'm so grateful
that you're still alive!

256
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,833
Tsukune!

257
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,541
Just tell me where it hurts
and I'll make it all better...!

258
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,583
--What about this?
--Well, to be honest...!

259
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,083
--I was worried so sick
--You made it much better!

260
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,250
--about it, um, I mean you...
--You made it much better!

261
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,250
Here, feel.

262
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,541
Huh?!

263
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,833
Well, do you feel how fast
my heart is beating?

264
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,291
Tsukune?

265
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,583
Yeah, but your heart's not
the only thing I'm feeling!

266
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,875
Do me.

267
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,791
What?!

268
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,708
Unless we do it,
I may lose you forever

269
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,083
and I just couldn't
deal with that.

270
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,875
Wait, you mean here and now?!

271
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,791
Wow, you can't let your
guard down for a second

272
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,000
around these two!

273
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,916
Thanks alot, Yukari.

274
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,750
Who wants to
solve this problem?

275
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,625
Hmm.

276
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,083
Miss Shirayuki?

277
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,791
I don't know how to.

278
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,875
Miss Kurono then.

279
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,791
I don't know how to, either.

280
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,916
As for the author Yakumo
Koizumi, he seems to have been

281
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,625
on quite good terms with
monsters such as us.

282
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,375
He wrote about all
kinds of monsters;

283
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,291
from faceless ones to
long-necked ones, and also-...

284
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,166
Um... You're too close, meow!

285
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:01,333
Close our eyes, look
around my frozen heart...

286
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:06,208
Start to melt with the
warmth of your desire...

287
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:11,458
Can this be love
I feel for you now...

288
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,625
Please don't tell me
you can't take it...

289
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:19,541
Since the day our
stars first aligned...

290
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:24,666
My whole world's
been frozen in time...

291
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,541
I love you so much,
I could die...

292
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,375
and I can't sleep at night...

293
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:39,625
There is a snowstorm,
there is a snowstorm...

294
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:44,166
it's blowing through
the walls of my heart...

295
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,041
there is a snowstorm,
there is a snowstorm...

296
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:53,458
And your chills to
the depth of my emotion...

297
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:59,416
now I'm yours I'm
a prisioner of passion...

298
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:27,708
Hoping that you might notice me
As you look the other way

299
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:38,875
I'm afraid to see, what could be
In the line of your gaze

300
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,708
My tender heart and
quivering breasts

301
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:51,583
So alone and un-adored
Why can't I be the one

302
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:59,375
Just tell me how
My heart is yours don't you see

303
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,541
I'll wait a countless
sum of days

304
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:09,333
Forever, if that's what it takes
How can I charm your heart

305
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:14,791
and take your breath away
Your smiling face

306
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:22,458
Left with no trace
I'm blinded through bitter tears

307
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,000
So I stand alone!

308
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,000
So I stand alone!

309
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:34,083
Yahoo, Yahoo, don't you see?

310
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,916
That was so beautiful!

311
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,208
There sure is a crap ton of
singing in this episode whee

312
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,541
Kurumu! I think the best
way to wrap up my visit is

313
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:49,000
by having dinner together, and
with Tsukune, too, of course.

314
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,708
Aw, that's such a kind offer...

315
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,208
Unfortunately, Tsukune's going
to have to turn it down

316
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,583
because he already promised
to eat with Mizore and I.

317
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,083
Huh?!

318
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,041
I'm afraid you must have him
confused with someone else,

319
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,750
because Tsukune promised
to have dinner with me

320
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,416
--and Kurumu tonight.
--Hey, wait a minute!

321
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,041
I'm quite sure it was him;
I know who my dates are...

322
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,083
I don't pick up random men,
unlike some bimbos that I know.

323
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,041
It must be nice to have
so few dates that you

324
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,958
can actually remember
them all. As for me,

325
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,666
I get so many offers from men,
I can barely keep track of them.

326
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,125
Geez...

327
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,708
This is way too tense.

328
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,541
Tsukune?

329
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,958
Yes, ma'am?!

330
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,333
We need to discuss you and
Kurumu's engagement party.

331
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,625
Engagement party?!

332
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,916
Let's pull out all the
stops...! You two are

333
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,333
getting married after all!

334
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,083
Hey, Tsukune?

335
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,625
Um, yes, ma'am?!

336
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,375
I think that you and Mizore
should have a lavish wedding,

337
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,083
don't you?

338
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,416
A wedding?!

339
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,541
Of course you and Mizore
are just dating right now,

340
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,666
but you know what
that usually leads to.

341
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,541
I never said we
were getting married.

342
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,125
Quiet!

343
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,041
Look, I hate to break it to you
like this, but unfortunately,

344
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,791
there's just no way that your
daughter can marry Tsukune...

345
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,250
Didn't you hear my Kurumu
earlier when she said that

346
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:02,291
Tsukune was her fiancée? If not,
get the wax out of your ears.

347
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,625
She's marrying Tsukune!

348
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,708
He'a going to be
my son-in-law, not yours!

349
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,000
Um...

350
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,375
I'd be really happy
if that actually happened,

351
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,583
but I kinda made up
that "fiancée" stuff.

352
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,958
Hush, Kurumu!

353
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,708
Since your bust size is
bigger than your brain size,

354
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,375
let me explain something...

355
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,208
There's no such thing as
a love affair when there's

356
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,916
no love involved at all...

357
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,875
So then the only one that
Tsukune truly loves...

358
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,166
Um, there's something
about me and Tsukune

359
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,666
I need to tell you...

360
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,708
I lied...

361
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:26,750
He's marrying Kurumu!

362
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,541
No, he's going to be
my son-in-law!

363
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,166
No, mine!

364
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:29,708
No, mine!

365
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,500
No, he's mine!

366
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,750
No, he's mine!

367
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,666
You just don't get it,
do you, Tsurara?!

368
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,500
No, you don't!

369
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,541
Chaos Claw!

370
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,375
Hah! That's no match against
my Dancing Blizzard!

371
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:44,791
Mom!

372
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,791
Cut it out!

373
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,958
Chill out, Mother!

374
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,750
I'll cut her with
Ultimate Claw Attack!

375
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,333
I'm gonna make
Tsukune my husband,

376
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,333
but the old fashioned way,
so please stop this now!

377
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,125
Transcendental
Ice Pillar Array!

378
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,500
Mother, I promise that I'll make
Tsukune my husband one day,

379
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,416
so please stop this fighting
before you hurt somebody!

380
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:07,583
Didn't you hear me...

381
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,791
"knock it off?!"

382
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,041
Please, Mother,
you have to cool your head!

383
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,250
--You be quiet and butt out!
--Be quiet...! Butt out!

384
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,833
Oh, no...! They're hurt!

385
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,250
--Tsurara Special!
--Ageha Screw!

386
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,875
You haven't changed a bit
since high school, have you?!

387
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,416
You're still trying
to swoop in and steal

388
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,166
someone else's boyfriend!

389
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,541
Huh?!

390
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,125
You can't call it "stealing"
when he was never yours

391
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,083
to begin with...! All you ever
did was hang around poor Gonzo

392
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,916
and bother him, but he
never even gave you

393
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,916
the time of day,
did he, Tsurara?

394
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,916
You're one to talk!

395
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,250
You came on
to him like a hussy,

396
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,375
but he never even
looked in your direction!

397
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,666
Take that back!

398
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,125
Well, I'm guessing that...

399
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,750
These two ladies...

400
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,125
Were at Yokai Academy...

401
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,000
In the same class?!

402
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,125
That only happened 'cause
you screwed things up

403
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,291
and got in the way!

404
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,625
You were the one
who got in the way!

405
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,916
I hated you then
and I hate you now!

406
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,791
Let's go!

407
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,916
Meet my Snowman of Fear!

408
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,583
Oh yeah, try these on for size!

409
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,916
Breast Missiles of Rage!

410
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,375
Your meddling ends now!

411
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,500
Same for you!

412
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,666
Aren't you too old
to act like this?

413
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,750
Moka, please wait!

414
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,916
--No!
--What did you say to us?!

415
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,333
How dare you?!

416
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,125
Let's teach this girl
a lesson!

417
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,458
A painful one!

418
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,166
Moka, stop, they're parents!

419
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,041
Oh, Tsukune!

420
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,083
What?!

421
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,375
If things don't work out with my
daughter, how 'bout dating me?

422
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,583
I knew you could fix
this up Mama and Papa

423
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,875
You used us to
carry out your stupid fight!

424
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,541
I'm sorry.

425
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,666
Well, what about you, Mother?

426
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,500
Yes, I'm sorry, too.

427
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,583
And we're both really sorry
that we lied to you about

428
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,250
the nature of our
relationships with Tsukune...

429
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,125
We want him to fall
in love with us naturally,

430
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,083
and not in some
underhanded way...

431
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,416
Even if you managed to force
Tsukune to become the husband

432
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,416
to one of us, it wouldn't
be right and that's not

433
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,750
the way we want him.

434
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,583
Hey, I'll take him that way.

435
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,708
Mizore, no!

436
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,958
I'm just kidding.

437
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,625
C'mere, Tsukune!

438
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,291
I hope you have a safe
trip home Mommy and Daddy.

439
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,083
You be a good boy now, Sizo, and
make the ko-me-uh name proud.

440
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,875
You can count on me, Daddy!

441
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,875
Wait, "Komiya?"

442
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,208
You don't suppose-...

443
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,416
Actually I do suppose it...

444
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,416
Then that would
make his father...

445
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,000
Gonzo?!

446
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,583
Kurumu, it's not the hunks
in the past, it's the hunks

447
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,416
in the future that count,
so don't let Tsukune get away!

448
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,208
Fine...

449
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,416
Mizore...

450
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,958
Next time I want you
to bring Tsukune home

451
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,791
as your real boyfriend,
do you understand?

452
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,291
Yes! Just please stop
doing that, Mother!

453
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,583
Man...

454
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,958
I'm glad that Parents' Day
is only once a year.

455
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,000
So, Tsukune...

456
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,333
Tell me.

457
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,583
Would you rather I had
parents like that who did

458
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,625
crazy stuff for me?

459
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,083
Or would that bother you?

460
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,125
Actually, it doesn't matter
to me what kind of parents

461
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,375
you have, Moka. Not at all.

462
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,500
How they behave won't change
the way I feel about you.

463
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,500
Tsukune...

464
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,208
Moka...

465
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,541
Uhh...!

466
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,333
What?!

467
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,750
My blood again?!

468
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,458
Already?!

469
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,541
That sure was
a fun Parents' Day.

470
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,416
Yes, but I had
a bigger role than you did.

471
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,166
Did not!

472
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,333
Did, too!

473
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,500
Excuse me, ladies,
but this is the preview,

474
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,750
so all parents have to
refrain from speaking...

475
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:49,833
Next time...

476
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:50,875
"Body Measurements
and a Vampire"...

477
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,250
and another!
