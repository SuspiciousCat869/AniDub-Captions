1
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
Hey there, Tsukune.

2
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,333
Oh, Moka.

3
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,666
Oh... Tsuku... ne...

4
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,625
Oh, Moka...

5
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,041
Um, Tsukune?

6
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,541
Yes, Moka?

7
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,166
Do you wanna
suck my blood again?

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:45,916
No...

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,208
not today...

10
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,041
I want something
else instead...

11
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,625
Huh?

12
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:55,541
Um...

13
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,625
are you sure about this, Moka?

14
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,125
As long as it's...

15
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,000
with you.

16
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:16,458
Trying to steal a kiss
from me takes some nerve...

17
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,833
I think it's time that you...

18
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,000
...learned your place!

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,291
Oh, crap!

20
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,625
Look at the time!

21
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,541
If I don't get a move-on,
I'm gonna miss the bus!

22
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:38,958
Hey, Mom, I've
gotta go right now!

23
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,000
Wait, what about breakfast?

24
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,375
I'll eat when I get there!

25
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:45,125
Just make sure you come home
for summer this year!

26
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,791
Also, I hope that you packed
plenty of clean underwear...!

27
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,208
Bye, sweetie!

28
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,125
Hey, Tsuki!

29
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,708
How long has it been, cousin?!

30
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,625
Sorry, Kyoko!

31
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,500
I've gotta go!

32
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,625
Geez...! Thanks so much
for the warm welcome, cuz!

33
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,000
My name's Tsukune Aono,
and I'm seventeen years old...

34
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,750
As of today,
I'm a high school junior...

35
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,125
Our spring break just ended,
and I'm about to begin another

36
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,166
year at Yokai Academy.

37
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,000
Hey, kid?

38
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,291
Huh?

39
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,375
It's been a year now.

40
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,166
You gotten used to it yet?

41
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,708
Yep... I guess so.

42
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,666
Yokai Academy is a school
of monsters, by monsters,

43
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,000
and for monsters.

44
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,500
If you can blend in there,
you're no ordinary guy.

45
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,166
Still, watch your back.

46
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,666
Why?

47
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,000
'Cause just when you think
you've got it all figured out,

48
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,750
that's usually when
things go to hell.

49
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,750
You have to pass through
this secret barrier to reach

50
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,208
my school, Yokai Academy.

51
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,041
There was this
mix-up, you see...

52
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,541
That's how I ended up enrolling
in this scary-ass school

53
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,791
in the first place.

54
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,083
I decided to stay, though...

55
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,416
And despite its scariness,
there's no other school

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,291
I'd rather attend
than this one.

57
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,541
I've got friends here,
and this is the only place

58
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,375
we can be together.

59
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,958
Speaking of friends,
isn't this the exact spot

60
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,000
where I first met Moka?

61
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,500
That's a bike...!

62
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,125
Alright, maybe it's Moka!

63
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,666
Ow...

64
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,791
Here, let me give you a hand...

65
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:30,833
I'm so sorry!

66
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:39,458
Whoa, she's so cute!

67
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,875
Hey...!

68
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,833
Stop groping me, you creep!

69
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,916
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
I was just-...!

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,250
Perv...!

71
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,375
You felt me up!

72
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,083
By accident...

73
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,583
Wait...

74
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,500
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but you smell really good!

75
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,291
You were gonna grope me again!

76
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,375
No...! I swear
I wasn't going to!

77
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,125
Hmph...!

78
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,583
Drop dead...!

79
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,291
Pervert!

80
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,875
It's only been a couple
of weeks, but it feels like

81
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,625
I've been gone for ages!

82
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,958
Wonder what everyone's up to?

83
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:23,750
Oh!

84
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,083
They're so incredible!

85
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,041
They're so billowy and bouncy!

86
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,250
I guess it's true about
bigger breasts being better!

87
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,541
Dunno, Yukari's tiny ones
are pretty cute, too!

88
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:40,916
Hey what the hell are
you doing your all ...girls!

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,708
Hey...! Nothing can
keep me from you Tsukune.

90
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,041
Yes, Ya-hoo-hoo...!

91
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,583
Tsukune!

92
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,750
Hey, you didn't
forget about me, did you?!

93
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,375
Oh, I've missed you so bad!

94
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,625
You're gonna tell me you're glad
to see me again, too, right?!

95
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,166
I would if I could breathe...

96
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,833
Chill out.

97
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,000
It'll be a cold day in hell
before I let you sink

98
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,791
your claws into my Tsukune,
you big-boobed bimbo.

99
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,250
Oh, yeah, you frozen freak...?

100
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,083
He's my Tsukune,
and I'm gonna shred you

101
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,166
into ice cubes if
you come near him!

102
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,583
Bring it on then, Kurumu.

103
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,750
There's only one woman
for Tsukune and that's me,

104
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,291
his little popsicle!

105
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,916
First day of school
and there's already a fight

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,125
between the succubus
and the snow woman!

107
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,541
Stop it!

108
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,500
Please, this is no way
to kick off a new school year!

109
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,875
Moka!

110
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,708
Tsukune!

111
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:31,916
What?

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,250
Hmm.

113
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,875
I really missed you...

114
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,375
Moka.

115
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,041
I missed you, too...

116
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,500
Tsukune.

117
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,000
Moka?!

118
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,916
It's been so long since I...

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Wait a minute...

120
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,208
Don't tell me.

121
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,916
I can't help what I am...

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,291
And what that is is a vampire!

123
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,083
Guess I'm lucky
the other girl didn't do this!

124
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,875
What do you mean "other girl"?

125
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,791
Hey, that's the
legendary Moka Akashiya!

126
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,000
She's so cool!

127
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,166
We're crazy about you, Moka!

128
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,916
So, I guess all of you
are freshmen, huh?

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,875
Yeah!

130
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,375
We're thrilled to be here!

131
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,541
We couldn't wait to attend
Yokai Academy, and finally meet

132
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,541
the awesome and sexy
older students we've heard

133
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,083
so much about!

134
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,125
Like Yukari Sendo, who's young
and tiny but totally smart!

135
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,833
And Kurumu Kurono, the bombshell
with the ballistic bazongas!

136
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:32,250
And also the literally cool
ice queen, Mizore Shirayuki!

137
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,500
But there's one girl
who's even prettier, classier,

138
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,833
and smarter than
that bevy of beauties!

139
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,083
You, the legendary
Moka Akashiya!

140
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,833
Wait! Quit it!

141
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,125
What are you doing?!

142
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,333
No, stop, please
don't touch me there!

143
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,958
What the hell's
with those freshmen...?!

144
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,625
One minute they're pawing
all over me and then

145
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,958
they're going gaga over Moka!

146
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,541
Um, hey, are you alright?

147
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,875
Tsukune?

148
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,208
Hello?

149
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,041
Ya-hoo-hoo!

150
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,666
I'm in the same
class with Tsukune;

151
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,458
it'll be just like
last year again!

152
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,708
Well, not exactly, because
this year I get to be in

153
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,708
the same homeroom
as all of you!

154
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,833
It's so great that
we're all together at last!

155
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,125
'Morning, students!

156
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,083
I hope you had
an enjoyable break!

157
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,458
Wha?!

158
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,125
Miss Nekonome's our homeroom
teacher this year, too?!

159
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,416
That's right, I sure am!

160
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,125
Welcome back to
Yokai Academy, everyone!

161
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,708
Well, let me hear it, class...

162
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,833
Are we gonna have the best
school year ever or what?!

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,625
Well hello again, folks!

164
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,583
That concludes all the
explanatory set-up for

165
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,458
any idiot who hasn't watched
the first season whee -...!

166
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,083
Stop, I can't breathe!

167
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,666
If you kill me, who's gonna...

168
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,958
Now that that's out of the way,
I've got another job for you.

169
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,666
What are you doing here?

170
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,458
Wow, this place is a madhouse.

171
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,750
Maybe things'll calm down
after the entrance ceremony

172
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,916
for all the new students.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,541
Yeah.

174
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:01,958
What are these?!

175
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,833
I got some, too!

176
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,708
Maybe they're fan letters
from those new girls you met.

177
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,083
Yeah, I bet you're right.

178
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,333
Huh, it looks like
I got some, too.

179
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,708
What's it say?

180
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,750
"Greetings! Dear Miss
Mizore... You and I have

181
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,375
a great deal in common. In other
words, I'm a stalker, too.

182
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,416
How 'bout we both spy on each
other from afar sometime...?

183
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,375
Stalk ya later."

184
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,166
I bet you've got
some too, Moka.

185
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,583
I doubt it, but I'll
check. Agh...!

186
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,333
Woh, Moka?

187
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,791
These are all
from Moka's fans?!

188
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,125
Alright, way to go, Moka!

189
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,208
I don't know how I'm supposed
to read all these letters...

190
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,375
That sure is one
weird-looking envelope.

191
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,875
Well, I'm sure the person who
wrote it wanted it to stand out

192
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,708
a bit; you know, so that
Moka would notice it

193
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,166
out of all of the others?

194
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,791
it... says...

195
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,333
"To my dearest and most
beloved Moka Akashiya...

196
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,166
Not a single day goes
by where you are not

197
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,416
in my thoughts or the
center of my attention."

198
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,208
Wow, it sounds like
she's a really big fan!

199
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,916
Yeah, especially if she's
thinking about you that much!

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
"And now, at long last... I'm
finally getting the opportunity

201
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,625
to meet you in person...
I'm bursting with excitement

202
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:19,958
at the thought of it."

203
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,041
Aw, she writes the sweetest
things, doesn't she?

204
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,041
Of course; she's a
pure-hearted girl, unlike you.

205
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,625
What was that?!

206
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,708
"And at the upcoming entrance
ceremony for new students..."

207
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,041
"I'm going to rush to
your side... and that's when

208
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,875
I'm going to end your life."

209
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,333
Hey, she said she's
gonna end your life...

210
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,791
Isn't that cute?

211
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,708
What?!

212
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,666
It's gonna be okay, Moka.

213
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,041
I'm sure that letter
was just a prank.

214
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,416
But still...

215
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,666
I'm scared...

216
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,250
I really am.

217
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,916
Well, Kurumu and I are
gonna go try to recruit

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,208
some new members
for the Newspaper Club.

219
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,000
In that case, I'll go, too.

220
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,625
No, it's okay
don't worry about it

221
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,375
After getting that creepy
letter, I'm sure you're not

222
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,583
feeling up to doing
anything right now.

223
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,000
Hey, where's our
club president?

224
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,958
Shouldn't Gin be involved
with the recruiting?

225
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,750
He's probably somewhere
taking dirty pictures

226
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,791
of unsuspecting girls...!

227
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,708
Gross!

228
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,875
So this is the
school dorm, huh?

229
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,833
It looks like
a nice and roomy place!

230
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,666
I'm sure that we're all
gonna have tons of fun here!

231
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,750
Slim pickin's so far...

232
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,541
I'm not seein many
sexy babes to shoot yet.

233
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,458
Whoa, look at those
knee socks...!

234
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,250
Those are gonna make for
some nice glossy pics...!

235
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,750
That's no ordinary
chick, no way.

236
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,500
Hey, you...!

237
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,416
Want an eyeful?!

238
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I'll give you one!

239
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,958
No, wait!

240
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,958
I really should be helping
the girls with the recruiting.

241
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,208
No, like Yukari said, you
don't need to worry about

242
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,208
that right now...
But if it makes you feel

243
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,375
any better, I'll stop by
later and help them out.

244
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,541
Hey there...!

245
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,375
Tsukune!

246
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,791
Moka!

247
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,666
Rubi?!

248
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,416
Hey, what are you doing here?

249
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,958
It's a long story...

250
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,958
But right now, I'm working for
The Director and helping out

251
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,166
wherever there's a need.

252
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,625
Um...

253
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,750
Isn't that the same thing
you said to Moka last time?

254
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,750
Yes...

255
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,958
But it is a long story.

256
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,583
Whoa, check it out, Moka.

257
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,666
Those look really
good, don't they?

258
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,708
Wow, they sure do!

259
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,958
What's one doing here?!

260
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,291
"Dearest Moka... At long
last I've arrived here

261
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,083
at Yokai Academy... I'm
looking forward to tomorrow's

262
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,333
entrance ceremony...
Because that's the day that

263
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,208
I'm going to end your
life once and for all...

264
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,708
Heh heh heh."

265
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,125
Hey, Rubi...!

266
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,250
Did you happen
to see who dropped

267
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,958
this bat-shaped letter here?!

268
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:05,958
See...

269
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,583
There was so much
that happened...

270
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,500
So much so that I can't
do it any justice.

271
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,166
Join the Baseball Club!

272
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,833
Hey, guys, come and join us
in the Swimming Club...!

273
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,791
Our president's
a total hottie...!

274
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,666
She smells like fish, though!

275
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,916
Ya like ghosts...?!

276
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,375
Come take pictures of 'em
in the Photo Club!

277
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,166
Hi, we're the Newspaper Club!

278
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,708
Please take a free copy... here

279
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,333
Oh, cool, I'll take one then.

280
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,208
Whoa...

281
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,041
This looks really professional.

282
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,250
Ya know, this might be
a club worth joining.

283
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,375
Hey, did you hear that?

284
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,583
I think we're a hit!

285
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,958
Ya-hoo-hoo...!

286
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,666
At this rate, we'll probably
recruit a whole bunch

287
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,250
of new members!

288
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,083
What's with this stupid paper?

289
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,250
Huh?

290
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,000
Who wrote it,
kindergarteners...?

291
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,166
Talk about lame.

292
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,250
I'll show you lame, you
freshman brat; get back here!

293
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,583
Um, excuse me...

294
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,750
Your paper...

295
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,166
--Could I have a copy?
--Me, too!

296
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,583
Yes, please, help yourselves,
there's plenty of copies

297
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,166
to go around.

298
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,500
Hey! Where'd that freshman go?!

299
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,291
I should be helping.

300
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,125
No...

301
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,125
You need to take it easy...

302
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,833
'Kay, Moka?

303
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,916
Tsukune...! Your back!

304
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,125
Huh?

305
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,541
How long has this been here?!

306
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,833
"Dearest Moka...
It's almost time...

307
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,916
I'm already on campus
and I'm waiting nearby."

308
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,791
"The entrance ceremony...
That day, my beloved Moka...

309
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,041
...will be your last one alive."

310
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,000
Nooo!

311
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,208
Moka!

312
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,291
I feel bad for her...

313
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,291
Poor Moka...

314
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,375
She was scared
out of her mind.

315
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,583
Moka...

316
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,083
Tsukune!

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh, Moka...

318
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,916
Tsukune...

319
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,708
Oh, Moka...

320
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,416
Tsukune...

321
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,083
Oh, Moka...

322
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,916
Oh, Tsukune...

323
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,916
I really enjoy spying
on you every night

324
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,625
before I hit the sack.

325
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,333
Hmm?

326
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,208
I wonder which room it is?

327
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,583
Hey, you over there.

328
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,416
Just who the hell are you?

329
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,875
Look, I don't know who it is
that you're spying on...

330
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,750
but you really shouldn't be
sneaking around out here

331
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,875
like that.

332
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,916
Yeah, well what are you doing?!

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,541
Me? Well, I...

334
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,041
You see... I was trying
to look at this cute guy

335
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,541
that I have a thing for.

336
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,916
Hah...!

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,500
Guess that makes you a
stalker then, doesn't it...?

338
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,750
You sicko!

339
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,791
Whoever you are,
you just got on my bad side!

340
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,791
 See yah!

341
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,666
Whoa, I can't believe
she dodged my attack...!

342
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,958
Good morning, Moka.

343
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,125
Oh, thanks a lot, but
I really don't know what's

344
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,041
so good about it, Tsukune...

345
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,666
Uh...! you alright...?!

346
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,041
Is something wrong?!

347
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,583
Holy crap!

348
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,916
When did you get all those?!

349
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,750
They arrived last night...

350
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,041
Excuse me, Moka?

351
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,458
Um, yes?

352
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,333
This just came for you.

353
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,250
I think it's a
letter or something.

354
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,625
Huh?

355
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,125
Moka, you home?

356
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,791
Yes, coming!

357
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:02,958
Here, this is yours.

358
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,083
It was just delivered for you.

359
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,458
Huh?!

360
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:08,875
Moka?

361
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,375
Not again!

362
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,291
This letter just arrived
for you via special delivery.

363
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,500
It was like that all night...

364
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,333
A new one showed up
every ten minutes.

365
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,291
I hardly got any sleep...

366
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,708
This is nuts!

367
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,875
Oh, Tsukune...!

368
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,750
What am I gonna do?!

369
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,500
I promise everything's
gonna be okay, Moka.

370
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't worry;
no matter what happens,

371
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,541
I will find a way
to protect you!

372
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,416
The entrance ceremony's
about to take place...

373
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
This is when the letter-writer
said they'd strike!

374
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,375
We've all gotta
protect Moka, guys!

375
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,125
You can count me in!

376
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,708
Well...

377
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,791
Things would get pretty boring
if my main rival got bumped off.

378
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,583
So I'll be happy to lend a hand.

379
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,291
Heh...

380
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,833
you'll "lend a hand"...

381
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,166
I'll bet you would.

382
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,458
You can cram it,
you cold-blooded creep!

383
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,375
Oh...

384
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,958
I almost forgot
to mention it...

385
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,291
But speaking of creeps, I saw
this weird stalker last night,

386
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,375
you guys.

387
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,916
What'd they look like?

388
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,458
Well, she was a girl...

389
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,666
And she had this
crazy bright-orange hair...

390
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,333
Did you say orange hair?!

391
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,416
That'll teach you
pervs to ogle me!

392
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Losers!

393
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,375
Losers?!

394
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,625
Us?!

395
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,708
Do you think you're so
cute we're gonna let you

396
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,166
get away with saying that?

397
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,125
You're the ones trying to
get away with something,

398
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,416
but unlike me,
you're ugly as sin.

399
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
--Ugly as sin?!
--What...?!

400
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,875
No girl talks to us
that way, skank!

401
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,291
Now I'm really pissed off...!

402
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,041
Do you know what Yokai Academy
Rule Number One is...?!

403
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,000
It says "Except in
special circumstances,

404
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,041
as long as you're on campus,
you must always remain

405
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,083
in your human form!"

406
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,083
You insulting us is
a special circumstance!

407
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,875
What's the hell's
going on in here...?!

408
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,000
Miss Nekonome,
what just happened?!

409
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,041
I don't know what set it off,
but one of the new girls

410
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,125
has picked a fight with two new
-- and I might add, big -- boys!

411
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,666
Run all you want, baby!

412
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,916
You're not
gettin' away from us!

413
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,208
If you goons think you can
catch me, go ahead and try!

414
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,625
Wait, that voice!

415
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,458
Yeah, it's that snotty
freshman girl from yesterday!

416
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,416
Think you can get away with
dissin' A-Class monsters

417
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,750
like us, huh?

418
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,750
Wow, you guys really are
losers if you're bragging

419
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,250
about being A-Class!

420
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,166
What?!

421
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,041
It's that girl with
the orange hair!

422
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,250
She's the stalker
I saw last night.

423
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,041
You're gonna get it, you tease!

424
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,250
Once we get ahold of you, you're
gonna regret mouthing off!

425
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,375
Please, you're way too slow...!

426
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,666
I've seen paint dry faster
than you two sacks of crap!

427
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,541
Yep, that's her, alright...!

428
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,416
I know those knee socks!

429
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
She's the girl in this picture!

430
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,250
As the only teacher
who's currently here,

431
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,250
I've got to put an end
to this and quickly!

432
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:53,791
Damn!

433
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:54,791
Where is she?!

434
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,083
Rwarr!

435
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:56,875
Ahem.

436
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,416
Testing, one, two, three.

437
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,833
Testing, one, two, three...

438
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,625
Um, all freshmen...

439
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,458
Would you please take
your seats and also refrain

440
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,458
--from destroying the gymnasium?
--Shove it, Teach!

441
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,375
Moka, it's too
dangerous in here...

442
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,333
I need to get you
to someplace safe.

443
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,833
That girl being chased...

444
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,958
The loud one with
the bright orange hair...

445
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,375
Uh, what?

446
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,041
What's she doing here?

447
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,083
Moka...

448
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,791
Come on, we've gotta
get out of here.

449
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,333
When the rosary seal
over her breast is removed...

450
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:04,333
Moka's innocent self vanishes...
and her inner vampire awakens!

451
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,041
Oh, you again!

452
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,375
It's been a long time...

453
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,750
Tsukune.

454
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,708
Yeah...

455
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,333
Putting that aside...

456
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,625
This fight is ridiculous.

457
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,125
Hey, what the hell is this...?!

458
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,125
You feel all that
incredible power?!

459
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,791
It's comin' from
that woman there!

460
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,875
Whoa, who the heck's that?!

461
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,333
She's got blood-red eyes!

462
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,333
And tons of monster energy!

463
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,750
Guys, wait a minute...

464
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,791
Do you think she's a legendary
"S" Class Supermonster?!

465
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,333
A Vampire?!

466
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,250
She's an "S" Class?!

467
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,250
Yeah, man, I think she is!

468
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,375
Oh, wow!

469
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,583
She's super-scary...

470
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,125
but so cool!

471
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,916
Out of all the older students
here, she's my new favorite!

472
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,333
I wanna be her!

473
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,708
Me, too, 'cause she's
the real deal...!

474
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:57,041
We're your biggest fans,
o' vampire goddess!

475
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,333
Listen up!

476
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,833
All of you here are
in high school now...

477
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,041
So start acting like it, okay?

478
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,583
And knock it off!

479
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,708
Yeah!

480
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,833
Well, am I making myself clear?

481
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,250
Yes, ma'am!

482
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,625
Are you okay, Moka...?

483
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,125
What happened?

484
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,500
She pushed herself too hard
and was beat to begin with.

485
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,083
Well, I guess the entrance
ceremony can finally go off

486
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,583
as planned now.

487
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,041
But who is that girl?

488
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,375
Yeah...!

489
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,500
That's what I wanna know...!
It seems like we've

490
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,250
all run into her before.

491
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,333
Well uh...

492
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,333
I know her...

493
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,333
Wait, you do?

494
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,541
Who is she?

495
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,291
Her worst nightmare.

496
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,500
It's been a really long
time, hasn't it, Moka?

497
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,833
What'd you think of all
those letters I sent...?

498
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,500
Did you manage
to read 'em all?

499
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,583
I busted my bat butt to
deliver all of 'em, whee...!

500
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,666
Now how 'bout
a little praise, whee?

501
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,750
We're not gonna
let you hurt Moka!

502
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:30,791
Everyone...

503
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:31,875
Run away.

504
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,500
What; why?

505
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,833
'Cause that girl...

506
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,000
She's my-...

507
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,458
Well...

508
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,458
I said I was gonna take your
life and now it's time...

509
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:40,833
Big Sister.

510
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,833
What...?!

511
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,208
Big Sister?!

512
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,125
That girl's...

513
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,708
her sister?!

514
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,750
Please help me, Tsukune...!

515
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,750
Why suck my blood now?!

516
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,333
And worse, it's
"to be continued!"

517
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,500
Tsukune, I got
another scary letter!

518
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,875
Let me see it, Moka...!

519
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:45,000
Wait, it says they're gonna
cut off your electricity

520
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,333
'cause you haven't
paid the bill!

521
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh?

522
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:47,916
That's all...?

523
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,166
Next time...

524
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,958
"Little Sister and
a Vampire,"...and another!
