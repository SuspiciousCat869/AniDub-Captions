1
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,083
The academy I was
approaching was

2
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,458
an enigma shrouded
in secrecy...

3
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,166
But even so,
I refused to be afraid...

4
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,541
Scaredy-cat...! Get Up...!

5
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,916
Where's all that
bravado you just had?!

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,416
Oh, you're going to
visit Tsukune's school?

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,583
That's right!

8
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,583
Well, in that case,
I'll make some of

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,958
Tsukune's favorite rice balls.

10
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,041
You don't mind bringing
them to him, do you, Kyoko?

11
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,416
This isn't a social visit!

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,666
Uh...

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,791
Tsukune's friends from
school had weird powers;

14
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,291
he might be in danger!

15
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,666
Kyoko, we've already
had this conversation.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,583
You must have just dreamed that
those girls had strange powers.

17
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,041
I'm sure of what I saw, Auntie!

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,916
And that's why I'm
got to get to the bottom

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,791
of things here at
this weird school!

20
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,250
Move it!

21
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,583
Get outta my way now!

22
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,041
Huh?!

23
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,041
Yee-owch!

24
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,250
Hey, what the
hell were you doin'

25
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,625
just standin' there
like an idiot?!

26
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,750
We don't have
time for this, whee!

27
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:26,916
Yeah...
You're right!

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,041
We just got our hands
on a secret weapon

29
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,916
that's gonna bring
my big sister back!

30
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:37,041
Wait, was that a bat talking
to that girl just now...?!

31
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,500
And speaking of which,

32
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,375
I'm pretty sure that I've
seen her somewhere before...

33
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,375
Those bells!

34
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,375
I'd better get going!

35
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:51,583
♪ opening song ♪

36
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,041
So this is Yokai Academy...?
I thought it would be modern,

37
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,708
but it looks more
like a gothic building

38
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,958
out of the Middle Ages!

39
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,041
What the--?

40
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,375
Tsukune!

41
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,375
Hey, wait!

42
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,833
Tsuki!

43
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,791
--Anyway, like I was saying...
--Tsuki!

44
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:41,666
Hey, there, cous-...!

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,250
Tsukune!

46
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,750
Take a look at this!

47
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm wearing it because I
heard this maid outfit is all

48
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,958
the rage with girls
in the human world...!

49
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,833
And I'd be happy to serve
you any way at any time...

50
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,458
My incredibly sexy master!

51
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,333
No, I'm the only one who's
gonna be serving Tsuku--...!

52
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,625
No, I am.

53
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,625
It's those same girls again...!

54
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,916
I thought there was
something strange about

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,208
them when we first met,
and this confirms it...!

56
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,333
Why are all of
them fawning over

57
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,750
Tsukune like that
in the hallway...?!

58
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,291
What kind of school
would allow that?!

59
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,625
Oh, my God, Yokai Academy
must be some kind

60
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,000
of training school for
workers in the sex trade!

61
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,666
It has to be, because that's the
only explanation why all those

62
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,041
cute girls would be
throwing themselves

63
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,125
at Tsukune like that!

64
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,875
Fight...!

65
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,416
Alright, come on,
you guys, calm down.

66
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,333
--There's no reason to fight.
--We're all friends here...

67
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,333
I'm tired of you and your

68
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,500
gi-normous jugs
getting in my way!

69
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,750
This situation is
just way too weird...

70
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,458
Maybe I should forget this
place and these rice balls

71
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,791
and just leave.

72
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,708
You wouldn't happen to be
my new master would you?

73
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,875
Don't call me master

74
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,458
I'm not one of those
tramps over there...

75
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,958
But...

76
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,583
If I was dressed in
one of those maid outfits,

77
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,000
I'd be way cuter than any
of those hookers in training!

78
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:56,791
Um, Master?

79
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,250
What?!

80
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:05,958
A mirror...? How did Auntie's
rice balls turn into a mirror?!

81
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,875
What's this?

82
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,208
Some of the yummiest
Rice balls I've ever had, whee!

83
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,166
That's not the damn point!

84
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,416
So nice to meet you...!
My name is Lilith,

85
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,125
and I'm the spirit
of this mirror...

86
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,416
And I'm guessing that you
must be my new master, right?

87
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,708
This is too freaky;
it's like something

88
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,833
out of a scary
movie or a TV show!

89
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:32,875
That's it!

90
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,041
That must be what's
going on here!

91
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,083
I'm getting punk'd on some

92
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,916
crazy hidden-camera
show, aren't I?!

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Huh?

94
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,625
But how'd they
pull this effect off?

95
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,166
It looks way too
real to be a prop.

96
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,083
I wonder if it's
some kind of CGI?

97
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,375
Um...

98
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,291
Oh, I see, Master,
you're just a regular human,

99
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,333
so you probably haven't seen
too many monsters before.

100
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,291
"Monsters?!"
That's pretty funny.

101
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,750
Well, I guess this is obviously
a comedy show, isn't it?

102
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,125
I'm being serious;
can't you tell that I'm real...?

103
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,583
Great, my new master's
a total moron!

104
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,750
Say hi to Dracula and
Frankenstein for me...

105
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,041
But I've gotta admit, this
is a pretty funny idea...

106
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,750
Watch, I'll prove
this isn't a joke!

107
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,458
Look, I just got my hands
on another hot video of Moka!

108
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,250
Alright!

109
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,041
Way to go!

110
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,541
Um, excuse me, guys?!

111
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,833
Huh?

112
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,041
You know, I've got a
thing for small chicks...

113
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,458
I don't, but I could
learn to have one...

114
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,375
Uh... Thanks,

115
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,625
but do you guys think you could

116
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,041
do me a teensy favor and
look into this mirror?

117
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,541
Huh?

118
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,000
What the hell just happened?!

119
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,208
It changed us into
our monster forms!

120
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,500
And on campus!

121
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,000
We're gonna get suspended!

122
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,500
See, look at those guys.

123
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,000
They were making
themselves appear human,

124
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,666
but they're actually monsters.

125
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,166
But this mirror of mine here
shows a monster's true nature,

126
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,458
and once they
look inside of it,

127
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,500
their transformation
magic undoes itself.

128
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,041
Those are best
special effects ever!

129
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,541
So the kids only dress
up like monsters here...!

130
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,083
But even so,

131
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,500
that only makes this school
even more suspicious to me...!

132
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,500
There's still something really
weird about this place!

133
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,500
My cousin Tsuki goes to
this school, so I don't care

134
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,625
what it takes,
I've gotta get to the

135
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,750
bottom of what
this joint's about!

136
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,916
Okay then...

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,958
So that's what you
wish for, eh, Master...?

138
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,083
Well, your wish is my command.

139
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,541
Huh?

140
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,291
This stuff weighs a ton!

141
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,500
Why did you have to buy

142
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,375
so many freaking ingredients
anyway, Kurumu?

143
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,208
Because I'm gonna bake
Tsukune a huge cake

144
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,333
that's gonna be yummy-wummy
for his tummy-tummy!

145
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,791
Geez...

146
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,583
Huh?!

147
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,833
Huh...?!
Why's everybody screaming?

148
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,208
Who or what is that?!

149
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,625
Dunno, I've never
seen her before!

150
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,708
Sorry to interrupt, but
I need you to show the world

151
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,875
what hideous monsters
the both of you really are!

152
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,083
Kurumu and Yukari are late;
I wonder where they're at?

153
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,125
Oh, they told me that they were
both gonna go shopping first.

154
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,250
'Kay...

155
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,875
I guess that just
leaves Mizore then.

156
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,500
I feel like we're
forgetting someone else,

157
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,958
but I don't know
who that might be...

158
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:49,833
Careful, Moka!

159
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,125
Here, let me get that for you!

160
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,125
It's okay; I've got it.

161
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,625
Hold on, Moka!

162
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,875
Oh no, you poor thing;
I'm so sorry!

163
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't worry about it.

164
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,208
You're actually
really light, Moka.

165
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,750
Tsukune, I--...!

166
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,500
Thank you very much.

167
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,625
Tsukune?

168
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,375
Yes, Moka?

169
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,916
You smell good...

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,458
Uh...
Moka, no, wait!

171
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,458
Tsukune...!

172
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,208
Sorry to interrupt!

173
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,000
What the?!

174
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:22,791
Rubi?!

175
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,083
What's with that outfit?!

176
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,500
It's a long story, but the
Director assigned me

177
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,541
to serve on academy
patrol detail today!

178
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,000
But that's not as
important as the favor

179
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,583
I need to ask of the
Newspaper Club!

180
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,833
Huh?

181
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,166
You see, a very rare and
important item has been

182
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,250
stolen from the Director's
treasure store and I--

183
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,375
Panties!

184
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,500
Ooh, yeah!

185
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,708
Woo, Moka's wearin'
white ones today!

186
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,166
Gin, please stop doing that!

187
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,458
Hey, Ginei...

188
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,708
You didn't happen
to look into a

189
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,458
strange gold mirror
just now, did you?

190
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,416
If I say yes, will you show
me your panties, too?!

191
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,291
I warned you,...!
No more of this...!

192
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,208
Enough!

193
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,250
Oh, no, what'd I just do?!
Please, don't be dead,!

194
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,333
Does this mean--...?!

195
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,791
Uh, Rubi?!

196
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,625
Just as I feared,
it looks like we're too late.

197
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,208
What the heck's going on here?!

198
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,083
Eat my Twirling Umbrella Attack!

199
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,166
Wait a minute; why's everybody
in their monster forms?!

200
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,791
Did they all decide
to break the rules?!

201
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,250
No, they looked
in Lilith's mirror.

202
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,916
It's a legendary mirror that
emits a very special light...

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,166
When monsters view that light,

204
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,208
everything about them
is completely laid bare.

205
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,750
Their true form
and their true nature.

206
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,875
Unfortunately, someone's
made off with that mirror!

207
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,458
Any idea who it was?

208
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,750
According to eyewitnesses, the
thief had orange hair tied into

209
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,791
pigtails on the sides,
knee-high socks,

210
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,208
and had a really ugly bat
companion with her, too...

211
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,916
That's all that we have.

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,416
Doesn't that sound
just like someone

213
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,958
that you and I know, Moka?

214
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,375
At any rate, we've gotta get
that mirror back immediately!

215
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,166
If we can't contain this flood
of monster energy that's

216
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,541
been unleashed, then the
great barrier that surrounds

217
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,041
Yokai Academy could be
very well be annihilated!

218
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,333
Uhh...

219
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,208
It even got Miss Nekonome!

220
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,583
I'm gonna go look
for the others!

221
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,458
Please be careful!

222
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,250
Right...

223
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,250
I understand.

224
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,791
Thank you...

225
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,458
There's been a
strange development.

226
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,083
Lilith's Mirror has
just been spotted,

227
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,625
but it's in the hands
of a human girl.

228
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,750
Apparently, she wandered
onto campus somehow.

229
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,458
Oh wait, did you just
say a human girl?!

230
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,833
I know it's nuts but
everything's way

231
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,958
too realistic to
be special effects...!

232
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,541
They don't even make
costumes as big as

233
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,791
some of the things I've
seen wandering around...!

234
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,125
And not to mention
the fact that everyone

235
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,041
she shows that mirror
to transforms...

236
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,208
...and that means
that every student

237
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,458
at this school must be a...

238
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,583
muh--...!

239
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,916
Oh, come on, what's the problem?

240
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,250
Isn't this exactly what
you wished for, Master...?

241
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,583
Don't you remember...?

242
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,583
Getting to the bottom of
what this school's about?

243
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,833
Actually, you've
done enough, Lilith.

244
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,416
Maybe we should stop now.

245
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,583
No, Master.

246
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,875
Huh?

247
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,916
There's plenty more
to get to the bottom of...

248
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,041
If you live long
enough to see it!

249
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,750
What's this?

250
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,666
It smells like the scent
of a delicious human girl.

251
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,416
Huh?

252
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,958
What the?

253
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,416
That must be the mirror
that Rubi mentioned!

254
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,958
Hey, Tsukune...

255
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,833
Oh, Kurumu...! I'm so
glad to see you're oka--...

256
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,208
Kurumu?

257
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,625
Tsukune...

258
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,250
I don't know why, but I
feel so hot all of a sudden...

259
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:36,083
You don't mind if
I take this off, do you?

260
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,166
Tsukune, I can't
tell you how much

261
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,250
I love the feeling
of being with you!

262
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,583
Is that so...?! Well, I can't
tell you how much I love

263
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,500
the feeling of your big,
bouncy, bodacious boobs!

264
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,250
Back off, you slut!

265
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,166
If you want to squeeze some
boobs, try mine instead!

266
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,125
Forget Kurumu and
her massive milk jugs!

267
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,291
My tiny, developing
ones are like...

268
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,416
Yukari, we're veering
dangerously close

269
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,708
to kiddie porn
territory...! Uh?!

270
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,333
Well, if it's boobs you
want, I've got some nice,

271
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,208
icy peaks of my own...

272
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,583
They're like two snow-white
mounds of heaven with

273
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,500
little pink cherries on top...

274
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,166
I love cherries!
I want cherries!

275
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,541
Yummy little cherries!
Gimme your cherries now!

276
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,625
Get away from my guy!

277
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,625
Oh, man, this is really bad!

278
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,875
The magic from that
mirror must be making

279
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,583
all of them act
berserk like this!

280
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,291
Tsukune, are you alright?!

281
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,791
Uh... Oh thank God! Someone
who's not been affected.

282
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,500
What would you like
me to do to or for you?

283
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,958
Huh?!

284
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,416
I want you to
command me, Tsukune.

285
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,000
Please, I'll do anything
that you ask of me...

286
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,291
That mirror's turned all of you
into a bunch of sex fiends!

287
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,916
Please, give me a command now.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,583
Uh...

289
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,125
Um...

290
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,458
A command...?

291
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,750
Okay, why don't you tell
me what happened to Moka!

292
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,000
As you command.

293
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,875
The two of us ran off
together trying to chase

294
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,208
down Lilith's Mirror, but at
some point, we got separated.

295
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,208
If Moka were to look
into that mirror,

296
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,916
which side of her would be
revealed to be her true nature?

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,750
Don't you have another
command for me yet?

298
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,625
Uh...

299
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,291
Tsukune!

300
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,958
There's nothing quite like the
taste of a delicious human...

301
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:58,625
Now...

302
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,125
...it's...

303
00:12:59,208 --> 00:12:59,791
...time...

304
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:00,250
...to...

305
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,708
...feast.

306
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,833
No...! Somebody help!

307
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,541
You get away from her!

308
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,875
Is that you, Kyoko?!

309
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:09,791
Moka?!

310
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:10,666
I thought it was!

311
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,833
I'm so glad you're alright!

312
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,041
No, stay away...!
I know what you are!

313
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,208
You're a monster like everybody
else at this place, aren't you?!

314
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,291
Uh...

315
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,750
If you are, then
I don't want you coming

316
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,625
anywhere near me, Moka...!
There's no way I could ever

317
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,375
trust you after
what you've done!

318
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,291
You made us think
you were a human,

319
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,791
but I know what you are now!

320
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,666
Do you think I'm gonna
let my cousin stay at a

321
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,833
place like this and with
monsters like you?!

322
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:33,708
No way!

323
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,333
I'm taking Tsuki home with me!

324
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,791
No, Kyoko, please don't!

325
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:40,375
Well, of all the people to
run into Moka Akashiya,

326
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:44,375
the uppity student who came
between me and Tsukune.

327
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,916
Is that Lilith's Mirror?

328
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,416
You caught me off guard
last year, but this time I've

329
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,333
brought along some
teacher's pets that are

330
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,666
not only obedient,
but hungry, too!

331
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,416
Kyoko?!

332
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,458
If I can get you to it, can you
grab that mirror over there?!

333
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,708
Huh?!

334
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,958
What?!

335
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,541
Are you insane, Moka...?!

336
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,666
Even if there was some way we
could get past those things...

337
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,083
I still wouldn't trust
you at all because

338
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,416
you're one of those
monsters, too!

339
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,791
You're right!

340
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,541
I am a monster that's
posing as a human, Kyoko...

341
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,083
So I really can't blame you
for not believing a word I say.

342
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,250
But listen...

343
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,666
You and I both have
something in common.

344
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,000
Huh?!

345
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,375
I believe in Tsukune
just like you do.

346
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,125
Yes, it's true that
I'm a monster...

347
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,416
But as far as Tsukune goes,
I trust him with all my heart!

348
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,250
And right now, Kyoko, I need you
to trust me so we can stop this

349
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,458
madness and save
Tsukune before it's too late!

350
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,250
Come with me, Kyoko!

351
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,291
You've gotta trust me on this!

352
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,666
Save the human girl for me!

353
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,000
Ahhh!

354
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,291
I can't believe I'm doing this!

355
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,666
Got it!

356
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,750
No, stop it!

357
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,791
Let me go!
Hey, what's the big idea?!

358
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,625
Now, Kyoko!
The mirror!

359
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,375
Right here!

360
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,833
Master?!

361
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,708
Alright, now it's my turn!

362
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,333
Do your thing, mirror!

363
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,875
I've just about had
it with you two!

364
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,541
Pi r squared, boys!

365
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,416
Moka, hurry up!

366
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,541
So she used the mirror to
bring me out without having

367
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,333
to take off the rosary;
I've gotta admit

368
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,500
that my other self
is pretty clever.

369
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,791
You, however, are pretty stupid.

370
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,375
Just what gives you to
right to go around

371
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,833
exposing people's true natures?

372
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,708
This does!

373
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,125
You...
it can't be...

374
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,333
Well, well...

375
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,791
I guess this is the
first chance we've ever

376
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,541
had to meet face-to-face
now, isn't it?

377
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,750
Apparently, you have
two true natures,

378
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,833
and they were both
brought out by my mirror!

379
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,708
This is too weird!

380
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,750
I...

381
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,291
...feel weak all of a sudden...

382
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,166
Just stay down and
wait this one out...

383
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,500
I'll take care of the
pipsqueak here.

384
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,083
No, wait!

385
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,083
You're not the only ones who can
transform into something else!

386
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,750
You used the mirror on yourself
to unlock your own powers,

387
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,041
but what are you?

388
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,041
A powerful and sacred
Shinto spirit

389
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,583
who's the soul of a
treasured antique item!

390
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,583
Not only that, but you'll
find me impossible to beat!

391
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,583
How could such a
weak attack stop me?!

392
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,958
It's because the two of you
always shared a single body,

393
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,666
and when you split it up, your
strength halved as well, moron!

394
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,666
No, come back!

395
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,291
We need to recombine
our bodies!

396
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,541
Stay out of this!

397
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,041
But...!

398
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,250
Listen up Moka, you said you
trusted Tsukune, didn't you?

399
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,250
You can trust Tsukune all that
you want, but you're not

400
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,541
strong enough to protect him
on your own now, are you?

401
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:18,041
Let's cut the crap
and get on with it!

402
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,958
Given your state,
even a little pipsqueak

403
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,666
like me can defeat
a vampire, huh?!

404
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,166
My body feels so heavy...

405
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,875
We're not gonna let that happen!

406
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,000
We're here, Moka...!
Wait, what the hell?!

407
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,416
Both Mokas together?!

408
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,291
Tsukune!

409
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,333
Glad you could make it!

410
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,625
Yeah, so am I, 'Cuz!

411
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,625
What the?!

412
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,833
Kyoko?!
What are you doing here?!

413
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,375
Impossible!

414
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,541
How did you manage to break
free from the mirror's power?!

415
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,166
Sorry to disappoint
you, Tinkerbell,

416
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,541
but my boyfriend freed us...!

417
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,541
His name's Tsukune Aono!

418
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,666
What?!

419
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,541
Whoa, Tsuki saved you guys?!

420
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,375
How'd you do it?

421
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,666
Oh, Tsukune!

422
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,166
You can always count on me!

423
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,541
I'll take such good
of you Tsukune...

424
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,875
Come on, you've
gotta pick one of us

425
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,666
to be a replacement for Moka.

426
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,791
Huh?

427
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,166
--Please pick me!
--Please pick me!

428
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,041
I can't.

429
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,458
--Huh?!
--Why?!

430
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,041
Because, honestly, none of you
could ever replace Moka.

431
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,833
Please, I'd be much
better than Moka

432
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,958
because I love you
more than she does!

433
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,875
And I feel the same
way about all of you.

434
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,041
Uh?!

435
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,500
Just like Moka,
no one in the world

436
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,291
could ever replace any of you.

437
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:21,750
It was nothing...

438
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,958
Really, it was no big deal...

439
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,458
You bastard!

440
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,250
I guess the light
wasn't strong enough!

441
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,583
Well, in that case, I'll just
have to use a stronger one!

442
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,416
That's not gonna work this time!

443
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,833
This way we don't hafta
look into the mirror at all!

444
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,500
Clever huh? I thought it up

445
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,541
and call it the
Yahoo-hoo-hoo blindfold!

446
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,500
That name really sucks, Kurumu.

447
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,208
Yeah, well so do you...! You
guys ready to do this thing?!

448
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:45,916
Ready!

449
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,125
Yeah, let's do it!

450
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,791
Bring it!

451
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,875
I shoulda asked this before...

452
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,000
...how do we take her
down if we can't see her?

453
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:58,916
--Huh?!
--Huh?!

454
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,541
Crap...!
That's a good question!

455
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,958
Oh...

456
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,416
...we never discussed
anything past the blindfolds.

457
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,958
What a bunch of idiots...!

458
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,666
You won't even see the
killing blow coming!

459
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,708
Left thirty degrees!

460
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,583
Distance ten meters!

461
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,666
Right...! Thanks!

462
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,833
I think that it's
well past time...

463
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,125
...for you to learn your place!

464
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,458
Yeah!

465
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,208
Why was learning
my place so painful...

466
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,416
Alright, we did it!

467
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,666
We defeated the bad
guy instead of Moka.

468
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,375
I didn't need
their help, Tsukune.

469
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,500
Moka?!

470
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,583
Are you okay?!
Are you hurt?!

471
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,458
I'm fine thanks to you.

472
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,333
Huh?

473
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,333
Uh...

474
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,666
Thanks so much
for trusting me...

475
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,500
That was a brave
thing for you to do.

476
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,583
Uh...

477
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,125
Oh, come on, you
don't have to thank me.

478
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,625
I really didn't
do anything at all.

479
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,958
Hey, Big Sister!

480
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,041
Now that the real you is back,
I'm never gonna let you go!

481
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,916
Great, another little
pest to deal with!

482
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,208
If we wrap it back up in
this cloth, Lilith's Mirror

483
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,916
should be rendered
completely ineffective.

484
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,583
Then let's hurry and get back
into the same body again.

485
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,583
What?!

486
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,375
Big Sis!

487
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,666
Hold on!

488
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,625
I don't understand what
you said back there...

489
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,083
Tell me!

490
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,666
You'll have to figure
that out on your own.

491
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,916
Uh...!

492
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,333
Go on, do it!

493
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,208
Okay, right!

494
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,500
No, please wait!

495
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,666
Huh?

496
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,500
What happened...?!
Pi r squared!

497
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,166
Meow?

498
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,541
The real Moka's
gone now, isn't she?

499
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,625
Why'd you have
to screw up my plan?!

500
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,500
"Your plan?" I guess that
makes you the thief

501
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,375
who stole Lilith's
Mirror, doesn't it?

502
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,333
Me and my big mouth!

503
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,000
You're going straight to
the secret underground

504
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,666
detention hall, where you can
think about what you've done.

505
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,166
Man, what a day.

506
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,708
Um, hey, Tsuki?

507
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,000
Uh!

508
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,416
Look, Kyoko, I can
explain all the

509
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,541
crazy stuff you saw
here, I swear!

510
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,708
Just tell me this...

511
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,750
Do you like going to
this school, Tsuki?

512
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,208
Uh...

513
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,125
You heard me...

514
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,125
Do you like going
to this school?

515
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:16,666
Yeah...

516
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,916
Of course, I do.

517
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,208
I've got so many wonderful
friends here that

518
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,125
I wouldn't want to go to
school anywhere else!

519
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,250
Okay then.

520
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,416
Huh?!

521
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,416
If you're happy here,
then this place's

522
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,041
secret is safe with me...

523
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,000
And if you trust them, then I
guess I trust your friends, too.

524
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,250
Um, sorry, but just to
set the record straight,

525
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,958
they're the friends
and I'm the girlfriend...

526
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,041
Isn't that correct, Tsukune?

527
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,375
No, it's not, and it never
will be, you big, smelly sow...!

528
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,041
Sorry, Lilith's Mirror
must still be affecting me!

529
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,500
Well my hand's
affected by spank-itis!

530
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,583
That was actually an
insult to all sows.

531
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,166
What did you just say?!

532
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,375
Whoa, guys, come on, calm down,
please! Kurumu, stop spanking!

533
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,000
I wonder if it really is
like the other me said...?

534
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,958
That I'm not strong enough on
my own to keep Tsukune safe.

535
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,500
You can trust Tsukune all that
you want, but you're not

536
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,541
strong enough to protect him
on your own now, are you?

537
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,125
The fact that she'd even
say something like that...

538
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,875
That must mean...

539
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,833
...that the other me
feels the same way!

540
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,875
She must love Tsukune, too.

541
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,083
Hey, what are you, a gigolo?!

542
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,041
--Tsukune... what's going on?!
--Tsukune... what's going on?!

543
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,041
Don't let that
be what I think it is!

544
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,416
No, it's happening even
faster than we feared!

545
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:46,625
Look up there!

546
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,083
Huh?!

547
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,416
No, the great barrier!

548
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,208
♪ closing song ♪

549
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,583
Oh, no, the great
barrier's breaking up!

550
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:41,916
Leave it to me, meow!

551
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,833
Who are you?!

552
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:43,875
Stand back!

553
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,208
Kitty jump...!

554
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,125
Shoot, I didn't mean to
trip and fall down, meow.

555
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,458
Uh, right...

556
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:52,000
Next time: "Holy Seal and
a Vampire" and another!
