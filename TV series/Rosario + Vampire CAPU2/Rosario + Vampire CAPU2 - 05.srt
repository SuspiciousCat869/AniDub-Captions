1
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, crap!

2
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,250
Yee-ouch!

3
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,458
Not again...

4
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,875
I'm just not cut out for this.

5
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,166
No...!

6
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,208
I can't give up!

7
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,041
Push it and pull it
and push it and pull it.

8
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,583
Whoa!

9
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,875
Watch it, Saizo...!

10
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,625
You almost sawed me up!

11
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,000
Man I can't wait...

12
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,458
yeah...

13
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,708
I bet the girls must be in
the middle of cooking class

14
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,916
right now, huh?

15
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
They're probably cooking
up somethin' good,

16
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,541
and I can't wait to sink
my teeth into it, dude!

17
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,708
Today's shot...

18
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,208
No one's got
their head in class...

19
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,000
Not even me.

20
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:06,500
Um...

21
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,875
This is all for you, Tsukune.

22
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,125
I worked really
hard to make it.

23
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,541
All this is for me?

24
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,416
Yeah...

25
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,666
So you'll eat it?

26
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,541
Yes, of course I will;
here goes!

27
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:20,958
Oh, Moka...!

28
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,583
It's delicious!

29
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,541
Push it-...!

30
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,125
Like I told you before...

31
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,000
Watch what
you're doing, okay?!

32
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,583
All right...

33
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,750
Listen up, girls...

34
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,625
Today's dish is
a popular one...

35
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,291
Curry and rice...

36
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,708
That's what it's
commonly known as,

37
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,375
but I'm reluctant to
call it by that name...

38
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,458
In India, where curry
originally comes from,

39
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,375
we only have the Tamil word
karii, which means nothing more

40
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,916
than just "sauce," - hey!

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,875
Geez, she's really fired up
about making curry, isn't she?

42
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,541
I guess you could
say Miss Apsara's

43
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,708
all "hot and
bothered" about it.

44
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,125
This is serious,
so pay attention you two!

45
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,375
For spices...

46
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,833
Add plenty of red and
black pepper and ginger.

47
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,125
Ya-hoo-hoo!

48
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,875
I'm spicing up my curry with
aphrodisiacs, love potions,

49
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,666
and sexual
performance enhancers!

50
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,208
Sounds yummy...

51
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,583
Hey, Yukari...

52
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,083
Green curry, huh...?

53
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,000
That's Thai-style curry,
isn't it?

54
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,416
Sure is...!

55
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,583
But I've added frogs and lizards
and grasshopper extract

56
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,250
to make it even tastier!

57
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,166
Uh...

58
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,250
Don't believe me?

59
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,666
Then why don't you
give it a try...!

60
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,375
It's full of magical
goodness and I'm sure

61
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,291
you'll love it Moka!

62
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,125
Okay...

63
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,458
It is the polite thing...

64
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,750
It's not spicy enough.

65
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,875
But if I make it any spicier,
it'll be too hot to eat!

66
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,583
Don't be ridiculous,
Miss Sendo!

67
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,708
Cooking is art...!

68
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:39,916
Art is explosion!

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,625
That means spicy...!

70
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,416
Right...?!

71
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,250
'Kay?!

72
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,083
No stop it...!

73
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,375
It'll be too hot!

74
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,583
But that's exactly
what we want here!

75
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,875
Hot and spicy is
what curry is all about!

76
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,750
Hey everyone!

77
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,125
I have meat, spices,
vegetables and flour,

78
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,416
and all the other ingredients,
so if anyone starts

79
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,041
--running out...
--Rubi?!

80
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,333
Um, let me guess; you're
helping out Miss Apsara today?

81
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,916
Yes...

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,458
Actually, I'm taking remedial
cooking classes, but that's...

83
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,708
It's a long story, right?

84
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,916
Uh huh...

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,208
A very long one, in fact...

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,500
Big Sis...!

87
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,958
You're supposed to be a
vampire, so what are you doing

88
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,208
cooking with those
lesser monsters?!

89
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,375
Come on!

90
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,208
Where's your Supermonster
Vampire pride?!

91
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,833
Have you forgotten that?!

92
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:31,958
Hey!

93
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,750
What do you think
you're doing here?!

94
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,708
I should be asking you that...

95
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,541
This is one of
my peeping spots...

96
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,625
Number three hundred
and forty, to be exact,

97
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,041
and one of my favorites.

98
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,958
I shoulda guessed,
you stalker.

99
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,041
Well you're
really one to talk...

100
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,583
You stick to Moka
just like stink on shit.

101
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,916
You're gonna pay for that,
you frozen freak!

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,041
Anybody who dares talk to me
that way gets a taste of this..!

103
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,125
My Ko-buddy hammer!

104
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,000
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.

105
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,791
Kokoa?!

106
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,041
Geez ice queen, are you
peeping in on us again?

107
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,125
Sure you were...

108
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,875
Get in here and
make some curry with us.

109
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,333
Guess I could try...

110
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,916
Oh, wow, this is
really incredible!

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,291
It's hot and spicy
and tastes awesome!

112
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,666
Gimme another plate!

113
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,291
We're glad you like it!

114
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,250
We worked hard
to make that curry!

115
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,416
Eat lots and lots, okay?

116
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,416
Here, Tsukune...!

117
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,916
Open wide!

118
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,250
Moka, stop...!

119
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,500
You snuck in behind our backs!

120
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,666
No kidding!

121
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,500
Here, Tsukune.

122
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,708
Moka's curry is pretty limp,
but I guarantee that mine'll

123
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,375
put lead in your pencil.

124
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,541
But you've gotta eat
while it's still hot-...!

125
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,291
I wouldn't eat her
curry if I were you;

126
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,416
you don't know where she's
been, but mine is healthy

127
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,125
and hearty and full of protein!

128
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,791
Tsukune, you've gotta start
beefing up your strength some...

129
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,958
if not...

130
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,333
you'll never make it
at this school...

131
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,458
so here, eat up.

132
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,875
Cool it, guys...

133
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,625
If you force that
hot food on him...

134
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,250
He's gonna burn
his tongue off...

135
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,166
Here, I'll blow on it for you.

136
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,875
How's that...? I cooled it off.

137
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,916
Me, too, and right down
to the core!

138
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,791
Oh, that reminds me...!

139
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,166
Mizore made
some curry today, too...

140
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,208
Hey...

141
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,500
You'll be sure
to give it a try...

142
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,458
won't you, Tsukune?

143
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,875
I'd be happy to!

144
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,500
Here it is.

145
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,458
It's full of fresh
vegetables, meat, and rice

146
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,666
that have been flash-frozen
for your delight.

147
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,750
It's my own special recipe,
so please, go ahead and eat up.

148
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,625
Dig in...

149
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,208
Don't be shy about it.

150
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,333
Um, it's not shyness
that's stopping me...

151
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,666
Look, she screwed up
another one.

152
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,166
Again?

153
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,083
Wow, I guess cooking just isn't
a snow woman's cup of tea,

154
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,208
is it, girls?

155
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,333
Oh, well, next month
we are having that

156
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,666
snow skiing tournament in PE...

157
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,291
Maybe she can do something
right for a change during that.

158
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,750
Yeah, she can make it snow,
unless she screws it up

159
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,375
like that curry!

160
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,083
Lay off her, you skanks!

161
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:13,583
Hey, how come she froze
all the rest of us, too?

162
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,000
Mizore, wait!

163
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,291
Oh, great...!

164
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,583
Why can't she just
ignore that kind of stuff?

165
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,916
What's burning?

166
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,583
Oh...

167
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,166
So you finally thawed out.

168
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,208
So tell me, are you
a new student, perhaps?

169
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,750
Huh...? Yeah...

170
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,583
Well, in that case,
allow me to tell you

171
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,166
about the
cooking class I teach.

172
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,833
'Kay...?

173
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,083
Cooking is art...!

174
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,250
And art is explosion!

175
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,333
That means spicy,
of course...!

176
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,250
So then how'd you like
to try this artistic

177
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,125
and explosively spicy curry...?

178
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,875
--Here you go--
--No way.

179
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,166
A high-born Supermonster
vampire like me doesn't

180
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,125
eat low-class food.

181
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:03,750
What...?

182
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,000
Low-class?!

183
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,541
I won't stand for that!

184
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,041
Damn!

185
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,625
Sopping wet and burned to
a crisp; it's just not my day!

186
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,250
Something else you want?!

187
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,541
Spicy!

188
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,750
I don't know why I'm even
trying to do this...

189
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,333
I shoulda known
I wouldn't fit in...

190
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,375
I'm a snow woman...

191
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,958
The only way for us
to live is all alone.

192
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,041
Listen up, snow woman...

193
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,041
Don't go running your
big mouth about dying

194
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,500
until you've actually
tried to live your life.

195
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,833
She was right...

196
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,250
Maybe I should give it
a try for once...

197
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,125
And live my life!

198
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,750
Oh, Tsukune...

199
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,458
Yahoo...!

200
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,791
I claim this
fried goodness for me!

201
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,000
Where's Mizore?

202
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,000
Uh...

203
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,291
I wonder if
she's still upset...

204
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,750
Probably...

205
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,333
Mizore's pretty thin-skinned.

206
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,333
So maybe we should all go and
see her together after school...

207
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,000
to try and cheer her up.

208
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:46,750
Great idea!

209
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,833
Hey, Big Sis!

210
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,666
Namaste!

211
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,708
Kokoa?!

212
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,958
You're being nice?

213
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,500
And she brought...

214
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,750
curry!

215
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,458
That's what you notice?!

216
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,791
I'm sorry...!

217
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,833
I'm always such a pain in
the neck to you guys,

218
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,958
so I thought I'd apologize
by making everyone

219
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,083
this delicious curry for lunch!

220
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,166
Curry up and get it!

221
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,708
Hey, does this mean that
you're not mad at me anymore?!

222
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,875
Yes, and I'm sorry
about everything, Big Sis!

223
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,875
Kokoa...

224
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,791
Big Sister...

225
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,041
Kokoa...

226
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,291
Big Sister...

227
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,708
Come on...!

228
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,250
There's something
weird going on here!

229
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,875
Look at her skin,
and the way she's acting!

230
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:31,500
Hey...

231
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,125
No need to curry!

232
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,916
I'm still ticked off that
we didn't get to try

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,708
some of Moka's curry.

234
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,333
It's all that stupid
snow girl's fault.

235
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,541
Yeah, and while we were
all frozen solid...

236
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,583
That jerk Tsukune
ate the whole thing!

237
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,291
Guys...

238
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,416
This is curry.

239
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,166
This stuff is delicious!

240
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,875
I'm a little late,
but I should still make it

241
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,333
before lunch period ends.

242
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,541
Oh, Tsukune...

243
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,833
I really hope
you'll like my curry...

244
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,958
There's nothin'
to curry about...

245
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,416
Whoa, what the hell
happened to everyone?

246
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,833
What are you currying
in your backpack?

247
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,208
You've gotta let us
curry it instead...

248
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,000
Get back!

249
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,666
This curry's for Tsukune!

250
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,333
Give us your curry!

251
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,958
No, chill out!

252
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,000
What's going on?!

253
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,333
Curry...

254
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,625
Curry...

255
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,250
Curry...

256
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,750
--Must have curry...
--They're yellow, too!

257
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,583
Join us and you can have
yellow skin as well...

258
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,625
Tsukune?!

259
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,708
You see...

260
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,583
It's a really long story...

261
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,125
But one day, he and I are...

262
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,500
You, too?!

263
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:14,958
Vindaloo Curry...

264
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:15,916
Pork Curry...

265
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,666
Ma Po Curry...

266
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,208
I don't understand; why is this
happening to everyone...?!

267
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,000
Tsukune, where are you?!

268
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,791
Tsukune!

269
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:35,583
Here...

270
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,208
Have some curry, Tsukune.

271
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,125
Here...

272
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,041
Have some curry, Moka.

273
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,375
Tsukune...?

274
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,541
And everyone else...?

275
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,208
I smell something.

276
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,375
I'd know it anywhere;
it's curry...!

277
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,208
Curry...

278
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,208
Curry...

279
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,500
Curry...

280
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,541
Curry...

281
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,750
Curry...

282
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,458
Curry...

283
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,916
Cooking is art...!

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,708
Art is explosion...!

285
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,208
That means spicy...!

286
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,625
Go!

287
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,000
Miss Ahp-suh-ruh?!

288
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,708
Miss Shirayuki...

289
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,541
Your skin is still
as white as fallen snow.

290
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,375
That proves without a doubt
that you've yet to be baptized

291
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,291
in my fountain
of specialty curry!

292
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,625
Miss Apsara is an apsara,
a water nymph from

293
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,875
Hindu mythology,
whee, um, I mean curry!

294
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,458
You mean you did this?!

295
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,333
Of course.

296
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,916
I've been sad for so long.

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,833
The world is overflowing
with curries that are

298
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,333
pale imitations
of the real thing.

299
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,583
And that is such a tragedy...!

300
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,916
I wanted everyone to taste
the real thing for once,

301
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,333
and to know the true spiciness
that can't be tasted

302
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,041
in those impostors.

303
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,125
Curry!

304
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:53,958
Give it to me!

305
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,333
I need it right now!

306
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,083
Give me curry!

307
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,416
Please...

308
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,958
Curry's the most important
thing in my life...

309
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,625
I love it!

310
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,708
Your lips...

311
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,875
Look at them...

312
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,000
Your love for curry's
made them swollen.

313
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,333
Curry...!

314
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,791
Give me more curry now...!
I need it...! Please!

315
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,791
I can't get enough!

316
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,708
All right...

317
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,333
Tsukune...

318
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,875
I'll give you some then...

319
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,833
Eat it to your heart's content.

320
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,833
What is that travesty you're
trying to pass off as curry?!

321
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,041
Something only
a snow woman can make.

322
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,583
My light and breezy
shaved ice curry!

323
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,041
Mr. Aono!

324
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,416
Don't you dare touch your lips
to that hideous, false curry!

325
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,708
Go ahead and eat up...

326
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:55,833
here...

327
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,750
I made it for you.

328
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,541
No, don't...! That so-called
curry is a perversion!

329
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,000
But...

330
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,583
It's so good...

331
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,583
No...! It can't be...! There's
no way a curry like that

332
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,916
could taste good!

333
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,458
It's delicious... My taste
buds have been paralyzed

334
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,958
by the hot spiciness...

335
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,250
but this chilled curry has
brought them back to life.

336
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,541
The shaved ice accompaniment
is exquisite.

337
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,708
It melts on the tip of my tongue
like a light, refreshing breeze.

338
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,250
And while the curry itself
leaves a pleasing aftertaste,

339
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:32,000
it's not oppressive, and floats
away like a cloud on the wind.

340
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:36,041
It's a masterpiece!

341
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,291
It's full of ice crystals...

342
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,875
Not even a snow woman can make
those unless her mind's pure...

343
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,416
But I put my all
into it for you.

344
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,166
Thank you so much, Mizore...

345
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,000
That was the most delicious
curry I've ever had.

346
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,500
Why thank you...

347
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,916
Tsukune.

348
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,500
No, I won't allow it!

349
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,208
That curry is a perversion!

350
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,333
So then...! I'm going
to cleanse your mouth

351
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,000
with some authentic
curry, Mr. Aono!

352
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,666
Watch out, Tsukune!

353
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,250
More!

354
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,500
More!

355
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,083
I want you to love
the real curry even more!

356
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,166
Here, let's see
you freeze this one!

357
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,041
Oh, shit...! Tsukune!

358
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,125
Curry!

359
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,125
It's so good!

360
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,458
Oh, Moka!

361
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,833
Wow, Moka...

362
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,333
Even you have yellow skin.

363
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,958
Well, the other Moka and I...

364
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,625
We do both share the same
body, you know, curry.

365
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,958
To think a vampire of my
strength could be manipulated

366
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,250
by something like this...!
What kind of weakling

367
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,500
have I become?!

368
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,708
This should stain your very soul
with the pure color of curry!

369
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,333
Just like your sister,
you don't have any respect!

370
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,375
You'll learn some
just like she did!

371
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,541
No, you'll learn
your place, curry!

372
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,750
Namaste ow...

373
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,250
This showdown took a total
of fifty-eight seconds,

374
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,250
whee, I mean, curry!

375
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,250
Mizore...

376
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,833
Do you mind if I give
everyone some of this

377
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,333
great curry you made?

378
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,000
Just look at 'em; I think
they could really use it.

379
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,625
Yeah, you're right...

380
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,708
I just hope they enjoy it
as much as you did...

381
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,083
I'm glad you liked it.

382
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,666
They will, too.

383
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,666
So you finally decided
to try living your life?

384
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,208
Uh...

385
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,833
Yeah, I guess Hell
froze over, huh?

386
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,041
What the hell?

387
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,833
Well, what do you ladies think?

388
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,000
It's great curry!

389
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,708
Tsukune...! Help me!

390
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,750
Hey, pull it together,
man...! I could eat

391
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,625
a whole lot more of thi-...!

392
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,625
That's why...

393
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,041
It's a long st-...!

394
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,458
Curry!

395
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,416
Geez...

396
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,333
This curry makes my eyes sting.

397
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:19,791
Oh...

398
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,208
What a giant mess...

399
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,708
This'll take forever!

400
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,875
Nope, only a week, and
now everything's finally

401
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,000
back to normal, whee!

402
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,875
It's my latest creation...

403
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,791
Shaved ice stew.

404
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,750
What, you make one good dish and
now you're getting cocky on us?!

405
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:37,958
--It's tasty!
--What?!

406
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,375
--It sure is.
--It's another masterpiece!

407
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,541
It's pretty good.

408
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,625
Yeah, I'll say.

409
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:43,625
Wait, what the?!

410
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,666
I wish it had some curry flavor.

411
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,625
Come on...

412
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:47,791
Fess up...

413
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,166
You put a spell on
everyone, didn't you?

414
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,375
Uh-uh, I didn't use any magic.

415
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,166
Huh?

416
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,916
I made it out
of love for Tsukune.

417
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,250
We're taking a field trip
to Kyoto, aren't we?

418
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,083
Yeah, and we've gotta buy
local souvenirs like swords,

419
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,458
toys, and wallets!
That's just Kyoto 101!

420
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:48,416
I'm not really sure what
"Kyoto 101" means, but okay...

421
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,291
Next time: "School Trip
and a Vampire" and another!
