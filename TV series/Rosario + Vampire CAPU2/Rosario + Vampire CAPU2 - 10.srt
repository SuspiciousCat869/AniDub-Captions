1
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,125
Look at her!

2
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,791
She's such a loser.

3
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,750
Yeah, totally pathetic!

4
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,458
Hi there, my name's
Deshiko Deshi...

5
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,750
I used to be an officer in the
Security Committee, but then...

6
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,208
Aww, man...

7
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,708
Lately, it kinda seems like
everything sucks for me...

8
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,666
All that stuff went down
around the Security Committee

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,208
last year, and I've been feeling
like a total reject ever since.

10
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,583
Excuse me.

11
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,250
Am I nuts, or did I just
hear the coolest voice

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,583
in the history of the world?

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,375
I guess not everything sucks.

14
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,250
Uh...

15
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,541
Hello, can I help you?

16
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,125
Oh, I was just wondering...

17
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,541
Where's the faculty lounge...?

18
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,708
Je t'aime.

19
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:06,333
I'll be your slave from now
'till the end of time!

20
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,708
Listen up, everybody.

21
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,875
We have a new student
transferring in...

22
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,208
So...

23
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,125
It's important that
we treat him with respect...

24
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,250
Now, his name
is Kotaro Ijuin...

25
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,833
So be nice, everyone.

26
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,000
Hello there,
you guys, I'm Kotaro...

27
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,500
How goes it?

28
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,791
We're glad to have you,
Mister Ijuin...

29
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,750
Grab that empty seat
right over there.

30
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,333
Oh, screw that guy...

31
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,041
I'd rather have Tsukune.

32
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,125
You know what?

33
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,500
I actually agree
with Boobzilla there.

34
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,416
Me too, I'm gonna cast
my vote for Tsukune as well.

35
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,791
Come on, you guys, cut it out,
this isn't a popularity contest.

36
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,041
Really...?

37
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,750
Guess you'd rather
have the transfer student.

38
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:25,666
Sweet.

39
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,958
That's one less rival for me.

40
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,125
Hey, that isn't true...!

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,416
You know Tsukune
is the one for...

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,916
Hey there, Moka.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Tsukune.

44
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,625
Moka.

45
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,708
Tsukune.

46
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,916
Oh, Moka...

47
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,041
Oops, sorry, my bad...

48
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,250
It's just that my feet
are so huge...

49
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,083
The damned things have
a mind of their own.

50
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,916
Hey, Kotaro.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,333
The next class is music; do
you wanna walk there with us?

52
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,416
Since you just transferred in,
you probably don't know

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,916
the way to the
music room, right?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,458
But don't worry;
we'll show you the way there.

55
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,750
Well, thank you, girls...

56
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,375
I think I might
take you up on that.

57
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,625
Yeah!

58
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,500
Hey, listen.

59
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,500
Huh?

60
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,750
Thank you.

61
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,416
It was nice of you
to come up and talk to me.

62
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,333
I don't have
any friends here...

63
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,916
I was pretty nervous...

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,083
I need you girls.

65
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,541
You're with me
From now on...

66
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,083
Je t'aime.

67
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,833
We'll devote our lives
to being there for you!

68
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,416
This is just the
firrrrrrst step.

69
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,791
Hey, we need to decide what
to feature in the next issue

70
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,875
pretty soon, don't we?

71
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:46,958
Hey, I know!

72
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,541
Howzabout we do
a column by me called

73
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,791
"Kurumu's Ya-Hoo-Hoo Cooking?!"

74
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,000
Forget that!

75
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,458
Let's feature "Yukari's
Relatively Accurate

76
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,625
--Tarot Readings" instead!
--Cooking is the way to go!

77
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:56,791
No, tarot!

78
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,291
No, we're doing cooking!

79
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,041
No, tarot!

80
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,500
How about a column
for stalkers?

81
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,791
I have a great title...

82
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,958
It's called "Watching Over
the One You Love"...

83
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,708
It's perfection.

84
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,125
Um...

85
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,375
At any rate, let's hammer
out all the details

86
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,083
at the club meeting
today, 'kay...?

87
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,875
After all, we've gotta get
Gin's opinion, too, right?

88
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:16,750
Right...

89
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,125
That sounds like a good plan.

90
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,500
Thank you for lunch.

91
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,541
Everything was great, thanks!

92
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,916
Hey, are you
all right there...?

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,375
You need to go to the nurse?

94
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,083
Oh...

95
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,708
No, I'm fine.

96
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,291
That's good news.

97
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,708
Even the mere thought of any
kind of injury befalling you...

98
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,250
It makes my heart shudder.

99
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,291
It wounds me.

100
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,166
See?

101
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,458
Yeah, um...

102
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,250
I...

103
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,166
I guess.

104
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,416
You're so cute...

105
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,750
You're my little bunny
rabbit, aren't you...?

106
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,125
Je t'aime.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,166
Oh, yes...

108
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,416
I will be your little
bunny rabbit forever.

109
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,666
Why'd I say that?

110
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,416
What the heck's going on?

111
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,125
This doesn't make
any sense at all,

112
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,791
why am I acting like
this all of a sudden?

113
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,083
Yeah!

114
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:04,583
Go!

115
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,541
It's yours!

116
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,250
Good shot!

117
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,000
Nice!

118
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,000
Over here!

119
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:08,916
Tsukune...!

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,791
Do it!

121
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:10,708
Right!

122
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,708
That was totally cool...

123
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,083
What an awesome way
to bite the dust...

124
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,083
Wow.

125
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,375
Who's there?

126
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,750
Wish you wouldn't frown
at me like that...

127
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,958
It really ruins your
beautiful smile, you know?

128
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,458
And where the hell
did you see my smile, huh...?

129
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,041
You creepy bastard.

130
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,750
You're a stalker, right?

131
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,166
I know all about you...

132
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,000
And I've looked
deep inside your heart.

133
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,125
In there, you always
have a smile ready for me.

134
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,000
I knew it...!

135
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,083
You have been stalking me!

136
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,583
Even though bashfulness
can be a virtue...

137
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,250
Right now it's really
getting in the way of

138
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,250
what I'm trying
to do with you...

139
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,500
Hey...

140
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,250
Go on and show me that
smile I know you have

141
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,750
somewhere inside of you.

142
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,250
Je t'aime.

143
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,458
What's happening?

144
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,375
My face is suddenly...

145
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,791
Oh, come on, Kurumu,
hold up your end, okay?

146
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:14,833
I can't help it...!

147
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,750
My boobs keep
getting in the way!

148
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,750
Whoa!

149
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,583
Aww, man!

150
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,791
Crap!

151
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,041
Why did you bounce away, ball?

152
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,333
I'd never do that.

153
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,875
Huh?

154
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,416
Oh, hey, new guy.

155
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Sorry...

156
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,541
But I've got some
balls to go grab.

157
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,000
That's pretty cold,
don't you think?

158
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,000
Your hand...

159
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,500
Get it off of my shoulder.

160
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,083
You act so tough...

161
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,291
Even though deep down, you're
nothing but a sweet, sensitive,

162
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,916
shy little girl, right?

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,458
What...?

164
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,083
Shut up!

165
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,291
You don't know me!

166
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,833
I don't do I?

167
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,583
That tough girl persona...

168
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,125
It's all for show...

169
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,166
Inside there's
a fragile soul...

170
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,166
A delicate little angel.

171
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,166
But you don't have
to hide that from me...

172
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,083
I'll take you
just like you are...

173
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,583
show me the real you...

174
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,125
Je t'aime.

175
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,625
Oh, yes, please
take me as I am.

176
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,208
What...?

177
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,375
What am I doing!

178
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,166
I can't control my hands!

179
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,208
Stop it!

180
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,625
Nooo!!

181
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:23,750
Hold on...!

182
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,291
No...!

183
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,166
Don't do that!

184
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,791
What's going on, Kotaro...?!

185
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,625
What are you trying
to pull here?!

186
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,541
Oh, Moka.

187
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,791
Answer me...

188
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,875
What exactly are you up to?

189
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,125
Come on...

190
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,041
Don't say it
like that, okay...?

191
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,125
It hurts my feelings.

192
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,125
Listen...

193
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,708
All I want is to
make new friends.

194
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,750
Liar!

195
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,791
That makes me so sad...

196
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,541
Especially coming from you...

197
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,583
It hurts.

198
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,250
Why do you dislike me so much?

199
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,083
Stay back.

200
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,083
Come girls...

201
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,041
Let's go...

202
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,416
Paradise is waiting for us...

203
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,791
Je t'aime.

204
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:04,875
Wh...

205
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:05,916
What is this?

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,541
What is this feeling?

207
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,708
Not yet...?

208
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,083
I see you haven't
given yourself over...

209
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,666
Such a naughty tease...

210
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,833
But you do understand,
don't you...?

211
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,250
I want your love...

212
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,791
To take it prisoner...

213
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,916
Oh, je t'aime!

214
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:25,583
This isn't good, I can't
resist it any longer.

215
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,791
Take me now...

216
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,166
Please let me be
by your side forever...

217
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,708
Why on earth did
I just say that?

218
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,625
Me, too...!

219
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,666
Oh, let me be by your side...!

220
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,708
Why the hell would
I wanna be by his side?!

221
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,083
Take me...

222
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,000
There's no way I could live
this life without you...

223
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:40,625
Wait...!

224
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,625
What's going on?

225
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,083
That's not how I really feel!

226
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,166
You make me so
unbelievable horny!

227
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,708
I've lost control of my body!

228
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,708
I love you, Kotaro.

229
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,458
No more!

230
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,166
Rescue us, Tsukuneeeee!

231
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,083
Ko-buddy!

232
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,666
Come on, Ko-buddy,
where are you, huh?

233
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,291
What's with that creep...?

234
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,833
Guh-rosss.

235
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,041
Kotaro, look...

236
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,250
I made them myself,
do you wanna try one?

237
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,375
What about my
special cookies...?

238
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,916
Please try one, okay?

239
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,125
Open wide for me, open wide!

240
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,000
--Open wide for me, too.
--Wow...

241
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,375
All the girls sure are being
nice to that transfer student,

242
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,583
aren't they?

243
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,708
What the heck is going on?

244
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,250
It's so scary.

245
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,583
Hey, Moka!

246
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,333
--Kurumu, Mizo...
--Tsukune!

247
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,375
Guys, wait...

248
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,708
What's the matter with you?

249
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,416
Where's everybody going...?

250
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,875
How dare you
approach him, you swine!

251
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,250
Filthy lowlife!

252
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,916
If you want an audience
with our beloved master...!

253
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,625
Then first, you've gotta ask
our permission, you wretch!

254
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,250
Do you got that, asshole?

255
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,708
Yeah, but...

256
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,875
Oh...

257
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,416
--Tsukune, you...
--Well, well...

258
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,208
Still trying to resist...?

259
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:22,916
Moka...

260
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,875
Je t'aime.

261
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:26,875
Oh, no!

262
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:27,916
Tsukune!

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,750
I can't control my body.

264
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,666
I can't say what I want to.

265
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,583
This is insane...!

266
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,250
Moka, no!

267
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,875
Stop!

268
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,666
Tsukune.

269
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,708
Seems like you
still don't get it...

270
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,000
If you keep resisting,
then you'll be punished...

271
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,458
Je t'aime.

272
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,000
Master...

273
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,541
I'll gladly take
any punishment!

274
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,375
Oh, please do!

275
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,541
I want you to punish me!

276
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,625
Punish me, my lord and master.

277
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:56,083
We deserve it; we've
all been very naughty girls!

278
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,625
What's going on?

279
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,625
Now, that's enough of that,
my precious little lambs.

280
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,083
Something is definitely up!

281
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,541
Yeah, you're right...

282
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,375
There's somethin'
fishy 'bout that guy.

283
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,416
A'aight!

284
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,750
It's time ol'
Gin stepped in...!

285
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,958
I'll see what that
jerk's up to!

286
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,250
You're my hero, Gin.

287
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,458
There's no way...!

288
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,875
I ain't about to let
some new guy take

289
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,166
all the girls for himself!

290
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,416
Later, bro, I'm out!

291
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,958
Oh, Gin!

292
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,708
Join with me,
and we can be together.

293
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,208
Anything for you...

294
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,416
I love you, man.

295
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,750
Oh, no, he got Gin, too!

296
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,916
Tsukune...!

297
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,250
Rescue me!

298
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,541
All I wanna do
is run into your arms!

299
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,958
But, Ko-tuh-roh won't...

300
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,041
Ever let us leave his side!

301
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,333
I could do it,
I really could...

302
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,333
With this power, I could
take over the whole academy.

303
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,875
Umm, excuse me,
Mister Ijuin...

304
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,000
But you really shouldn't
be carrying on in the hallway

305
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,083
like that, you know?

306
00:12:59,166 --> 00:12:59,958
Oh, sorry.

307
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,583
I...

308
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,416
I know it could never be,
but I just can't help it.

309
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,833
You're way too close, meow.

310
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,333
You are older than me but...

311
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,750
I still want you.

312
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,333
No...

313
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,833
Uh, look...

314
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,291
A student shouldn't say things
like that to a teacher...

315
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,916
It's not right, meow.

316
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,833
My goodness, what lovely
cat hair you have...

317
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,166
Je t'aime!

318
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,750
Oh, meow!

319
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,583
Ko-buddy!

320
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,458
Ko-buddy...!

321
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,625
Come out, wherever you are!

322
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,125
Ko-buddy...!

323
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,750
Come on out!

324
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,041
Ko-buddy!

325
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,083
Damn...!

326
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,791
Where in the hell
is everybody today?!

327
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,000
That stupid-ass bat!

328
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,291
He's supposed to be
my slave, but I can't

329
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,875
find that jerk anywhere...!

330
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,250
When I do, I'll beat him
to a bloody pulp!

331
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:55,166
Je t'aime Je t'aime

332
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,916
I'm not the kind
to settle down

333
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,125
But could it be
I've fallen in love

334
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,416
You're trouble,
I can see that now

335
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,750
Because I'm falling
for you, my love

336
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,041
Watchin' all the
lights go around

337
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,416
It's like a mirror to my heart

338
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,791
So let's dance, Together
we can make a new start

339
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:28,375
Say, say, say
My pussy cat

340
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:33,666
Hey hey hey Don't wanna
fight the feeling anymore

341
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,833
I think it's best if
we just lose control

342
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,583
If ten thousand times of
telling you I love you

343
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,291
Is not enough to
gain your affection

344
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,041
Then telling you a million
times "je t'aime"

345
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,833
Should be enough
to win your heart!

346
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,666
But if a hundred million
times is what you're after

347
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,500
I'm sorry but you're out
of luck How 'bout we

348
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,625
seal this with a kiss?

349
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:01,208
Oh, oh, oh
You're what I want

350
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,208
Babe, you know we're playing
fire Hot-t-t, Hot-t-t

351
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,125
Hold it...!

352
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,041
No way I'm gonna
let you do this!

353
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,000
We don't let people go around
disrupting the peace on campus!

354
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,333
Thanks, Rubi!

355
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,166
Leave this one to me!

356
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,750
What the...?!

357
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:22,958
But, Rubi!

358
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:27,541
We'll have a
mischievous love affair

359
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,708
No way!

360
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,250
Rubi, he got to you, too!

361
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,000
It's a long story.

362
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,458
Oww, Rubi, stop!

363
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,541
If I ask a hundred times to be
your lover And even then you

364
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,083
still won't have me I'll
keep asking everyday

365
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,958
over and over 'Til you say
yes on New Year's Eve

366
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,791
Je t'aime je t'aime je
t'aime je t'aime je t'aime

367
00:15:54,875 --> 00:16:00,458
I've said 5 times already Can
you resist the power of love?

368
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:06,791
No no no
Soon you will see!

369
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,791
I'm so sorry, Tsukune!

370
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,416
Mister Aono.

371
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,208
Tsukune.

372
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,250
We really wish...

373
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,500
That we could
save you right now.

374
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,333
But we can't
control our actions!

375
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,791
What the hell's
goin' on in here?!

376
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,458
Kokoa!

377
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,666
I'm already pissed,
and this isn't helping any!

378
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,583
Yes yes yes
My pussy cat

379
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,958
Stay back, Kokoa...

380
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,333
He'll get you too!

381
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:36,333
Bang Bang Bang I'll shoot an
arrow through your heart

382
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:40,958
With one more chorus of the song

383
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,500
Here we go!

384
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,083
If ten thousand times of
telling you I love you

385
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,708
Is not enough to
gain your affection

386
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,583
Then telling you--

387
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,500
Just shut the hell up already!

388
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:54,583
Uh...

389
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,875
Miss Kokoa!

390
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:56,916
"Miss Kokoa?"

391
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,083
Uh...

392
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,416
What I meant is
"Do I know you", whee...?!

393
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,125
No, I didn't...
I just-...!

394
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,125
Wait a sec.

395
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,416
Are you...?

396
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,416
Oh, no!

397
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,083
Don't listen to
his voice, Kokoa!

398
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,291
I've come this far...

399
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,708
May as well seduce Miss Kokoa!

400
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,208
Je t'aime!

401
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,708
Ko-buddy...

402
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,208
I've been looking for you.

403
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,500
What are you talking about,
my lovely little cherry...?

404
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,708
Je t'aime!

405
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,041
What the hell does
that even mean...?!

406
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,333
It sounds like its
French or something!

407
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,541
Shit...!

408
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,708
I guess vampires are
a tough nut to crack!

409
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,583
We should go on a date,
just you and I...

410
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,958
Je t'aime!

411
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,000
You wanna die?

412
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,625
'Till I breathe
my last breath...

413
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,291
You're mine and mine alone...!

414
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,125
Je t'aime!

415
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,750
What is this...?

416
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,958
I don't like it...

417
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,708
It feels really weird.

418
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,375
One more time
and she's mine...

419
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:09,083
Just one more time, whee!

420
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,041
My beloved Ko.

421
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,833
Wow, you really are my
little Ko-buddy, aren't you?

422
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,291
That's right, whee...!

423
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,416
And pretty soon Miss Kokoa,
you'll be calling me your

424
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,916
'beloved Ko' forever.

425
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,166
Just stop it...

426
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,458
Don't you go
getting any funny ideas!

427
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,000
Ha...!

428
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,083
Both sisters at the same time,
that's not a bad plan, whee!

429
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,958
I'll make you girls forget
absolutely everything...!

430
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,625
Je t'aime!

431
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,791
Stop...

432
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,000
Please stop it!

433
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,333
Kokoa!

434
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,541
Let them go!

435
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,083
I saw that one
coming a mile away...

436
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,458
You really thought that I...

437
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,958
Oh, holy shit, whee!

438
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,208
When the rosary seal over
her breast is removed...

439
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,833
Moka's innocent
self vanishes...

440
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,000
and her inner
vampire awakens!

441
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,083
Big Sis, you're back!

442
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,583
You're pathetic...!

443
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,291
Losing your senses over a
crappy little magic trick.

444
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,583
Sorry.

445
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,541
Hold on...

446
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,291
We can talk later.

447
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh no, oh no, oh no,
what the hell should I do?

448
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,041
Wait...!

449
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,041
With my power I can
win this thing!

450
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,541
We don't need words...

451
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,708
Look in my eyes...

452
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,500
Listen...

453
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,541
My love for you...

454
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,041
It is so vast.

455
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,833
It's infinite, like a thousand
sparkling stars shining -

456
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,541
Shut up!

457
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,041
Uh...

458
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:53,875
I um...

459
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,458
Look, Miss Kokoa...

460
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,083
When you got back from the ski
trip you were all tuckered out

461
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,125
--so I thought that...
--Wanna hear this...

462
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,250
Or no?

463
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,791
As a matter of fact,
Big Sis, I don't.

464
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

465
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,458
Hold on a minute, Miss Kokoa,
I was doing you a favor!

466
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,166
I thought if I got rid of
all these people standing

467
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,083
--in your way...
--Tell someone who cares!

468
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,541
I...

469
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,458
I'm good...

470
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,208
I should still be able to...!

471
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,333
All I need to do is...

472
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,708
Get up!

473
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:29,708
Huh...?

474
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,666
Dark.

475
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,333
You're nothing more
than a stupid little bat...

476
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,208
And if you think you can
just go around lifting up

477
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,833
the skirts of vampires...

478
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,750
Then you've got
another thing coming!

479
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,791
Well, you've got some big brass
ones, I'll give you that much...

480
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:43,875
Still...

481
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,041
Wow...!

482
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,583
I've never seen
an aura like that before!

483
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,041
Can't we just...!

484
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,666
No, look, you've got
the wrong idea...!

485
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,875
--I was just gonna use this...
--Learn your place!

486
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,958
Please not that!

487
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,750
That was this
episode's showdown...

488
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,125
You know...?

489
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,958
I never thought I'd be
calling it on myself, whee!

490
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh, I knew you could
do it the whole time...!

491
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,875
Moka, you're the best big
sister in the whole world!

492
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,791
If you wanna say thanks,
then you'd better say it

493
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,541
to the other Moka...

494
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,458
She barely had
control of herself...

495
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,166
But regardless, she did
everything in her power

496
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,791
to try and rescue you.

497
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:38,875
But...

498
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,333
But she...

499
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,500
That other stupid girl isn't
even the real Moka dammit!

500
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,083
I've only got one
big sis and that's you!

501
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,125
Hey, you guys, what the hell
are we doing onstage?

502
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,791
Why in the name of everything
holy am I dressed like a bunny?

503
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,041
Hey...!

504
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,833
What in the world just
happened here, Tsukune?

505
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,041
Oh...

506
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:07,750
Uh...

507
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,583
N-n-nothing at all...

508
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,125
Hey...

509
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,500
You okay, Moka?

510
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, Kokoa.

511
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,333
Well, obviously it wasn't
"nothing," for crying out loud!

512
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,375
--I'm dressed like a whore!
--Oh , God, what am I wearing?

513
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,750
This must be a long story.

514
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:19,666
I kinda like mine.

515
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,708
No, no!

516
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,541
Nothing happened at all,
you guys...

517
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:23,708
Let's get outta here!

518
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:24,791
Hey...!

519
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,375
Kokoa.

520
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,416
Thank her...

521
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,708
She did everything
in her power to rescue you.

522
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,333
But that one isn't
even my real sister...

523
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,041
Let's go, Ko-buddy.

524
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,125
I'll be right there, whee!

525
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,125
Uhp.

526
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,125
Ya-hoo-hoo!

527
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,041
Yukari and stalker girl
got their own episodes,

528
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,000
so it's gotta be
my turn soon, right?

529
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,000
Next time...

530
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,541
"Lilith's Mirror
and a Vampire"...

531
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,291
and another!

532
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,250
So I'm not the main
character next time?!

533
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:50,791
Huh?

534
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:51,875
What the hell?!
