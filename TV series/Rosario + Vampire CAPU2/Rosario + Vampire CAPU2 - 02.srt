1
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,750
Vampires.

2
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,291
a perfect pairing
of ultimate power

3
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:35,041
and the magnetism
of consummate beauty.

4
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,625
But now, another one
has emerged.

5
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,625
Hold on, whee!

6
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,166
You're telling me that
first-year student over there--

7
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,916
She's Moka's little sister?!

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,916
Kokoa...

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,916
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,625
Huh...?

11
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:54,666
Kokoa...?

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,333
Is that her name or something?

13
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,291
Moka?

14
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,250
Finally...

15
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,291
We're face to face.

16
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,750
And guess what Moka...?

17
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,958
Now I'm gonna wipe you off
the face of the earth!

18
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,541
Go on. Get out
of here, everyone!

19
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,375
Hurry!

20
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,208
Kokoa only came here for me!

21
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,458
Moka, watch out!

22
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,083
Wow, she's incredible!

23
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,083
With strength like that...

24
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,583
There's no question...

25
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,625
She's an S-class monster...

26
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,625
A vampire!

27
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,833
You never fail
to impress, Miss Kokoa!

28
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,625
Your power's
electrifying, whee!

29
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,125
That bat!

30
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,458
All along I thought he was just
the narrator for the show,

31
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,791
but now...!

32
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,625
Has he been in cahoots
with her this whole time?!

33
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,250
What's wrong with you?

34
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,541
Come on...!

35
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,208
Why won't you fight...?

36
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,458
Let's do it like we used to!

37
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,250
What's this
girl's problem, huh?!

38
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,375
She doesn't care
what she destroys!

39
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:24,958
Stop!

40
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,625
Kokoa, no!

41
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:28,750
Moka!

42
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,208
Leave this to me...!

43
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,375
This...

44
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,041
to me...

45
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,291
This to me...

46
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,083
Tsukune!

47
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,958
I thought this last time...

48
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,250
But he sure does smell good.

49
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,666
What exactly do you think
you're trying to pull, huh?

50
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,416
Oh no Tsukune, are you okay?!

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,333
Moka, his blood's everywhere!

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,708
Ah, that smell...

53
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,375
I can't control myself.

54
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,166
Hey! Get it together, Moka!

55
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,333
That does show they both
respond in the same way

56
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,791
to Tsukune's blood...

57
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,083
They're sisters all right!

58
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,916
You just had to get in my way!

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,791
If you're gonna interfere,
then I guess I'll hafta take

60
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,250
you guys out as well!

61
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,583
Wow, she sure is a tough one.

62
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,958
What do I do...?

63
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,583
If she keeps going
they're gonna...!

64
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,625
Hey, you...!

65
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,625
Stop!

66
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,916
What the hell
is going on here?

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,041
What the...?!

68
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,625
Mister Kotsubo?

69
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,291
Man, I hate that asshole.

70
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,583
Hold on, I recognize you.

71
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,041
She's the new first year.

72
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,000
And her name is Kokoa Shuzen.

73
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,125
"Shuzen?"

74
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,166
Okay...!

75
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,208
What the hell
is Rubi doing here?

76
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,666
It's a long story...

77
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,375
But right now I'm
working for the director,

78
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,708
and helping out
where there's a need.

79
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,291
And then even more stuff
happened, like this week

80
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,625
I'm helping make up the
roster of new students.

81
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,000
Rubi is not important...

82
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,041
The issue is Kokoa!

83
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,875
And you're gonna march your
butt back to class right now!

84
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,083
Well...

85
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,375
It looks like you guys
are safe for now...

86
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,166
But next time I'm gonna
wipe you off the face

87
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,458
of the earth forever!

88
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,916
Moka Akashiya!

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,125
Hey...!

90
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,083
Slow down!

91
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,791
Goddamnit!

92
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,916
Oh My goodness, I completely
lost my train of thought.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,291
Well!

94
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,125
It's a long story after all,
there's so much to tell.

95
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,666
Don't you worry, Tsukune...

96
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,291
I'll fix you up. 

97
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,333
Hey, Yukari, why don't
you let me help you out?!

98
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,541
No...!

99
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,541
If you get near him,
you'll suck his blood.

100
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,041
Hey, I've got a better idea.

101
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,333
Why don't you tell everyone
about your sister...?

102
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,916
I'd like to hear the story.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,541
Oh yeah, her name's Kokoa,
wasn't it?

104
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,125
But wait!

105
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,291
If you two're sisters how come
you have different last names?

106
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,166
Hers is "Shuzen"
and yours is Akashiya.

107
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:39,958
Oh...

108
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,208
Well...

109
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,333
I guess if she doesn't
want to talk about it...

110
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,375
No it's just that...!

111
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,416
All right.

112
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,416
Originally there were four
of us; me and my three sisters.

113
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,875
Counting from the top
I'm the third oldest...

114
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,291
Kokoa's the youngest of us all,
just one year behind me...

115
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,791
She and I had
different mothers...

116
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,416
But as kids we lived
in the same house.

117
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,625
Yeah, but...

118
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,750
How'd the two of you
get to the point where

119
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,166
you're always
fighting each other?

120
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,000
That's just the way
we were, even back then.

121
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,291
We were constantly
fighting every day.

122
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,875
You can try all you want, but
you're never gonna beat me...

123
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,291
You need to learn your place.

124
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,166
No...

125
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,375
You haven't beat me yet, Moka!

126
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,958
Come on, Kokoa...

127
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,708
I'm getting fed up with
how fixated you are on this!

128
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,666
You see...

129
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,375
Back when I was still a kid...

130
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,875
Unlike now...

131
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,708
I didn't have this rosary seal
to help control my power.

132
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:36,916
Poor Kokoa...

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,083
She never beat me,
not even once.

134
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,208
Just give up, Kokoa.

135
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:43,833
No...!

136
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:44,833
Let's go again...!

137
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,041
I refuse to quit...!

138
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,416
One of these days
I'm gonna take you down!

139
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,041
I'm sorry,
but that'll never happen.

140
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,125
I've been keeping
this a secret...

141
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,291
But I'm gonna be
moving out soon.

142
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,833
Apparently, they're going
to seal away my powers...

143
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,958
And then after that, I'm gonna
go live with my real mother

144
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,791
in the human world.

145
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,333
As far as our little fights...

146
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:11,250
Today was your
last chance to beat me.

147
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,708
I don't understand...

148
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,291
No...!

149
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,333
No fair!

150
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,083
Kokoa.

151
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,083
It's your fault.

152
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,708
I'm never gonna forgive you,
no matter how long I live!

153
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,375
And Kokoa didn't give up...

154
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,166
She chased right after me
when I went to the human world.

155
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,708
And kept challenging
me to fight.

156
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,041
But.

157
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,125
My powers were sealed away
because of the rosary.

158
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,333
And I wasn't strong
enough to fight her...

159
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,416
All I could do was run away.

160
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,875
S-so let me
get this straight.

161
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,125
You're saying that Kokoa
chased you all the way here

162
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,416
to Yokai Academy?

163
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,250
I'm afraid so.

164
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:54,208
That has gotta be the most
single-minded fixation ever.

165
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,833
I wonder if that's
really the only reason.

166
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,791
Well, from her
point of view...

167
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,125
She sees me as the irresponsible
big sister who left her...

168
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,958
And I think she probably
despises me because of it.

169
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,250
Come on...

170
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,125
It's not like that
whole ordeal was your fault.

171
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,458
Yeah, you're not to blame!

172
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,458
Oh, man...

173
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,791
Your little sister sucks...

174
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,583
Want me to just freeze her
and be done with it?

175
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,083
You can't...!

176
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,791
Messed up as she is, she's
still family to me, you guys!

177
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,500
But at this rate,
you could wind up dead.

178
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,541
I think he's right!

179
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,875
Kurumu.

180
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,291
Course I don't really care
if she dies or not...

181
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,750
But if my poor little
Tsukune got himself

182
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,375
hurt again, I swear to you,
I just don't know how

183
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,916
I'd continue on living!

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,750
M-more importantly, we don't
know when Kokoa's gonna

185
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,375
come after Moka again!

186
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,166
I can answer that one;
she's coming right now, whee!

187
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:39,833
Kokoa...!

188
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,708
Miss Kokoa...!

189
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,958
They're right here, whee!

190
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,666
Nice job, Mister Ko!

191
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,166
She's here!

192
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,583
You think you can run from me,
you got another thing coming...!

193
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,791
Hey, Mister Ko...!

194
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,541
Come on!

195
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,125
Right away wee!

196
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,666
Oh, Miss Kokoa, that hurts...!

197
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,041
Ah, but in a way it also
feels kinda good wee!

198
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,166
Wh-what the heck?!

199
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,208
My shape shifting
bat, Ko, transforms,

200
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,791
which means I can turn him
into anything I want!

201
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,208
Wow, did they put the bat
in the show just for this?

202
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,250
Those crazy writers had
this in their back pocket

203
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,791
the whole first season!

204
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,416
Here comes the pain!

205
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,500
Man, this bitch is nuts.

206
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,875
She's gone completely
off her rocker!

207
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,333
For crying out loud Moka,
she is your sister...

208
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,750
Make her stop or something!

209
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah, okay, I'm on it!

210
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,291
Moka!

211
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,166
Hi-ya!

212
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,625
Sorry everybody!

213
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,583
I just don't think I can do it!

214
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,541
--Come on, let's get outta here!
--Hello?

215
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,750
Where do you think
you're going?

216
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,541
Get your ass back here!

217
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,250
That ceremony was so long!

218
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:01,875
Yeah.

219
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,041
Hey...

220
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:03,916
But what about that
awesome vampire girl

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,125
who showed up before hand!

222
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,541
I wonder who she was?

223
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,458
Yeah, me too, me too!

224
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,708
Hey, check it out,
that's Moka over there!

225
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,666
That mystery vampire goddess
sure was incredible, all right!

226
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,541
But Moka is still
the absolute coolest!

227
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,791
Moka!

228
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,916
Ah, not now!

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,708
I'm real busy, okay?!

230
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,166
Don't get in my way...

231
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,875
Because no matter who you are,
I will take you down!

232
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,125
"Meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow..."

233
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,916
Miss Nekonome, did I
catch you at a good time?

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,250
Yeah, if you can catch some,

235
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,916
it's always
a good time for fish.

236
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,416
That may well be,
but that's not what I want...

237
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,166
I need to talk to you about
a first year named Kokoa.

238
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,833
Apparently...

239
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,416
Kokoa Shuzen was the
chief culprit behind

240
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,791
the rumpus before the ceremony.

241
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,375
That one seems to be
quite the trouble maker, huh?

242
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,583
That's terrible,
now if you'll excuse me, I...

243
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,666
Wait, we need your assistance!

244
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,916
We think it would be wise
for you to nip this problem

245
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,791
in the bud with some
discipline before

246
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,791
she starts up any more trouble.

247
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,541
So Miss Nekonome,
do you think we can

248
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,375
count on your cooperation here?

249
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,708
But wait...

250
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,541
She hasn't caused any more
problems yet, has she?

251
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,791
I don't care if I
destroy the whole school...!

252
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,875
I'll do whatever I have to!

253
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,125
Do you hear me Moka?!

254
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,666
I will hunt you down
no matter what it takes!

255
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,666
It seems she's
causing one now.

256
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:40,541
It's...

257
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,208
a...

258
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:41,750
Scan...

259
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,000
dal.

260
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,625
We're safe...

261
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,666
She's gone.

262
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,250
Don't let your guard down.

263
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,708
Kokoa's insane; she's the most
persistent person I've ever met.

264
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,083
She just got here;
at least she's not

265
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,375
familiar with the place.

266
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:59,125
Miss Kokoa I found them wee!

267
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,583
Good work, bat!

268
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,583
Let's do it again,
Ko, come on!

269
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,250
Okay, whee!

270
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,875
Oh no!

271
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,333
That one looks even deadlier
than the last one did!

272
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,333
And those spikes
are ridiculously huge!

273
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,208
Now it's time for you to die!

274
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,666
We won't let that happen!

275
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,541
Somewhere I hear a voice
crying out to us for help.

276
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,375
This violence
has no place here...

277
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,791
We reject it.

278
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,625
Our names ring through
the halls of Yokai Academy!

279
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,458
The white shadows
of two shining beauties!

280
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,250
Known to the world as...!

281
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,208
The duo of Pretty Witch
and Love-Love Succubus!

282
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,583
We're the incredible
super miracle double delux...

283
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,333
Too loooong!

284
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:47,625
Oww...!

285
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,791
That was mean!

286
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,291
Hey why'd you attack us...?

287
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,916
it's against the rules while
we're still doing our cheer!

288
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,958
We should've just frozen
her solid and called it a day.

289
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,041
Sorry kids, but I'm through
playing around here.

290
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,625
In that case, me too!

291
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,916
Yeah! Let's kick her ass
all the way to next week!

292
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,125
Stop it...!

293
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,541
I know she's being
a brat you guys,

294
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,500
but she's still
my little sister!

295
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,916
Caught you slipping!

296
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,708
Bat to the butt!

297
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,625
Oh man...

298
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,583
She ripped us to shreds, huh?

299
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,041
I really hate that bat.

300
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,125
Me too...

301
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,666
My face really hurts.

302
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,291
Uh...

303
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,375
Sorry.

304
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,125
That takes care
of your stupid friends!

305
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,458
What the...?

306
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,500
Look who it is...!

307
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,833
Check it out!

308
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,750
Sorry to keep ya
waitin', you guys.

309
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,666
I'm ready
whenever you are, Gin.

310
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,333
Well look who
decided to show up!

311
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,791
Our club president...

312
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,166
Saving the day!

313
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,125
With both of those monsters
fighting together...!

314
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,916
Kokoa doesn't have
a chance of defeating us!

315
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,791
That girl is completely toes!

316
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,708
It's "toast," not "toes,"
you big dummy!

317
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,541
Alright then, here we go!

318
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,291
Heck yeah Let's do it!

319
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,416
Ooo... That is so hot...

320
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,041
I knew you'd make
a great model!

321
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,125
You are one photogenic babe.

322
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,958
I'll do any pose you want.

323
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,291
Your wish is my command, Gin.

324
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:14,958
Woo-hoo...!

325
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,333
What's going on...?

326
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,625
Well, whatever...

327
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,250
Now I finally get
the chance to take you out!

328
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,833
Moka Akashi...!

329
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,875
Hey! What the hell?!
Where'd you guys go?!

330
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:27,583
Now ...!

331
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,375
I'm really mad!

332
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,916
What is it with her, anyway?

333
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,166
I'm exhausted.

334
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,541
Damn, this girl
is way too persistent.

335
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,416
If a stalker woman says
you're too persistent,

336
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,333
you have serious issues.

337
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,666
Shut up...

338
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,708
When I stalk people,
at least I'm smart about it.

339
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,083
We're safe for right now...

340
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,791
But I doubt it'll be too long
before she finds us.

341
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,541
Moka...

342
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,833
What's wrong?

343
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,041
Hey, guys...

344
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,708
I'm gonna go face her.

345
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,625
That's nuts!

346
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,875
Not a good plan!

347
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:16,958
No...

348
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,791
This whole thing
is between me and Kokoa.

349
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,000
It's my problem.

350
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,375
So I need to find a way
to fix it on my own.

351
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,625
Moka, you can't.

352
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,875
I mean...

353
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,958
I can't just keep
putting you and the others

354
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,291
in the middle like this.

355
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,666
Moka, wait!

356
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,333
It's fine, don't worry...

357
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:37,041
I bet if we have a conversation,
I can make her listen to reason.

358
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,750
Hold on, don't go!

359
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,916
I mean it, too...!

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,833
Don't you go following me!

361
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,750
Am I dreaming?

362
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,041
You know, I never
imagined you would

363
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,041
come begging me for a fight...

364
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,333
Oh, how I've longed
for this day...

365
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,166
Dearest sister.

366
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,125
I didn't have a choice...

367
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,208
If I would've let you
just run amok...

368
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,708
You'd have dragged
them all into it,

369
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,833
and things would've
gotten out of hand.

370
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,125
That's why I've come here...

371
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,708
Let's settle this ordeal
once and for all, Kokoa.

372
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,041
I'm so happy...!

373
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,291
I've waited so long to
hear you say those words!

374
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,666
Morning Star!

375
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,333
Since the day you
left home and never came back,

376
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:36,666
I've waited for this day to
come, and now it's finally here!

377
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,791
Do you really think
you can block my attacks

378
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,625
with that thing?

379
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,958
What's wrong with you...?

380
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,625
I know for a fact you're
a lot stronger than this.

381
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,125
Well, if you're
not even gonna try!

382
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,958
Kokoa!

383
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,500
You beat me fair
and square Kokoa...

384
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:44,541
It may not look it, but I
fought as hard as I could.

385
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,666
You jerk.

386
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,083
How come you won't use all your
power and fight me for real?

387
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,458
Kokoa.

388
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:55,500
Why can't you understand
what you did to me, huh?

389
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,666
My big sister up and left me...

390
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,833
She left me all alone
in that house.

391
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,375
And what about me...?

392
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,708
How do you think I felt?

393
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,666
I see...

394
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,541
After Moka left you were alone.

395
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,125
You were lonely the
whole time, weren't you?

396
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,166
Tsukune...!

397
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,458
and everyone, you're all here!

398
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,416
Kokoa...

399
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,625
The truth is...

400
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,250
What you've felt for
Moka all this time is

401
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,083
nothing more than love...

402
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,375
Sending those hate letters...

403
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,958
Even chasing her
around all over the place...

404
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,041
Deep down...

405
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,416
What you really wanted
was your sister.

406
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,250
You just wanted
to see her again.

407
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,875
It all makes sense now.

408
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,208
An expression of love
all twisted around.

409
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,708
Though you're
probably the last person

410
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,541
she wants to hear that from.

411
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,375
But everything's
all right now...

412
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,875
No need to keep the act up...

413
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,000
After all, you two are
at the same school now,

414
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,791
so you can be together
as often as you like.

415
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,583
That's it, isn't it, Kokoa?

416
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,958
I...

417
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,083
never knew how you felt...

418
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,166
Forgive me...

419
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,916
I left you behind.

420
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,250
This is the best part of the
story, where the two sisters

421
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,375
have their joyous,
tearful reunion.

422
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,833
For real, it's so beautiful!

423
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,958
We should act like
the sisters we are...

424
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,875
Maybe now, you and
I can be friends again,

425
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,583
like it used to be.

426
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:09,958
That's...

427
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,041
not it.

428
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,916
That's not it!

429
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,666
Truth is, I hate your guts...

430
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,625
And won't stop
until I defeat you!

431
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,166
Hold on...!

432
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,541
That wasn't it?!

433
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,875
But the whole story was
starting to wrap itself up!

434
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,208
You think I wanna be friends?!

435
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,625
No, don't do it!

436
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,375
All I want is to wipe you off
the face of the earth!

437
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,791
Moka, no!

438
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,166
No way!

439
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,750
Tsukune and Moka, they're...!

440
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,166
Squashed Flatter
than a pancake!

441
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,333
Man...

442
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,958
To think she's my own sister...

443
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,750
I never thought
she hated me this much.

444
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,541
Ah, well...

445
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,125
Regardless of who it is,
when someone flashes

446
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,416
their fangs at me,
know what I do?

447
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,000
I knock em' out.

448
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,541
When the rosary seal over
her breast is removed...

449
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,541
Moka's innocent
self vanishes...

450
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,000
and her inner vampire awakens!

451
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:06,041
I don't care if you are my
sister, I don't pull punches.

452
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,458
It's time for you
to learn your place!

453
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,083
--Moka, wait!
--Not just yet, Tsukune.

454
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,416
Kokoa's a vampire...

455
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,875
A kick like that
won't slow her down.

456
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,416
Well...

457
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,458
You can still get
on your feet, eh?

458
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,375
I don't understand!

459
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,208
She took Moka's
kick right to the chest!

460
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,625
Don't tell me...!

461
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,416
Are we about to witness
a Vampire fight to the death?

462
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,708
When two powerful monsters
meet head to head...

463
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,208
Who knows what will go down!

464
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,375
For all we know, the whole
academy could blow apart

465
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,750
--at the seams!
--Moka...!

466
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,583
Please...!

467
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,583
You've got to stop this...!

468
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,750
Anything more might...!

469
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,625
Atta girl...

470
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,541
Come and get me, Kokoa.

471
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,708
Big sister.

472
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,333
Big sisteeeeeeeer!

473
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,208
Moka...!

474
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,208
Yay...!

475
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,875
Oh, sister you're
finally back...

476
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,375
I've wanted to
see you so baaaad!

477
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,750
What the...?

478
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,000
Kokoa...

479
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,083
Weren't you just saying
you wanted to wipe me

480
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,750
off the face of the earth?

481
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,125
Yeah...!

482
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,375
Not you, it's that dumb
lame-ass "Moka Akashiya"...

483
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,208
That wimp isn't anything
like the real Moka...!

484
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,416
Please, sister...!

485
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,166
Just promise me
you'll never go away again!

486
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,333
Please don't turn all
wimpy on me, okay...?!

487
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,625
Let me get this straight,
what she wanted was...?

488
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,875
was the sister she knew when
they were growing up together.

489
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,333
And who she really hated was
the Moka we all know and love.

490
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,416
You're starting
to get on my nerves!

491
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,458
Wonderful...

492
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,041
Getting kicked
by my big sister...

493
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,250
It's even more spectacular
than I remember it!

494
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,916
Sorry Kokoa...

495
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,083
But the person you want me
to be isn't here anymore,

496
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,375
she's gone forever.

497
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,208
Wait...!

498
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,750
What are you talking about?

499
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,791
It's time you get used to it.

500
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:01,541
Oh, Moka!

501
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,833
Tsukune!

502
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,666
It's 'cause she's around
those wimps all the time...!

503
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,666
She's one of them now!

504
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,458
But...

505
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,958
That's just fine by me...!

506
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,833
I'll gather more information...

507
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,708
And one of these days
I'll get the real Moka

508
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,750
back in my life for good!

509
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,750
I wouldn't really call
that a showdown whee...!

510
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:20,708
Hey, get up...!

511
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:21,666
Miss Kokoa...!

512
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,208
Miss Kokoa, 

513
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,750
Pull yourself together whee...

514
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,958
Poor Moka...

515
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,750
To have to fight
your sister like that.

516
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,041
Oh, Tsukune, I'm so exhausted.

517
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,250
But still.

518
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,875
Hey, Tsukune, what's wrong?

519
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,791
We need to hurry up and
get her to the nurse's office,

520
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:40,708
Okay...

521
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,000
Right.

522
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,125
It just doesn't
make any sense...

523
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,708
If Moka was scary
as a little girl...

524
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:47,791
Well, then...

525
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:51,916
Where did our Moka come from?

526
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,166
Tsukune...

527
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,416
You smell...

528
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,458
So delicious.

529
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:01,291
You're gonna suck my blood
even when you're half-asleep?!

530
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:41,541
We were almost goners
this episode, Tsukune!

531
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,166
And next time, I'll do
even more to plunge you

532
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,750
straight into hell, you and
your dumb little friends!

533
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,708
You're in the
previews too, Kokoa!

534
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:48,958
Next time...

535
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,041
"Mother and Child and a
Vampire."...and Another!
