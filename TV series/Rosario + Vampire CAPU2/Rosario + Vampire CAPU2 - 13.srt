1
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,875
Oh, man...

2
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,375
Am I ever gonna
get to this place?

3
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,333
Is that it?

4
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Just hang on, Moka...!
I'm almost there!

5
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,625
Wee-hee-hee-hee-hee...!
This is as far as you're

6
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,416
gonna get, pal, whee!

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,333
Get away!

8
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,458
Get off of me!

9
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,000
If you think this
is gonna stop me...

10
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,416
...then you've got another
thing coming 'cause

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,125
I'll get her back
no matter what!

12
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,250
Agh, what's going on?!

13
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,375
How'd your eyes just
change color, whee?!

14
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,250
Ohhh, shiittt!

15
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,125
Ko, my darling, come back!

16
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,333
Whoa, what the heck...?
Why'd they all fly away?

17
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,125
Ah, who cares?

18
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,333
I've gotta keep moving!

19
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,375
Hey, what the hell was
that, Ko-buddy...?!

20
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,375
Here I give you the chance

21
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,000
to flap your stuff
and you blow it!

22
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,458
Guess if I want it done right,
I'll have to do it myself!

23
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,125
Oh, Tsukune?

24
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,583
Huh?

25
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,833
Boop.

26
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,458
Ohhh, shiittt!

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,916
Geez, I guess they don't call
it the "northern" barrier

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,833
for nothing; it's
pretty cold here.

29
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:41,041
Speaking of cold, freeze
right there, Tsukune.

30
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,291
Huh?

31
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,833
Mrs. Shirayuki?!

32
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,541
Please, you don't have to be
so formal with me anymore...

33
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,375
Why don't you just call me
"your little snow bunny"...?

34
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:51,666
'Kay?

35
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,333
Uh...

36
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,583
I've gotta go now...

37
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,208
Hyooloolee...

38
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,750
Hyooloolee laa laa...

39
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,041
Get your paws off of me,
you damn, dirty yeti...! <i>Help</i> !

40
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,416
Well, we should get going...

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,541
After all, the wedding
preparations have

42
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,541
already begun back
at the village.

43
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,375
Whose wedding?!

44
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,708
--No, wait a minute, let me go!
--Silly boy...

45
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:13,875
You're marrying Mizore.

46
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,250
Congratulations
on your wedding day!

47
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,666
Wait...! No...! Please stop!

48
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,375
Mother, Father, let him go!

49
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,250
Mrargh-rargh?!

50
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,125
What are you doing?!

51
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,208
Mizore, what the?!

52
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,500
You heard what I said.

53
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,458
Let him go now, Mother.

54
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,958
Mizore, dear...

55
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,458
Are you trying to tell your
father and I you've given up

56
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,583
on your dream of
becoming Tsukune's wife?

57
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,583
No, I haven't given
up on it at all...

58
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,833
Well, it's just that--

59
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:41,916
What, dear?

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,958
Well, Mother,
if Tsukune says that he

61
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,541
really wants to
go to that castle...

62
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,708
Then...

63
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,916
It's my wifely duty to
put my life on the

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,666
line to protect his
right to do that...!

65
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,958
You're willing to
do that, Mizore?!

66
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,375
That's the spirit;
I'm impressed, Mizore...

67
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,541
However, dear...

68
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,041
If we let Tsukune make
it to the castle,

69
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,583
that vampire will be
in your way again.

70
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,791
Don't you have any faith in me?

71
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,125
What do you mean?!

72
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,166
Who cares if the other
Moka comes back into play?

73
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,333
I'll just do what I've
always planned on doing,

74
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,875
Mother, and that's fight her

75
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,083
fair and square for the honor
of becoming Tsukune's wife!

76
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,583
Well... I hate to tell you
this, but this wedding isn't

77
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,708
just a question of what
you want anymore.

78
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,583
The future of the
snow woman line now

79
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,416
depends on this
wedding taking place.

80
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,541
If that's the case, then
I'll fight you on this, Mother!

81
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,958
Mizore, do you really think
you can defeat me...?

82
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,583
And with every snow woman
in our tribe backing me up?

83
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,875
Hyooloolee...

84
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,583
Hyooloolee laa laa...

85
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,791
Magic wand, golden washtubs!

86
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,416
Hey, Mizore...! I'm gonna
win him the same way!

87
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,875
Yukari?!

88
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,333
And besides, I really wanna
see the other Moka again, too!

89
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,541
Hey, you better
hurry up and get to

90
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,541
that castle while you
still can, Tsukune!

91
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,583
Hell will freeze over
before I allow that!

92
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,083
Hyooloolee,
Hyooloolee laa laa...

93
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,791
Magic Wand Giant
Spinning Washtub Volley...

94
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,916
Go...!

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,791
What the?!
Mama?!

96
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,416
Now's your chance, Tsukune, go!

97
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,000
Gotcha...! Thanks, guys!

98
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,458
Hold it right there!

99
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,083
You're the one that
needs to hold it, Mother!

100
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,583
Are you really going
to raise a hand

101
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,833
against your own mother...?
Well, are you, Mizore?

102
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,208
If that's what it's
gonna take, then yes.

103
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,625
Oh really?

104
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,708
It's on!

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,791
Almost there...!

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,750
Just a little farther!

107
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,375
Crap, how do I cross this?!

108
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,583
I found you!

109
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,250
Hi...! I've been looking all
over for you, Tsukune-woonie...!

110
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,416
What do you say we go and
get you married to Kurumu?

111
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,875
No!

112
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,333
What is it with all these
wedding plans today?!

113
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,500
If you'd rather,
we could always make

114
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,250
that wedding between
you and me instead!

115
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,875
Well, to be honest...

116
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,458
I gotta admit that
your breasts are even

117
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,041
more mesmerizing than
your daughter's are...

118
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,208
That's right, they can be yours.

119
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,875
They can...?!
No, we've gotta stop this!

120
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:14,875
Oh?

121
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:15,916
And who says
that we have to...?

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,250
Tell you what,
after we're married,

123
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,166
I'll let you bring as many
pretty girls into our

124
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,208
bedroom as you like if
that's what you want.

125
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,875
But I don't have any interest
in doing that, not at all!

126
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,208
Oh...

127
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,125
Well, if that won't work,
my succubus powers will.

128
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:32,125
No man can resist them,
or my womanly charms.

129
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,708
Let him go, Mom!

130
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,833
I'm coming, Tsukune!

131
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:39,500
Oh, crap!

132
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,208
I'm your mother!

133
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,875
When I fly by...
Grab onto me!

134
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,166
Tsukune!

135
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,166
I like your way
of saying thanks!

136
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,708
Huh?!
I'm so sorry!

137
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,708
I'm not...

138
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,583
And keep thanking
me all you like.

139
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,458
Huh?

140
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,750
Actually, that'll have to wait!

141
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,541
Um, hey...

142
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,833
Thanks for that
back there, Kurumu.

143
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,041
You know...

144
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,083
Ever since the other
Moka's been gone...

145
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,541
I've been feeling hopeful,

146
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,708
like I was the front-runner
to become your girlfriend.

147
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,166
Kurumu?

148
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,041
But I guess...

149
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,458
I was mistaken, wasn't I?

150
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,708
Even though that
Moka's not around...

151
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,708
Especially 'cause
she's not around...

152
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,166
Your feelings for her
are stronger than ever...

153
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,625
She's got a real hold on you.

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,166
Kurumu, listen...

155
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,666
I'm--

156
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,125
Stop right there...! If you
say you're sorry right now,

157
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,541
then that means
it's all over for me!

158
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,041
And besides that...

159
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,750
Out of all the other girls,
I'm still the one who cares

160
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,416
for you the most, Tsukune,
and that's the honest truth!

161
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,083
Kurumu, I--

162
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,500
Don't forget what I said...

163
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,750
So you know...

164
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,875
I've felt that way the
whole time I've known

165
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,875
you and I'll keep
feeling that way...

166
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:00,833
You hear me, Tsukune?

167
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,000
Kurumu Dear...!

168
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,291
Is that any way to
treat your own mother?!

169
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,750
Don't worry, I'll keep
my mom busy here...!

170
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,083
Get inside the castle!

171
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:08,833
Uh...

172
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,291
Right!

173
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,083
And he runs off without
even a second glance.

174
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,666
Tsukune, you're a jerk...

175
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,041
...the biggest jerk who ever
lived, do you hear me...?!

176
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,833
Jerk!

177
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,750
Time for you to learn...

178
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,208
...respect!

179
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,250
Grargh rargh rargh rargh!

180
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:10,958
This is it.

181
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,625
I wouldn't do that.

182
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,125
Uh, Kokoa...? Why?

183
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,625
So tell me...

184
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,541
You don't have the foggiest
idea who lives here, do you?

185
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,750
Yes, I do.

186
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,500
It's one of the
Three Dark Lords.

187
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,625
Well, he's not just a Dark Lord;
he's also my father.

188
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,250
Your father?!

189
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,916
Then that also makes him Moka's
father as well, doesn't it?

190
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,791
That makes sense
since he was the one

191
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,916
who crafted Moka's rosary...!
I'll just go in--

192
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
You don't have a clue!

193
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,625
If you did, you'd know that

194
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,625
my father positively
hates humans...

195
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,916
If you go in, he's
going to kill you

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,500
before you can even say "boo."

197
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,791
That's right, whee...!
Miss Kokoa's daddy is bad news!

198
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:45,958
He isn't just a vampire,

199
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,708
but an S-Class Ultra
Supermonster, whee!

200
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,000
If you wanna turn back,
this is your last chance.

201
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:52,750
Thanks.

202
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:53,916
That's very kind of you.

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,666
What is?

204
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,666
You worrying about me;
that's so sweet.

205
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,291
What...?! Don't make me laugh,
you creep...! Hah...!

206
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,000
As if I'd worry
about you anyway!

207
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,083
However, I'm still going in.

208
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,416
I'll see you later...

209
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,541
And thanks again.

210
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,000
Uh...

211
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,375
Geez...! What's goin' through
that pea-brain's head...?!

212
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,333
That idiot's walkin' right
into his own funeral!

213
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,333
Awww...

214
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,125
Does he really love that
lame Moka so much?

215
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,666
Um...

216
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,250
Excuse me...! Sir...?! You're
Moka Akashiya's father, right?

217
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,000
Hey...! You have a rosary...!

218
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,583
I'm in desperate need
of one of those!

219
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,500
Oh, please, sir,
can I have it?!

220
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,250
No, you cannot.

221
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,500
Uh...

222
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,541
You filthy human scum...

223
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,041
How dare you set
foot in my castle

224
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,875
without asking my
permission first?!

225
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,166
Leave!

226
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,458
Hear me out...

227
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,666
I said leave!

228
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:04,708
Holy crap...! It really was
before he could say "boo," whee!

229
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,625
Why...?! Why didn't
he listen to me?!

230
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,208
You should have
heeded my instructions.

231
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,541
It was a mistake to give
Moka that rosary to begin with.

232
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,041
But to think that of all those

233
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,666
with the strength
to remove it...

234
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,625
It wasn't a monster, but
worthless human scum instead.

235
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,041
Tell me...

236
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,625
Oh... So you actually
survived that?

237
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,333
Why is it...? Why do you
hate humans so much?

238
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,541
You, of all people, should know
the answer to that question...

239
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,208
Your species is full of fear...
and hatred.

240
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,666
I know this first-hand...

241
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,333
I sent Moka to be
schooled amongst

242
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,291
humans for her own safety...

243
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,750
But you people
ostracized her.

244
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,000
But that wasn't me!

245
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,458
You were no different...

246
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,458
I know when you first
found out what she was,

247
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,583
you feared my daughter.

248
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,875
"I don't need monsters
for friends anyway."

249
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,458
I wonder who it was
who said that to her...

250
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,416
You're right,
that's how I felt then...

251
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,250
But...

252
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,916
Now--...

253
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,875
Now what, human?

254
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,875
Now I love her...!
With all my--

255
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,166
Be silent worm!

256
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,333
I did what I did to give my
daughter an opportunity

257
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,291
to live in peace in
the human world...

258
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,666
I transformed her aggressive
personality into the

259
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,750
polar opposite, one that was
both gentle and kind...

260
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,916
But you took advantage
of that gentleness...

261
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,583
And I'll be damned
if I let her get

262
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,916
involved with a
weakling like you!

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,791
But how could you do it...? How
could you just transform her...?

264
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,916
Moka was your
own daughter.

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,375
Um, Miss Kokoa...?
Should we help, whee?

266
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,291
Yeah...
We really oughta...

267
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,708
If we don't, Daddy's
gonna kill him...!

268
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,375
Come on, Ko-buddy, let's go!

269
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,083
Silence!

270
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,166
Moka is my daughter...!
To protect as I see fit!

271
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,833
I know she's your daughter...

272
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:17,916
I get it...

273
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You love her...

274
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,916
But still, Moka
has the right to--

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Do what she wants...? Not with
you, you piece of human garbage!

276
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,208
But she...

277
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,208
...made a promise to me.

278
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,375
A promise, eh?

279
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,166
She did...
right before she disappeared.

280
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,791
Trust me...

281
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,500
We'll meet again...

282
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,833
I promise you.

283
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,250
And that's why...

284
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,208
I came to your damn castle...

285
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,375
To... get my Moka back!

286
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,000
You weren't listening,
were you...?!

287
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,708
This other Moka that
you saw on the surface

288
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,333
and are trying to
bring back now...

289
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,333
She isn't real...! She's
nothing but a phantom!

290
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,833
You're wrong!

291
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,166
No, I'm not, human...! The girl
you've fallen in love with

292
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,666
is a mere phantom, and you're
a fool caught in its thrall!

293
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,458
Damn you!

294
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,833
That's your daughter
you're talking about!

295
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,291
How can you call
her a phantom?!

296
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,291
The other Moka...

297
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,583
What we shared was real.

298
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,375
How is this possible...?
Oh, that's right...

299
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,375
My daughter gave you
some of her blood,

300
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,875
so that's where this strange
power is coming from.

301
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,416
Even if Moka has
two souls within her,

302
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
the hand I touched
was the same hand!

303
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,875
And I know for a fact...

304
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,291
...that the Moka I touched
was no phantom!

305
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,000
I care about both Mokas...!

306
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,291
And I don't wanna
be without either one!

307
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,250
Have it your way, but both
Mokas are my daughters...!

308
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,000
And you will not
march in here

309
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:43,208
and steal them from me because
you think you have powers!

310
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,625
My daughter's love
is a precious thing!

311
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:57,125
I will not allow her heart to be
wasted on lowly scum like you!

312
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,541
Moka and I care
for one another...!

313
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,750
And it's no less than
the love you feel...!

314
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,875
Not one bit, do you hear me?!

315
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,375
Moka...

316
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,416
Please give me the strength!

317
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,875
Give me that rosary!

318
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,208
I want Moka...!
Give me back my Moka!

319
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,916
What do you say we
leave it at this for now?

320
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,333
Enough, Father.

321
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,166
Of what, Moka?

322
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,125
This unnecessary little show
that you've been putting on...

323
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,166
You didn't need
to do it just for me.

324
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,000
Why do you think it was a show?

325
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,791
Because if you were
serious about killing him,

326
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,375
you would've just stopped
Tsukune's heart with

327
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,916
the very first blow and
been done with it...

328
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,916
As for your showdown,
I'd have to say

329
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Tsukune beat you
fair and square.

330
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,625
Look, I did it...

331
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,958
I got it.

332
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,125
When did he snag that?!

333
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,625
Not too shabby for a so-called
"worthless human," is it?

334
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,708
I guess not...

335
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,125
But are you okay with this...?

336
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,666
If so, it'll mean
you'll have to live as

337
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,916
the inner face of that
other girl again.

338
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,500
The decision isn't mine to
make; it's up to someone else.

339
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,291
As long as that's
what you want...

340
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,541
I suppose that
you're old enough to

341
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,041
make your own decisions now.

342
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,208
Very well then...

343
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,458
Take that rosary and do what
you will with it, Tsukune Aono.

344
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,833
Uh...

345
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,333
However, don't
assume that means

346
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,875
I'm also giving you
my daughter's hand.

347
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,166
You would do well
to remember that.

348
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:42,375
He never changes,
does he...? Same old Father.

349
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,125
So...
I guess this means...

350
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,041
Uh-uh!
No way!

351
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:47,791
Huh?

352
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,000
Yoink!

353
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,208
If you put this on her,
you're gonna turn my

354
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,208
Big Sis into a
total wuss again!

355
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,291
Hey!

356
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,166
You give that back
right now, Kokoa!

357
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,625
No!

358
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,458
You two should have
this conversation

359
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,041
outside before it's too late.

360
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,041
Right, Miss Kokoa's father
has a policy about his castles;

361
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,333
if one gets infiltrated,
he destroys it, whee!

362
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,291
What?!

363
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,166
No, stop!

364
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,958
Don't take my rosary!

365
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,541
Whoa, what the
heck happened here?

366
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,166
Yeah...

367
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,458
It's trashed...

368
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,833
It looks like this entire
place got leveled...

369
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,500
So you finally got
a hold of it, huh?

370
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,208
Oh...

371
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,083
Well... Shall we pick up

372
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,958
where we left off
the last time...?

373
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,291
What are you gonna do with that
rosary now that you have it?

374
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,000
Um, well, you see...

375
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,750
Prefer her to me...?

376
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,541
Are you going to choose
the other Moka then?

377
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,125
--I...
--No, Tsukune!

378
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,791
You can't pick one
of the Mokas over me!

379
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,875
Their boobs aren't
nearly as soft as mine!

380
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,625
Sorry, but he's gonna pick me.

381
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,166
No, he's picking
me and that's final!

382
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,375
Moka, listen...! And the
rest of you guys, too!

383
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,458
What is it?

384
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,250
I need you to
understand something...

385
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,833
I'm just not there yet...

386
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,208
Picking one of you is something
I'm not able to do right now.

387
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,000
And that's the reason why
I couldn't bear the thought

388
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,416
of never seeing the other
Moka again, because it's...

389
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,208
Well... It's like before
I could even begin

390
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,250
to think about
picking somebody...

391
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,750
Without her, it felt
like I couldn't make

392
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,541
a decision about my future...

393
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,791
When I heard about the Future
Paths Information Session

394
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,250
at school, I knew I had
to find the other Moka.

395
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,416
I had to see her.

396
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
I needed to see the
other Moka again...

397
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,791
...so I could be sure
of what I really felt...

398
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,416
And so I could be sure
of who I wanted to

399
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,000
spend the rest of my life with.

400
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,500
That's the honest truth
and that's how I feel.

401
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,291
Sounds like an excuse to me.

402
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,458
Uh-huh...

403
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,250
Wait...! What?!

404
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,708
So you can keep
stringing us all along...!

405
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,916
Just who the hell do you
think you are, anyway?!

406
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,750
No, wait...! Moka, please...

407
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,916
I'm being totally
honest, I swear!

408
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,750
Regardless,
it's time that you...

409
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,458
...learned your place!

410
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,500
Ohhh, shiittt!

411
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,166
Please believe me, Moka,
I've learned my place now...

412
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,916
To be honest...

413
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,291
I have gotten a
little bored with

414
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,291
looking like this
all the time...

415
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,083
But before I go, I wanna
do it with you at least once.

416
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,291
"It;" you mean sex?!

417
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,250
Oh, come on now...

418
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,541
You really didn't
expect me to wait

419
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,875
forever for this, did you?

420
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,250
That's what you meant...

421
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,958
Oh, crap...! That hurts
more than usual!

422
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,208
I'll see you later...

423
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,833
'Kay, Tsukune?

424
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,375
Moka?

425
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,458
Tsukune?

426
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,708
Oh, Moka.

427
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,250
Oh, Tsukune.

428
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,125
Moka...

429
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,208
Oh, Tsukune...

430
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,583
This staring at each other
thing's making me sick!

431
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:10,875
Yeah, it's pretty annoying!

432
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,041
If you two 're gonna hug...

433
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,791
Just go ahead and
do it already...! 'Kay?!

434
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,250
Tsukune!

435
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,208
Moka!

436
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,083
Oh, Tsukune!

437
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,458
I missed you, Moka.

438
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,250
I missed you, too.

439
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,208
I'm only letting 'em do this
'cause they haven't seen

440
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,666
each other in a long time!

441
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,458
There, there, Kurumu...

442
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,625
It'll be okay.

443
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:41,833
Moka, thank God...

444
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,833
I'm glad you're okay.

445
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,416
Like I said...

446
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,750
I promised I'd see
you again someday.

447
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,875
Yeah...

448
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,958
You sure did...

449
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,833
I'm glad you kept that promise.

450
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,875
Um...

451
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,166
Hey, Moka...?
What's the deal...?

452
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,833
You're squeezing me so
tight that I could swear

453
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,583
that you're mad at
me about something.

454
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,458
Oh, no...

455
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,916
...whatever gave you that idea?

456
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,250
I dunno...

457
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,250
Maybe because you were
almost breaking my spine?

458
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,791
So...
Umm...

459
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,041
What is it that you're
mad about, Moka...?

460
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,125
Tell me.

461
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,500
Very well then, Tsukune!

462
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,333
I'm upset with you
because you were...

463
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,583
Well...

464
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,000
...getting all lovey-dovey
with the other me.

465
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,083
Um, yeah, but the
two of you both--!

466
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,958
I know she and I both share
the same body, but still...!

467
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,541
Look, I don't know
why, Tsukune...

468
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,250
...but it made
me kinda jealous.

469
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,500
But I know how you
can make it up to me!

470
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,875
Huh?

471
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,416
I missed doing this so much!

472
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,333
Twice in one day?!

473
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:44,375
♪ closing song ♪

474
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,125
Stop it...! Knock that off,
Moka...! Right now!

475
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,750
You're sucking way too
much blood from Tsukune.

476
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,000
Just look at him;
he looks like beef jerky!

477
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,333
If you don't stop,
you're gonna kill him!

478
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,500
Oh, I'm sorry!

479
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,125
I guess I got a little
carried away, huh?

480
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,041
A "little" my ass!

481
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,541
Hey! You sneaky skanks
get your paws off

482
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,375
of my Tsukune right now!

483
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,125
Your Tsukune...?!
He's ours!

484
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,250
That's right...! And
if you want him,

485
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,708
you're gonna have to
fight us for him!

486
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:39,750
Fine, I will!

487
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,666
No...! Guys...! Stop it!

488
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,958
Hi, everybody!

489
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,666
Oh, thank goodness
you're all okay!

490
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,791
It's a long story, but
we finally managed to

491
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,625
capture and subdue
all of your parents...

492
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,291
I hope they've
learned their lesson.

493
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,041
Tsukune's gonna marry my Kurumu!

494
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,083
No, he's gonna marry my Mizore!

495
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:56,958
No way!

496
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,458
Well, Miss Akashiya...

497
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,458
I see you're back
to your old look again.

498
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:01,875
Oh... Yes...!

499
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,541
And it's all because
of Tsukune!

500
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,166
Well, all right, everyone!

501
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,875
Let's head back to
Yokai Academy, 'kay?!

502
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,291
Okay!

503
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,375
You won this round...

504
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,833
Have fun with that lame
version while you still can...

505
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,083
'Cause I have a plan to
reclaim my real big sister

506
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,583
and I'm going to
launch it real soon.

507
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,500
Speaking of plans, Kokoa...

508
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,458
Oh, um, Daddy...!
When did you get here?!

509
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,375
After some investigation,
I discovered that

510
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,666
one of your plans
created this ruckus.

511
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,125
Um... No, sir...
Me...?! Are you serious?!

512
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,791
As serious as this spanking!

513
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,791
--Daddy, no, please stop!
--Miss Kokoa, whee...!

514
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,166
--Daddy, no, please stop!
--Be brave, my mistress...!

515
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,208
Think happy thoughts...!

516
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,208
I feel your pain...!
I really do...!

517
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,958
You poor thing...! That's
gotta hurt...! Ouch, whee!

518
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,708
I can't believe he actually
sent that human back alive...

519
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:56,708
He must be placing his hopes
for the future on that kid...

520
00:23:56,791 --> 00:24:00,291
The future of a place with room
for both humans and monsters.

521
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,666
A place called Yokai Academy.
