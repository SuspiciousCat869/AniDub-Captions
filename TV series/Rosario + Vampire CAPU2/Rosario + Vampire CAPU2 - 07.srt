1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,166
Teen pregnancy rates are
now at an all-time high...

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,583
And statistics show that this
trend of babies having babies

3
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,458
of their own is getting worse.

4
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,041
Parents...

5
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,291
Do you know what your teenagers
are doing in their spare time?

6
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,916
Oh, how awful...

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,750
Today's kids are so wild...

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,458
Huh?

9
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,541
Coming...! Yes,
how can I-...? Uh?!

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,958
Tsukune?!

11
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,250
Well, I'm here, Mom.

12
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,458
Uh...

13
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,333
Then welcome home!

14
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,208
A school trip?

15
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,166
I wanted to drop
by on my free day;

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,041
I did mention it
to you, didn't I?

17
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,916
No, you didn't say anything...

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,458
In fact, you haven't
called your father and me

19
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,458
very much at all recently.

20
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,166
Really?

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,958
I'm sorry, Mom.

22
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,125
Face facts...

23
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,291
He's growing up and not
a baby anymore...

24
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,708
He has a life of his own.

25
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,958
Ohh, my special little guy's
a young man now.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,208
Huh...? I wonder who that is?
Coming! Be right there!

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,791
Mom, why'd you scream?!

28
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,333
This gorgeous girl says
she's here to see you?!

29
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,833
Uh...

30
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,541
Moka?!

31
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,833
I guess that my visit's
a bit of a surprise.

32
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,416
Calm down. Don't panic.
There's nothing to worry about.

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,250
Your only son just brought
his first girlfriend home

34
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,083
to meet you!

35
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:25,291
How nice...! So this is
your bedroom, eh, Tsukune?

36
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,958
Man, I don't believe this!

37
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,791
Moka's not only in my house,
but also my bedroom!

38
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,333
Whoa, it's so big!

39
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,000
--You haven't seen "it" yet!
--A lot bigger than...

40
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,083
Uh...! Um, I meant to say...

41
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,666
I'm really flattered that
you wanted to spend your

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,250
one free day by coming
here and seeing me.

43
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,166
Well, a free day
in the human world...

44
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,625
It wouldn't be any fun
without you, Tsukune.

45
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,541
And besides, I've been
wanting to meet your parents

46
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,166
for awhile now.

47
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,041
My mom...

48
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,541
You sure surprised her.

49
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,166
Oh, no, I'm not
imposing, am I...?

50
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,291
That might explain
the way she reacted.

51
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,666
No, she was just surprised
at how beautiful you are;

52
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,125
that's all.

53
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,916
You're just being nice.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,791
Look...

55
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,458
I need to be honest with you...

56
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,333
I was worried that if I let you
come home all by yourself...

57
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,208
You'd decide to stay here
and I'd never see you again.

58
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,666
What, why?!

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,833
You know I wouldn't
do that to you-...!

60
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,833
Tsukune...

61
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,958
Moka...

62
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:31,375
Huh?

63
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,250
Oh, Tsukune...

64
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,208
How weird, this feels like a-...

65
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,416
Hi there, Tsukune...!
Oh, did I fall asleep...?

66
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,666
Sorry about that...
it's so comfy!

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,541
Kurumu, do you mind telling
me just what the hell

68
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,833
you're doing hiding in my bed?!

69
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,333
Ya-hoo-hoo...!

70
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,833
I came here to surprise you,
Tsukune...! I heard you were

71
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,416
going home, so I decided to
get here before you did...!

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,250
I figured I could meet your
parents, and then you and me

73
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,791
could have some fun, one-on-one
playtime in here alone!

74
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,625
Best of all, I'd beat all
the other girls to the punch

75
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,083
'cause none of them
would be smart enough

76
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,583
to think of this...! Those
three are airheads...! Huh?

77
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,666
This really sucks...

78
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,791
I musta fallen asleep
while hiding in here...

79
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,708
Oh, hey, Tsukune, I thought
we could spend some time

80
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,958
alone together.

81
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,375
Hi, Tsukune...!
You alone now?

82
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,125
I'm sure she's
a very sweet girl.

83
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,416
And remember, Tsukune's a good
boy, unlike those sex-crazed

84
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,333
teens they were
showing on TV...

85
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,375
I made some tea
for you tw-...!

86
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,416
You ho-bags!

87
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,416
You're one to talk,
you sleazy slut!

88
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,416
Tsukune is mine, you guys!

89
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,041
That was my boob
he was grabbing!

90
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,416
Tramps!

91
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,750
Oh, no, Mom!

92
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,125
Would you care to
explain why there are

93
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,791
four different girls
in your room...?!

94
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,166
Are you having out-of-control
teenage sex in there?!

95
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,458
Mom, calm down!

96
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,291
Nothing funny's
going on, I swear;

97
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,166
they're just some
friends from school!

98
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,375
"Just some friends?!"

99
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,625
You're going to become
another statistic...

100
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,708
Since Tsukune attends
a school for monsters,

101
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,166
he's probably never told
his folks too much about it,

102
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,583
or us, for that matter...
He must be keeping it

103
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,208
a secret because he knows
the news would freak them out.

104
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,416
We've put him in
a really bad spot...

105
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,083
You know, guys...

106
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,875
I don't think any of us
should have come here at all.

107
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,416
But I can't!

108
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,791
Just please calm down
for a minute, 'kay?

109
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,958
My truck is the
great First Star;

110
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,250
the king of the old highway...

111
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,041
What...?! Outrun by
the Strawberry?!

112
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,041
Tell me, Mistress Kokoa,
how's that candy you bought

113
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,708
in Kyoto, whee...! Oh,
I think I should mention

114
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,083
you're not supposed to ride
your bike on the free-...!

115
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,500
Wisten up, Big Sis!

116
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,416
Wif you fink you can
wun away fwom me,

117
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,291
you've got anowwer fing comin'!

118
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,291
Everyone just barged in
all at once...

119
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,958
I really can't blame Mom
for freaking out like that.

120
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,125
At a time like this, I've just
gotta keep my head on straight.

121
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,041
I have to chill out and
think about things calmly.

122
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:01,833
Tsukune?

123
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,208
Mind if I come in?

124
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,666
Huh?

125
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,958
Kurumu, my mom's downstairs!

126
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,833
Hey...! Calm down; I just
want to talk, and I knew

127
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,458
this was the one place
where we'd have some privacy!

128
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,083
Tsukune, I've been wondering...

129
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,291
Is there some kind of
problem with me being here?

130
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,041
Uh, no, it's okay...

131
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,541
Great.

132
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,583
Well, in that case, I guess
you won't mind if I do this.

133
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,041
Kurumu?!

134
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,875
I want to be with you,
Tsukune...

135
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,833
And I also want to be more
than "just some friend."

136
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,666
What I really want...

137
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,041
Is you, Tsukune...

138
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,916
It's about time
things cooled down here.

139
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,875
Mizore?!

140
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,000
I expected as much
from you, Kurumu...

141
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,708
But it was a big mistake
thinking you could get

142
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,166
the drop on me in a place
where there's water.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,750
Not to mention that
I'm also a girl who'll stop

144
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,916
at nothing when
it comes to love.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,208
Tsukune, look...

146
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,750
I'm sure it'll be
a little cold at first...

147
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,291
But the main reason
I came here is because

148
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,291
I'm gonna make
a baby with you...

149
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,833
Even if I have to force you.

150
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,583
Hold it right there, Mizore!

151
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,916
No, don't look!

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,541
Yes, you heard me correctly,
honey; Tsukune brought a whole

153
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,750
gaggle of girls home...!
I really need you to get here

154
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,416
as fast as you can because
I don't know what to do!

155
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,416
One of them's running
around in her swimsuit!

156
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,416
You've gotta come do something!

157
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,291
Get back here!

158
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,833
It's all your fault that Tsukune
saw me naked in the bathroom!

159
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,083
Get home now, Koji!

160
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,125
Our son's become a sex fiend!

161
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,875
Stop running around, you two!

162
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:42,708
Tsukune, wait!

163
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,541
At least put your pants on!

164
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,041
Uh...! Mrs. Aono?!

165
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,083
Hey, Auntie,
I came by to say hi!

166
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,750
I thought I'd surprise
you because you told me

167
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,500
your days can
get dull around here...

168
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,666
Hey, let go!

169
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,416
--No, you let go!
--You have to stop!

170
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,916
And you need to put
some pants on, Tsukune!

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,208
Tsuki...

172
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:09,000
Uh...! Oh... Kyoko...
How's it goin'?

173
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,750
Why are you wrestling three
girls in your underwear?!

174
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,375
Alright then...

175
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,125
So you didn't just bring
a girlfriend home;

176
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,750
you brought four of them...

177
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,791
Um, "brought" isn't
exactly the right word.

178
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,125
Well...

179
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,500
being the closest thing
you have to a big sister,

180
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,375
I'm happy to see
you're growing up...

181
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,625
I never knew that you
had a big sister, Tsukune.

182
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,416
Quiet! I'm not done!

183
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,291
Wow...

184
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,500
To think that the same little...

185
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,375
I don't; Kyoko and I
are actually cousins...

186
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,791
But you see, because our houses
are so close to each other,

187
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,458
she and I basically grew up
like brother and sister.

188
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,041
"Playa?" What on Earth
does that mean?

189
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,458
It means a slick guy who
doesn't just date one girl,

190
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,333
but plays the field with
a bunch of different ones.

191
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,875
Oh, dear God!

192
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,583
What do I do...?!
My little boy's now a gigolo!

193
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,750
Don't you worry...

194
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,291
I'll get Tsuki
straightened out, Auntie.

195
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,666
Well, all of you
are attractive enough.

196
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,291
But Tsuki always has been
a little indecisive.

197
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,375
So I take it then that he
doesn't know which one of you

198
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,875
to pick to be his girlfriend.

199
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:05,833
Am I right?

200
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,416
No, it's just-...

201
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,791
No way, you're totally wrong;
Tsukune's heart already belongs

202
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,125
to me...! These other chicks
just can't take a hint

203
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,625
and they keep trying to cut in!

204
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,458
Wow, you just
described yourself...

205
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,875
Don't you think it's
about time you woke up

206
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,375
and realized how much you're
bothering poor Tsukune?

207
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,458
Says the stalker
who peeps in his windows!

208
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,791
The truth is, I'm Tsukune's
real girlfriend!

209
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,166
What?!

210
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,291
Wow, it's a lot more
complicated than I thought...

211
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,041
But that isn't a problem, 'cause
if Tsuki can't make a decision,

212
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,416
then I guess I'll just
hafta make it for him!

213
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,666
Let's see which one of you
loves Tsuki the most...!

214
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,916
It's time for you to make
your cases, ladies!

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,250
Starting now!

216
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,708
Huh?!

217
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,125
I'm not about to sign off
on any girlfriend of Tsuki's

218
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,083
until she proves she's
up to snuff in my eyes first!

219
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,500
Nobody gets in front
of the Red Wolf...

220
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,458
I'm the fastest thing
on the highway!

221
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,875
Mistress Kokoa,
slow down, whee!

222
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,166
What...?! Overtaken
by the Strawberry?!

223
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,291
How's that fried shrimp
you bought in Nagoya, whe-...!

224
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:12,916
Alright!

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,625
Candidate number one,
make your case!

226
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,833
Okay, Chesty, that's you,
you're up...! Go!

227
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,333
Sure thing...!

228
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,041
Happy to oblige...! Hi there,
my name's Kurumu Kurono...

229
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:26,000
And my best attributes
are my boobs-...!

230
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,666
I think big boobs are way
overrated, don't you agree...?

231
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,500
I'm Yukari Sendo, by the way!

232
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,708
And this smokin' little
body of mine's just loaded

233
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,041
with potential.

234
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,666
Good 'cause you're flat as
a pancake right now...

235
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,166
Of course my
greatest fantasy...

236
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,291
is to have an incredible night
of passion with both Moka

237
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,041
and Tsukune at the same time!

238
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,791
Geez...

239
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,000
I never would have guessed
you'd be open to kinky stuff

240
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,125
like that at such
a young age, Tsuki.

241
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,666
I'm not open or kinky!

242
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:53,875
Um...

243
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:54,625
Hi, there...

244
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,375
My name's Moka Akashiya.

245
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,916
Wait...? "Akashiya"?

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,333
And I'm, uh...

247
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,916
Well, Tsukune was the
first person I ever did it with.

248
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,916
You did him?!

249
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,750
No, it's not what you think!

250
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,833
Please tell 'em, Moka!

251
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,583
My poor baby lost
his innocence?!

252
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,208
And what's worse is that
you attacked Tsukune

253
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,166
and just took it from
him without asking!

254
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,416
Without asking?

255
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,958
You mean you violated
my sweet, little boy?!

256
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,458
It wasn't planned; it was
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

257
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,000
Even so, he'll pick me because
he saw me without my panties

258
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,083
in the third episode
of the first season!

259
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,791
He saw you without your panties,
so what...? I came here to make

260
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,666
babies with him, and that's
what I'm gonna do right now.

261
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,541
Uh...! Make babies
with him...?!

262
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,041
So my Tsukune turned out just
like all those troubled kids

263
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,375
I saw on that program...

264
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,375
Hey...

265
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,541
So let's do
this thing, Tsukune.

266
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,583
You mean right here
in the living room?!

267
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,708
Yeah...

268
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,041
Why, does this place
not work for you?

269
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,500
Well, okay, fine,
let's go to your room then...

270
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,833
Just the two of us.

271
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,958
What do you think you're
doing, you snow skank?!

272
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,541
Trying to help Tsukune...

273
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,583
Since the poor guy was forced
to witness that hideous sight

274
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,916
in the bathroom just now...

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,333
I thought I'd take
his mind off of it.

276
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,375
Hey, what do mean
by "hideous sight?"...

277
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,333
You're not referring to my
gorgeous naked body are you?!

278
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,583
Oh, Tsukune...

279
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,208
If only we'd taught you
better, you wouldn't be

280
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,375
a sex fiend who's
making babies!

281
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,791
Mrs. Aono!

282
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,916
Alright, that's it; I've had
it...! Let's take this outside

283
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,291
so you and me can settle
things once and for all!

284
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:12,958
Bring it!

285
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,333
Just calm down...

286
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,708
No, hold on, you two!

287
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,750
Cool!

288
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,291
This just got
really interesting!

289
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,958
Yeah, no kidding!

290
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,125
Aw, come on, knock it off!

291
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,750
Whoa!

292
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,458
They're pretty good...! Hey,
are they martial arts masters

293
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,875
or something?

294
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:36,458
Yeah!

295
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,250
Get her!

296
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,333
Get her!

297
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,083
No, please don't
encourage 'em, Kyoko!

298
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,333
I'm tired of you
getting in my way!

299
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,625
We're supposed to be
settling this, aren't we?

300
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,916
If I beat you in this fight...

301
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,291
Then you agree to stay away
from my Tsukune forever.

302
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,458
Is that a deal?

303
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,666
Yeah, bring it on, Frosty!

304
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,875
It's on!

305
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,416
They're awesome...! Are those
two in a special effects club

306
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,833
or something...? I don't
even see their wires!

307
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,750
I've gotta admit,
this is really something!

308
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,916
They're going all out!

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,916
Did they forget
we're in the human world?!

310
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,666
Hey, snow skank...!
You were actually trying

311
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,333
to kill me back there,
weren't you?!

312
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,000
Look, you even drew blood!

313
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,291
I'll draw a whole lot more.

314
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,875
Say...

315
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,916
Tell me something, Tsuki; just
who the hell are these girls?!

316
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,291
Them?

317
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,416
Oh, they're just some girls
I know from school...

318
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,708
School girls can't
hover in mid-air!

319
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,666
Um, well...

320
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,625
Stop, you guys've
gotta knock it off!

321
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,291
I'll do something
to stop 'em!

322
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,166
Huh?!

323
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,916
Magic wand, golden washtub...

324
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,208
Magic wand, golden washtub...

325
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,208
Abracadabra!

326
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:04,958
Move it!

327
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,083
Stay out of our way, brat!

328
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,208
You two tramps...!
Now I'm mad!

329
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,166
Geez, things just
keeping getting worse...

330
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,125
Like I was saying,
who are those girls?!

331
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,583
Kyoko!

332
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,416
Um...

333
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,208
sir, that's not
appropriate behavior!

334
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,416
That girl's wearing
strawberry panties!

335
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,250
We got passed
by the Strawberry!

336
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,000
Mistress Kokoa, how's
that eel you bought

337
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,708
in Lake Hamana, whe-...!

338
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,083
Mrs. Aono...
Are you alright, ma'am?

339
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,958
I... think...

340
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,375
Wait...! What have
you done with Tsukune?!

341
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,708
He went chasing
after the other girls.

342
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,375
I'm sorry!

343
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,000
We all barged in
unannounced...

344
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,083
and have caused you nothing but
trouble since we got here...

345
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,291
I swear, ma'am...

346
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,583
I never intended
for any of this.

347
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,333
Who are you girls really?

348
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,916
We're in a
school club together...

349
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,375
The same Newspaper Club
that Tsukune's also in...

350
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,958
We all have a
good time with him...

351
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,041
Uh!

352
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,375
But please don't
take that the wrong way;

353
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,250
it's totally wholesome...!
It's nothing indecent,

354
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,291
but I guess I would be lying
if I said I never had those

355
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,833
kinds of feelings, what with
teenage hormones and all...

356
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,333
Oh, my God,
what am I saying here?

357
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,416
But the truth is Tsukune and I
are just friends and that's it.

358
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,083
I promise.

359
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,583
I can't blame her
if she starts yelling.

360
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,833
The Newspaper Club?

361
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,791
And didn't I hear you say that
your last name was Akashiya?

362
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:48,833
Yes...?

363
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,166
Well, then...

364
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,541
Tsukune's been raving
for months about a friend

365
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,166
whose last name is Akashiya!

366
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,625
He said that you
were a great fighter,

367
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,083
but it never occurred to me
that you might be a girl!

368
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,791
I'm so glad to finally
get to meet you,

369
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,833
because Tsukune talks
about you all the time...

370
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,500
Every time that he calls home...

371
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,375
you're mentioned.

372
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,541
I've made a good friend
here at school...

373
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,916
And they've become
really important to me.

374
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,000
You know, at first,
it really surprised me...

375
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,333
I thought he was joking...

376
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,166
But I could tell by the
sincerity in his voice

377
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,416
that he was happier than
he's ever been in his life.

378
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,458
And Mom, I hope I can introduce
you two one of these days.

379
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,333
I can't tell you how much
I've been looking forward

380
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,583
to meeting you, my dear...
Tsukune told me that you're

381
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,625
his best friend in the world...

382
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,791
And that you
make him so happy.

383
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,333
For doing that
for my son, Moka...

384
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,125
I do thank you.

385
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,208
Lately...

386
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,291
I've been feeling that
our friendship has been

387
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,083
a little too close for comfort.

388
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,333
I agree.

389
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,375
With friends like you two,
who needs enemies?

390
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,416
If they don't stop fighting like
this, people are gonna realize

391
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,625
that none of them are human!

392
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,125
Moka...?! It's too
dangerous for you to be here;

393
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,791
they're fighting for keeps!

394
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:13,958
Tsukune...

395
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,208
Uh...

396
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,541
What's that blood-sucking
bitch trying to pull?!

397
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,416
While we're busy fighting to
the death, she's weaseling

398
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,750
in on Tsukune...

399
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,416
We can't let her do that.

400
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,625
You're damn right!

401
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,291
Then let's you and me
double-team her!

402
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,375
I wanna join in, too!

403
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,333
Let's get outta here...!
They're gonna cream you!

404
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,458
Don't worry.

405
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,666
Huh?!

406
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,958
'Cause I'm gonna be
just fine, Tsukune.

407
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,083
Oh, dammit!

408
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,125
Moka tricked us and lured us
right into a trap!

409
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,458
When the rosary seal
over her breast is removed...

410
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,958
Moka's innocent
self vanishes...

411
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,375
and her inner vampire awakens!

412
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,791
You stupid, immature girls...

413
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,750
Forcing me to come out due to
your petty little squabbles.

414
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,583
It's time I put you
in your place!

415
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,250
Wow...

416
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,291
she's strong...

417
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,250
Yeah...

418
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,916
That kick really hurt...

419
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,125
But she does have sexy legs...

420
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,291
It's your indecisiveness...

421
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,500
that brought this about...

422
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,041
You know that...

423
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,750
That's okay for
the time being...

424
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,375
But one of these days,
you are going to have

425
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,541
to make a decision, Tsukune...

426
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,625
And that time is coming up.

427
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,083
A decision, huh...? What kind?

428
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,500
The one about who
to take as your partner...

429
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,333
There'll come a time real
soon when you'll have to

430
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,958
make that decision
on your own...

431
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,291
So don't forget that...

432
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,791
Tsukune.

433
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,041
Um, hello?

434
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,708
This episode's big
showdown took a whopping

435
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,416
twenty-three seconds, whe-...!

436
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,541
Aw, not again, Ko!

437
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,875
C'mon, we're almost there!

438
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,500
Hey!

439
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,708
You there in the strawberry
underwear and chewing on

440
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,041
a Chinese bun!

441
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:42,958
Pull over!

442
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,625
You're exceeding
the speed limit!

443
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,916
You heard me, pull over,
right now!

444
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,125
I'm here to pick you up!

445
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,208
No, let go of me!

446
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,791
I don't wanna go back
to school yet!

447
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,375
Well, you should have thought
of that before you caused

448
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,000
such a big ruckus
in the human world!

449
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,958
All of your passes
have now been revoked...

450
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,250
You've got no one
to blame but yourselves.

451
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,500
I'm the dad!

452
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,125
I'll come back
as soon as I can, Mom.

453
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,416
I'll be looking
forward to it, dear...

454
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,750
Miss Akashiya?

455
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,083
I'm counting on you to keep
looking out for Tsukune...

456
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,291
Just like you told me
you've been doing.

457
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:18,875
Yes...

458
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,625
I will, Mrs. Aono.

459
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:23,375
Aww...

460
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,958
There, there.

461
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,958
Oh, great.

462
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,333
Well, I guess this means that
our school trip's finally over.

463
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,458
It's all your fault our passes
got revoked, so you could

464
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,500
at least attempt
to act sorry about it.

465
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,083
Hey...

466
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,708
So just what'd you
and my mom talk about?

467
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,166
Not too much...

468
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,958
Just that you told her I was
a really scary person who

469
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,958
can handle myself
in a fight pretty well.

470
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:54,458
What...?! But I never told her
that you were scary, Moka!

471
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,833
The rest...

472
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:56,583
Huh?

473
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,458
Well...

474
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,333
It's a secret...

475
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,666
Oh, hi, Kyoko...

476
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,125
You're finally awake, huh?

477
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,416
Where are all those girls?!

478
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,875
They went back to the school...

479
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,125
Auntie, listen...

480
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,583
there's something weird
about those girls...!

481
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,291
They can fly, and shoot
things out of their hands,

482
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,916
and they all have
freaky powers!

483
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,583
They're not normal, and
I'm worried that Tsuki's

484
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,000
in serious danger!

485
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,333
They're loud, but they turned
out to be nice girls...

486
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,291
And as for them flying,
I think maybe you just had

487
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,625
a strange dream.

488
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,875
A dream...? Well you know,
now that you say that,

489
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,583
the stuff I thought I saw
them do was far-fetched...

490
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,583
But...

491
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh...! I'd better go see who's
at the door...! I'm coming!

492
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,000
It still seemed real enough
that I'm gonna go check out

493
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,291
this Yokai Academy
for myself one day...

494
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,250
I'll figure out the truth if
it's the last thing that I do!

495
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:47,500
What is it, Auntie?!

496
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,541
Are you okay?!

497
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,500
Wait, they left
this morning...?!

498
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,625
Run away all you want;
I'm not gonna give up...

499
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,291
Big Sister!

500
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,833
What happened after
that is a long story...

501
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,583
A very long story indeed...

502
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,625
Um, Rubi?

503
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,291
This is actually
the preview segment.

504
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,250
That time for me was an
experience impossible...

505
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,041
Well, I guess we'll
be here for awhile...

506
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,625
Next time: "Youth and a
Vampire" and another Chomp!
