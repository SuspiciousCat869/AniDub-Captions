1
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,000
Yikes...!

2
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,166
Now I'm worried about that, too!

3
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,041
But don't sweat it,

4
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,583
if anything was gonna happen...

5
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,500
With my luck,
it would happen to m--

6
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,625
What's going on?!

7
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,166
Look out!

8
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,750
What... What is that thing?!

9
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,208
Saya...! What are we gonna do?!

10
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,083
Stay away from me!

11
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,416
No...! Come back!

12
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,750
Let me go! Let me go!

13
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,458
Nene...! Please come back!

14
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,875
Nene! Come this way!

15
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,416
I need you, but...

16
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,958
You haven't been blessed yet.

17
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,583
Nene!

18
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,250
Saya.

19
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,833
Father...

20
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,875
It killed Nene.

21
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,500
You need to get some rest.

22
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,125
How can I?

23
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,125
Because you must.

24
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,208
Will you find where
the light leads, Saya?

25
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,333
I wasn't dreaming.

26
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,458
It really did happen.

27
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,208
Um, yeah?

28
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,500
Good morning, Saya... It's me.

29
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,708
Why are you here?

30
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,500
May I come in?

31
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,250
Yes, come in.

32
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,916
Tadayoshi told me you haven't
been feeling very well today.

33
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,333
No, I'm fine.

34
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,416
Clearly you're not.

35
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,541
He also said you had a
fever and to convince you

36
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,333
that you needed to stay
home from school today.

37
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,875
But, I...

38
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,708
And, since you're
not gonna be able

39
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,416
to come to the
café this morning...

40
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,333
I brought something
for you to eat.

41
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,666
I'll go warm it up
for you, right away.

42
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,083
But I thought you might
like some coffee first.

43
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,250
Thank you.

44
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,916
Just be careful;
it's pretty hot.

45
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,458
I really appreciate
you coming...

46
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,791
I hope it didn't cause
you too much trouble.

47
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,250
Trust me, it was no trouble.

48
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,916
Please, don't
even worry about it...

49
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
You're special to me.

50
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,875
You are more important
to me than anything...

51
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,166
'Kay?

52
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,125
I'll go get your lunch ready.

53
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,333
Try to get some rest
until I come back.

54
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,958
Maybe it's the fever...

55
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,625
My head is so cloudy.

56
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:24,291
I need to think...
but I can't...

57
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,666
And I'm... So sleepy...

58
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,250
Everything's blurry.

59
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,458
I'm shaking...

60
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,750
Has this happened to me before?

61
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,500
Or was it a dream...?

62
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,583
It wasn't...
It really happened, too.

63
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,916
Let's try it, then...

64
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,916
The two of us...

65
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,333
A dream?

66
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,083
But that place... it seems
so... so familiar to me.

67
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,208
You can stay home again today.

68
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,625
No.

69
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,208
Very well.

70
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,291
Would you mind telling
Fumito I'm sorry I wasn't

71
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,125
able to eat breakfast at
the café this morning?

72
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,750
I'll let him know.

73
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,166
Did the Eight Trigrams
reveal to you

74
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,125
that an Elder Bairn
would appear again today?

75
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,125
Just take it with you, Saya.

76
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,041
I'll be back later.

77
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,125
Please, be careful.

78
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,750
I will.

79
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,958
What's going on?

80
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,291
Oh, hi, Tokizane.

81
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,833
You weren't at school
yesterday, were you?

82
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,541
Uhh... No.

83
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,125
Why? Were you hurt?

84
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,958
I was... I guess...

85
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,625
Not too bad, though.

86
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,125
You can always
talk to me... okay?

87
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,750
Always.

88
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,250
Hey guys, sorry
if I'm interrupting

89
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,875
but class is almost
about to start, so...

90
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,250
Hey... How are you?

91
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,750
I'm fine, thanks.

92
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,958
Well, welcome back;
we missed you.

93
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,208
Saya!

94
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,375
We've all been worried since
you weren't here either.

95
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,041
What do you mean?

96
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,791
Haven't you heard about Nene...?

97
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,833
Nobody has seen or heard
from her in like two days.

98
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,583
Nono's been out of school,
too, because of it.

99
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,041
Take your seats, please.

100
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,000
Yesterday, I told you
Nene Motoe hadn't come home

101
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,666
since leaving school
the day before...

102
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,250
Her parents and the
police are saying

103
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,208
she still hasn't
called or returned.

104
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,083
I'm sure you're all aware...

105
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,333
but several incidents
like this have happened...

106
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,750
And most of them
have been local.

107
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,708
Then it really was true.

108
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,916
What was true?

109
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,500
Everyone's saying people are
randomly disappearing...

110
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,833
They leave to go somewhere and
nobody ever sees them again.

111
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,791
You know they never
did find that baker

112
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,875
we heard about at Guimauve.

113
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,833
You okay?

114
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,375
Nene...

115
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,958
Saya, what's wrong?
Are you all right?

116
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,041
My head... It's hurting.

117
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,666
Are you sure that's all?

118
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,708
She might just still be sick;
she was out yesterday...

119
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,833
Remember?

120
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,750
That's a good point...

121
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,291
Saya, you probably should
have stayed home again today.

122
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,250
Although, at this point
it doesn't really matter;

123
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,000
the police have asked us
to close down the school.

124
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,291
Go straight home and
don't stop anywhere.

125
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,625
Tomorrow morning,

126
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,000
we'll let you know if you
need to come back in.

127
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,916
Make sure you
answer your phones.

128
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,000
Saya?

129
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,125
Um... Yeah?

130
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,875
Take care of yourself.

131
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,666
I made a promise...

132
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,041
I will protect them... Everyone.

133
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,833
Promised whom?

134
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,166
Who said that?

135
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,416
Was it you?

136
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,916
No, that's ridiculous.

137
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,666
Maybe not.

138
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,166
But I could be wrong.

139
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,458
So it was you talking...

140
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,500
Hey, Saya. What's up?

141
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,708
Nene...

142
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:29,625
I mean... Nono.

143
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,791
Yeah... I'm Nono.

144
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,333
How could you tell?

145
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,458
Everyone else thinks I'm Nene.

146
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,458
I'm not really sure.

147
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,000
Did you know Nene
and I are identical twins?

148
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,666
If I change the part
in my hair to the left,

149
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,791
no one can tell the
difference between us.

150
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,625
So, then...

151
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,541
How did you know it
was me and not her?

152
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,583
I just... I did.

153
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,291
The day she disappeared...

154
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,000
You know where
she said she was going?

155
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,083
To see you...

156
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,625
She said she was worried.

157
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,625
After you collapsed
she started feeling guilty

158
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,000
and wanted to go check
and see how you were.

159
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,208
Saya...

160
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,708
Please, tell me what
happened to my sister!

161
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,583
Nono...

162
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,250
Why hasn't she come home?

163
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,750
Please, just tell me
where she is!

164
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,791
What happened to Nene?!

165
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,500
Say something already!

166
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,625
Why can't you just be
honest with me, Saya?

167
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,416
What happened to her?

168
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,208
Where did she go?

169
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,750
Please, I... Nono...

170
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,333
Why did you do that?

171
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,875
It was mean...!
You're the worst!

172
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,791
I'm sorry.

173
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,041
What was that?

174
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,541
What's going on out there?

175
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,125
What's wrong?

176
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,375
Why are you running
away from me?

177
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,208
Hey... Are you okay?
What's that?!

178
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,958
Nono?

179
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,041
Nono? Nono!

180
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,250
Wake up... Saya.

181
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,833
I am sorry you were
unable to save your friend.

182
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,375
I know it must be painful.

183
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,708
Father...

184
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,833
But understand...
you are the only shrine maiden

185
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:01,041
we can send to
fight the Elder Bairns.

186
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,375
I am the only one.

187
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,416
Saya...

188
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,583
What will you do
to the Elder Bairns?

189
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,291
Defeat them... I made a promise.

190
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,791
To whom, exactly?

191
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,458
To whom did you make
that promise, Saya?

192
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,500
It's you...

193
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:19,291
Next time on Blood-C:
"As Pitiless as the Storm."
