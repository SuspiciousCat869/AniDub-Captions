1
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,625
It's true. You did
make a promise...

2
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,666
But will you be able
to keep it in the end?

3
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:03,333
Or... will you break your vow?

4
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,375
It's all up to you, Saya...

5
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,458
The power is in your hands.

6
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:33,000
Run...! Everyone
get outside, now!

7
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,708
Hurry!

8
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,708
Come on... Stand up!

9
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,708
Hitomi!

10
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,750
This is our chance!

11
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,791
Right now?

12
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,916
Let's go!

13
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,250
Yoshito, no!

14
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,458
This way!

15
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,833
Wait for me!!!

16
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,250
Itsuki! Hurry up!

17
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,208
She's still down there...

18
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,125
How strange...

19
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,250
Why are you angry?

20
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,458
Why...? What?

21
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,541
I asked why you are angry.

22
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,000
How can I not be angry

23
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,916
when you're murdering
all of my friends?

24
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,583
Friends?

25
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,875
I'll... kill you!

26
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
Itsuki!

27
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,791
Run for it!

28
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,291
No more... Die!

29
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:08,708
I can't do this!

30
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,291
I gotta get out of here!

31
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,666
Move! You're in
my way! I said move!!!

32
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,333
To protect them...

33
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:08,583
I promised... I swore it.

34
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:14,500
I promised...
I'd protect everyone.

35
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:21,541
I promised... I...

36
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,416
Saya!

37
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,250
I'm, uh... I am so sorry.

38
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:42,625
Saya... Who are you?

39
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:49,833
I am... My name
is Saya Kisaragi...

40
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:55,291
My father...
is Tadayoshi Kisaragi.

41
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,666
He works as a
priest at the shrine...

42
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:03,291
And I... I attend
Sanbara High School...

43
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm in my second year there.

44
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,083
No!

45
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,583
That's not what I meant.

46
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,375
What are you?

47
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,458
Saya... Saya Kisaragi...

48
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,041
You're here... You survived.

49
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,416
It's dead...

50
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,250
And now... Have you
finally killed them all?

51
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,875
I couldn't protect them...

52
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,791
I couldn't save anyone.

53
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:38,166
Nene is gone... And Nono, too...

54
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,166
Even Yuka's dead now.

55
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,333
Thank you...
Thank you very much.

56
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,958
I haven't done anything.

57
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:48,750
You have. I didn't
want to be alone;

58
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,625
and you stayed with me.

59
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,791
Does it hurt?

60
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,416
Yes.

61
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,500
And, where does it hurt?

62
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,250
Is it in your head,
where you think?

63
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,041
Maybe...

64
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,458
The pain is in your body?

65
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:23,041
Or... do you feel
it in your heart?

66
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,000
There was a great deal
of development today...

67
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,666
The end is near.

68
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,208
To whom did you promise, again?

69
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,500
And, more importantly...

70
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,791
Who are you, Saya?

71
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,541
Think about it...

72
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,375
The truth lies
within the answers.

73
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:04,083
Also, it might be wise to
consider why you always

74
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:08,166
have such a difficult time
answering those questions.

75
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,666
Saya!

76
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,208
Tokizane?

77
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,500
What are you doing here?

78
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,333
What a relief?!

79
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,958
You're safe.

80
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,666
I heard what happened at school.

81
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:41,625
Everyone in class except
for Itsuki is gone...

82
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,000
Including Yuka...

83
00:17:51,583 --> 00:18:00,708
Everyone...
Everyone... Everyone?

84
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,666
What is it?

85
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,083
Tell me something.

86
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,541
Were you...
Were you at school today?

87
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,375
For a bit...

88
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,541
They're saying that some
kind of weird monster showed up.

89
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,083
And what about the school?

90
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,541
Did they call you?

91
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,041
You know, to let you know
they were going to be open?

92
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,291
Yeah.

93
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,750
That message
should have gone out

94
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,166
to everyone, though, right?

95
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,791
What?

96
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,708
The message to come to school...

97
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,416
It would have gone out
to everyone, wouldn't it?

98
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,166
Yeah, I guess it would've.

99
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,208
Then if so... How come
it was just class B?

100
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,125
The only students in the entire
school were from our class.

101
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,541
They were... running away...

102
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,333
But nobody else was
in the halls at all...

103
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,958
I was fighting
the Elder Bairn...

104
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,958
The other classrooms
were empty...

105
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,458
We were the only ones there.

106
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:04,458
No teachers, even...
Except for Miss Tsutsutori.

107
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:08,916
I don't understand...
Where was everyone else?

108
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,541
How did you manage
to survive the attack,

109
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,875
and how did you make
it all the way here

110
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:22,083
after everything
that's happened?

111
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,625
I guess... I was just
worried about you.

112
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,875
You were? Why?

113
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,166
I don't know!

114
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,000
Because I like you.

115
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,666
You're here...
because you like me?

116
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,416
That's right.

117
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,750
But why...?

118
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,166
And when did you
start liking me?

119
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,041
What do you mean...?

120
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:05,458
I see you in class all the time,
and I like being around you.

121
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,791
You do?

122
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,541
How long have we been in
the same class, Tokizane?

123
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,166
Saya...

124
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,333
Saya!

125
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,583
Why are you here?
It's very late.

126
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,541
Who might you be?

127
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,083
I'm Tokizane...

128
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,250
Saya and I are
in the same class.

129
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,708
Then you should know...

130
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,958
It's far too dangerous for
you to be out at this hour.

131
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,833
Right.

132
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,000
Well...

133
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,166
we can talk more
about this later.

134
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,250
Are you all right... Saya?

135
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,083
My name...

136
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,916
It's Saya Kisaragi...
It is, isn't it?

137
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,541
My name is Saya Kisaragi.

138
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,958
This is my second
year in high school,

139
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,208
and Miss Tsutsutori
is my teacher.

140
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:56,875
My best friends are Nene...
and Nono... and Yuka.

141
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:02,375
I'm also friends with Itsuki,
the Class Rep, and Tokizane.

142
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,666
My father is Tadayoshi Kisaragi.

143
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,625
He's a priest at
the local Shrine.

144
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:12,833
But... I don't... know...

145
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,416
Tell me why...

146
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,000
Why don't I know the
name of my own mother?

147
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,500
My mother's name and face...

148
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,333
I don't remember either one...

149
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,916
How can I not know that?

150
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,958
Saya...

151
00:23:57,041 --> 00:24:01,750
Saya...? Am I really
Saya Kisaragi?

152
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:05,000
Next time on Blood-C:
"Since 'Tis by Its Breath."
