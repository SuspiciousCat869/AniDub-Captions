1
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,666
Saya! What's wrong?

2
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,166
I messed up the omelet...

3
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,000
The end of it got all smushed.

4
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,625
It's okay...

5
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:14,833
Nothing to worry about,

6
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,625
we'll just have your
father eat that part.

7
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,000
No... You can't do that!

8
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:19,833
It's fine...

9
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,750
I'll take it.

10
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,500
But you should
have the best part!

11
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,791
Don't you understand...?

12
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,541
He loves everything
you cook so much

13
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,500
he'll eat up every last bite,
no matter how smushed it is...

14
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,541
Right?

15
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,875
Then on this knife I swear...

16
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,208
I'll work hard to give you
what you deserve, Father...

17
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,375
I'm gonna make you the best
breakfast you've ever had!

18
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,208
We thank you for this meal.

19
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:56,916
The food was good...

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,166
I'm so proud of you.

21
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,250
I'm glad you liked it...

22
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,833
Next time I'm gonna
work even harder to try

23
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,291
and make it perfect for you.

24
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:04,958
Here.

25
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:05,791
Enjoy, Saya.

26
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,041
Oh... Thank you so much.

27
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,000
Where's Father's?

28
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,916
I'm making it right now.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,125
In that case,
he can have mine first.

30
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,916
That's a nice offer, but
his is different from yours.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,166
Huh?

32
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,708
His is weak...

33
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,083
He doesn't have the stomach
for strong coffee like you do.

34
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,250
Really?

35
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,833
I didn't know that.

36
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,833
It's a fact, to be sure.

37
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,875
Guimauve!

38
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,458
Well, you said you liked it,

39
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,708
so I decided to
make you some more.

40
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,000
Is it okay if
I eat it right now?

41
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,250
Please.

42
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,166
It's so good...

43
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,000
It makes me feel kinda floaty.

44
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:55,833
Oh yeah...

45
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,208
That stuff's full of sugar.

46
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,958
It's more than
just a sugar rush...

47
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:03,458
As soon as I put it in my mouth,
I feel light as a feather.

48
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,041
When I have it
with the coffee...

49
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,625
The feeling gets stronger.

50
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,708
Ah, the perfect combo then...

51
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,500
Would you like a piece...?

52
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,125
It's "floaty"...

53
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,416
No. I think I'll pass.

54
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,875

00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,458
Hey wait, don't go that way!

64
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,958
You could get hurt
out here all by yourself...

65
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,291
It's not safe.

66
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,166
What if a car came?

67
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,041
So... You were
running late today

68
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,625
because you were
playing with a dog?

69
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,041
Yes.

70
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,250
Well...

71
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,500
Good for me because
that means I get to have

72
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,750
some help cleaning up
the chemistry room...

73
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,375
Talk about a mess.

74
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,750
This is my punishment...?

75
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,333
You sure there's not
anything else I can do?

76
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,750
No, this is all I need...

77
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,875
Thanks a lot, though...

78
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,958
They're pretty laid
back at this school...

79
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,500
...and I'm just a teacher...

80
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,583
...so I like to go
with the flow.

81
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,208
How long have you
been working here...?

82
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,958
Have you taught at
other schools before...?

83
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,750
I'm sorry to ask so many
questions, I'm just curious.

84
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,250
This is my first
go at teaching...

85
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,375
It's fun.

86
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,250
What did you do
before you came here?

87
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,166
Well, I was a researcher...

88
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,500
Although it was in a
somewhat different field

89
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,333
than the chemistry
I'm doing now.

90
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,125
So you quit to do this, huh...?

91
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,291
That's really neat.

92
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,208
Yep...

93
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,541
That's me...

94
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,500
If I decide I wanna learn,
I'm the type of person

95
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,208
who will do whatever
it takes to succeed.

96
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,333
If you don't mind me prying,

97
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,666
what exactly did
you wanna learn?

98
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,291
Something I could
only learn here...

99
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,125
Teaching at this school...

100
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,000
Enough about me, what about you?

101
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,375
Do you like it here?

102
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,875
It's amazing...!

103
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,916
I have so much fun and all
the people are really wonderful!

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,291
Good...

105
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,500
So you're not having issues
with your classmates?

106
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,666
Oh... I see ...

107
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,916
I'm not being rude

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,958
or doing anything that's
upsetting people, am I?

109
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,625
The thing is, my
father always tells me...

110
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,916
...sometimes I'm a little--

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,083
no, way more
than just a little...!

112
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,250
I'm completely unaware

113
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,291
of what he refers to as
"common sense"...

114
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,208
I've been causing
problems, right?

115
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,416
Not at all...!

116
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,125
Everybody loves you here Saya,

117
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,833
you don't have a thing
to worry about, alright?

118
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,125
Besides...

119
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,916
I like you... and that's
what matters... okay ?

120
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,541
Yes, of course.

121
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,166
So... If you ever wanna talk...

122
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,041
I'm always right here, Saya.

123
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,416
Umm...

124
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,875
Thank you.

125
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,416
Saya, it's you!

126
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,833
Is everything okay?

127
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,625
Today is a half-day, so
we're done with school early...

128
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,458
We should go
somewhere fun after this!

129
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,291
Just give it up, you two!

130
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,708
There's nothing fun
to do in this town...

131
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,166
Idiots.

132
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,791
Yuka is the meanest person
in the history of the world!

133
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,333
Forget her, I wanna
go somewhere anyway!

134
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,125
High school's supposed
to be awesome, isn't it?

135
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,833
Then how come ours sucks?

136
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,583
Nono... Nene...

137
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,125
Please don't cry.

138
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,250
Class rep!

139
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,416
Saya, what's up?

140
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,958
You said you found
a place in town

141
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,750
with really good
cake didn't you?

142
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,291
Yeah, I'm impressed
you remembered.

143
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,708
But you never told
me what it's called.

144
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,125
It's Guimauve.

145
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,375
It's good... Café Guimauve
has the best desserts in town.

146
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,791
Well, the bakery's
not half bad...

147
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,708
Although, the café does
at least serve coffee.

148
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,875
Oh...! It really is
depressing here.

149
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:25,791
Fun stuff...

150
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,875
Where's all the fun?

151
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:29,750
As a matter of fact,

152
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,000
I never thanked you

153
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,958
for refusing to go there
with me the first time.

154
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,208
Thank her?

155
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,125
I was just pretending
like I knew the place...

156
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,125
She not only knows it, she
goes there every single day...

157
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,375
If she had said yes,
I would've looked like a moron.

158
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,083
Oh... I get it.

159
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,208
All right! Let's go to
Guimauve and eat cake...!

160
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,208
That sounds like fun, right?

161
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,541
Cake, huh?

162
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,791
Do high school
kids even eat cake?

163
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,541
I guess it's better
than nothing.

164
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,625
Everything Fumito
makes is really good...!

165
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,833
You guys will love this place!

166
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,375
Will you come with me?

167
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,958
You were wrong...

168
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,375
Taking her to Guimauve
would've been a smart move.

169
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,333
Yeah, your guess is
as good as mine...

170
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,541
I never know what
she's gonna say.

171
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,208
It's a perfect day today,
don't you think?

172
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,958
Yeah, definitely.

173
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,583
The weather's all right,
but it's way too quiet.

174
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,708
This town sucks...
Yep... Big time.

175
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,000
You can complain all you
want to, but that's not gonna

176
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,416
make the scenery or the
population any less crappy.

177
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,625
Yeah but--

178
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,250
I don't know, it's so
nice and quiet here.

179
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,208
Don't you understand,
that's why we think it sucks?!

180
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,750
This place is gross...!
Super lame...!

181
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,625
It's a teenage nightmare!

182
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,791
Yeah!

183
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,458
You two...
You always talk in sync!

184
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,625
Like a bad comedy routine.

185
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,916
At least say "like a
pop-star" or something!

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,333
Or a big TV star!

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,541
I'm sorry, it's just...
I don't get it.

188
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,583
The thing is... I don't really
watch TV.

189
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,333
What?!

190
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,250
Wait, you mean like you don't
watch reality shows on TV?

191
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,250
No... I never do...
We don't own one.

192
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,666
No TV... Like at all?

193
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,583
Yep.

194
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,875
Hold on...

195
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,958
You actually mean
there's no TV in your house?

196
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,166
Yes.

197
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,958
So there's not
one in the den...?

198
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,583
In the bedroom or the
living room or anything...?

199
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,458
None?

200
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,625
Right.

201
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,500
Ew...!

202
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,125
Life without a flat screen!

203
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,291
That's no way
for a girl to live!

204
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,208
Oh, the humanity!

205
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,416
Oh, don't worry; it's
not a big deal at all.

206
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,916
What do you do
when you're at home?

207
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,250
Well, I help out around the
house...

208
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,458
...and... I guess
I read and do my homework.

209
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,875
What do you do for fun?

210
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,791
Father and I talk about stuff...

211
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh... and I really love going to
Café Guimauve too,

212
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,416
it's my favorite place!

213
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,916
Oh yeah...!
Come on, let's hurry!

214
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,708
Yummy cakes and hot
coffee are waiting for us!

215
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,083
Oh boy, this is not good.

216
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,458
Well...

217
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,041
Looks like you
brought some company.

218
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,166
It's 'cause your food's so good!

219
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,833
It really is delicious!

220
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,625
Yeah, it's the best!

221
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,083
Well, thank you very much.

222
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,458
You know, I'm not a
big fan of cake usually,

223
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,500
but this stuff is pretty good.

224
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,625
True... It really is tasty.

225
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,791
I'd be interested to
know how you make it.

226
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,916
Why do you ask that, do
you enjoy making cakes too?

227
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,708
Yeah, I love to cook...
and I'm not half-bad.

228
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,666
Oh...? Trying to
win points with Saya?

229
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,583
Is that right?

230
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,833
I guess I'd be lying

231
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,875
if I said I didn't want
to impress her a bit.

232
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,208
What's the matter?

233
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,125
Oh Saya, you're just impossible!

234
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,000
Hey... You know what
would've been lovely?

235
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,333
If Tokizane would have
come had cake with us...

236
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,291
I thought about inviting him,

237
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,958
but I guess he'd already
gone home for the day.

238
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,416
Saya.

239
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,791
Do you think I should feel
bad that she's so upset...?

240
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,666
Or maybe it's better
to ignore it all together.

241
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,250
Sit anywhere you like.

242
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,791
Sorry to be a bother,
but I'm not here to eat.

243
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,250
Oh... What is it?

244
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,916
Well... I just wanted to
let you know the owner of the

245
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,333
Nightingale Bakery has been
missing for over two days now.

246
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,791
The bakery?

247
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,708
There was a closed sign on
the door when we passed it.

248
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,625
Nobody has heard a thing...

249
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,791
His wife tells me it's unlike
him not to make any contact.

250
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:11,375
Oh my... I hope he's all right.

251
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,125
At this point, we
think it's very possible

252
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,708
something may have
happened to him...

253
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm warning
everyone in this area

254
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,375
to be extra cautious
and stay on the look-out.

255
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,583
Thank you for letting
us know, Officer.

256
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:25,041
And kids... make sure you
get home before dark, okay?

257
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:25,500
Right.

258
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,166
'Kay!

259
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,333
Thank you!

260
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,708
It can't be.

261
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,125
Another Elder Bairn.

262
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,708
It's elusive...
I could not detect it.

263
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,416
However, one will
surely appear tonight.

264
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,708
Keep your guard up...

265
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,958
It may be different
than the others.

266
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,375
Saya.

267
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,958
It doesn't matter
how strong it is.

268
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,375
I will defeat it,
Father... I swear.

269
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,458
The baker...

270
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:25,208
Remember...
Honor the covenant...

271
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,666
Do not forsake us.

272
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,083
Human beings evolve...

273
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:43,208
This may be true, but is
it so very black and white?

274
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,375
Aren't there some
parts that can change

275
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,791
and others that never will?

276
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:52,708
There's always a fundamental
portion that remains the same.

277
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,958
But imagine...

278
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,541
What if you were to
change at your core?

279
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,000
Would you be the same person?

280
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,708
Surely not, and
more importantly...

281
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:10,041
"Fundamental change."
Is it truly even possible?

282
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:14,083
Well, we shall see.

283
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,291
I don't get it, Tokizane...

284
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,166
You can't eat boxed lunches?

285
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,250
I'd rather sleep than eat.

286
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,333
Oh no!

287
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,458
You have to eat;
otherwise, you get sad.

288
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,000
You're an interesting
kid, you know that?

289
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,250
It seems like things
are going really well, huh?

290
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,541
Oh yeah, I'd definitely say so!

291
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,583
Looks like you might
lose your girl, Itsuki.

292
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,541
Don't worry...

293
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,000
I won't let that happen.

294
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,208
Yeah... Me neither!

295
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,791
Huh?

296
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:19,208
Next time on Blood C:
"That Has Made Me Sad."
