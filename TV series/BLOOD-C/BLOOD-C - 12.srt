1
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,208
You sure about this...?

2
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,625
Seeing you here might
be too much for her.

3
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,500
It's fine... She's too
far gone already...

4
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,666
Right... Saya?

5
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,375
Fumito... What...

6
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,458
So you're back then...

7
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,750
Shame but even giving you
the coffee at this point

8
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,541
wouldn't do you any good.

9
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,541
This isn't how it looks!

10
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,750
I mean, yeah, we might
have made a little mistake...

11
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,500
But it was only
a little bitty one...

12
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,666
If you think about it,

13
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,000
we can't really be
blamed for any of this.

14
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,583
We're just a couple of
kids being kids, you know!

15
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,458
And kids screw up!

16
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:08,916
It's natural; that's what we do!

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,166
Very good point...

18
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not surprised
you see it that way.

19
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,375
Thank you!

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,750
Well, here's the
way I see it...!

21
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:17,875
Give me the money you owe me

22
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,791
so I can get the
hell out of here.

23
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,000
Unfortunately, your actions

24
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,958
are a clear violation
of your contract.

25
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,708
I don't care!

26
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,041
So let me guess...

27
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,333
You're just a kid
being a kid, too?

28
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,958
I don't have any more
time to waste here.

29
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:37,250
I need to publish and
I need to do it now!

30
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,125
Those brain-dead old bastards
won't give me any more time...

31
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,625
On top of that...

32
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,333
New researchers keep showing up

33
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:46,291
and taking my grant money...

34
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,666
Those fools...

35
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,333
That damn committee
practically called me mad...!

36
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,583
They laughed at me!

37
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,250
First things first...

38
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,750
You need to take
your hands off Saya.

39
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,791
Saya... Are you hungry?

40
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,666
I'd like to give you
something to eat.

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,041
You naturally consume
things similar to yourself...

42
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:25,500
Similar things that have been
around, for a very long time...

43
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,333
Unlike you, they can
take on different forms...

44
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,583
And those forms

45
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,500
for the most part make
them extremely powerful.

46
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,416
Powerful and rather
hungry for humans...

47
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,750
I happened across their story
in some documents that were...

48
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,833
Well, let's say they

49
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,750
were classified higher
than top secret.

50
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,833
It's called the Shrovetide...

51
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,041
Nothing special, really...

52
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,375
The nation's leaders
made a modus vivendi

53
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,708
with an opponent they
could never defeat...

54
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,625
They allowed a certain quantity
of humans to be devoured...

55
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,500
And in return, they
were promised no more

56
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,166
than that would be killed...

57
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,541
Quite a fascinating
discovery for me.

58
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,833
How so?

59
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,791
For one, those ancient,

60
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,083
heteromorphic
beings intrigued me...

61
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,208
Do you know them...?

62
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,625
Let's call them
Elder Bairns, shall we?

63
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,458
The Shrovetide covenant
was created ages ago...

64
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,750
No one who knows or
handles the agreement now

65
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,791
understands how terrible
these monsters truly are...

66
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,416
Although, how would they?

67
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,333
Do you?

68
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,166
Yes, I'm well aware.

69
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,166
I'm terrified of them...

70
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,166
But, some people
desire to obtain power

71
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,833
because they're afraid of it...

72
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,583
When I was asked
whether or not I could use

73
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,875
the Shrovetide,
what was I supposed to do?

74
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:38,750
You're lying.

75
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,083
Am I...?

76
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,166
I already have all
the cards I need...

77
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,500
I made sure
to get a hold of him

78
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,458
in order to then
get a hold of you...

79
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,125
After that... Saya...

80
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,875
All I had to do was find you.

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,166
You don't feed on humans...

82
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,041
You feed on the blood
of those like you...

83
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,375
The Elder Bairns
fear you because of it.

84
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,916
To them, you're the monster.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,958
Now then, I've prepared food

86
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,375
and a feeding ground for you.

87
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,041
A place with clean air.

88
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:17,166
Quiet, devoid of outsiders.

89
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,583
Easy to control.

90
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,541
What for...?

91
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,958
What are you planning to do?

92
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,125
Just a little experiment...

93
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,375
Something I wish to discover...

94
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,625
What is that?

95
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,166
I want you to enlighten me...

96
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,083
Humans, by nature, change...

97
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,166
Of course, there are some parts

98
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,916
that modify and
some parts that don't...

99
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,291
But there's a fundamental
core that stays the same...

100
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,375
For example, your abilities,
your strength...

101
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,708
If those remained and we
simply adjusted your birthplace,

102
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,333
your surroundings,
your memories, even...

103
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,500
What would happen?

104
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,458
If all those things changed...

105
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,666
would you still be the
same person as before?

106
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,041
Would you think the same things?

107
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,500
Act the same way?

108
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,708
Or would you evolve
at your deepest level...?

109
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:14,791
Is it, in fact, possible for
that fundamental core to change?

110
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,625
So what? Why do you care?

111
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,583
You will not escape...

112
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,833
I know what you're thinking;

113
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,916
I can see that
light in your eyes.

114
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,333
I saw the same light

115
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,333
when you fought
my private guards, too...

116
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,083
You were beautiful.

117
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,625
I will not change.

118
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,458
I will not!

119
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,000
We should test it out and see...

120
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,291
Don't you think?

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,208
I remember now...

122
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,708
So, this is the stage

123
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,750
and they're the actors for
your experiment, is that right?

124
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,625
Of course.

125
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,666
I did it all for you, Saya...

126
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,166
You swore to me you
would never change...

127
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,708
But I wanted you to...

128
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,583
It seemed we were at
a crossroad of sorts...

129
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,833
So, I decided if we
were going to do it right,

130
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:10,666
there was going to
be a winner and a loser.

131
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,333
With a prize for the winner...

132
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,958
...and a penalty...
for the loser.

133
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,666
Has the show ended, now?

134
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,416
Like, you know, the grand
finale or whatever they call it?

135
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Oh, yeah!

136
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,666
Her memories are
back so the jig is up.

137
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,083
Hooray, for us!

138
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:25,958
It's over!

139
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,375
So you don't need us anymore...

140
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,625
We're finished, aren't we?

141
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,375
Absolutely...

142
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,666
If our actors won't
act any longer...

143
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,083
They can go ahead
and leave the stage.

144
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,166
What's wrong with his
talisman, it didn't work!

145
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,750
Yes...

146
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,166
Alas, the ones I gave you after
your first deaths were fake...

147
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,291
They're not going to work.

148
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,166
No, no!

149
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:28,125
Let me go!!! Let me go! No!

150
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:33,791
No!

151
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,125
Please, somebody help!

152
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,916
It hurts! Please somebody help!

153
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,500
You're next, Kanako.

154
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,000
I expected your betrayal.

155
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,166
That's why your talisman
has been fake the entire time.

156
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,166
Thanks for your performance.

157
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,333
What weapon she uses
doesn't matter, does it?

158
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,916
Correct...

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,083
That nonsense about the shrine
maiden and the sacred blade...?

160
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,333
That was all
just part of the story.

161
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,750
As long as it can draw enough
blood, anything will work.

162
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,916
Save me! Save me!

163
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,291
It's you... Father...

164
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,583
Please, help me; please,
you have to save me!!

165
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,375
Help me!

166
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,291
Looks as though he drank

167
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,583
too much of your blood
this morning, Saya...

168
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,791
I guess you're not the only
one who's back to normal.

169
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,666
You knew what would happen
when you gave it to him.

170
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,041
See, I knew you were back...

171
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,541
How nice.

172
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,583
I assume you know what
he is now... Don't you?

173
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,375
An Elder Bairn...
A half Elder Bairn.

174
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,041
Yes, the result of congress

175
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,291
between a human
and an Elder Bairn...

176
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,166
That's why he has
a human form...

177
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,583
However, his powers...

178
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,083
Well, they're far greater
than a mere human...

179
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,833
He's the closest
being to you, after all.

180
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,625
Which is most likely the reason
you obeyed him so blindly...

181
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,958
Of course the false memories of
his being your father did help.

182
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,958
I thought it was a nice touch.

183
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,416
With the appropriate
suggestions,

184
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,041
your blood controls him...

185
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,083
...in addition to
the Elder Bairns.

186
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,958
So you'd given my blood to
the Elder Bairns I encountered.

187
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,375
I gathered it before
we started this game...

188
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:55,208
It was the only way I could
force them to do what I wanted.

189
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,250
Appear where I needed them...

190
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,333
Attack people you
thought you love.

191
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,583
If you have control over them...

192
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,041
Why allow so many
innocent people to be killed?

193
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,791
It was more efficient to
have the main cast survive,

194
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,125
but there was
no particular reason

195
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,166
for us to worry about
keeping the extras safe.

196
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,666
Oh, come on, don't
make that face at me...

197
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,708
Humans don't matter to you.

198
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:48,125
You aren't like them, and you
certainly don't eat them.

199
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,541
You can't do that because
you're under another compulsion.

200
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,583
Not because of me.

201
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,583
I didn't do that to you.

202
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,833
I just used that knowledge
to make the false memories...

203
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,208
You can't kill humans...

204
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,000
That was an arrangement
you had with someone else...

205
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,541
A contract you made.

206
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,750
Yes... To protect
that person from you.

207
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,833
So I promised you
if you were the winner,

208
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,583
I'd make sure you
could kill humans again.

209
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,333
And if I won, well...

210
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,500
Clearly you're not strong
enough as a human to beat her...

211
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,125
Time to change.

212
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,666
Listen to me; you're being
controlled by my blood!

213
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,083
Go back to normal.

214
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,166
Just go back.

215
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:15,875
Saya.

216
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,208
Tadayoshi.

217
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,416
Did you find where the...

218
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,916
Where the light leads...?

219
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,083
You should know...

220
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:03,083
Being with you... Saya...

221
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,458
Made me happy.

222
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:12,250
You were the only one
I ever met like me...

223
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,250
I think that's why...

224
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,416
Hurting you hurt me, Saya...

225
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,000
You were my girl.

226
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,583
Thank you for that.

227
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,666
I'm sorry, Father.

228
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:54,166
I bet you want to kill
me now... don't you...?

229
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,208
It isn't quite time
for that yet... Not yet...

230
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,833
You won't get away!

231
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,333
Saya!

232
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,208
Tell me why...

233
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,916
I'm not sure...

234
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,625
I was supposed to be
an actor in a silly game.

235
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,875
But then... after awhile...

236
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,416
I think I started to
really care about you...

237
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,333
I couldn't help it.

238
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,041
The one you cared for wasn't me.

239
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:56,125
No... I suppose not, huh...?

240
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:00,125
But I know she's still
a part of you... Saya.

241
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,041
Why are they doing this to us?

242
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,833
Who's controlling them?
What is this?!

243
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,875
Hey, let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!

244
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,458
This isn't right!

245
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:24,708
How amusing...

246
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:25,916
It appears you're
the only member

247
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,208
of the main cast to survive.

248
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,458
Well, I can't die;
I have goals to accomplish.

249
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,625
You wanted to be
Governor of Tokyo, wasn't it?

250
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,958
Yes, that's right...

251
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,625
It's the only reason I pretended

252
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,458
to be a high school
student for you...

253
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,333
In return...
I'm hopeful you'll help me.

254
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,833
I didn't tell you yet, did I...?

255
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,958
Your beloved guimauve...?

256
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,166
It was made with the
blood of your kills...

257
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,708
I knew you'd enjoy it...

258
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,208
Did you know? Its texture is
said to be like human organs.

259
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,666
Perhaps if you get the
chance to kill me one day,

260
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,958
you can find out for yourself...

261
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,500
Goodbye, Saya.

262
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,500
Before her capture,
Saya made a wish...

263
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,000
She wanted to stay herself...

264
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,500
I granted it, however...

265
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,791
It's time to reach
for the next one.

266
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,791
Saya... Now...
About... That wish...
