1
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,791
This place...

2
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,291
Today it's like nothing
ever happened...

3
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,500
What is this?

4
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,041
Saya?

5
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,708
Fumito?

6
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,541
Are you okay?

7
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,375
Oh yeah... I'm fine...

8
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,416
Really, it's just--

9
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,875
It's not nice to lie...

10
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,541
What's wrong?

11
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,041
Look, I know you don't want
anyone to worry about you...

12
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:59,291
But we can't help if you
keep hiding things from us.

13
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:00,958
Don't forget...

14
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,458
If you ever wanna talk,
I'm here... 'kay?

15
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:07,958
To be honest...

16
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,625
I feel a little confused
right now and...

17
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,750
My head...

18
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,458
It feels weird.

19
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,416
Is it hurting?

20
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,166
Yes.

21
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,583
Good news is you don't
seem to have a fever.

22
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,458
I know...

23
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,125
Plus... I don't feel weak...

24
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,541
It's strange, I have no
idea what's causing it.

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
No caffeine for you then...

26
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,958
I don't think this
is gonna help any.

27
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,500
I'd love some actually...

28
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,083
Your coffee makes
me feel so relaxed.

29
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,375
All right then, if you say so.

30
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,375
Here... Enjoy.

31
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,333
Maybe this is just what I need.

32
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,416
It's good.

33
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,000
Glad you like it.

34
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,583
This is perfect...
I feel so calm...

35
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,125
Like I don't have a
care in the whole world.

36
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,333
She just fell asleep.

37
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,041
I see.

38
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,958
You should know.

39
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,541
She told me she has a headache.

40
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,541
The Elder Bairns
came, didn't they?

41
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,208
Be ready.

42
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,458
Can you do this?

43
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,958
I swear... I'll defeat it.

44
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,666
You are Saya, I presume.

45
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,666
That's one.

46
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,125
Too bad.

47
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,708
I must say I am unimpressed...

48
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,333
I find it hard to believe you're
the one who slew my comrades.

49
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,583
She's gone.

50
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,791
I can't see a thing.

51
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,666
The covenant has
not been honored.

52
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,791
This is the punishment.

53
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,875
Covenant?

54
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,125
Between who...? Tell me!

55
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,208
The humans... and our kind.

56
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,041
What promises were made?

57
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,541
Oh no!

58
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,833
Please...! Help!

59
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,791
Are you okay?

60
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,041
Your face has the
look of a wild hunter.

61
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,291
I swear... You won't touch them.

62
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,458
I'll save everyone
I care about or die trying!

63
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,291
You are wasting your time.

64
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,625
Can you not see?

65
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,041
She's always
one step ahead of me.

66
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,875
What promises were made?

67
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,958
Are you all right?

68
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,750
Covenant...?

69
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,166
Between the humans
and the Elder Bairns?

70
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,375
That dog.

71
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,625
When a human being encounters

72
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,083
that which they can
never understand...

73
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,791
What do they do...?

74
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,166
Naturally, they
search for answers.

75
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,041
They ask themselves questions...

76
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,375
What just happened to me...?

77
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,250
How do I reconcile this...?

78
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,833
What am I supposed to do now...?

79
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,500
Then again the more you
think about something...

80
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,375
Often times, the
further your mind

81
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,916
will lead you away
from the truth...

82
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:32,250
Yes... Your thoughts will only
get in the way...

83
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:38,041
...of what your instincts truly
desire, to know the real answer.

84
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,458
Hey, space cadet.

85
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,916
What's wrong with you?

86
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,875
Hey, Yuka.

87
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,166
Are you depressed because
gym class got rained out...?

88
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,333
It's only for one day... Right?

89
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,708
Yeah but...

90
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,041
It's not about the weather.

91
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,250
Really...?

92
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,541
Are you feeling sick?

93
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,291
No, I wouldn't say that...

94
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:12,500
I'm fine it's just I...
There's so much going on...

95
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,250
So much I don't understand.

96
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,125
Like what?

97
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,625
Well, uh... I'm not sure why,

98
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,708
but my head feels kinda heavy...

99
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,083
I'm in a whole lot of pain,

100
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,666
almost like it's
hurting for me to think.

101
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,416
Tell me what's happening.

102
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,791
Is something bothering you...?

103
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,500
Or are you in trouble?

104
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,416
Whatever's going on,
you can talk to me...

105
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,791
I'm right here.

106
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,083
I mean, come on,
what are friends for?

107
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,166
Yeah.

108
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,541
Listen... up!

109
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,791
Instead of gym class,

110
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,583
we're going to be having
a study hall today!

111
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,041
Scary stories...! Who's got 'em?

112
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,875
Well... It is the perfect
day for that sorta thing.

113
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah!

114
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:54,833
All right...!

115
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,625
Who wants to go first then?!

116
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,083
That's not a bad idea.

117
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,333
You guys are supposed
to be studying though...

118
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,833
Correct me if I'm wrong,

119
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,791
but I'm pretty sure that's
why they call it "study hall."

120
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,250
Come on; cut us some slack.

121
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,708
How 'bout we compromise:

122
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,500
you can study us
while we tell scary stories.

123
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,208
Where's the educational
benefit in that?

124
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,666
What could it hurt...?

125
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,875
Plus, the class rep was right;

126
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,958
this weather's perfect
for a scary story...

127
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,041
Okay, I'm in!

128
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,166
All right!

129
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,791
But first, you
have to go sit down.

130
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,250
Huh?

131
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,750
That's no fun;

132
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,916
we'd have to do the exact
same thing in a real study hall!

133
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,291
Yeah...

134
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,000
We should at least rearrange
all the seats, right...?

135
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,291
We could set up the chairs

136
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,875
just like we're in a
little tiny movie theater!

137
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,625
Why go to all that trouble?

138
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,583
'Cause...! You see.
We get so scared.

139
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,375
That way we can leap into each
other's arms when we need to!

140
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,000
Those two sure are obsessed
with scary stories, aren't they?

141
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,083
A little bit too
obsessed if you ask me.

142
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,416
Why not...?

143
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,541
This'll be a whole lot more
fun than a study hall...

144
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,750
You can arrange the
chairs however you want...

145
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,041
Wait just a second.

146
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,708
Where exactly do you
think you're going, Tokizane?

147
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,791
Crap.

148
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,958
Slowly, the man
approached the child...

149
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,166
Silently, he moved in close.

150
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,625
He reached out his hand...

151
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,125
And grabbed the
boy by the shoulder.

152
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,541
And then...

153
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,666
The child turned
and faced the man...

154
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,250
He looked at him and said.

155
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,208
"Please, Daddy...

156
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,666
I've been such a good boy,

157
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,958
don't push me off
the cliff this time."

158
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,583
Help!

159
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,833
That's the fakest scream ever!

160
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,541
What a mean
thing to say, Yuka...

161
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,500
Honest, we were really scared!

162
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,000
You circus clowns, saying that
in unison makes it more fake!

163
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,791
That was a great story, huh?

164
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,375
Uh...

165
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,333
I don't get it, why did he take
his own child to the cliff...?

166
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,458
That's dangerous.

167
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,541
Man...

168
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,750
When you're trying
to build the story

169
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,875
to a climax and
no one's paying attention...

170
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,375
It makes you
feel like a big loser.

171
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,166
It's not our fault you told a
story everyone already knows.

172
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,916
Yeah, but couldn't
you say the same thing

173
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
about most ghost stories?

174
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,666
Maybe, but...

175
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,708
You've gotta make
it relatable at least...

176
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,750
You know.

177
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,958
"You guys...

178
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,500
This really happened
to my father's ex-wife's

179
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:22,166
brother-in-law's second cousin
once removed." Or whatev.

180
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,958
That is a very
specific relationship...

181
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,458
I bet you lunch tomorrow
you can't say that twice.

182
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,125
I'd rather hear stories
that happen closer to home.

183
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,916
Like in this town.

184
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,416
Huh?

185
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,416
It's totally scarier if
it feels more real.

186
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,875
That's true, but nothing
ever happens here.

187
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,125
Is that right?

188
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,250
I know a story about this place.

189
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,458
You're like the
best teacher ever!

190
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,583
Hold on...
I don't know about this.

191
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,625
Don't be a baby...!

192
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,250
It's a ghost story, after all...

193
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,250
It's scary, that's
the whole point!

194
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,791
But... what if it
really happened?

195
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,666
Oh, it did.

196
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,083
From what I can tell, it
seems to be a true story...

197
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,333
And according to the legend,

198
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,750
if you hear the ending,
it'll happen to you too.

199
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,000
No way... That's a bit much.

200
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,375
Something will happen...?

201
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,250
You have no idea...

202
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,333
I'm so bored,
every single day...!

203
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,750
Teacher...! You can count me in!

204
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,750
I don't wanna hear any
complaining later...

205
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,333
Got it, Nene?

206
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,500
The story goes like this...

207
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,833
Since days of old, inhuman
things have lived amongst us,

208
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,958
even in this village.

209
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:29,791
Sometimes...

210
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,791
They take on unusual forms,

211
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,875
very different from a human...

212
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,083
And other times,

213
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,416
for some reason,
they choose to look like us.

214
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,666
But still... These creatures...

215
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,583
They're alike in one respect.

216
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,750
They feed on human beings.

217
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,166
Because they're so all-powerful

218
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,375
and people are
so weak and fragile,

219
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,541
they think of us the
way we'd view an animal.

220
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,666
No matter how dear
someone might be to you...

221
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,750
No matter how
much you love them...

222
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,166
They'd be nothing
to these creatures

223
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,916
but a lesser life-form...

224
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,291
A species that isn't
fit to be anything more

225
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,958
than a source of
food for their survival.

226
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,166
The story goes...

227
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,291
Somehow, the humans
attempted to communicate

228
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,291
with these inhuman monsters...

229
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,083
Because, at least
according to the legend...

230
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:21,666
A few of these creatures had the
ability to speak our language.

231
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,375
They tried... In the end
though, it was in vain.

232
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,416
In vain...? But why?

233
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,083
Because, from the point
of view of these beasts...

234
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,416
Human beings...?

235
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,291
We are nothing but food to them.

236
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,666
So together...

237
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,291
The villagers...
They came to a resolution.

238
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,166
What was that?

239
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,541
Saya!

240
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,166
Saya?!

241
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:14,875
Are you all right?

242
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,083
C'mon, wake up...! Hey!

243
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,833
Saya...? Saya!!!

244
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,250
I can't believe
I fainted in class...

245
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,708
It wasn't the thunder, I'm not
scared of stuff like that.

246
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,500
And what did she mean...?

247
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,916
Resolution?

248
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,458
Saya!!!

249
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,833
He actually called me
by my first name...

250
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:05,875
And it really did seem like

251
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,750
he was genuinely
concerned about me.

252
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,083
I don't know why, but...

253
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,291
Suddenly, something
seems very wrong.

254
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,916
Saya, you there?

255
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,583
Wait, I know that voice.

256
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,750
Hey, Nene!

257
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,541
Hey!

258
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,833
Sorry to keep you waiting!

259
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,125
Oh, I just got here!

260
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,750
But... I'm amazed you
could tell it's me so quick...

261
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,833
Most people couldn't tell the
difference to save their life.

262
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,875
I can see it.

263
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,833
You look the same but
you're different people...

264
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,208
It's obvious.

265
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,958
That totally rocks...!

266
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,416
But when we're not
next to each other,

267
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,666
doesn't it get harder
to tell who's who...?

268
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,333
I couldn't even do that,
and she's my sister!

269
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,541
I don't quite know
how to explain it,

270
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,208
but I can tell you apart...

271
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,375
It seems perfectly
clear to me...

272
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,083
Nono is Nono and Nene is Nene.

273
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,416
Yeah, that's true.

274
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,583
So what's up?

275
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,333
Were you just stopping
by to hang out...?

276
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,625
I've got some homework
to do, but it can wait.

277
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,458
Actually, I wanted
to apologize for earlier...

278
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,208
I feel like the whole
thing was my fault,

279
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,916
I practically begged the
teacher to tell the story.

280
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,041
I just wanted to make
sure you were doing okay.

281
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,708
I'm fine.

282
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,250
Thank you.

283
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,958
Nono was mad, she tried to
stop me and I didn't listen...

284
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,208
I guess I was just wondering
if you were mad at me too.

285
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,291
No way, I'm not mad at you...

286
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,166
As a matter of fact, I think
it's sweet you're concerned.

287
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:37,875
Yeah but...

288
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,625
I was really worried about you;
you didn't look good.

289
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,083
I'm great...

290
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,958
Other than my head hurting
a little bit, I'm wonderful.

291
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,708
Does it hurt because
you fell down?

292
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,458
Uh, no...

293
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,875
The pain's been
going on for a while.

294
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:50,916
Yikes...!

295
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,583
Now I'm worried
about that, too...!

296
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,166
But don't sweat it, if
anything was gonna happen...

297
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,708
With my luck, it
would happen to m--

298
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,500
What's going on?!

299
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,916
Look out!

300
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,125
A monster!

301
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,041
Hey there, Saya...

302
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,125
Answer this question:

303
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,375
Do you know which
one of us is Nene

304
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,541
and which one is Nono?

305
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,458
Umm, the one on
the right is Nene

306
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,458
and the one on the left is Nono?

307
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,208
That's right!

308
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,083
Great job!

309
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,208
But how could you tell?

310
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,750
I don't know,
I just know somehow.

311
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,791
Yeah, well what about now?

312
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:07,791
Riddle me this...

313
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,708
Is one of us the
real Nene or not?

314
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,708
Why are there three Nene's?!

315
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,708
Oh... You'll have to guess.

316
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,375
Next time on Blood-C:
"Dashed by Fierce Winds."
