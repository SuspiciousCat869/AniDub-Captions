1
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,666
It's like no matter
what we do to try

2
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,791
and make her remember,
she just keeps changing back

3
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,958
into this lame
version of herself.

4
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,541
Seriously!

5
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,083
Every time we start thinking she
might know what's going on...

6
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,208
Whatever she remembers
goes like, right out the window.

7
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,916
I... What?

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,916
Didn't I tell you it's time
to stop all this nonsense?

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,166
You don't have to
keep playing the game.

10
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,666
We've spent the entire
summer on a farce,

11
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,208
and I'm done with it...

12
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,166
How long is long
enough for you, Saya?

13
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,208
The... summer?

14
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,125
What an idiot?!

15
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,208
She still doesn't get it!

16
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,000
We've been putting on this
stupid show for, like, ever...

17
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,375
You want some more proof?

18
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,416
This weird outfit isn't
even a real school uniform.

19
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,833
Ooh, nice!

20
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,833
At least we surprised
her a bit this time!

21
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,166
Do you know what one is
supposed to look like, though?

22
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,500
What uniform did you
wear in elementary school?

23
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,750
Or middle school...?

24
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,166
Do you know?

25
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,666
Do you remember who you
were in class with last year?

26
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,333
You don't, do you?

27
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,000
Would you like to know why?

28
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,333
It's because they
never existed, Saya.

29
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,500
Although, they might be planning

30
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,541
to introduce them
into the story later!

31
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,291
If it doesn't blow up
in their faces first.

32
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,375
But...

33
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,541
I, uh...

34
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,708
I know, you're on
your mother's path...

35
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,125
She was a shrine maiden, too.

36
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,125
What was her name again?

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Do you happen to
have a picture of her?

38
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,750
Any specific childhood memories

39
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,041
of you and your beloved Father?

40
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:29,916
No. You don't have a
single memory, do you?

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,791
But I... I am...

42
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,083
Go on... Who are you?

43
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,833
I'm Saya... Kisaragi...

44
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,750
Kisaragi... Right.

45
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,166
Stupid.

46
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,166
Yeah, for real...

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,375
Giving her that name is

48
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,416
the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

49
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,166
Hey...!

50
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,500
Do you know what
it means...? Kisaragi?

51
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't.

52
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,375
Its meaning is to
change one's robes...

53
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,458
To become someone else...

54
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,958
For a girl who
has been convinced

55
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,541
she's someone she's not,
it may be the perfect name.

56
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:13,875
So... Miss Kisaragi...
No, Saya...

57
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,333
Even if your head is telling
you you're someone else...

58
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,958
I'm still willing to bet...

59
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,583
What's in here
hasn't changed at all.

60
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,000
I mean, not that we really
care or anything, though.

61
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,500
Sorry.

62
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,625
We just want to get back to
our own lives already, so...

63
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,333
Yeah.

64
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,166
We're not the only ones.

65
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,416
Tokizane?

66
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,083
How?

67
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,625
All I want to do
is finish this job

68
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,333
and get the money they owe me.

69
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,708
You are so totally heartless.

70
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,000
Like you two are any different.

71
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,375
The only reason
we're doing this is

72
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,500
so we can get other
jobs when we're done.

73
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:12,333
Can you blame us?

74
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,875
The economy is awful!

75
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,208
Are you telling me you
actually took main cast roles

76
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,958
in this stupid production out
of future employment concerns?

77
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,500
What does main cast roles mean?

78
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,083
Oh! It means we're very
important to the story!

79
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,958
It's the two of us, of course...

80
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,583
Your handsome Tokizane...

81
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,375
Yuka... Mister
Class Rep, Itsuki...

82
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,333
And, don't forget...
Kanako Tsutsutori.

83
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,750
All the other people
are cast as extras...

84
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,833
But... Just because we've
managed to stay alive...

85
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,041
...don't assume anyone
else had that luxury.

86
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,458
It's true...

87
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,083
The members of the main
cast are considered special...

88
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,750
So they gave us talismans
to keep those monsters away.

89
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,000
Pretty fancy protection, huh?

90
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:00,000
Then, all the people
who disappeared...

91
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,541
They're all...

92
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,791
They're all dead.

93
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,291
It's funny.

94
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,666
I've actually had a
really good time...

95
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,500
But...

96
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,041
I'm kinda over it now.

97
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,208
I know; it's just too
much work and time...

98
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,333
Especially for
such a boring reward.

99
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,250
What did they promise
to give you guys, anyway?

100
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,250
Funny story...

101
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,083
We were a little... bad...

102
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,916
And if the cops found out...

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,500
It could cause some trouble.

104
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,458
By trouble, she means
we'd probably go to jail.

105
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,125
Luckily... they said...
they'd take care of it.

106
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:36,333
And we won't have to worry
about it anymore... Yay!

107
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,916
So basically you're
both criminals?

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,500
Oh, get off your high horse.

109
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,541
Yeah, you knew the
extras were going to die,

110
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,291
and you didn't do
anything to help them.

111
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,916
Someone was having
too much fun playing

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,416
the "bad boy" role
and getting close

113
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,333
and personal with
the leading lady.

114
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,666
The hell I was.

115
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,541
Okay, okay.

116
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,875
That's enough...

117
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,666
Seriously, calm down.

118
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,916
You're freaking Saya out.

119
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,791
You're freaking her out more
than anyone else, Teacher!

120
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,791
Wait...

121
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,958
She's not a teacher at all!

122
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,125
Tell me that you brought it.

123
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,375
Yeah.

124
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:12,375
Hey!

125
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,500
Rude!

126
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,083
Is that what I think it is?

127
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,416
Yeah.

128
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,916
Nice...!

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,416
You talked about it,

130
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,333
but I didn't think you'd really
be able to come through!.

131
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,625
How'd you do it?

132
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,458
I pretended to be attacked
and got it when I ran.

133
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,666
What?! Crazy!!

134
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,250
I couldn't have done that...

135
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,958
It's insane!

136
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:46,125
I didn't want to
either... however...

137
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,208
I don't want to have to deal
with those nut jobs anymore

138
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,583
or with this monster.

139
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,791
Well...

140
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,291
As soon as we can
get Saya to drink,

141
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,625
things should start
moving along quickly.

142
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,708
That being said, I cannot
guarantee the results...

143
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,041
Do you understand?

144
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,166
Naturally.

145
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,875
Yeah.

146
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,583
All you have to do is
drink this... Trust me.

147
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,375
It's the blood of those
you call Elder Bairns.

148
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,416
Look how strong you are.

149
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,583
It would appear the
rumors are correct...

150
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,875
I see why the US military

151
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,125
and Japanese government
would want to keep you a secret.

152
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:36,291
Saya, an inhuman
thing in human form.

153
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:52,333
Does your strength come from
the fact that you aren't human?

154
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,791
Or is it because of the
life you've lived so far...?

155
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,750
I want to know.

156
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:07,791
I want you, Saya...
and for that to happen.

157
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,208
I need you to take a nap.

158
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,625
This is the effect of
drinking their blood...

159
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,458
She starts remembering.

160
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,458
Oh...

161
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,083
I've seen that before.

162
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,458
It's so weird, drinking
that nasty monster blood

163
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,000
makes her eyes turn
all red and creepy.

164
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,625
Haven't you seen
her do that, yet...?

165
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,333
I have... It was
when I pretended

166
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,958
to be attacked but
ran away instead.

167
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,333
After she killed
the monster thing,

168
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,541
she started drinking its blood.

169
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,541
Like on purpose drinking it.

170
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,625
Hey...

171
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,333
At least she's pretty!

172
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,000
You know, most inhuman
things found in legend

173
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,125
and myth are said
to be beautiful.

174
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,333
Really...? What happened
with those monsters, then?

175
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,875
The Elder Bairns
are hardly relevant...

176
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,250
Saya is special...

177
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,416
Originally, my research focused
on ancient poems and songs...

178
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,166
Did you know most
of those old verses

179
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,125
are packed with hidden riddles?

180
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,291
They aren't just
silly romantic balladry.

181
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,500
There are hidden stories
in almost all of them...

182
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,625
...bizarre creatures
and strange events...

183
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,583
Saya... That was where
I first heard about you...

184
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:28,375
After that, I changed my focus
and dug up everything I could...

185
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,958
But you're still
such a mystery...

186
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,125
I am sure of one thing, now...

187
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,250
You are strong and beautiful.

188
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,208
You're practically a god...

189
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,541
You are something far
greater than mankind...

190
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,833
...yet you are not a monster.

191
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:41,916
Cool!

192
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,375
Well, you are the
star of the show.

193
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,583
The monsters are
just loser extras.

194
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,625
You're the best
protagonist ever!

195
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,458
A star with no script...

196
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,291
Although I guess it
helps that you didn't know

197
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,250
you were in a movie
in the first place.

198
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,333
Good point...

199
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,958
I still don't get
how you could just

200
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,666
like completely forget all
that weirdo stuff you did.

201
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,333
Simple... That decision was made

202
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,000
by the person
behind the experiment.

203
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,958
You were given false memories
and anything necessary was done

204
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,125
to keep you from reverting
back to your original self...

205
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,041
Maintain the farce at all costs.

206
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,750
Would you be the lie
they created for you...

207
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,250
...or would you change...?

208
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,125
Would Saya take
her life back again?

209
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,083
Why the hell would
anyone care about that?

210
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,500
No idea.

211
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,583
Only the creator of this
cruel game can tell you why...

212
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,708
Interesting.

213
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,166
So this is all
about you not wanting

214
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,958
to go along with
the story anymore...

215
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,541
And you needed the three
of us to help you out.

216
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,083
Which explains why you
had us come here to try

217
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,583
and get her memories back
instead of going to Guimauve

218
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,791
where you were told to
just ruffle up her feathers.

219
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,875
Yes.

220
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,041
This isn't gonna
backfire on us, is it?

221
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,416
I mean, coming here?

222
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,750
Of course not.

223
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,625
I'll tell them it was
part of shaking her up...

224
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,208
What's more, I shut off

225
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,416
the camera that
monitors the storeroom.

226
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,833
Nice!

227
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,541
Well played, Miss Tsutsutori!

228
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,083
She's not our teacher;
we can just call her Kanako...

229
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,083
As if that's her real name.

230
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,875
We all had to change
our names, right?

231
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,416
Obviously, yes...

232
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,916
How else could anyone expect

233
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,583
to find so many obscurely
named people all in one place?

234
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,000
Tell me...

235
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,250
What did they promise to
give you in return for this job?

236
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,083
I only wanted to
see the real thing.

237
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,416
And now I have, haven't I?

238
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,291
Yes...

239
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,958
Folklore and mythology
have always been

240
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,291
a source of
fascination for me...

241
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,166
But being able to
experience the truth

242
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,500
was something
I couldn't live without.

243
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,291
I came here for one reason...

244
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,708
And that was to
see it for myself.

245
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,666
To see an authentic Shrovetide,

246
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,000
not this fake one
that they have created.

247
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,041
Okay...

248
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:44,958
Shrovetide?

249
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,875
What the hell does that mean?

250
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,666
It means... to allow...

251
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,083
And to eat... and crimson...

252
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,958
Basically, it's an
agreement allowing

253
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,500
the beasts to eat humans.

254
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,250
You're kidding... right?

255
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,166
I have spent years searching...

256
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,625
Those small-minded old fools at
the universities made fun of me

257
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,041
for believing it existed,

258
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,291
but that didn't stop
me from looking.

259
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:11,125
And here it is...
right in front of me.

260
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,333
You're real... Saya...

261
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,500
Real... and those creatures
you call Elder Bairns...?

262
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,333
They're every bit
as authentic as you.

263
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,291
The experiment just won't end...

264
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,458
We should have been
done with it all by now...

265
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,000
This is his doing...

266
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:29,791
That man...

267
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,458
No, that bastard...

268
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,416
He keeps using
drugs and hypnosis

269
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,041
to force you into staying this
silly Saya Kisaragi character.

270
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,291
I'm sick of it!

271
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,875
Once you're back
to the old you...

272
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,166
I'll make sure you find
the damn Shrovetide for me.

273
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,416
Now, drink...

274
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,791
Drink the blood of the
so-called Elder Bairns.

275
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:48,875
Come back to me...!

276
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,291
Come back!

277
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,166
Regain your true self!

278
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,500
The tranquilizers work,
but clearly they don't last.

279
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:09,166
I am relieved they were at least
effective the first time...

280
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,750
Otherwise, even he might not
have been able to catch you...

281
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:14,916
However...

282
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,791
I certainly can't have
you running around

283
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,416
out of control again.

284
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,958
My apologies...

285
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,833
Don't worry...
I won't take it all.

286
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,208
Your blood is precious...

287
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,500
It needs to be put to good use.

288
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:45,166
Although... First,
I should give a taste to him...

289
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,291
And the rest...

290
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,708
Well, it's been
promised elsewhere.

291
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:53,041
Saya... Are you hungry?

292
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,000
I'd like to give you
something to eat.

293
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,250
Well, I guess
the important thing

294
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,458
is we're almost finished
with this stupid job.

295
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,333
Oh, come on...

296
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,375
It hasn't been that awful...

297
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,958
The uniforms are cute.

298
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,541
Yeah, but they're totally out
of place for a high school...

299
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,333
No one would take them seriously
if we were in a real town...

300
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,708
Well, I didn't think
about it that way...

301
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,875
Why do you figure
they designed them

302
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,208
to look like this, though...?

303
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,625
I've never even heard
of black and red uniforms.

304
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,583
Maybe to hide... you know.

305
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,708
To hide what?

306
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,750
All the blood.

307
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,458
Yeah, that makes sense!

308
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,708
When she kills those monsters,
she gets soaked with blood...

309
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,333
This way nobody sees it.

310
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,250
True... Not that it matters;
we're almost done here.

311
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,416
Hey... Do you think they'd
let us take them when we go?

312
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,416
What the hell would
we want these for...?

313
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,375
It'd be like wearing a costume.

314
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,416
Yeah... That's kind
of the idea...

315
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,041
We wouldn't wear them.

316
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,291
Yes! You're a genius...

317
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,500
For the girls, right?

318
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,125
They can put 'em on
when they're working.

319
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,208
We'll be less likely
to get caught...

320
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,541
But, we'll still be
making plenty of money.

321
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,375
Perfect...

322
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,166
We'll be back in business...

323
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,916
Sounds like a plan.

324
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,541
What's going on...?

325
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,666
Her memories
should have returned

326
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,416
after drinking the
Elder Bairn blood...

327
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,333
This is taking far too long.

328
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,833
What?! No way!

329
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,625
Are you all right, Saya?

330
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,208
Your orders were
to report immediately

331
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,041
if there was any
change in the star

332
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,541
so what exactly are you doing?

333
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,000
We know you've been gathering
secretly without checking in...

334
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,875
Evidently, you're
up to something

335
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,416
We didn't do anything.

336
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,458
What do you mean?

337
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,833
Don't play the innocent
card with me, ladies...

338
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,333
The main cast is under
constant surveillance.

339
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,916
Not when we're
off duty, we're not!

340
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's right...!

341
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,666
Not to mention,
when Saya wasn't around,

342
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,166
we made sure to turn off
our GPS and camera stuff!

343
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,791
Are you kidding...?

344
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,708
You didn't know there
were more than that?

345
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,958
The experiment is
still very much active...

346
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,125
We'd like to know what you're
trying to accomplish here.

347
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,791
They haven't even
killed me off, yet...

348
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,791
Now, look at what
you've done to her...

349
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,000
She's been weakened...

350
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,375
Hurting the star tops the list

351
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,291
of things you're
forbidden to do.

352
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,458
You're overreacting.

353
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,041
We didn't do
anything that bad to her.

354
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,125
Relax.

355
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,541
We didn't tear off
her fingernails.

356
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,541
Or break any of her bones.

357
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,083
You should blame Kanako.

358
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,500
She's the one who told us to.

359
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,541
I did nothing but
tell them the truth!

360
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,916
The cast does not need
to worry about the truth...

361
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,541
That's not our job.

362
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,416
Well, I don't care!

363
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,666
I just wanna go home.

364
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,875
We want this stupid
thing to end, already!

365
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,416
Don't complain now.

366
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,666
You knew what the terms were.

367
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,416
And you agreed
for your own profit.

368
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,375
I didn't agree to near death...!

369
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,041
I want my money!

370
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,125
I couldn't care less
who gives it to me!

371
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,708
Once that thing gets
her memories back,

372
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:40,125
Kanako said she'd hand my cash
over to me, and I could leave!

373
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,833
But what about our deal?!

374
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,083
He said he wouldn't
just take care

375
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,458
of our last bout with the law...

376
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,583
...he'd completely
expunge our records!

377
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,791
We needed that!

378
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,250
You stupid bitch!

379
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,250
You said nobody
would find out about this.

380
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,291
You lied to us!

381
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,708
How could you even believe her?

382
00:20:56,791 --> 00:21:00,958
The entire town was created
specifically for this project...

383
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,208
The buildings, the people...

384
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,833
Everything you see.

385
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,625
It's impossible to hide
anything in this place...

386
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,041
Impossible.

387
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,083
What is he talking about?

388
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,750
Seriously!

389
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,458
I honestly didn't care
what happened to you.

390
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,000
The bottom line for me
was if we kept this up,

391
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,041
Saya's memories
would never come back.

392
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,125
Experiment, my ass...

393
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,666
He has no intention of
allowing this farce to end!

394
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,083
He overwrites her memory
every time it returns!

395
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,416
If he keeps her like this,

396
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,583
I'll never be able to
reveal Saya to the world!

397
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:34,708
You what?!

398
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,291
I don't give a damn
about the world...

399
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,166
I've been risking
my life, daily...!

400
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,666
Someone better
give me my damn money!

401
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,750
What the hell?!

402
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,833
If he finds out,
we won't get anything!

403
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,500
Just shut up!

404
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,083
I'm already out of
time with her...

405
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,541
At this rate, I'll be
banned from publishing...

406
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,125
And I have living proof!

407
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,916
She's right here in front of me.

408
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,250
Come on...

409
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,625
Remember who you are,
so he can pay...

410
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,750
He will... I swear!

411
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,916
Oh, will I?

412
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:20,000
Tell me...
How am I going to pay?

413
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:55,375
Saya, what do you
believe defines a person?

414
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,833
Does nature define you...?

415
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,500
Or does nurture decide?

416
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:03,708
Next time on Blood-C:
"If Remembering Me."
