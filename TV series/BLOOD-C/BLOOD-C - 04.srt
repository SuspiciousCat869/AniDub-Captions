1
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:06,041
Remember...
Honor the covenant...

2
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,500
Do not forsake us.

3
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,708
Saya.

4
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,041
Oh, good morning, Father!

5
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,583
How're you?

6
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,666
It's still early...

7
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,166
What are you doing up?

8
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,916
You should've stayed
in bed and rested.

9
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,583
Don't worry;
I'm tough, remember?

10
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,708
Not just physically...

11
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,916
Your emotional wounds
need care as well.

12
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,916
Yes... I feel bad
about the baker...

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,500
I just couldn't
save him... and...

14
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,041
And?

15
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,875
Before the Elder Bairn died,

16
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,250
it told me something odd...

17
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,500
It said... for me to
honor the covenant.

18
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,750
They've never
spoken to me before.

19
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,041
Not until now.

20
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,708
I'm confused...

21
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,750
What it said...

22
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,875
This covenant...

23
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,500
Do you know what
it meant, Father?

24
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,916
What are these
Elder Bairns to you, Saya?

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,750
They are my enemies.

26
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,958
You must not allow yourself to
be distracted by their words...

27
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,500
Trust your heart... always.

28
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,083
Yes... I will.

Father looked
so worried earlier.

42
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,875
It's because
I got hurt; I know it.

43
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,208
I need to be stronger for him.

44
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,916
I can't believe how, like, way
perfect the weather is again.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,625
At least there's something
nice about today...

46
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,458
I heard some bad news earlier.

47
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,500
Oh... About the baker?

48
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,875
The bakery is still closed...

49
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,791
That's not good.

50
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,291
Looks like he never
did come back...

51
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,750
He's just gone.

52
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,166
A katana...? But why...

53
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,541
It's so strange.

54
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,333
I checked the
bakery this morning.

55
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,750
Some guy there told
me he was still missing...

56
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,625
So sad.

57
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,291
That police officer
went all the way

58
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,791
to Guimauve just to warn us.

59
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,750
They must have been
looking for him then.

60
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,500
Apparently nobody's
even heard from him.

61
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,333
I bet I know what happened.

62
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,416
He was probably over living
in this boring, crappy town

63
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,916
and just ran away from home.

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,416
I don't think it's
technically running away

65
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,791
if you're already an adult.

66
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,375
Then... what is it?

67
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,791
Uh, disappearing?

68
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,291
Yeah!

69
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:02,750
Hey!

70
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,291
And she's off!

71
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,458
It's the dog!

72
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,750
What dog?

73
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,291
Please, wait!

74
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,083
Watch out!

75
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,291
Please, get off, of me.

76
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh! Um... I'm sorry...!

77
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,041
Are you hurt?
Uh... Do you need help?

78
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,166
The nurse?

79
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,875
Get off, first.

80
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,208
I'm so sorry, Tokizane!

81
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,958
At least you're not hurt, so...

82
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:50,500
Tell me... What were you
climbing that tree for anyway?

83
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,791
To catch the, dog.

84
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,875
A what?

85
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,125
A puppy...!

86
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,875
I mean... I'm not sure
if it's a real puppy...

87
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,500
...but it is really tiny.

88
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,750
And uh, how exactly did you end
up in a tree chasing this dog?

89
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:07,666
He was jumping from branch
to branch, so I followed him.

90
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,375
Sure it was a dog, not a... cat?

91
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,458
I'm sure! It was a dog.

92
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,750
Okay... Now, if you don't hurry
up and eat, lunch will be over.

93
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, yeah!

94
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,875
Well, aren't you gonna eat?

95
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,833
No, I prefer sleeping to eating.

96
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,000
That's not good...!

97
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,333
You have to eat;
otherwise, you'll get sad.

98
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,500
Uhhh... Haven't you
said that before?

99
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,333
Yes, I have, because it's true.

100
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,708
Of course... You're funny, Saya.

101
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,375
That looks nice!

102
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,416
What?

103
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,291
You look better
when you smile...

104
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,791
Did you know that?

105
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,125
Thank you.

106
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,083
We can share this
if you want to...

107
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,500
You'll like it; I promise...

108
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,750
Fumito's lunches are the best.

109
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sure you know him...

110
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,166
He owns Café Guimauve
next to the shrine...

111
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,166
Have you been there before?

112
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,916
I've been there.

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,666
Would you like a rice ball?

114
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,750
Does it taste okay?

115
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,500
It's good... I guess... Yeah.

116
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,958
Thanks! I'm glad you like it!

117
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,416
But you didn't make this, right?

118
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Right...

119
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,000
It just makes me
happy when someone

120
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,625
compliments Fumito's cooking,

121
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,833
so I like to say thank you.

122
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,041
Okay, so what do you
think about this Fumito guy.

123
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,291
I love him.

124
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,291
Where do you think Saya went?

125
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,208
There is no telling.

126
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,416
Is something, wrong?

127
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,333
Why, exactly?

128
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,208
What?

129
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,958
Why do you love him?

130
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,250
I don't know;
I just really like him...

131
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,583
To start with, he's nice,

132
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,333
and he's the best
cook I've ever met,

133
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,583
and no matter what he's doing,

134
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,750
he always takes the
time to listen to me.

135
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,500
No, that's not what I mean!

136
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,041
So, that's all it
takes to love, then...?

137
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,458
He's a nice, cook
who listens to you?

138
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,875
Is that love...?
It seems too easy.

139
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,791
He really said that to you?

140
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,291
He did...

141
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,666
I'm not even sure
what his point was;

142
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,958
maybe I said
something to upset him.

143
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,791
No, I seriously doubt it.

144
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,125
Yeah?

145
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,708
He always seems like
he's upset with me, though.

146
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,500
I'm sure he's just got
his own stuff going on...

147
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,250
Don't forget he's still young.

148
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,666
It's yummy.

149
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,166
Your coffee is the best...

150
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,291
It never fails to
make me feel better.

151
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,500
Well, I do make it
just for you. Here.

152
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,250
Guimauve!

153
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,958
Yes, enjoy...

154
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:54,375
I think you've earned
something nice.

155
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,958
Thank you, Fumito!

156
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:13,166
Are you okay?

157
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,250
Hey... What's wrong?

158
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:19,250
Sorry... I just kind of
spaced out, I guess.

159
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,750
You sure you're okay?

160
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,166
I'm fine.

161
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,625
You know you can
talk to me, right?

162
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,166
No matter what it is.

163
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,833
I'm here.

164
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,041
Thanks.

165
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,625
It's not a simple thing to
change a person's emotions...

166
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,583
And, as long as those
feelings remain engraved

167
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:54,916
into their heart, it doesn't
really matter what they are.

168
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,000
I imagine the most
difficult emotion

169
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,791
to affect would be hatred...

170
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,708
Many people will tell you
such negativity doesn't last...

171
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:06,041
But that's not quite the
same as going away, is it...?

172
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,625
Hatred remains...

173
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,375
It only hides where
you cannot see it.

174
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:16,375
Given the slightest opportunity,
it will reassert itself.

175
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,791
 Now then...

176
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,125
Given hatred's persistence...

177
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,750
What is one to do if they wish
to eliminate it for good...?

178
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,625
The only possibility
is to overthrow hatred

179
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,500
with an equally
powerful emotion.

180
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,708
I will protect them...
I promise.

181
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,375
To conquer an
emotion as strong as hatred...

182
00:12:55,166 --> 00:13:00,166
Well... Only love
and trust will do.

183
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,958
Yamada!

184
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,416
What?

185
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,333
Get out of here, now!

186
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,291
Right!

187
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,416
Come on, let's go!

188
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,291
This isn't what they
said it would be.

189
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,958
I know.

190
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,708
I didn't realize they ate
their own kind, too.

191
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,458
Run...! Hurry!

192
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,208
Is it you...?

193
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,125
Are you the one who
is trying to destroy us?

194
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,791
It appears you do
not know how to fight.

195
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,541
The others...

196
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,750
He's controlling them.

197
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,791
You are the same.

198
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,541
The ones above
control those below.

199
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:53,041
Meanwhile, they work
for others above them.

200
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,041
But there are some things
that cannot be controlled.

201
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,125
Honor the covenant.

202
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,375
I don't... What covenant?

203
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,208
The Shrovetide.

204
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,958
The Shrovetide?

205
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,458
We eat because we must.

206
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,208
Let this be a warning.

207
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,500
Interfere again, and we
will dine on you as well.

208
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,291
You are my enemy.

209
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,541
All I do is fight.

210
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,208
Shrovetide...? I...

211
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,791
I can't...

212
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,541
This is...

213
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,750
Saya!

214
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,416
I did it.

215
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,000
Are you hurt?

216
00:20:56,083 --> 00:21:01,166
Yes... But don't worry;
I should be all right...

217
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,000
There were three this time.

218
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,416
I killed them all.

219
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,666
And what were these
Elder Bairns like?

220
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,458
They said they
were the same as us.

221
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,000
They did?

222
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:16,083
They said... to honor
the covenant... again.

223
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,000
Nene Motoe?

224
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,000
Here!

225
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,000
Nono Motoe?

226
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,291
Here!

227
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,416
I'm so sorry I'm late!

228
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,541
Good morning, Saya...

229
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,250
I passed Kisaragi
in the K's, though.

230
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,583
I'm sorry; it won't
happen again.

231
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,833
Well, I haven't finished yet,

232
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,041
so I can give you
a break this time.

233
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,125
I completely understand
why you're late.

234
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,708
It's so gorgeous outside.

235
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,125
If you ask me, it's going
to be a perfect, peaceful day.

236
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,125
It's raining today.

237
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,708
I guess it had to eventually.

238
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:54,958
We won't have gym class,

239
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,833
so you can have a
study period, instead.

240
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,375
Let's tell ghost stories!

241
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,041
Talk about the best idea ever!

242
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,583
Yeah, um...

243
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,250
I don't think that's what a
study period is for, you guys.

244
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,500
What's wrong, Itsuki?

245
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:06,916
Are you worried you're
gonna get too scared?

246
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,375
No, that's not it at all!

247
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,875
Whatever. I'm going home.

248
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,250
Excuse me...

249
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,166
What exactly do you think
you're doing, Tokizane?

250
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,916
Next time on Blood-C:
"Meeting in the Way."
