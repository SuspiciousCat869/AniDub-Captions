1
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,625
I see...

2
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,333
So you believe time
ultimately defines

3
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:13,375
what a person will
eventually become...

4
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,750
Fascinating...

5
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,791
Over time, one has
various experiences...

6
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,083
Various interactions
with others...

7
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,083
And these shape the individual.

8
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,541
However...

9
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:11,500
I do not believe experience
is the complete story...

10
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,333
"Why?" you ask...

11
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,291
I'll show you.

00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:23,375

Fumito?! I didn't see you there!

24
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:15,708
Oh...

25
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,916
I'm so embarrassed.

26
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,833
Well don't be...

27
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,625

00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,916

31

Please stop!

32
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,291
Your father's even showing up
in your songs now, isn't he.

33
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, yeah, but it's
for a good reason.

34
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,291
When he says it won't rain...
it never does!

35
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,041
He's right...

36
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,166
It will be okay!

37
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,833
You sure that isn't just
because he checks out

38
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,833
the weather reports
every morning?

39
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,666
It doesn't matter; he's still
never been wrong about it,

40
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,166
and I ask him every day!

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,583
You really do love
him a lot, don't you?

42
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,041
Yes!

43
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,250
For you.

44
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,458
What is it?

45
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,708
It's a reward.

46
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,083
You know, for getting
all your laundry done.

47
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,541
And your chores too.

48
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,791
You heard the
laundry part, too...?

49
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,791
I must have been
singing so loud...

50
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,208
This is awful.

51
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,666
I have to say, your voice
is surprisingly lively.

52
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,958
Go on and eat it...

53
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,000
It's called guimauve.

54
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,083
That's the same
name as your café.

55
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,041
Yep...

56
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,375
That's right.

57
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,791
You like to drink your
coffee black, don't you?

58
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:41,875
Yeah.

59
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,166
I just think it tastes
better that way.

60
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,833
I have to drink the
coffee you make here

61
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,166
at least once a day;
otherwise, I feel weird.

62
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,541
Glad you like it...

63
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:55,041
...and... the two should
go well together.

64
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,708
It has kind of an
unusual texture.

65
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,583
In a bad way?

66
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,291
No, it's great!

67
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,375
Good answer!.

68
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,625
That's what I was
hoping you'd say!

69
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,375
I can't believe how yummy it is!

70
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,875
You know, I thought
those little cakes you had

71
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,583
my father bring me not too
long ago were pretty tasty, too!

72
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,541
You liked those, huh?

73
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,833
Yes! I like any kind of sweets!

74
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,958
You probably didn't
know this about Tadayoshi,

75
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,791
but he's got a
sweet tooth himself.

76
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,125
Really?

77
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,541
I had no idea; he's never
eaten snacks with me.

78
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,333
He must be embarrassed.

79
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,250
Oh, well, should I not
have a sweet tooth then?

80
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,583
Is it something that I need
to be embarrassed about?

81
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,541
Not at all...

82
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,500
You are perfectly adorable.

83
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,000
But then...?

84
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,916
Adult men don't like to admit
they've got a thing for sugar...

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,791
It's not necessarily
the most masculine trait.

86
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,500
Are men not supposed
to eat sweets?

87
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,625
Oh no...

88
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,125
But I'm guessing
Tadayoshi thinks

89
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,000
he's cooler than
a sweet tooth...

90
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,916
And he wants you
to think so, too.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,125
That doesn't make sense.

92
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,166
I already do think he's cool.

93
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,791
I'll be sure to tell him that...

94
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,916
And, while I'm at it,...

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,750
I'll let him know
it's too late...

96
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,583
You know about his love of
all things saccharine already.

97
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,458
Guimauve!

98
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,250
Take it.

99
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,083
You mean, this is for me?

100
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,541
Of course.

101
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,000
Wow, thank you!

102
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,208
♪ Guimauve, guimauve... ♪

103
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,500
♪ I think it
tastes wonderful. ♪

104
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:57,000

105
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,500
You know, they say
guimauve's texture

106
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,875
feels a lot like something else.

107
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,458
What is it?

108
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,375
Good question.

109
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,333
I wonder what that
something else could be.

110
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,958
What does it feel like?

111
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,125
Good morning, everyone!

112
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,250
What held you up today?

113
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,375
A dog.

114
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,458
You saw another abandoned dog?

115
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,500
Not exactly;

116
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,208
it wasn't abandoned...
just alone.

117
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,458
Wouldn't that make
it abandoned, then?

118
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,833
No... I don't think so;

119
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,416
it was pretty calm
for the most part

120
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,291
and acted like it knew
precisely where it was

121
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,291
and what it was doing.

122
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,916
Was it like a big dog?

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,708
No...

124
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,000
It was small.

125
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,041
A puppy?

126
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,541
No, full grown;
he was just small.

127
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,125
His fur had this really
weird pattern on it.

128
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,333
Weird like how?

129
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,458
Oh...

130
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,625
Good morning,
Class Rep, how are you?

131
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,166
Good, thanks...

132
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,291
If you started using my actual
name, I'd be better, though.

133
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,708
Does that mean you want me

134
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,541
to call you Class Rep
Tomofusa from now on?

135
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,875
Uhh... No, that's not
what I was saying.

136
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,666
Oh no!

137
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,041
Itsuki's pitch goes wild!

138
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,708
And Saya doesn't even
know she's supposed to play!

139
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,208
When they're this
good at ignoring you,

140
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,833
it makes you want to get their
attention that much more.

141
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,708
We believe in you, Itsuki!

142
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,750
It's time for class, guys.

143
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,166
Late again Tokizane?

144
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,625
Sorry about that.

145
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,458
That apology of yours barely
keeps you out of trouble, too.

146
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,958
Morning, Tokizane!

147
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,500
Impressive.

148
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,666
That looks good...

149
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,000
D'you make it?

150
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,375
No, Fumito made it for me...

151
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,791
He's a great cook.

152
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,041
Who's Fumito?

153
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,583
Café Guimauve?

154
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,958
You've heard of it, right?

155
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,708
Of course I've heard of it.

156
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,083
It's the only café in town.

157
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,375
It's also the only place

158
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,666
that even remotely
resembles a coffee shop.

159
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,000
Fumito owns the café.

160
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,083
You must know him
pretty well for him

161
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,125
to make you fancy
lunches like that.

162
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:51,291
I guess so; he went to the same
high school as my father did.

163
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,166
Really?

164
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,750
That's kind of surprising...

165
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,125
He seems like he's a
lot younger than your dad.

166
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,375
He is.

167
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,666
Apparently, they didn't
attend at the same time.

168
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,166
Well, that explains it.

169
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,166
Way to break that ice, Itsuki!

170
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,708
You like totally still
have a shot with her!

171
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,250
Well, thank you... I'm trying.

172
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,500
Hey, guys...

173
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,250
Do you know what guimauve is?

174
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,583
You mean like, the cafe?

175
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,625
No... The candy.

176
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,958
Oh yeah...

177
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,083
The one that kind of looks
like a pink marshmallow?

178
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,500
What about it?

179
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,916
Have you tried it before...?

180
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I heard its texture feels
just like something else.

181
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,833
I don't know; I've never had it.

182
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,583
I have.

183
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,416
Me too!

184
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,041
So, what do you think
it feels like, then?

185
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,750
It's just like a kiss!

186
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,958
A what?

187
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,541
Saya, you know what
a kiss is, don't you...?

188
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,125
Yeah... I sorta figured saying
that would freak her out.

189
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,333
You can do it, Itsuki!

190
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,333
Well, thank you...

191
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,333
I'll keep at it, I guess.

192
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,416
If you don't hurry up and eat,

193
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,833
lunch will be over
before you finish.

194
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,916
Oh, yeah.

195
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,541
That's so cool.

196
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,750
Yeah, it is.

197
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,791
I wish we had a homemade lunch.

198
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,875
What are you girls eating today?

199
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:19,958
Bread!

200
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,916
It's from the
Nightingale Bakery.

201
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,416
I love the bread from there...

202
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,166
All their stuff is so good!

203
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,166
Which is helpful; it is
the only bakery in town.

204
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,833
Yeah, if it wasn't good,
we'd starve to death.

205
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,041
This place has got
just one of everything.

206
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,625
There's even only one
supermarket.

207
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,583
Come on, there's more
than one of some things.

208
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,750
Like what?

209
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,500
Like places to hang out.

210
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,041
Quit complaining.

211
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,708
It's not like we
have a choice...

212
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,666
This is more of a village
than a town, if you ask me.

213
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,250
Yeah, there aren't
many people here...

214
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,625
It's practically abandoned.

215
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,458
That's the truth.

216
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,375
But it's really great here...

217
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,333
Nice and quiet.

218
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,791
Uh, seriously...?

219
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,583
You like it... here?

220
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,416
Yeah!

221
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,583
Hey, Saya!

222
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,666
Excuse me!

223
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,500
Tokizane!

224
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,208
Hi... Are you hungry?

225
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,416
Sorry?

226
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,958
Have you eaten?

227
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,541
No... Not yet.

228
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,541
If you don't hurry up and eat
something, lunch will be over.

229
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,625
Yeah, wellI'm not hungry.

230
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,500
You should still eat.

231
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,333
Why's that?

232
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,041
Because you have to...

233
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,958
Otherwise you'll get sad.

234
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,125
Try this!

235
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,708
No thanks.

236
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,208
Do you like it okay?

237
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,375
Yeah... it's good.

238
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,333
Thank you!

239
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,625
What a relief?!

240
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,375
I don't get it.

241
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,833
Why are you thanking me?

242
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,875
Well, for starters you ate it.

243
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,125
Also...

244
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,333
You were complimentary...

245
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,083
And then that made me happy!

246
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,916
She is ridiculous.

247
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,916
Oh no...

248
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,083
You think she likes Tokizane?

249
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,333
I don't know, but technically,

250
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,291
they did just
have lunch together.

251
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,500
Hey... I hope that doesn't scar.

252
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,666
Saya!

253
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,750
Stop standing
there like an idiot.

254
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,416
We're almost done eating;
move it or lose it.

255
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,041
Right, sorry!

Father!

267
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,375
I'm back; did you
have a good day?

268
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,416
Yes, I did... Saya...

269
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Yes?

270
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,166
I'm glad you're so cheerful...

271
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,916
...but that song
you were... singing...

272
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Don't tell me you heard me, too?

273
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,958
Uh... Yes.

274
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,666
You went to the archive today?

275
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,750
I did.

276
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,041
Were you looking
for something specific?

277
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,125
I was trying to find the one
who named them Elder Bairns.

278
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,708
So far, I haven't been able to
find it in any of the books...

279
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,791
However, based upon entries
I have repeatedly uncovered

280
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,666
throughout the documents,
these creatures

281
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,916
have been feeding on
humans for a very long time.

282
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,916
They've been feeding on humans?

283
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,708
You're the only
one fighting them...

284
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,291
So you know this
better than anyone...

285
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,291
They are incredibly strong.

286
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,458
Yes.

287
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,750
And you also know
the only thing capable

288
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,250
of defeating these evil beings.

289
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,208
The sacred blade.

290
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,000
Correct.

291
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,250
Your mother fought
the Elder Bairns

292
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,416
using the sacred
blade as well, Saya...

293
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,583
She fell to them.

294
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,708
I won't fail... I promise.

295
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,750
I'll defeat them.
I swear Father...

296
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,458
I'll protect everyone.

297
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,041
I will protect them.

298
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,958
Oh no! I was
finally late to school!

299
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,375
Let me guess; you were
up late watching TV?

300
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,333
The news or a comedy
show or something?

301
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,250
The shopping channel
or a documentary?

302
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,208
A variety show or
a singing show?

303
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,666
A travel show or a cooking show?

304
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,666
Um, I'm not entirely
sure what those things are.

305
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,250
The Kisaragi family
secret is finally revealed...

306
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,166
What could the
shocking truth be?!

307
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,416
This is lame.

308
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,541
Next time, on Blood-C:
"As for Man."
