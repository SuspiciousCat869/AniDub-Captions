1
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,583
I don't understand.

2
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,375
This woman was my own mother...

3
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,916
She was the priestess of
the shrine, just like I am...

4
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,583
And she used the
same sacred blade

5
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,333
to defeat the Elder Bairns.

6
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,291
But it's just that I...
I don't know...

7
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,958
I can't remember
anything else...

8
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:49,041
Not even her name.
Father. I try. But I can't.

9
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,083
Saya!

10
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,625
Slay it.

11
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,666
At last... Yes... It's you.

12
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,916
Or, perhaps I was mistaken.

13
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,250
However, I find this
very entertaining...

14
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,250
The time has almost come.

15
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,750
So sad... It must be terrible,

16
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,208
to know that no matter
how hard someone tries,

17
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,375
they can never be in control.

18
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,916
You can relate to
this feeling, yes?

19
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,791
Wait, what?

20
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,666
You feel free and
yet you are not free.

21
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,333
Though certainly,
you must get hungry.

22
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,208
You have gone without
food for quite some time,

23
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,833
you must be starving.

24
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,041
And lately, no matter
how much you eat,

25
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,083
your stomach yearns for more.

26
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,333
They break the covenant
and what do you do?

27
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,583
You help them by
waging war on my kind.

28
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,125
There was a time you would
have seen this so clearly,

29
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,625
but you have forgotten your way.

30
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,250
How very foolish of you.

31
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,083
What's going on?!

32
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,666
I heard fighting!

33
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,625
I am famished, aren't you?

34
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:29,250
So hungry I no longer
care about taste.

35
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,708
I only want to feed.

36
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,375
To eat a human child.

37
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,375
Tell me: does that anger you?

38
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:45,083
Your kind needs sustenance
as well, do they not?

39
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,333
And besides...

40
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,583
you eat of a far more
forbidden fruit than we.

41
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,166
You are the one
who is in the wrong.

42
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,666
It's time.

43
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,916
We must decide upon a reward...

44
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If you keep your
promise until the end,

45
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,166
what shall I give you...?

46
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,208
What will your prize be?

47
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,708
And if fortune makes it

48
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:28,083
so defeat is the only
recourse you have...

49
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,583
What could I take from you?

50
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,083
Saya... What's the matter?

51
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:47,291
I see... You need to feed.

52
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,708
Poor thing.

53
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,666
Here... Eat.

54
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,208
Enjoy the pain...

55
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,791
I feel no pity for
a puppet of deceivers

56
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,708
who break their own covenant.

57
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,541
Saya?

58
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,916
Ask your father...

59
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,500
Tell him you want
to know the truth...

60
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:15,000
...about you. Who you are.

61
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,458
I am Saya... Saya Kisaragi.

62
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:29,041
I'm me... Saya.

63
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,000
Aren't I?

64
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,208
Who am I?

65
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,625
Saya?

66
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,500
Drink this. Please.

67
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,083
Go on.

68
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,125
How do you feel?

69
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,708
Is your head hurting again?

70
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:12,208
No... Now that I've had
some coffee I feel better.

71
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,416
Good.

72
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,625
Fumito?

73
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,333
Have more.

74
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,916
Thank you very much.

75
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,666
You want something to eat?

76
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,708
Actually, yes...
I'm really hungry.

77
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,500
What would you like?

78
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,750
Guimauve.

79
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,708
Sure.

80
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,333
I've been craving it.

81
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,875
Thanks a lot, I sure
do love this stuff.

82
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,708
Is it always pink like this?

83
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,625
Well, it all depends on
the ingredients you mix in...

84
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,916
Although... I thought
making it this way

85
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,833
would really hit the spot.

86
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,208
You do like it... Don't you...?

87
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,291
The color and the taste?
Aren't they good?

88
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:10,875
She's up... Wide awake.

89
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,041
She said she felt better after
I gave her some coffee to drink.

90
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,916
And when I asked if she
wanted anything to eat...

91
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,208
She said, "Guimauve."

92
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,041
What about you...?

93
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,125
Aren't you hungry?

94
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,416
Have some food and get ready.

It's so weird...

102
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,500
He left without
saying anything...

103
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,791
Where in the world
could he have gone to?

104
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,125
Hello there.

105
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,125
Good morning.

106
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,625
Wearing your uniform?

107
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,541
I just felt like putting it on.

108
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,291
Oh.

109
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,833
Well, if it makes you feel
better, then it's okay by me.

110
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,583
It looks really nice.

111
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,458
Thanks.

112
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,250
What happened?

113
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,000
Did you hurt yourself?

114
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,083
I thought I was
good in the kitchen...

115
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,625
Never can be too careful.

116
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,166
Did you drop some dishes
on the floor or something...?

117
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,791
Oh no... Maybe I can
help you clean it up?

118
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,541
Don't worry...
It's all over now.

119
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,166
Okay, if you say, so...

120
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,875
Oh! Hello...!

121
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,916
How are you this morning?

122
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,666
Great, now that I found you.

123
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,708
Can I get you anything?

124
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,041
How 'bout something good?

125
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,750
No promises,
but I'll do my best.

126
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,791
You'll want to eat
as well, right...?

127
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,291
Some of that guimauve
you're so crazy about?

128
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,541
Yes, thanks...

129
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,541
And some coffee too, please.

130
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,041
You got it.

131
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,375
And you...?

132
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,333
Care for anything to drink?

133
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,250
I'll pass on the coffee
if that's all right...

134
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,708
I'll have some tea instead...

135
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,291
No milk please.

136
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,000
By the way...

137
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,541
A kind soul told me
your father keeps

138
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,666
a lot of valuable scrolls
and relics in his shrine.

139
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,708
Maybe, I don't know.

140
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,375
He doesn't collect old books?

141
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,083
Oh yeah, he has a bunch
of those in the storehouse.

142
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,291
Perfect... Would you be
willing to let me see them?

143
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,208
I'd have to ask
permission first.

144
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,541
If he's at home,
we could check with him.

145
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,833
He's gone...

146
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,083
I'm not sure where he went.

147
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,208
If it's possible...

148
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,750
I would sure like
to see them today.

149
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,208
Oh... Really?

150
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,791
Yes. Right now.

151
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,208
Don't worry.

152
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,666
I won't take anything,

153
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,083
I just wanna see what he's
got in there, that's all...

154
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,625
I'll be careful... Please.

155
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,333
I may have told you this before,

156
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,250
but I've always been interested
in legends and mythology.

157
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,958
Old texts like your Father's are
very hard to come by.

158
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,833
That's the reason I came here...

159
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,458
So I could check
out the real thing.

160
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,625
So, whaddaya say?

161
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,333
I know you're
worried but trust me.

162
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,333
It's no big deal... Cool?

163
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,500
You're right...

164
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,333
I'll let my father
know I brought you here.

165
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,166
He's not back already, is he?

166
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,333
We could tell him now...

167
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,541
If you want to.

168
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,000
No.

169
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,583
It's so weird...

170
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,208
It's really not like him to
disappear that way.

171
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,125
Now we're talking.

172
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,583
This is the one
I was looking for...

173
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,666
It's the same legend
I told you about in class...

174
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,916
You remember that, don't you?

175
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,958
I was trying to find the one
who named them Elder Bairns.

176
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:45,583
So far, I haven't been able to
find it in any of the books...

177
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,916
However, based upon
entries I have repeatedly

178
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,333
uncovered throughout the
documents, these creatures

179
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:54,000
have been feeding on humans
for a very, long time.

180
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,500
And you also know the only thing

181
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,583
capable of defeating
these evil beings.

182
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,291
The sacred blade.

183
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,166
There's only one thing
that can defeat them.

184
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,000
It's my sword.

185
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,583
Are you all right?

186
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,375
What's the matter?

187
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,125
I'm fine...
Sorry I spaced out...

188
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,666
My mind wanders.

189
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,250
No, it's okay... Although.

190
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,750
It does seriously make me wonder

191
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,416
how long you're going
to play this stupid game.

192
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Huh?

193
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,500
Can't you tell
by looking at this book?

194
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,208
No, I... Tell what?

195
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:50,125
Look at it again...
Go on. Do it.

196
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
The paper...
It looks like it's new.

197
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,000
It's supposed to be an old book,

198
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,708
recounting an even older legend.

199
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,166
This isn't right.

200
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:31,208
All of these books are... empty.

201
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,958
Oh, come on!
It's all fake, silly!

202
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:47,333
But it... can't be. You're dead.

203
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,208
Nope... I'm still here!

204
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,875
Me... too!

205
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,291
You can see
who's who, can't you?

206
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,125
Or'd you forget
how to tell us apart?

207
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,208
Let's put an end to
this farce, shall we?

208
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,958
It's about time you
learned the truth.

209
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,750
Do you know what
it means...? "Kisaragi"?

210
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,750
I don't.

211
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,833
It means to change
one's robes...

212
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,083
For a girl who's been convinced

213
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,375
she's someone she's not,
It's the perfect name.

214
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,333
Next time on Blood-C:
"Whom Then Are There Now."
