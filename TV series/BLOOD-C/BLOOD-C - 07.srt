1
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,000
My daughter's fine.

2
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,458
She's inside right now.

3
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,708
Well, sir...

4
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,166
The thing is, Nene Moto,
one of her classmates,

5
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,833
never came home after
they closed the school...

6
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,250
And her twin sister Nono's been
missing since yesterday also.

7
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,666
 As you can imagine,

8
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,708
we're concerned something
may have happened to them.

9
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,666
But...

10
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,541
Your daughter's safe and
sound, so no need to worry...

11
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,875
Although...

12
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,208
If I were you,

13
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,000
I would keep a close eye
on her for the time being.

14
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,083
Understood.

15
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,583
We appreciate
the warning, officer.

16
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,958
First Nene...

17
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,041
And now Nono.

18
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,416
I couldn't save them, Father.

19
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,958
I've failed us all.

20
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,541
Saya.

21
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,041
I'm so sorry...

22
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,458
Maybe I'm not strong
enough to do this...

23
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,875
I made a promise.

24
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,791
I swore that
I would protect them.

25
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,583
Promised whom?

26
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,333
Saya.

27
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,625
When I vowed to guard the people
I love from those beasts...

28
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:42,666
It must have been for Mom.

29
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,041
My child.

30
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,291
She was a shrine
priestess here, just like me...

31
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,500
But she died trying to
fight off the Elder Bairns...

32
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,166
I think I did it for her...

33
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,125
For her memory.

34
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,583
Saya?

35
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,750
Wake up!

36
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,625
Father.

37
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,916
I know it must have been a
truly painful experience...

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,875
Being unable to
protect your friends.

39
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,416
But...

40
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,375
You're the only Shrine Maiden

41
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,458
we can send to
battle the Elder Bairns.

42
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,000
Only you.

43
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,458
There's no one else...? Just me?

44
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,583
That's right...

45
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,791
You have to keep
fighting... Say it.

46
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,750
What will you do
to the Elder Bairns?

47
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:58,375
Kill them...
Defeat them... I promised.

48
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,250
Yes... You made a promise.

49
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,750
Your promise was
essential for us...

50
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,083
For what we've decided to do...

51
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,625
But, we still require
many other preparations

52
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:24,208
for this experiment,
our theories will be tested

53
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,125
and the answers
finally revealed.

54
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,541
We will know who was
right and who was wrong...

55
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,416
But it will take more
than the two of us.

56
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,291
Now then... Let us
begin preparing. Saya.

57
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,625
You can't sleep?

58
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,791
That voice I heard yesterday.

59
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,875
It was yours.

60
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,791
Well, I'm glad to know
I'm not imagining things.

61
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,833
You're remarkably calm.

62
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,958
No... I am surprised...

63
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,250
But... Some Elder
Bairns can speak.

64
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,500
If I'm an Elder Bairn...

65
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,750
Shouldn't you be
trying to kill me?

66
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,875
Oh, yes... I would...

67
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,458
..but I don't feel
any evil from you.

68
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,666
Just remember...

69
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,750
You can't always judge
a book by its cover.

70
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,375
One's true nature
can be concealed.

71
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,833
I see...

72
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,333
You're talking
about them, right?

73
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,416
Yes, and other things, as well.

74
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,750
Tell me the truth...

75
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,666
You're not one of the
Elder Bairns, are you?

76
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,875
Perhaps... What do you think?

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,083
I... don't know...

78
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,458
I sense a strong
power from you...

79
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,875
But somehow it's different.

80
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,083
Okay.

81
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,833
I'm curious...
Why'd you come to me?

82
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,625
To make a wish come true.

83
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,208
What wish?

84
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,208
One time...

85
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,791
Someone came to visit my shop

86
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,750
'cause they wanted
a wish granted.

87
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,083
Your shop?

88
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,250
Yes... That's correct.

89
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,166
What do you do at your shop?

90
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,458
We make people's
wishes come true.

91
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,625
Oh, I get it, then you must
be the guard dog there, right?

92
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,791
No, I own it.

93
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,833
Are all the customers
who come to your place dogs?

94
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,333
No... I wouldn't go that far...

95
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,333
We get all types, really.

96
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,625
So you run a magical shop
that grants wishes,

97
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,125
to both people and dogs...

98
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,708
And one time, somebody came
to see you in your shop...

99
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,625
So, you granted them
a wish they asked for

100
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,333
and that's why you've
come here to visit me?

101
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,333
That's correct, more or less.

102
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,500
I don't understand,
whose wish was it?

103
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,291
That, unfortunately, is
something I cannot tell you.

104
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,125
Well, then can you at least
tell me what they asked for?

105
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,833
Sorry, but that's not possible.

106
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,541
I see...

107
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,416
Are you positive you
have the right person...?

108
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,833
I've lived here my whole life,
I've never even left...

109
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,708
I haven't heard of
your shop either...

110
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,958
And as best as I can remember,

111
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know of anybody
who's ever been there.

112
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,708
Are you sure?

113
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,250
Is that what you really believe?

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,583
Your voice, it was...

115
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,958
Inside my head...
I could hear you clearly...

116
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,666
You said something to me...

117
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,791
When I was telling my father

118
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,041
why I promised to
protect everyone...

119
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,791
You asked a question.

120
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,166
Promised whom?

121
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,833
I know I made a promise...

122
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,375
I swore on it...

123
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,208
That I would protect all the
people I love or die trying...

124
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,916
But I--

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,166
But you don't actually remember

126
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,166
to whom you made
that promise, do you?

127
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,166
A wish can be
granted if you wish

128
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,291
for it with all
your heart and soul.

129
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,708
But still, for that desire
to become a reality,

130
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,791
a great price must be paid.

131
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,333
The greater the desire,
the greater the price...

132
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,625
There are many limits
to what I can do.

133
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,958
Among them, is that I'm
forced to appear in this form.

134
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,500
Saya.

135
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,208
I promised to grant that
wish, no matter what...

136
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sworn to do my duty.

137
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:51,041
Until then, I'll stay
beside you... So.

138
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,458
A dream?

139
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,500
There's no way...
It was... real.

140
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,958
I'll be back.

141
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,458
It's too early for you to go.

142
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,916
I know...

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,083
But I just feel like I should.

144
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,208
You're thinking that,
even as you stand here now,

145
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,000
Elder Bairns may appear
somewhere and wreak havoc...

146
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,541
Yes?

147
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,208
Yes.

148
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,333
But, Father?

149
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,791
Please, just take it.

150
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,291
Saya...

151
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,666
From this moment forward,
keep it with you at all times.

152
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,541
Morning.

153
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,375
Good morning to you too.

154
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,458
You're here.

155
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,375
And smiling.

156
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,041
No point forcing a
smile when you feel bad.

157
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:43,250
Oh, I'm okay...
Thank you though.

158
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,458
A little bird told me you went

159
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,666
to sleep last night
without eating dinner.

160
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,583
A little bird?

161
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,458
I talked with
your father about it.

162
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,750
How does Risotto sound...?

163
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,583
I'll whip some up.

164
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,375
Guimauve.

165
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,458
You told me something about
guimauve, remember...?

166
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,750
You said when you taste it,

167
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,041
its texture feels exactly
like something else.

168
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,125
Did I say that?

169
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,708
Yeah, you did.

170
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,708
But you never said what?

171
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,000
Get it now?

172
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,625
Do you mean lips?

173
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,958
That's it?

174
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:30,666
Yep...

175
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,375
And other things too.

176
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,625
Oh.

177
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,833
So... I'm guessing you'll
want more than risotto...

178
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:45,125
Let's get you an egg and maybe
a hot salad... What else?

179
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,666
Coffee, yes?

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,666
Here.

181
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,083
Thanks for everything.

182
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,458
I'd say you look better already.

183
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,583
That's because of your food;
it was really delicious...

184
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,291
The coffee, too!

185
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,583
Well, thank you...

186
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,666
Oh, right.

187
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,125
Here's lunch and
some more guimauve...

188
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,166
It'll make a good snack.

189
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,500
Thanks a lot,
I'll see you later!

190
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,541
I've got some time to
spare before class starts,

191
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,125
so I figured I'd wander
around town for a little while.

192
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,333
No school today.

193
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,333
Why not?

194
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,291
Has no one told
you what's going on?

195
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:55,625
No... I left early and I haven't
really talked to anyone so far.

196
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh... Well, Saya.

197
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,125
School might be closed
down for a long time.

198
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,916
They still haven't
found anyone yet.

199
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,791
Although, who's to say it's not
better if they never do...?

200
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,708
We might not
like what they find.

201
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,541
Whaddaya mean?

202
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,500
Remember the story
I told the other day?

203
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,416
Uh... Yes.

204
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,958
Maybe that's why they
can't find Nene and Nono...

205
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,000
What if they aren't
missing persons...?

206
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,166
What if we can't find them
because they've both been eaten?

207
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,916
It's the same thing with
those other missing people...

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,583
Those monsters probably
got to them first.

209
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:43,541
At least... That's what I think.

210
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,875
What's the matter with you...?

211
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,541
Is your head bothering
you again, Saya?

212
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,041
No... I'm feeling okay...

213
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,333
Good.

214
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,375
Then get outta here already...

215
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,041
Otherwise, I'll make you learn.

216
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,500
It doesn't make sense,
why would she bring up

217
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,291
that story out of the blue
unless she knew something?

218
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,458
Is it possible that she knows
about the Elder Bairns?

219
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,083
Excuse me!

220
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,583
Miss!

221
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,875
Yes?

222
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:25,583
Didn't you hear?

223
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,291
School's been cancelled.

224
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sorry... I left so early,
I think I missed the phone call.

225
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,500
Well, that's all right...

226
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,625
There'll be no more class
till we figure this thing out.

227
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,833
Hurry on home,

228
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,083
it's not safe out in
the streets right now.

229
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,375
Die!

230
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,125
You are unworthy.

231
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,500
It's disappointing you have
grown so feeble and weak.

232
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,083
Wha'd he say?

233
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,583
The word "pathetic" would
apply to the loser, as well...

234
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,750
You are clearly not the
same person you once were.

235
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,916
But to suffer a defeat
at your hand now...

236
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,958
It would indeed be a
disgraceful embarrassment.

237
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,625
What are you saying, I have
never fought you before...!

238
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,083
Ever!

239
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,375
So weak... I should pity you.

240
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,875
Could you be
thinking of my mother?

241
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,041
Did you ever fight her before?

242
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,291
This is her sacred blade.

243
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:52,125
Compared to the woman she was I
may not measure up, it's true...

244
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:56,083
Even so, I will defeat all of
you if it's the last thing I do!

245
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,583
Take this!

246
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,125
A sacred blade... Ha!

247
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,500
Is that the story
your father told you...?

248
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,333
Back at the family shrine...

249
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,541
I suppose he had a very
serious look on his face

250
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,291
when he told you, did he not...?

251
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,375
Now that is hilarious!

252
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,791
Stop laughing!

253
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,791
How can I not laugh at that...

254
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,083
...such ridiculousness...?

255
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,541
Old Tadayoshi...

256
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,416
The very same man who
told you to defeat my kind...

257
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,666
You and your father deserve each
other, fools that you are...

258
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,708
Though between the both
of you, you're likely the worst!

259
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,458
Shut up!

260
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,416
I won't let you
call him a fool...!

261
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,416
My father's strong and kind...!

262
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,750
Ever since my
mother passed away,

263
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,541
he's always been right
by my side supporting me!

264
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,625
Your heart tells you
what you already know.

265
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,625
You are wrong, and even you
don't believe your own words.

266
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,583
What?

267
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,458
You're feeding me these
lies to try and confuse me!

268
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,791
Human beings are the
ones who lie; not my kind.

269
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,125
They continue to
violate the covenant

270
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,875
with their falsehoods
and poisonous filth!

271
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,583
Stop right there!

272
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,291
It's time for you to die.

273
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,958
After I am finished with you,
I will kill Tadayoshi, as well.

274
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,208
No please!

275
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,333
That's right...

276
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,791
You should be happy,
getting to perish

277
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,583
beside your beloved
father and mentor!

278
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,416
I promised!

279
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,750
You monster...!

280
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,333
I won't let you near him!

281
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,166
Yes...

282
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,666
Now that's more like it...

283
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,125
I sense the old you.

284
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,583
Ask your father...

285
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,375
Tell him you want
to know the truth...

286
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,791
...about you. Who you are?

287
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,708
Saya?

288
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,541
Tokizane... Hi.

289
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:14,458
A promise was made, the only
question remains: to whom...?

290
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,833
Who came to see me about
making that wish come true?

291
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,625
I wonder.

292
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,166
What is that?

293
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,125
If you get involved,
you could be hurt.

294
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,958
I don't care, I just wanna know.

295
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,000
But why?

296
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,041
Because you're
everything to me...

297
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,458
You're it... Saya.

298
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,416
Next time on Blood-C:
"Within the World."
