1
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:33,041
What, do you believe,
defines a person...?

2
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:39,000
Not a flesh and blood
embodiment of self, per se...

3
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,333
Yes, physical form is

4
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,666
of course a piece of
this fascinating puzzle...

5
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,333
However, what I am
attempting to uncover

6
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,666
is something further
beneath the surface.

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,250
Something more often referred
to as a person's "character"...

8
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,500
Is one's individuality, perhaps,

9
00:00:56,583 --> 00:01:00,375
determined at their birth,
by hereditary traits...?

10
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:03,125
Or, rather, are a person's
innate qualities created

11
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,000
by their upbringing...?

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,166
Does nature define you...?

13
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,500
Or does nurture decide...?

14
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,000
I suggest we try a
little experiment...

15
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,916
One day I will
catch the light...

16
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,750
Soon...

17
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,041
And then I will
find out what it means.

18
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,708
Saya.

19
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,708
Hello, Father!

20
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,875
Are you all right?

21
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,625
Yes, I'm fine; don't worry...

22
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,208
I'm really tough.

23
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,750
I know how strong you are...

24
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:41,666
Yet still...

25
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,916
A shrine maiden should try not

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,875
to smash her head
into things so often...

27
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,041
Do you understand?

28
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,583
I do, but I don't
always hit my head ...

29
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,458
Do I?

30
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,125
Saya... listen to me...

31
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,708
This is important...

32
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,291
You must learn to
be more careful,

33
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,666
and not only with your head.

34
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,500
I understand, Father...

35
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,250
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,416
Well...

37
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,708
Perhaps it speaks
to your concentration...

38
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,166
Your rituals?

39
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,333
Finished...

40
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,791
I saw that light
again this morning.

41
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,208
Did you catch it?

42
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,666
No, sir...

43
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,416
I did try...

44
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,791
But it got away.

45
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,083
You should not give up...

46
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,041
Have you been seeing
it more frequently?

47
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,458
Yes...

48
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,750
I almost feel as though
I remember it from somewhere.

49
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,416
Almost...

50
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,541
I 'm not sure, though.

51
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,166
Your mother was a
shrine maiden as well...

52
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,416
She often received auguries

53
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,083
between the real world
and that of dreams.

54
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,458
Pay attention;

55
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:45,291
what you see may contain
some portent of the future.

56
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,708
Maybe finding it out will
help me fulfill my duty.

57
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,833
There is no need
to force anything...

58
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,791
But you might
learn from this light

59
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:55,958
Yes, sir...!

60
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,458
If I do, I'll let
you know immediately!

61
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,333
One more thing, Saya...

62
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,166
Yes, Father?

63
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,791
If you plan on going
next door for breakfast...

64
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,208
I suggest you change your
clothes as quickly as you can

65
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,750
and make your way over there.

66
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,750
Well, I was wondering what
happened to your nose...

67
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,250
The tip of it's a
little scratched up.

68
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:42,958
Father's right.

69
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:43,833
I'm too careless.

70
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,416
I need to focus better.

71
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,666
True...

72
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,875
I think, at times,
you can be a little hasty.

73
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,708
I just wish; I wish I didn't
cause my father so much trouble.

74
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,541
That works both ways, Saya...

75
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,416
I know your father, remember...?

76
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,333
And, he doesn't exactly make
things easy for you, either.

77
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,500
He is tough...

78
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,041
But he's also really
kind, and honest...

79
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,458
He's, well... wonderful!

80
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,166
Ever the daddy's little girl...

81
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,791
You do love him
a lot, don't you...?

82
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,458
Yes...!

83
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,958
So much...

84
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,958
I wish I could do
more to help him...

85
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,291
But I feel like I'm still so
inexperienced at everything.

86
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,750
Now, that's not true...

87
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,708
You should give
yourself a break.

88
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,333
You're doing your best.

89
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,458
Hey... Isn't it
time for school...?

90
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,166
Hold on!

91
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,083
You have ten minutes
to get there...

92
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,916
Take your time, okay?

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,250
Don't trip!

Good morning, everyone!

112
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,166
Look who got here on time.

113
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,291
Yeah, barely...

114
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,250
It was close.

115
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,958
No more lost children today?

116
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,458
No old ladies needing
your help crossing the street?

117
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,916
No, but...

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,541
But I did find some trash
left on the ground, so...

119
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,583
Tell me you did not pick up
someone's disgusting crap.

120
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,916
How could I not?

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,583
I left it where they
usually pick up the trash...

122
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,625
...but... you know what...

123
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,833
I think the garbage trucks
had already come by.

124
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,916
At least it's picked up.

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,708
What's wrong with you?

126
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,791
Think about it...

127
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,500
You are like the
biggest sucker ever...

128
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:35,791
Every morning some new
ridiculous thing makes you late.

129
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,708
But I wasn't even
a little late today.

130
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,375
I'm not talking about today.

131
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,083
I'm referring to the two times
a week you usually are late!

132
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,125
I'm sorry, Yuka.

133
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,083
What good does it do
to apologize to me?

134
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,625
Yuka can be so scary!

135
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,750
She's like a mean,
overprotective mom!

136
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,083
Shut your mouths!

137
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,791
I, uh...

138
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,416
I hate to interrupt but...

139
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,916
Oh, Class rep!

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,666
Our teacher is almost here.

141
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,625
Sorry; I hope
we weren't too loud.

142
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,833
No. Don't worry.

143
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,791
I actually like watching
your little routine.

144
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,375
Trust me.

145
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,625
Don't be stupid.

146
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,500
And every comedic team
needs its straight man.

147
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,916
Who you callin' a straight man?!

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,166
You...! He means you!

149
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,250
Okay, it's nice to
see you having fun,

150
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,916
but it's time for class.

151
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,250
We can catch up

152
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,541
with the rest of your
little routine during lunch.

153
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,291
This is not a routine!

154
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,583
And isn't it always
like the straight man

155
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,625
to get so easily offended?

156
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,166
Welcome, Tokizane...

157
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,583
Can't you pretend
to care you're late?

158
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,541
I'm late; sorry.

159
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,750
Well, that was
thoroughly convincing.

160
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,166
Thank you.

161
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,416
Now then...

162
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,000
Since we all seem to be here,
why don't we take attendance?

163
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,666
Kisaragi... Saya.

164
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,125
Yes, I'm here!

165
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,875
All done! Just kidding.

166
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,208
Ha! Miss Tsutsutori,
you're always so funny!

167
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,708
You're so cool!

168
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,875
Saya's the best in school!

169
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,708
Well, thank you;
that's really sweet.

170
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,500
They're right, you know.

171
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,375
Unbelievable.

172
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,083
Were you born this way or what?

173
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,291
Well, I've always been
good at sports and stuff.

174
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,000
Do you have like a million
first place trophies at home?

175
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,000
Your parents must be so proud!

176
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,291
Not really.

177
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,000
My dad is a priest,
so he's busy with that...

178
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,458
My mom died, so it's just us.

179
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,083
We're sorry.

180
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,083
Don't be; you don't
have to apologize.

181
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,625
We're perfectly happy.

182
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,416
My mother passed away back when
I started elementary school,

183
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,166
so I don't remember her much...

184
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,208
Luckily, father
and I have Fumito!

185
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,750
He started making
me boxed lunches

186
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,125
and was really supportive.

187
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,500
He's owns the café next
to the shrine, right?

188
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,833
Yep... Neither one of us cook...

189
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,916
So he's been kind
enough to step in...

190
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,208
He usually makes
most of our food

191
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,750
and brings it to
the shrine for us.

192
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,833
That's cool...

193
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,375
You're lucky, Saya.

194
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,208
Your dad and that Fumito guy
seem like super awesome people.

195
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,500
Yeah!

196
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,041
Hey, Saya...

197
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,208
Oh, class rep!

198
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,083
I was wondering, uh...

199
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,833
Wanna walk home with me?

200
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,875
I thought we
could stop for cake...

201
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,291
I know a good place.

202
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,833
Wow, thanks for the offer...

203
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,583
But there's a ceremony
at the shrine tomorrow...

204
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,500
I promised to go home after
school to help my dad out.

205
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,333
O-kay... Next time.

206
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,333
Sure thing...! Now I'm sad...

207
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,291
I'm missing out on
some yummy cake.

208
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,916
Well, not just cake.

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,041
What do you mean?

210
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,083
I uh... Nothing.

211
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,458
Be careful on your way back.

212
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,208
I will!

213
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,583
You be careful too.

214
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,166
Thanks for the offer.

215
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,166
Bye...

216
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:06,875
Saya?

217
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,041
Are you leaving already?

218
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,625
Yeah!

219
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,333
I'll see you tomorrow!

220
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,833
A doggie!

221
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,041
No!

222
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,291
I have to go home!

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,125
Father!

224
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,375
Is it time?

225
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,833
My time?

226
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,083
Come with me.

227
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,583
The signs indicate an Elder
Bairn will appear tonight.

228
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,500
According to the Eight Trigrams?

229
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,083
An omen appeared when
I cast the Trigrams earlier

230
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,333
in preparation for the ceremony.

231
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,583
I see...

232
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,666
Slay it... Saya.

233
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,375
Turn on my soul...

234
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,916
My awareness...

235
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,958
Help me confirm
their infinity...

236
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,125
May the first god
grant me wisdom.

237
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,750
May the land god
grant me strength.

238
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,625
Saya.

239
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,166
Father!

240
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,791
Have you been hurt?

241
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,500
No, I'm fine.

242
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,916
I slew the Elder Bairn,
just like you said.

243
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,875
I know... Well done, Saya.

244
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,583
Come... let us purify
the sacred blade.

245
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:16,791
Yes.

246
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,750
Are you all right, child?

247
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,625
Yes, I...

248
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,583
My hand.

249
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,333
I see... You must have
been gripping it too tightly.

250
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,083
Saya?

251
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,166
Yes, I'm fine...

252
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,500
It's nothing.

253
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,916
I've already heated
the water for you...

254
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,583
Go take a bath.

255
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,500
Yes, yes father

256
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,125
Good morning!

257
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,083
I made it to class on
time again today...!

258
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,375
I'm not late to school
all the time or anything,

259
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,041
but if I see someone
who needs help,

260
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,791
or a puppy or stuff like that,
I just can't stop myself...

261
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,833
You know, now
that I think about it,

262
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,750
I wonder if that little dog
I ran into would be my friend.

263
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,958
I bet one day it will let
me pick it up and hug it.

264
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,666
Oh, I just know it will!

265
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,083
And until it does,
I won't give up!

266
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:18,125
Next time on Blood-C:
"It Is for Thy Sake."
