1
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,958
What happened?

2
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,083
Talk to me, Saya.

3
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,500
Are you okay...?

4
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,458
Is that your blood?

5
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,625
No, it's not.

6
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,166
It 's...

7
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,375
What are you doing?

8
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,750
I'm so relieved...

9
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,791
When I first saw you here...

10
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,958
I was worried you might be hurt.

11
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,458
Let's go.

12
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,583
Okay but... Where?

13
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,375
Thanks for being so nice to me.

14
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,958
Saya...

15
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,583
What was that?

16
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,458
Why are you carrying that
sword with you everywhere?

17
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,708
Well, I--

18
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,375
Please... Tell me.

19
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,541
I can't... If you
get involved...

20
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,875
Then you'll be in danger,

21
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,750
and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

22
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,583
I'll be fine, you're the one
I'm really worried about.

23
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,458
I wanna know everything.

24
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,541
You do...?

25
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,125
How come?

26
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,833
What, you can't tell?

27
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,708
No, I guess not.

28
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,250
Guess the subtle
approach won't work...

29
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,500
Well... that's okay...
I'll just lay it out there.

30
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:17,416
In my eyes... you're special.

31
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,416
Don't you see?

32
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,208
You're everything to me...

33
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,041
You're it.

34
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,250
And you can talk to
me about anything...

35
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,416
Who knows?

36
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,625
Maybe there's something
I can do to help.

37
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,916
If I tell you this
you have to swear...

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,041
You have to promise
to keep it between us.

39
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,291
I will.

40
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,833
Good... Then I'll tell you.

41
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,666
Morning...

42
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,500
Saya ate her breakfast
before she went to school.

43
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,125
I see.

44
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:05,458
But... she looked
sad... Very sad.

45
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,041
Sad, eh?

46
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,291
Yes...

47
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,208
She's probably worried
that she's upset you...

48
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,625
Or, that you might be
disappointed in her...

49
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,833
Lovely child...

50
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,583
She really does care
about her father a lot.

51
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:23,833
I suppose it's true: blood
does run thicker than water.

52
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,333
Would you like some coffee?

53
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,583
No.

54
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:35,875
Oh... Well... Would you
prefer something else?

55
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,208
They're called Elder Bairns?

56
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,375
So what...?

57
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,208
They survive by like
eating human beings?

58
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes. First Nene... Then Nono...

59
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,958
And the rest of the
missing people, too.

60
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,875
You know it's not
your fault, right?

61
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:58,958
Yeah but...

62
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,250
I'm supposed to
fight the Elder Bairns,

63
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,250
and protect the people I love.

64
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,000
I made a vow to defeat them...

65
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,750
To do everything I can--

66
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,666
What's wrong?

67
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,041
It's all right,
I'm fine... Please.

68
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:21,500
It doesn't look that
way to me, Saya.

69
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,625
Tokizane?

70
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,125
I'm here.

71
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,166
I don't get it...

72
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,416
Why are you
holding me like this?

73
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,458
Come on... You know...
You have to know...?

74
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,583
It's so clear.

75
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,583
What's the matter?

76
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,375
Is there something
wrong with me?

77
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,791
No, not wrong, I mean...

78
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,666
It's just the way
you are... For now.

79
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,333
I believe everything you said...

80
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,375
I know you're
telling the truth...

81
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,708
I saw the monster for myself...

82
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,375
That's all that matters.

83
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,375
No.

84
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,250
Huh?

85
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,250
Uh... I mean...

86
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,125
It's not a monster, it's...

87
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,416
It's an Elder Bairn, that's all.

88
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,958
That's a weird distinction
to make, don't you think?

89
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,791
I'm not sure, maybe.

90
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,958
Aren't those two
things one and the same?

91
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:19,041
Yeah... I guess they are.

92
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,125
From the looks of you,
I'd say you need a bath...

93
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,125
I don't think a
handkerchief's gonna cut it.

94
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,333
I'll walk you home
so you're safe...

95
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,875
Come on.

96
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,708
No, I'm good, really.

97
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:31,708
No, you're not.

98
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,750
Yeah, but--

99
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,041
Really... You should
let me help you.

100
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,750
I can carry that.

101
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:42,791
Please, I'll get it...
Your sword.

102
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,625
Thank you...

103
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,500
I'm very lucky you're here.

104
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,375
Such a gentleman.

105
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,416
Umm... Tokizane?

106
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,166
What's up?

107
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,291
You're a really great guy.

108
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,958
What're you talking about?

109
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,125
Nothing, it's just...

110
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,083
I wish everyone
understood you...

111
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,708
I wish they all could
see how nice you are.

112
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,708
You know.

113
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,250
That's all that matters.

114
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,125
Yeah, but that's such a waste!

115
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,625
Unfortunately,
I gotta take off...

116
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:29,750
But... if anything's bothering
you at all, just tell me.

117
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,666
So you really want
me to... tell you?

118
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,666
Sure.

119
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,750
But why?

120
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,208
Cause I wanna know you...

121
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,208
Everything about you.

122
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,375
That means so much!

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,916
Father?!

124
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,500
Where are you?

125
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,083
Father!

126
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,875
What happened to you?!

127
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,500
Talk to me!

128
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,000
Father!

129
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,375
It's you.

130
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,250
You're awake!

131
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,458
You're gonna be okay...!

132
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,708
What's wrong,
were you feeling sick...?

133
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,291
It's my fault...
I didn't even know.

134
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,791
I'm fine...
Just dizzy, that's all.

135
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,958
Yeah but...

136
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,541
You look really pale
and-- That's blood!

137
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,333
Oh no, did I get it on you?

138
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,500
Please, it's nothing.

139
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,875
No, you're--

140
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,375
You need to calm down...

141
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,541
Saya...

142
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,458
Don't worry about me,
I'll be all right.

143
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,250
You'd tell me...?
If you weren't...?

144
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,666
Yes.

145
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,000
Do you mean it...?

146
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,833
You promise me you would?

147
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,875
You have my word...
I'll be fine.

148
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,416
I'm so glad...!

149
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,791
If anything happened
to you, I swear I'd...

150
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:21,875
I swear I'd... I don't know.

151
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,666
I can't think
of anything to say.

152
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,541
What would I do...?

153
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,625
If you were gone?

154
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,708
Father.

155
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,166
I wonder why he wouldn't
tell me what was wrong with him.

156
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:42,000
♪ If Father's sad,
then I am sad as well. ♪

157
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:47,666
♪ If he's blue, then I am blue
though the sky's blue too. ♪

158
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,750
♪ I... love him. ♪

159
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:55,000
♪ And he loves me too.
And he loves me too. ♪

160
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,166
But what if he's not
telling me the truth...?

161
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,458
Oh no... What if he's not okay?!

162
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,875
I've gotta find out!

163
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,416
Well, hello...

164
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,791
It's you again.

165
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,416
Yep, it's me...

166
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,666
I have to say,
I'm relieved

167
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,375
you're not screaming
your head off right now.

168
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,125
You're hurt.

169
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,625
The wound's almost closed up.

170
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,375
Whadda you make of it?

171
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,875
Come on...

172
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,666
You don't find it strange
that your body heals so fast?

173
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,666
I never really thought
about it before.

174
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,583
Okay , I guess that
was a stupid question.

175
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,291
So... Do you remember
whom you promised...?

176
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,833
Have you thought about it?

177
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,875
Oh, no...

178
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,500
I can't remember anything.

179
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,916
Well...

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,208
Have you considered what
would happen if you broke it?

181
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,958
To put a stop to
the Elder Bairns...

182
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,000
To protect everyone.

183
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,750
If you were to
break that promise...

184
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,916
...what would happen to you?

185
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:45,750
This experiment is extremely
important to both of us.

186
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,333
If we go through with it...

187
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,333
We'll need a means
to decide who won.

188
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:54,000
That requires a reward
for the victorious party.

189
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,416
And for the loser?

190
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,916
A punishment.

191
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,458
Saya.

192
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,541
If you win, what would you like?

193
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,541
And if you lose...

194
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,416
What could I take that would
be more painful than death?

195
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,125
Your move.

196
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,666
Don't you pass out...!

197
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,833
I can't carry you like this...!

198
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,250
Keep it together now.

199
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,750
I knew it wouldn't be
easy for you to remember.

200
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,166
It's close... The time has
almost come.

201
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,166
It's weaker...
You're nearly there.

202
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,916
Saya...! What's wrong?!

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,583
Uh... I'm okay...

204
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,625
I'm almost done in here.

205
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,666
Punishment...?

206
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,666
A reward?

207
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,333
It's been three days now...

208
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,250
And still no sign
of the Elder Bairns.

209
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,583
Yes.

210
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,875
People from the school
notified me earlier today;

211
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,041
they are planning to
resume classes at once.

212
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,041
I understand.

213
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,458
Will you go?

214
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,041
Yes...

215
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,500
I have to.

216
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,166
Are you all right?

217
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,958
My dear child...

218
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:20,333
Tell me... Does it
cause you any pain...?

219
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,333
Fighting them
all by yourself...?

220
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,625
Being alone...?

221
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,041
Knowing you are the only one?

222
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,791
My wounds heal very quickly...

223
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,833
Besides, I'm tough;
I don't mind a little pain!

224
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,333
Father... You don't seem well.

225
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:41,583
No, I... I'm fine,
really... Trust me.

226
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,458
What did the eight
trigrams show you...?

227
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,250
Look, whatever you saw,
it doesn't matter,

228
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,333
because I'm not afraid
of the Elder Bairns...!

229
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,958
There's no need for you
to be worried, all right...?

230
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,708
What happened to Mom won't
happen to me, I promise you!

231
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,208
I'll be fine!

232
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,791
Father, talk to me.

233
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,708
Saya... I...

234
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,041
When the Elder Bairns appear,
remember your vow...

235
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,208
Destroy them and
return home to me.

236
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,666
Understand?

237
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,750
Saya?

238
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,958
Good morning, Yuka.

239
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,750
Hey, what's the matter...?

240
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,833
You don't look so good.

241
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,250
No, everything's great.

242
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,833
Well... I suppose
that's something...

243
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,250
After all this,
it's nice to know

244
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,041
somebody's looking
at the bright side.

245
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,125
They still haven't
found Nono or Nene...

246
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,458
And did you hear
about the policeman?

247
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,958
Apparently, a few days ago,
he went missing too...

248
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,333
I don't know what's going on,

249
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,541
but I hope they're
all gonna be okay.

250
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,375
You're here!

251
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,333
Oh, hello.

252
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,833
With school being
closed for so long,

253
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,083
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

254
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,375
Yeah.

255
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,958
I'm definitely glad
to see you again...

256
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,041
But I'm sorry it's happening
at a time like this,

257
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,916
I wish it wasn't.

258
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,000
What's that?

259
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,041
You brought it here last
time, too... Didn't you?

260
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,500
This is, uh--

261
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,583
Hey, what's up?

262
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,916
What're you screamin' for? Whoa!

263
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,541
I wanna see!

264
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,958
That's one ugly mother!

265
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,875
No kidding man,
look at that thing.

266
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,291
No, not here!

267
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,250
What is it?

268
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,750
I don't know.

269
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,291
Oh, no... It's coming this way.

270
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,791
Eh, I wouldn't worry,
it looks kinda slow.

271
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,875
But it sure is creepy.

272
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,708
Guys! Get down!

273
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,916
What the hell's going on ?

274
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,875
Where did he go?

275
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,333
They're... They're dead?

276
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,375
Come on guys...! Lets go!

277
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,833
This monster, it's not letting
anybody get out of here.

278
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,791
Help me!

279
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,291
Saya?

280
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:49,750
Saya, no!

281
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,583
Just stay back!

282
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,750
This ends right now,
you hear me? Now!

283
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,833
I will not let anyone else die!

284
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,875
Who are you? Tell me the truth!

285
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,125
My name is
Saya Kisaragi... My father...

286
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,791
That's not what I meant!

287
00:23:56,875 --> 00:24:00,958
And now... Have you
finally killed them all?

288
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,458
Next time on Blood-C:
"Against My Wish."
