[Terada] It has
its own wiki site...

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Monsters of
the imagination

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
only exist and survive
through people's ideation.

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:26.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
So long as people
keep fantasizing

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
about the steel lady,
she will remain immortal.

00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:32.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
Even if we cut off her head,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
she'll just keep
coming back.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her life comes not
from within her,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
but from the desires
of others.

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:48.567 position:30% line:89% align:start
[opening music]

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:14.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase doesn't
have the ability to think.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's an automaton
that continues

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
moving in the way
people expect her to.

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
This makes her completely
different from

00:02:20.234 --> 00:02:22.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
your traditional yokai
and ghosts.

00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:25.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] Iwanaga.

00:02:25.534 --> 00:02:26.267 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
Then how do we defeat her?

00:02:28.234 --> 00:02:31.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase is bound
to kill someone soon.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've never seen a monster
of the imagination

00:02:33.534 --> 00:02:35.767 position:21% line:89% align:start
grow to this extent.

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:37.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
I dove into the wiki page,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
but it seems like
they're somehow making her

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
even more violent.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Precisely why
we'll have to use this site

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
to our advantage in order
to bring her down.

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:47.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
If she's become immortal

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:49.267 position:35% line:83% align:start
because of
everyone's imagination,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
we'll just have to conquer
that imagination.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.133 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
Saki, this is where
your abilities

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
as a police officer
will come in handy.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're saying want me
to get the police

00:02:59.868 --> 00:03:01.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
to shut the website down?

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:02.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not at all.

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:04.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
It isn't very realistic
to shut down

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:06.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
a personal website
without a valid reason.

00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:08.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then what do you
want from me?

00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:09.767 position:33% line:89% align:start
Information.

00:03:09.801 --> 00:03:11.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
I need you to get me
valid information

00:03:11.901 --> 00:03:13.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
on Karin Nanase's death.

00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:15.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
We craft a story,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
one plausible and interesting
enough to surpass the rumors.

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:20.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase is a ghost

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
As well as a monster of
the imagination

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:24.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
created from that story.

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:25.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
To find a way past that,

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll overwrite this part
of the story

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:29.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
and convince people to think
that she's something

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.901 position:30% line:83% align:start
people made up,
and not actually a ghost.

00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:35.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
If the people who believed in
Steel Lady Nanase's existence

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:36.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
believe the revised story,

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
then Steel Lady Nanase
will lose her vitality

00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:41.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
and cease to exist.

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:45.434 position:33% line:83% align:start
A story where
the ghost doesn't exist...

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:46.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
So you plan to apply

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
a rational explanation
to an urban legend

00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:50.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
and prove that it was a lie?

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:52.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
Impossible.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
Once a rumor starts spreading,

00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:56.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
it doesn't matter if there's
a rational explanation.

00:03:56.767 --> 00:03:59.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not everyone will accept it.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
If the rumor seems
more believable,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
then lies can replace
the truth,

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
regardless of whether
there are discrepancies.

00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:06.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's correct.

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:08.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
The truth isn't always
the strongest approach.

00:04:08.434 --> 00:04:11.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
But Steel Lady Nanase
is also the truth.

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:13.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
Which is why I'm going
to use rational fiction

00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:15.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
to counteract her.

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:17.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] I'll post something on
the forums more appealing

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
than the standard
"Steel Lady Nanase is a ghost."

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
A statement that suggests

00:04:21.868 --> 00:04:23.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
that the stories about
Steel Lady Nanase

00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:24.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
are all fiction.

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:25.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
And should be forgotten.

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:26.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>Rational fiction?</i>

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:28.234 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
"Ghosts don't exist,

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:31.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
therefore Steel Lady Nanase
doesn't exist, either."

00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:34.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
No one's interested in a story
that resolves like that.

00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:36.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's the hopes and fears
people have that make

00:04:36.267 --> 00:04:38.601 position:33% line:83% align:start
her existence
more interesting to them.

00:04:38.634 --> 00:04:39.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
The Steel Lady exists,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
but is a monster of
the imagination.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
She'll vanish if people
stop thinking about her.

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:46.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
Telling that truth
produces the same result.

00:04:46.968 --> 00:04:48.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
In fact, there'll be more
people writing

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
that they hope she exists.

00:04:50.234 --> 00:04:52.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because that's far more
interesting.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
But even if it is a lie,

00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:55.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
If we can manage to
create a story

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
that's more interesting
than the false spectre,

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:00.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
people will flock
to it instead.

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:03.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
Though many people really
do believe in spirits,

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:06.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
They also wholeheartedly wish
that such terrifying things

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
-didn't exist.
-[gasp]

00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:11.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
These desires coexist
on opposing vectors,

00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:13.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
so we can easily flip
their direction.

00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:15.300 position:10% line:89% align:start
All right, that makes sense.

00:05:15.334 --> 00:05:18.534 position:7% line:83% align:start
But still, since you sympathize
with spectres,

00:05:18.567 --> 00:05:20.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
the idea of you trying
to prove that

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
they actually don't exist
is basically fraud.

00:05:23.267 --> 00:05:26.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes. That's true.
It's a hoax.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:30.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
But there's no other way
to exterminate this monster.

00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:33.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Let's discuss
something a bit more realistic.

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:35.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
In order to convince
the forum posters

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
that Steel Lady Nanase
isn't a real-life ghost,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
There are two problems
we need to address.

00:05:40.968 --> 00:05:42.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
First, we have to explain

00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:44.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
who's causing all of
these attacks

00:05:44.267 --> 00:05:47.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
that have been happening
all around Makurazaka City.

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:49.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
Second, we have to
be able to explain

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:51.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
why they're doing
something like this.

00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:53.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
We offer a new solution

00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:56.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
that will realistically
explain these two factors.

00:05:56.334 --> 00:06:00.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
We will bind Steel Lady Nanase
in rational fiction.

00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
I need accurate information
to make this plan happen.

00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:06.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
If I were to write something
just using just the information

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:08.534 position:38% line:83% align:start
about her
that's available online,

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:11.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
And later, someone points out
there was an error,

00:06:11.067 --> 00:06:13.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
suddenly, our solution
sounds less credible.

00:06:13.801 --> 00:06:15.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
And that's the reason why

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:17.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
I need information
from the police.

00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:20.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
Especially concerning
Karin Nanase's death.

00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:23.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're asking an officer
to leak personal--? [gasp]

00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.834 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:06:24.868 --> 00:06:26.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought this might
prove more difficult

00:06:26.367 --> 00:06:28.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
since you're an officer
in the traffic division,

00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:31.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
But you already have documents
on Karin Nanase right here!

00:06:31.868 --> 00:06:33.400 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey! Give that ba--

00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:36.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Saki] Hey, Kuro!

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:38.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
What is with this girl?!

00:06:38.067 --> 00:06:40.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
I tried warning you
yesterday, didn't I?!

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:43.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
I told you not to get involved
with the Steel Lady!

00:06:43.868 --> 00:06:46.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
But seeing how you have
documents on her,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you can't let
Steel Lady Nanase go either.

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
As I told you yesterday,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
A detective I know believes
Steel Lady Nanase

00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:55.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
is part of a larger incident,
and is investigating--

00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:59.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then we have the same goal.
We have to defeat her somehow,

00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:01.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
And that's exactly
why I need these.

00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:05.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
Saki, will you
help me out, here?

00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:08.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm fine with helping you
gather some more information,

00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:10.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
but what about
the perpetrator?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even if you're going to
make up some rational story,

00:07:13.367 --> 00:07:15.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
we don't have a suspect
we can arrest.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I'm not at all
comfortable with the idea

00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:19.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
of framing someone either.

00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:22.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll figure out a way that
we can avoid all of that.

00:07:22.934 --> 00:07:25.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our ultimate goal here,
is to offer a story

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
more appealing than
the truth.

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:28.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
That there's some ghost
out there

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
actually causing
all of these incidents.

00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:32.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
So in the long run,

00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:35.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
it doesn't matter if we can't
pinpoint a suspect.

00:07:35.334 --> 00:07:38.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because Steel Lady Nanase
was deliberately made up

00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:39.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
by someone online.

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:42.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
We just need people
to believe that solution.

00:07:42.968 --> 00:07:44.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
What you're saying is,
it doesn't matter

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
if the police can
solve this or not.

00:07:46.968 --> 00:07:48.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
As long as the people
who believe

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
in Steel Lady Nanase,
are convinced by something

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
that makes sense to them,
we win.

00:07:53.634 --> 00:07:54.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is that about it?

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:55.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's correct.

00:07:55.734 --> 00:07:57.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
That seems a bit harsh.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
Compared to a fake solution
that relies on

00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:01.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
a police investigation
and going to trial,

00:08:01.767 --> 00:08:03.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
it seems less difficult.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess I can at least
reveal everything

00:08:04.968 --> 00:08:06.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm allowed to.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
I suggest we start
with an outline and

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
go back over any questions
or doubts.

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:13.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
Karin Nanase was suspected
of killing her father,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
and the media was after her,
so she hid in Makurazaka City.

00:08:17.234 --> 00:08:20.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
Her body was discovered
on January 30th of this year,

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
just after eight in the morning.

00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:24.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
One of the first questions
in the investigation,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
was what Karin Nanase
was even doing there.

00:08:27.133 --> 00:08:29.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
She was found at a vacant
construction site

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:30.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
for a future condo.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's a very unlikely place

00:08:32.467 --> 00:08:34.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
for a 19-year-old girl
to visit.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
And after midnight,
it was pouring,

00:08:36.968 --> 00:08:39.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
so there was really no one
around in the area.

00:08:39.934 --> 00:08:41.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was rather unusual
for her to be out

00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:44.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
in that rainy weather,
so late.

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:45.934 position:7% line:89% align:start
The only plausible explanation

00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:46.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
is that someone must've
called her out there

00:08:46.868 --> 00:08:48.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
to meet with her.

00:08:48.367 --> 00:08:50.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
Indeed, and according
to the reports I've read,

00:08:50.367 --> 00:08:52.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
there were cigarettes
next to her.

00:08:52.467 --> 00:08:55.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Saki] There was an umbrella
and five cigarette butts.

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
And inside her coat pocket,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
they also found a lighter and
an open pack of cigarettes.

00:09:00.868 --> 00:09:02.634 position:16% line:89% align:start
Karin Nanase was a minor,

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
so she wouldn't legally
be allowed to smoke.

00:09:05.634 --> 00:09:06.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
The police suspect that

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
she came over here with
the intention to smoke

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
without being bothered
or noticed, by anyone.

00:09:12.834 --> 00:09:15.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
Karin Nanase was called there
to meet with someone,

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
and smoked while waiting
for them to show up.

00:09:17.534 --> 00:09:20.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of course, it's also possible
that the person she met with,

00:09:20.934 --> 00:09:22.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
was already waiting there

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
and that was the one
who was smoking.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
That wasn't completely
ruled out.

00:09:26.334 --> 00:09:28.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
But it was pouring down
the whole night.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
So even if someone else
was there,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
any footprints would've
been washed away.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
But if someone was trying
to get a hold of her,

00:09:34.868 --> 00:09:36.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'd think we'd find
a record of them

00:09:36.734 --> 00:09:38.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
trying to call her phone.

00:09:38.167 --> 00:09:40.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
But all they found in
her phone history,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
were messages between her
and her manager.

00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:44.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even early on in
the investigation,

00:09:44.434 --> 00:09:47.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
police were trying to rule
this as an accident.

00:09:47.334 --> 00:09:50.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
Steel beams suddenly falling,
killing her instantly,

00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:53.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
would be the easiest and
most rational explanation.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
But if that's truly the case,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
some other problems
begin to arise.

00:09:59.868 --> 00:10:01.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] Like what?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
The fact that there was
no sign of her

00:10:02.734 --> 00:10:04.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
trying to defend herself,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
as the steel beams came
falling down on her face.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
If a steel beam was
about to fall on you,

00:10:08.501 --> 00:10:09.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
even if it was hopeless,

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
you would try to move,
or at least instinctively try

00:10:12.534 --> 00:10:14.834 position:35% line:83% align:start
to brace or
defend yourself somehow.

00:10:14.868 --> 00:10:16.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
But there was no sign
of that.

00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:17.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, it's also debatable

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:19.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
that she might've allowed
herself to get crushed.

00:10:19.968 --> 00:10:21.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
There was also a theory,

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
that if it actually
was a murder,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
the perp could've hit her
hard enough

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
to knock her unconscious,

00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:31.501 position:5% line:83% align:start
laid her into position and then,
pushed the beams onto her.

00:10:31.534 --> 00:10:34.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
But Karin Nanase was on
the run from the media,

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:37.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
and was a suspect in
the death of her own father.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
They thought she might be
at her wit's end.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
It seemed likely that
she was feeling desperate,

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:45.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, if steel beams had fallen
on her around that time,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
it wouldn't be surprising

00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:48.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
if she was too out
of it to react.

00:10:48.767 --> 00:10:50.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
That seemed more likely.

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:51.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, the theory about someone

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:54.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
knocking her out
was discarded.

00:10:54.267 --> 00:10:57.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
Okay, Karin Nanase was tired
of running from the media

00:10:57.868 --> 00:11:00.067 position:33% line:83% align:start
and had even
contemplated suicide.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
The steel beams fell
on her amid all that and,

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
she just couldn't be bothered
to avoid getting crushed.

00:11:05.868 --> 00:11:07.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
A possible explanation.

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:10.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
Other investigators came to
that same conclusion.

00:11:10.734 --> 00:11:11.868 position:35% line:89% align:start
In the end,

00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:14.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
even though the police
officially ruled

00:11:14.234 --> 00:11:16.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
Karin Nanase's death
to be an accident,

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
considering the situation,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
there was an unofficial
conclusion that

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.234 position:7% line:83% align:start
this accidental death could've
also been a suicide.

00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:25.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
Her older sister,
Hatsumi Nanase,

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:28.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
the person most likely to have
a motive to kill her,

00:11:28.734 --> 00:11:29.834 position:33% line:89% align:start
had an alibi.

00:11:29.868 --> 00:11:31.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
There were no other
likely suspects,

00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:33.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
so police came to a conclusion

00:11:33.868 --> 00:11:35.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
a month after her body
was found.

00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:37.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her own sister had
a reason to kill her?

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:39.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:11:39.267 --> 00:11:41.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
She'd been telling others
that her sister was responsible

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:42.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
for their father's death.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:44.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
If Karin Nanase were to die,

00:11:44.467 --> 00:11:47.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
her entire estate would
be given to Hatsumi.

00:11:47.434 --> 00:11:48.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
In other words,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
Karin's death would've
been convenient.

00:11:50.868 --> 00:11:52.834 position:38% line:83% align:start
Even now,
among all the questions

00:11:52.868 --> 00:11:54.367 position:35% line:83% align:start
surrounding
Karin Nanase's death,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
the biggest one is
her sister, Hatsumi.

00:11:57.067 --> 00:11:58.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
But during the investigation,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
she was the only person
who denied the theory

00:12:01.868 --> 00:12:03.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
that her sister was,
in fact, suicidal,

00:12:03.734 --> 00:12:05.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
and wanted another answer.

00:12:05.133 --> 00:12:06.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's strange that
she'd take issue

00:12:06.801 --> 00:12:09.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
with the police concluding
that her sister's death

00:12:09.467 --> 00:12:10.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
was all an accident.

00:12:10.534 --> 00:12:13.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
You'd think an older sister
suspected of murder,

00:12:13.267 --> 00:12:15.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
would want the case to
get wrapped up quickly.

00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:17.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
And yet, it bothers me

00:12:17.267 --> 00:12:19.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
how she was convinced that
if her sister were to die,

00:12:19.634 --> 00:12:21.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
it wouldn't be like that.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, Iwanaga, you wanna tell us
what actually happened?

00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:25.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
What do you mean, Kuro?

00:12:25.334 --> 00:12:26.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
The way things usually go,

00:12:26.868 --> 00:12:28.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
you probably already
know what happened.

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:31.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm glad you've gotten
to know me so well.

00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:34.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I didn't use
my usual methods this time.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
There were far
too many people around,

00:12:36.133 --> 00:12:37.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I couldn't go to
the crime scene.

00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:39.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
So why don't we head
over right now?

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:40.734 position:38% line:89% align:start
Go where?

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:42.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're going to go
find a witness.

00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:55.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Saki] Why in the world did
you bring me here?!

00:12:55.934 --> 00:12:57.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's been over six months

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
since the body of
Karin Nanase was found!

00:12:59.701 --> 00:13:00.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's the point
in coming

00:13:00.934 --> 00:13:02.067 position:30% line:83% align:start
to the scene of
the crime now?!

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.834 position:41% line:83% align:start
Right.
You won't find anything.

00:13:03.868 --> 00:13:05.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
Which also means
no one will be watching.

00:13:05.934 --> 00:13:07.934 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that means,
it's an opportune time

00:13:07.968 --> 00:13:10.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
for those who aren't human
to come forth.

00:13:10.567 --> 00:13:12.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
[energy gathering]

00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:17.334 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right,
let's take a look, shall we?!

00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:21.334 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:23.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
She won't be satisfied
unless she does all this.

00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:25.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's a holy priestess's dance!

00:13:25.868 --> 00:13:28.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
And priestesses draw
magic circles now?

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:29.934 position:30% line:83% align:start
Didn't you see
how cool it was?!

00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:31.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
Who are you trying
to show off to?

00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:33.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, naturally,
for the one

00:13:33.133 --> 00:13:34.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
who's about to
be summoned forth.

00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:35.767 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:38.300 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Male voice]
You guys are so loud.

00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:39.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.434 position:7% line:83% align:start
[haunt] What are you doing here
this late at night?

00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:43.968 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scream]

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
And we're lucky enough to
run into a human spirit.

00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:47.767 position:21% line:89% align:start
This should be easy.

00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:48.968 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, is it you?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
The lady of one eye and one leg?

00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:53.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
The ayakashi all around town
have been talking about you.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
So that means that he's...

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
the creature that's part
kudan and part mermaid?

00:13:58.667 --> 00:14:00.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes! He's part human, too.

00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:02.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh... How disturbing.

00:14:02.868 --> 00:14:04.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, out of curiosity,

00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:05.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
have you been here
for a while?

00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:06.834 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:06.868 --> 00:14:08.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ever since I died at
this site last year.

00:14:08.667 --> 00:14:10.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, you would've been here
when it occurred.

00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:13.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
The accident happened
in late January.

00:14:13.133 --> 00:14:15.901 position:33% line:83% align:start
One in which
a 19-year-old girl was killed.

00:14:15.934 --> 00:14:18.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, do you mean Karin Nanase?

00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:19.534 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:20.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
So you know of her then.

00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:22.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, after all...

00:14:22.067 --> 00:14:25.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
I witnessed the moment
that she met her end!

00:14:25.234 --> 00:14:28.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>That night in the rain,</i>
 <i>she was all alone.</i>

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>The poor girl seemed</i>
 <i>terribly depressed.</i>

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>And then...</i>

00:14:34.968 --> 00:14:36.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, look out!

00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:46.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>She didn't even bother</i>

00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:49.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>trying to dodge</i>
 <i>the steel beams.</i>

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
It happened so quickly!

00:14:50.234 --> 00:14:52.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was basically suicide!

00:14:52.234 --> 00:14:53.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
If only I were faster,
or stronger...

00:14:53.567 --> 00:14:56.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
I might've been able
to redirect them.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.367 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now, now.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no reason for you
to feel responsible.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
And this clarifies the truth
of what we were looking for.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
The city's police are efficient.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was an accidental death
bordering on suicide.

00:15:07.367 --> 00:15:07.767 position:33% line:89% align:start
Case closed.

00:15:07.801 --> 00:15:09.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now hold on!

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:11.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
Is this really a good way
to investigate?

00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:13.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
There were no deductions!

00:15:13.067 --> 00:15:15.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
We have an unrelated
third-party eyewitness.

00:15:15.334 --> 00:15:17.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
What could be better
for relaying the events

00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:18.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
that transpired?

00:15:18.434 --> 00:15:19.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
So you didn't even
need to confirm

00:15:19.801 --> 00:15:22.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
the police investigation
in the first place, did you?!

00:15:22.968 --> 00:15:24.334 position:33% line:83% align:start
You could've
found out everything

00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:25.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
by asking ghosts and yokai.

00:15:25.868 --> 00:15:27.767 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's important
to know the truth.

00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:29.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
But it's perhaps
equally important to see

00:15:29.934 --> 00:15:31.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
what is generally regarded
as the truth

00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:32.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
by the world at large,

00:15:32.868 --> 00:15:34.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
and what conclusions
stem from it.

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:36.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's how those
on the Internet

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:38.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
who fantasize about
Steel Lady Nanase

00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:40.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
formulate their ideas
and function.

00:15:40.634 --> 00:15:42.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
I won't be using anything

00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:43.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
beyond what's available
to them.

00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:46.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
And even if there's information
that's not the truth,

00:15:46.167 --> 00:15:47.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
but is believed
as the truth,

00:15:47.868 --> 00:15:49.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll use that, as well.

00:15:49.767 --> 00:15:51.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
I am the Goddess of Wisdom.

00:15:51.567 --> 00:15:52.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
To create this fiction,

00:15:52.934 --> 00:15:54.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll need to make it
sound more convincing.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.534 position:33% line:83% align:start
And I'll use
any means necessary.

00:15:57.567 --> 00:15:58.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's our lady!

00:15:58.767 --> 00:16:01.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
I will use this frustration
to do my best, too!

00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:03.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
By the time this building
is finished,

00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:06.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll be strong enough
to be a guardian spirit!

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:11.968 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Saki] All of this is starting
to feel pretty reckless.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even if the conclusion
you post on the forum

00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:15.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
is well-written,

00:16:15.367 --> 00:16:17.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
and is able to draw
people's attention to it,

00:16:17.868 --> 00:16:19.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
in the end, whether people
accept it or not

00:16:19.434 --> 00:16:23.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
is going to depend
entirely on luck, isn't it?

00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:26.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
The problem is,
people aren't always logical.

00:16:26.734 --> 00:16:28.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
Many people would
be impressed

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:30.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
that something mystical
had been resolved,

00:16:30.133 --> 00:16:32.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
but there are others who
want to believe in ghosts.

00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:34.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
Will these lies
be able to hold up,

00:16:34.334 --> 00:16:36.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
even when we can't sure
what that balance is?

00:16:36.968 --> 00:16:38.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
But that's also
the reason why

00:16:38.367 --> 00:16:41.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
monsters of the imagination
aren't so easily created.

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:44.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can't know if a lot of
people will believe it or not

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:45.634 position:16% line:89% align:start
unless we give it a try.

00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:48.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
Our chances against
the already-spread rumors

00:16:48.067 --> 00:16:50.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
of Steel Lady Nanase,
aren't going to be the best.

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:52.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
But every major rumor is
at least believable

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
to some extent, isn't it?

00:16:55.133 --> 00:16:58.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
Besides, we have
our secret weapon, Kuro.

00:16:58.968 --> 00:17:00.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
If there's a possibility
that I can produce

00:17:00.934 --> 00:17:03.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
a somewhat appealing lie that
enough netizens will accept,

00:17:03.968 --> 00:17:07.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
then Kuro will make it
an absolute certainty.

00:17:08.167 --> 00:17:10.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, he didn't eat kudan meat
and survive for nothing,

00:17:10.901 --> 00:17:12.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can tell you that much!

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:15.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kuro] Goodnight, Saki.
See you later.

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:16.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes, have a goodnight.

00:17:16.868 --> 00:17:19.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
Right...
See you later.

00:17:19.234 --> 00:17:21.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
So Kuro, did you get
a hotel in the area?

00:17:21.901 --> 00:17:24.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
Not yet, I hadn't quite
gotten that far.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought that might
be the case,

00:17:25.834 --> 00:17:28.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I made sure I'm staying
in a room with a double bed.

00:17:28.501 --> 00:17:29.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm pretty sure

00:17:29.534 --> 00:17:31.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
I saw a business hotel
by the station.

00:17:31.901 --> 00:17:34.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why do you refuse
to sleep with me?!

00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:36.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
This isn't really
the time for that.

00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:37.200 position:35% line:89% align:start
Iwanaga...

00:17:38.234 --> 00:17:39.734 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do you know
what kind of "solution"

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
you're going to create?

00:17:41.267 --> 00:17:43.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have to explain
why the perpetrator takes

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
Karin Nanase's form
and attacks people.

00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:48.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
I could come up with
countless motives, of course.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
But if you're asking
whether or not

00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:52.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
it'll be impactful enough
to draw attention...

00:17:52.868 --> 00:17:53.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's hard to say.

00:17:53.734 --> 00:17:55.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:17:55.067 --> 00:17:57.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Linking it up with
the past incident,

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
and polishing the narrative
into more of a tearjerker

00:17:59.334 --> 00:18:01.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
might give the new rendition
wider appeal.

00:18:01.834 --> 00:18:03.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kuro] Not exactly
something realistic,

00:18:03.334 --> 00:18:05.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
but a version that seems
more like a story.

00:18:05.801 --> 00:18:07.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes, the world is
full of harsh truths

00:18:07.834 --> 00:18:08.901 position:27% line:89% align:start
every single day.

00:18:08.934 --> 00:18:11.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
And no one finds
them desirable.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
And after that,
it'll all be up to you, Kuro.

00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:16.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'll go get the future

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
that goes along
with your solution.

00:18:18.334 --> 00:18:21.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll die as many times
as I need to for you.

00:18:23.901 --> 00:18:26.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kuro] There's not just
a single future.

00:18:26.067 --> 00:18:28.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
When you look into
the future from the present,

00:18:28.701 --> 00:18:30.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
it splits, changes,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.067 position:30% line:83% align:start
and spreads out
into different paths.

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:37.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
There are pathways to
a variety of futures,

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:39.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
and any of those futures
are possible.

00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:41.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
And the moment
you choose a path

00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:43.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
and move forward,

00:18:43.133 --> 00:18:45.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
all the branches
behind you disappear,

00:18:45.734 --> 00:18:47.367 position:33% line:83% align:start
and the past
becomes one path.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
One path to the past
and the infinite future.

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:52.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
The future's always
unknown and undecided.

00:18:52.901 --> 00:18:54.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
But wouldn't that make
telling the future,

00:18:54.868 --> 00:18:56.701 position:19% line:89% align:start
pretty much impossible?

00:18:56.734 --> 00:18:58.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
If the future splits
infinitely,

00:18:58.534 --> 00:19:00.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
there would be no way
to find a single destination.

00:19:00.834 --> 00:19:02.234 position:38% line:89% align:start
And yet,

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
the kudan can make
predictions without fail.

00:19:04.701 --> 00:19:05.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why the contradiction?

00:19:05.934 --> 00:19:07.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
The kudan doesn't
make predictions

00:19:07.868 --> 00:19:09.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
by looking into the future.

00:19:09.267 --> 00:19:11.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
The kudan is able to winnow
those infinite splits

00:19:11.968 --> 00:19:13.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
into a single future.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
It has the power to determine
which future will occur,

00:19:16.734 --> 00:19:18.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
and what destination awaits.

00:19:18.367 --> 00:19:21.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
So that's the true power of
the prophet beast kudan?

00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:24.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
What a terrifying ability.

00:19:24.067 --> 00:19:28.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
In order to use that power,
the kudan loses its life.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
It searches through
the endless amounts of futures

00:19:30.934 --> 00:19:32.901 position:7% line:89% align:start
and ultimately decides on one.

00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:35.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
So its life force
probably burns out.

00:19:36.434 --> 00:19:39.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kuro] However, it can't
determine any kind of future.

00:19:39.434 --> 00:19:41.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nor can they use it
to their advantage.

00:19:41.868 --> 00:19:43.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are the limitations?

00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:45.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, if I'm not prepared
to die,

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't see the splits
in the future to choose from.

00:19:48.234 --> 00:19:49.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
Perhaps the kudan
doesn't die

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
because it states
its prophecy,

00:19:51.868 --> 00:19:53.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
but is able to state
its prophecy

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.234 position:7% line:89% align:start
because it's preparing to die.

00:19:55.267 --> 00:19:58.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then I guess glimpsing
into the future

00:19:58.133 --> 00:20:00.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
is a privilege for those
about to die.

00:20:00.234 --> 00:20:02.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
You talk like
it doesn't apply to you.

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:04.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, I can return to life.

00:20:04.167 --> 00:20:06.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>Also, I can only</i>
 <i>choose futures</i>

00:20:06.267 --> 00:20:08.100 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:20:08.133 --> 00:20:10.100 position:19% line:83% align:start

 <i>a year into the future,</i>

00:20:10.133 --> 00:20:11.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
 <i>there are too many variables,</i>

00:20:11.868 --> 00:20:13.567 position:19% line:83% align:start

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.367 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.701 position:19% line:83% align:start

 <i>and difficult to grasp.</i>

00:20:19.734 --> 00:20:21.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
This all sounds like a pain.

00:20:21.467 --> 00:20:22.667 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:24.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, by the way, Kuro,

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's something I wanted
to report to you today.

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:27.400 position:41% line:89% align:start
Report?

00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:28.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:20:28.367 --> 00:20:30.567 position:35% line:83% align:start
I received
my letter of acceptance!

00:20:30.601 --> 00:20:32.000 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, fantastic.

00:20:32.033 --> 00:20:33.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll be going to
the same university

00:20:33.701 --> 00:20:34.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
in the spring.

00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:36.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
Pretty cool, right?

00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:37.868 position:38% line:89% align:start
So, Kuro,

00:20:37.901 --> 00:20:40.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
when Steel Lady Nanase
killed you earlier,

00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:41.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
were you not able
to find a future

00:20:41.734 --> 00:20:43.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
in which she can
be destroyed?

00:20:43.467 --> 00:20:44.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
If there was one,

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
then I wasn't able
to reach it.

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:47.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
There were too many pathways,

00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:49.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
I didn't have the time
to sort through them.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
Finding the best future
to defeat that thing

00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:55.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
and coming back to life
took everything out of me.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
Though, you didn't actually
defeat her.

00:20:57.133 --> 00:21:00.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
You always think you can
solve everything on your own.

00:21:00.033 --> 00:21:02.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah? Look who's talking.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can come back to life,
but if you die, that's it.

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:08.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>You leave me alone</i>
 <i>for a whole week,</i>

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:10.567 position:21% line:83% align:start

 <i>you're my guardian?</i>

00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:14.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Back then, Kuro died once,</i>
 <i>determined a future,</i>

00:21:14.133 --> 00:21:16.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>and came back,</i>
 <i>like nothing had happened.</i>

00:21:16.133 --> 00:21:19.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>But even after all that,</i>
 <i>he couldn't determine a future</i>

00:21:19.267 --> 00:21:22.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>where he was able to</i>
 <i>defeat Steel Lady Nanase.</i>

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.767 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>That was a potential future</i>
 <i>outside of Kuro's grasp.</i>

00:21:25.801 --> 00:21:29.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>That's why it's my job to</i>
 <i>make it something obtainable.</i>

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>If I can at least set up</i>
 <i>an opportunity,</i>

00:21:31.834 --> 00:21:34.234 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>we can defeat</i>
 <i>Steel Lady Nanase.</i>

00:21:34.267 --> 00:21:38.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>And Kuro will make</i>
 <i>that opportunity a reality.</i>

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
So... you haven't told Saki
about her, have you?

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:44.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
Nope I didn't say
a single word.

00:21:44.868 --> 00:21:45.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, that's good.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.267 position:30% line:83% align:start
It hasn't been
determined that

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
she's actually involved
in any of this.

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:51.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
So hey, why didn't you try

00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:53.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
using your power over
the future to choose a path

00:21:53.767 --> 00:21:55.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
where you and Saki
didn't break up?

00:21:55.834 --> 00:21:56.834 position:27% line:89% align:start
If I can do that,

00:21:56.868 --> 00:21:58.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm going to go grab
a future

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
where it's okay for me
to break up with you.

00:22:00.801 --> 00:22:02.701 position:41% line:83% align:start
Wait...
What are you trying to say?

00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:03.834 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's so mean!

00:22:03.868 --> 00:22:06.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why are you always
like this?!

00:22:06.067 --> 00:22:07.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] Don't worry.

00:22:07.534 --> 00:22:10.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not like I think
I can get back with Saki.

00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:12.601 position:38% line:83% align:start
I imagine
she feels the same way.

00:22:12.634 --> 00:22:13.901 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't overly appreciate

00:22:13.934 --> 00:22:15.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
the two of you agreeing
like that, either.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh? So, what exactly
do you want me to say?

00:22:18.133 --> 00:22:20.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
To passionately tell me
that you'll make me happy,

00:22:20.734 --> 00:22:21.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
no matter what.
