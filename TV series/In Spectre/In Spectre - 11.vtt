00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Rikka is
a worthy adversary.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
She'll present her argument,
literally die for it,

00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:22.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
and bring herself back

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
just to have control of
the flow.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:28.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I'm not alone
in this fight.

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:30.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have Kuro on my side,

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:33.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
and we won't let you
get away with it.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just because the third
solution was rejected,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
it's not like everybody would
have changed their minds.

00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:42.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
A certain percentage
should've switched over

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:43.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
to the side of disbelief

00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:45.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
because of the first
two ideas you gave.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
However many have
slipped between

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
the two camps of thought
is of no consequence.

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:50.367 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:54.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
It stands to reason that
many would be satisfied

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:56.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
with the explanation
thus far.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
Rikka is calculating
my moves

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:00.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
the same way that you are,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
and choosing her futures
based on

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:04.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
which ones have
the fewest dissenters.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
She's under the assumption
that I've been trying

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:09.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
to chip away at
her influence in stages.

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:14.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Which is what makes this
such an effective trap.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
The solutions
I've presented thus far

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
included previously
accepted scenarios.

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:20.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
Such as Detective Terada

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
investigating Steel Lady
Nanase on his own.

00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:25.934 position:35% line:83% align:start
As well as
Karin Nanase's father

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:28.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
leaving behind
a damning handwritten note.

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:30.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even if they reject
the solutions themselves,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
the basic elements
remain intact.

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:36.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even though our third
solution was rejected,

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:38.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
as was the portrait of
the killer from it...

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:40.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
nobody took issue with
the part where I said

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:42.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
that Karin Nanase's sister
was the one

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
who passed the note on
to the media.

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:45.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
Rikka will be satisfied

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
with whatever conclusion
results in

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
the ghost of Karin Nanase
continuing on

00:01:49.968 --> 00:01:52.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the imaginations of
her website's users.

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:54.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
So she sees no reason

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:57.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
to discard my solutions
by their roots...

00:01:57.334 --> 00:01:58.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
when she can achieve
her goal

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
by simply crushing
the solutions.

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
If she tried disproving
parts of the story

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:06.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
other than the outcome,
she'd stand out more.

00:02:06.868 --> 00:02:10.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
Therefore, Rikka is forced to
follow the simplest option.

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
But wouldn't that mean...?

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>Is she saying that</i>
 <i>what Rikka's doing to</i>

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:17.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>the futures she's chosen</i>

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>have all been a part</i>
 <i>of her plan?</i>

00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:22.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
The elements are
now in place.

00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:23.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
All that's left is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.601 position:35% line:83% align:start
to deliver
the finishing blow.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.200 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:35.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:38.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
New fiction is born
from fiction...

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:40.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
and inverts into the truth.

00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:45.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase will
be finished.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:48.200 position:41% line:89% align:start
Humph!

00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:52.767 position:38% line:83% align:start
And now,
the fourth solution.

00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:54.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:09.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
[opening music]

00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:31.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:04:31.534 --> 00:04:32.567 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] I still say,

00:04:38.234 --> 00:04:40.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase is
pure fiction!

00:04:40.701 --> 00:04:42.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
The three solutions
I've presented thus far

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:45.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
formed the foundation needed
to get to the actual truth.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
Someone's behind this.

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:49.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
They not only created
Steel Lady Nanase

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:51.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
they also murdered
Detective Terada.

00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:53.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Anon] <i>We've been</i>

00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:57.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
The one we've been
focusing on

00:04:57.801 --> 00:05:00.467 position:38% line:83% align:start
is the on
behind this, i.e.

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:01.968 position:33% line:89% align:start
Karin Nanase!

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
She's actually still alive!

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
The person who died at
the construction site

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
was someone else made
to look like Karin!

00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:11.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you have a corpse
without a face,

00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:13.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
it being switched for
someone else

00:05:13.434 --> 00:05:14.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
isn't a stretch.

00:05:14.534 --> 00:05:16.734 position:35% line:83% align:start
Ultimately,
the real Karin Nanase

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:17.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
is still alive.

00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:20.701 position:24% line:83% align:start

 <i>no Steel Lady Nanase.</i>

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:29.767 position:21% line:89% align:start
Her father was dead,

00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:31.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
and her sister
had turned her back.

00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:33.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now she was all alone.

00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:50.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Karin] Excuse me!

00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:50.367 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:55.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry to startle you...
I saw you walk by...

00:05:55.234 --> 00:05:58.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I couldn't help
but notice we look alike.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] And that was
how it all began...

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:02.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
Their faces were different,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
but their builds
were similar,

00:06:04.634 --> 00:06:05.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
as were their hair lengths,

00:06:05.868 --> 00:06:08.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
and they were roughly
the same age.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll refer to her
as "Miss A"

00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:11.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
for ease of discussion.

00:06:11.868 --> 00:06:13.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's impossible for us
to know

00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:15.434 position:33% line:83% align:start
what Miss A's
circumstances were.

00:06:15.467 --> 00:06:17.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
Perhaps she was estranged
from her family,

00:06:17.334 --> 00:06:20.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
had no friends, or suffered
from a mental illness.

00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:21.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
But unfortunately for her,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
she was found by
Karin Nanase.

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:27.400 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>If I can leave</i>
 <i>my public self behind</i>

00:06:27.434 --> 00:06:29.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>and start over as</i>
 <i>a new person...</i>

00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:31.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] That desire for
a fresh start

00:06:31.601 --> 00:06:33.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
led her to commit a crime.

00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:34.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Karin] Say...

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have a favor to ask.

00:06:37.534 --> 00:06:40.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
From there, Karin Nanase
managed to coax

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:42.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
Miss A into her hotel room,

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:44.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
and had her touch
her personal belongings.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
She was careful
to wipe away

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
her own fingerprints
from the room,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
ensuring that only Miss A's
prints would remain.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
I assume Miss A had
some motivation

00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:57.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
to assist Karin Nanase.

00:06:58.567 --> 00:07:00.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
Depressed, and
contemplating suicide

00:07:00.868 --> 00:07:03.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
before being stopped
by Karin Nanase,

00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:06.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
Miss A became dependent
on her.

00:07:06.167 --> 00:07:09.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
One might surmise that she
was promised compensation,

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:11.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
so she was more
than willing.

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:13.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Miss A] So I'm going to
act as your decoy

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:16.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
and lead the media

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:25.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Karin] How could they?

00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:29.601 position:21% line:83% align:start

You've got this.

00:07:30.734 --> 00:07:32.801 position:35% line:83% align:start

It's empty.
Which is totally ideal.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because the media would
never go in there.

00:07:38.534 --> 00:07:40.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's meet there tonight.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] If Karin Nanase
hadn't met her,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
the rumors would've run
their course,

00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:48.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
and they both would have
had the chance

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:50.934 position:13% line:89% align:start
to live long, happy lives.

00:07:50.968 --> 00:07:53.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
But sunk in the
irrationality of despair,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
the idol had been handed
the chance

00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:58.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
to restart her life in
the most dramatic fashion.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.133 position:41% line:89% align:start

[loud bang]

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
Miss A's face was crushed
beyond recognition.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
The steel beams made it
impossible

00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:30.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
to identify her that way.

00:08:30.067 --> 00:08:31.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that would explain
one of

00:08:31.534 --> 00:08:34.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
the long-standing questions
of the case...

00:08:34.033 --> 00:08:36.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why did Karin Nanase let
the steel beams hit her

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:38.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
without any signs
of struggle,

00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:40.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
or a defensive posture?

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.934 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's because
the body wasn't hers.

00:08:44.968 --> 00:08:46.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
It was the body of
someone else

00:08:46.834 --> 00:08:47.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
who'd been knocked
unconscious

00:08:47.868 --> 00:08:49.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
before the steel beams
fell on her.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Karin finished falsifying
the scene of the ""accident""

00:08:56.133 --> 00:08:57.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
and then she fled.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
Miss A's identity gave her
a shot at a new life.

00:09:03.801 --> 00:09:05.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
It was the chance
she needed

00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:06.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
to break free from her past.

00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:08.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
[employee] And that's all
filed away.

00:09:08.501 --> 00:09:10.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Here's your driver's
license back, Miss.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] She'd need to
change her appearance

00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:16.367 position:33% line:83% align:start
to keep from
being recognized,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
but that shouldn't have
been too difficult for her.

00:09:19.667 --> 00:09:21.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
Someone that determined
would've been able

00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:22.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
to pull it off.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
The body that
the police found at

00:09:25.133 --> 00:09:28.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
the construction site in
Makurazaka City this year

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
was not Karin Nanase.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
She fooled us all with
the faceless corpse switch.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.067 position:35% line:83% align:start
Meanwhile,
she's alive and well.

[growl]

00:13:36.567 --> 00:13:39.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
After all, there's an order
to this world

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
that even the strongest
cannot infringe upon.

00:13:43.534 --> 00:13:44.534 position:30% line:89% align:start
Exactly right!

00:13:44.567 --> 00:13:46.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
In order to make herself
completely dead,

00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:48.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
at least according to
the public eye...

00:13:48.767 --> 00:13:50.400 position:33% line:83% align:start
she invented
her very own ghost,

00:13:50.434 --> 00:13:52.667 position:33% line:83% align:start
and made sure
Steel Lady Nanase was

00:13:52.701 --> 00:13:55.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
immediately the first thing
that came to people's minds.

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:57.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
This might not have gained
much attention

00:13:57.567 --> 00:13:59.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
until somebody pointed out
that the Steel Lady

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
looked a lot like
Karin Nanase.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
In order to make sure
that nobody figured out

00:14:04.868 --> 00:14:06.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
that a body swap
had happened,

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
and to keep the faceless
corpse trick under wraps...

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
she decided her next step
needed to be extreme.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
Karin Nanase started
to appear

00:14:14.868 --> 00:14:16.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
in Makurazaka City
every night

00:14:16.934 --> 00:14:18.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
as Steel Lady Nanase.

00:14:18.367 --> 00:14:20.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
Since she was simply playing
the ghost version of herself,

00:14:20.934 --> 00:14:23.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure the portrayal
seemed convincing.

00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:25.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
The rumors spread,
and suddenly,

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
it was a huge hit
on the Internet.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
But for the rumor to
spread more effectively,

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
to make it go far and wide,
she did one thing.

00:14:35.334 --> 00:14:36.501 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:14:36.534 --> 00:14:40.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
She created this Steel Lady
Nanase Wiki-page by herself.

00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:41.367 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:14:44.767 --> 00:14:46.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
Enough, Karin!

00:14:46.534 --> 00:14:48.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know that you created
this website,

00:14:48.801 --> 00:14:51.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
and that you're also
the admin!

00:14:51.567 --> 00:14:52.634 position:27% line:89% align:start

[Anonymous] <i>No way...</i>

00:14:53.801 --> 00:14:56.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I'm sure you're reading
my posts as we speak.

00:14:58.467 --> 00:14:59.367 position:24% line:89% align:start
From the beginning,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've been working to
expose your crimes!

00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:05.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] This site
spread rumors

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
about Steel Lady Nanase
very quickly,

00:15:07.634 --> 00:15:09.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
and magnified them.

00:15:09.067 --> 00:15:10.934 position:30% line:83% align:start
But the spread
of information was

00:15:10.968 --> 00:15:12.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
a little too convenient.

00:15:12.467 --> 00:15:13.400 position:24% line:89% align:start
Which is expected.

00:15:13.434 --> 00:15:16.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
You had the information,
managed the account,

00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:19.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
and ultimately, created
Steel Lady Nanase.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've tried to reject
every single solution

00:15:21.868 --> 00:15:24.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
that I've presented so far.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
All of my solutions were
intended to erase

00:15:26.868 --> 00:15:28.234 position:33% line:83% align:start
a ghost from
the equation...

00:15:28.267 --> 00:15:31.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yet if someone had concluded
that the ghost was a fake,

00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:33.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
it would've messed
things up for you.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
You want these rumors
to spread further,

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
so your ghost ""passing on""
isn't ideal.

00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:40.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
Which is why you've refuted
everything I said,

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
and even went so far as
trying to moderate my posts.

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:45.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's a flat-out lie.

00:15:45.033 --> 00:15:47.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
The person who created
the website and

00:15:47.534 --> 00:15:49.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
runs it was always Rikka!

00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:52.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] I told you from
the very start

00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:54.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
there'd be a fair amount
of lying.

Just last night,
in Makurazaka City.

00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:27.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
You were there to inflame
the Steel Lady Nanase panic,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
by checking out
the next location

00:16:29.734 --> 00:16:31.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
at which you planned
to appear.

00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:35.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
The detective,

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
who didn't think Steel Lady
Nanase was a ghost,

00:16:36.868 --> 00:16:37.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
drove by and saw you

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
and thought you were
suspicious.

00:16:39.701 --> 00:16:39.734 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Terada] Hmm?

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
You were probably still
dressed normally at the time,

00:16:43.634 --> 00:16:46.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
but there was something
he couldn't overlook...

00:16:46.267 --> 00:16:48.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
the fact that your boobs
were massive.

00:16:48.901 --> 00:16:50.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
Such distinguishing
features reminded him

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
of Steel Lady Nanase

00:16:52.434 --> 00:16:54.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
and made his intuition
go to work.

00:16:56.968 --> 00:16:58.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
For what it's worth,
I heard that

00:16:58.234 --> 00:17:00.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
the detective wasn't
a fan of big breasts.

00:17:00.334 --> 00:17:02.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
Of course, the same
could be said for Kuro.

00:17:02.634 --> 00:17:04.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
Taking my petite frame
into consideration...

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kuro isn't the kind of man
who judges women

I'm with
Makurazaka City PD.

00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:32.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
We've had reports
of suspicious activity.

00:17:32.868 --> 00:17:34.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

00:17:35.968 --> 00:17:38.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
What brings you here
this evening?

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh...

00:17:39.367 --> 00:17:42.067 position:16% line:83% align:start

Steel Lady Nanase
had attacked him.
