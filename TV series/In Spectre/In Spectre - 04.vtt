00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.601 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] Wow...

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:18.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
Talk about
a lack of personality...

00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:22.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Saki] So... How old are you?

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:24.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
I just turned nineteen.

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:27.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
And at present, I'm going
to the same university

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
that you and Kuro
both attended.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:31.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
I met you once
a long time ago

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:33.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
when you were at
the university hospital.

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:35.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
The university hospital?

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:38.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess I can't blame you
for not remembering.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
It was over four years ago.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
What you said earlier
was a lie, right?

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:47.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
That you're Kuro's girlfriend.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mean, you're not
Kuro's type in the slightest.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:55.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since someone who was
his type dumped him so cruelly,

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:58.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
it makes sense he might
seek out the complete opposite.

00:00:58.701 --> 00:00:59.901 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:00.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
I heard that Kuro's cousin in
the hospital had passed away,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
so maybe he talked to
this girl in desperation,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
and now, he just
can't get rid of her...

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
[angry grunt]

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
You think
you really know it all,

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:17.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
but behold how happy
we look as a couple

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
in this photo!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kuro clearly isn't happy
in this picture...

00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:23.968 position:30% line:89% align:start
He looks bored.

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:25.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's just because he's shy!

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:27.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
That lie won't work
on someone

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:29.367 position:33% line:83% align:start
who dated him
as long as I did.

00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:32.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:36.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
So... How is Kuro, anyway?

00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:38.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's still studying
at the university.

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:41.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since he's not getting
married to you,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
there really isn't a need
for him to rush

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:44.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
to get a job anymore.

00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:48.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
He had always talked about
heading on to graduate school.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our plans for marriage
were included in that.

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:53.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
And yet, the two of you
didn't get married.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
You did run away from
your fiancée, after all.

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:57.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, what could I do?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
The possibility of him
not being human

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:02.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
had never crossed my mind.

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:04.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
[kettle whistling]

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:09.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
It was...all too much.

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:12.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
Of course, you're not wrong
in your appraisal.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kuro seems perfectly human
to the untrained eye,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
but likely cannot
be classified that way.

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:21.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
But, I'm in
a similar situation too.

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:23.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
So that makes us
the perfect match,

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:24.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
don't you think?

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:26.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
Similar, you say?

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:28.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
So what are you?

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:30.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yokai, ayakashi,
and spectres...

00:02:30.534 --> 00:02:34.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
They all look to me
as their Goddess of Wisdom.

00:02:34.334 --> 00:02:37.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
Think of me as a priestess
who mediates their conflicts

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:40.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
and works on solutions
to their problems.

00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:43.300 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:46.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't think a priestess
can be deflowered...

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:57.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
[opening music]

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] More importantly,

00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:20.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase is
the issue at hand.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
Has the police department

00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:24.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
already started
an investigation?

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:26.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
One of our detectives
noticed something strange

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:29.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
going on in the city,
so he's looking into it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
Are there
any damage reports?

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:34.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's only a matter of time
until we see them.

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
That Steel Lady Nanase

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:39.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
was far more violent
than I'd heard about.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
If we don't do anything,
she might commit a murder soon.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes. Have to say
I'm afraid of that too.

00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:48.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
We need to deal with
her threat immediately.

00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:50.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whether it's a yokai
or urban legend,

00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:53.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
has there ever been
an incident serious enough

00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:54.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
to call for police action?

00:04:54.567 --> 00:04:57.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hard to believe that something
so uncertain, so vague

00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:00.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
could actually cause
an incident.

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:03.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
But Steel Lady Nanase
is different.

00:05:03.734 --> 00:05:05.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
A quite astute observation.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
Proper monsters tend
to be rather modest in public,

00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:10.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
and try not to
draw any attention.

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:12.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
But there's nothing proper
about her.

00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:15.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why, the respectable
ghosts and monsters

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:18.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
that have resided in the area
for quite some time

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
have been living in fear and
came to ask me for my help,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
even if it meant traveling
hundreds of kilometers.

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:28.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:30.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
By the way...

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:32.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why didn't Kuro make
the trip with you?

00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:33.167 position:41% line:89% align:start
[choke]

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
Since the yokai
are afraid of him,

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:36.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
he'd be pretty
useful right now.

00:05:36.868 --> 00:05:38.601 position:33% line:83% align:start
And besides,
he's not the type of person

00:05:38.634 --> 00:05:43.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
to let someone he cares about
go yokai-hunting on their own.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'd planned to finish quickly
and head straight home,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
so I didn't see
the need to invite him.

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:49.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
But the way you are,

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:50.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'd invite him like
it was a vacation.

00:05:50.968 --> 00:05:53.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yes, well, that's because...

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:55.834 position:33% line:83% align:start
he contracted
a highly infectious disease...

00:05:55.868 --> 00:05:57.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why'd you look away
when you said that?

00:05:57.934 --> 00:05:59.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
May I have some more coffee?

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:01.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
Answer me first!

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gulp]

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, okay, the truth is...

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:08.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
Kuro disappeared last week,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
and I can't get
a hold of him.

00:06:09.534 --> 00:06:12.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
He hasn't replied to
the voicemails I left him.

00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:16.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
Here. This was the last message
he sent me.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
"Something came up.
Don't look for me."

00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:20.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, seriously...
Kuro does not like you.

00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:22.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
Like I said,

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:25.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
Kuro just isn't very good at
expressing his feelings...

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
I told you lies like that
wouldn't work with me.

00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:32.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
[heartbroken cry]

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm the only one fit to be
with that big idiot!

00:06:34.968 --> 00:06:37.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why is he acting like this?!

00:06:37.767 --> 00:06:39.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
Back when Kuro and I
were dating,

00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:40.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
he never even once

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
ignored any of my phone calls
or text messages.

00:06:44.868 --> 00:06:46.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
He was always...

00:06:46.534 --> 00:06:50.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
right there by my side,
whenever I needed him to be.

00:06:50.734 --> 00:06:51.968 position:41% line:89% align:start
[angry]

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
You have some nerve bragging
when all it took

00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:56.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
was a little kappa
to scare you off!

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:57.701 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wha--?

00:06:57.734 --> 00:06:59.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm just worried about Kuro

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:01.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
because you're clearly
some kind of stalker!

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:02.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no reason
for a woman

00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:05.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
who severed all ties to Kuro
to be worried about him!

00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:06.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:07:06.534 --> 00:07:08.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
This has nothing to do
with me now.

00:07:08.534 --> 00:07:12.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
But it's unlike him to go
a week without contacting you?

00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:13.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
Definitely weird.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:14.567 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well, yeah.

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:16.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
Still though,

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:18.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's not like I don't
have any leads at all...

00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:21.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
Besides he won't actually die
even if you kill him.

00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:23.968 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:40.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>Jumping from one hotel</i>

00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:42.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>staying one step ahead</i>

00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:44.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>In late January,</i>

00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:46.367 position:24% line:83% align:start

 <i>in Makurazaka City...</i>

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>with no idea that</i>
 <i>she'd die a few days later</i>

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>not far from her hotel.</i>

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:08.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Saki] Detective Terada?

00:14:08.334 --> 00:14:09.367 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do you think
it's completely unfathomable

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:13.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
that Steel Lady Nanase
could actually be a ghost?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
And here we go again...

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
After taking a look
at Nanase's history,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
it could make sense for her
to reappear as a ghost.

00:14:20.267 --> 00:14:22.801 position:7% line:83% align:start
Suspicions that she was behind
her father's death

00:14:22.834 --> 00:14:24.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
were never cleared up,

00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:25.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
and those who spread
the rumors

00:14:25.767 --> 00:14:27.234 position:7% line:89% align:start
refused to take responsibility.

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:29.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure Karin Nanase was
doing whatever she could

00:14:29.934 --> 00:14:31.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
to get her name out there.

00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:32.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
I think I get it,

00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:34.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
how she'd come back
as a vengeful spirit,

00:14:34.868 --> 00:14:37.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
just to attack society
as a whole.

00:14:37.133 --> 00:14:38.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think I can believe
that much.

00:14:38.601 --> 00:14:39.801 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course,

00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:42.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
I realize the existence
of ghosts seems far-fetched.

00:14:42.968 --> 00:14:44.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't deny they exist.

00:14:44.734 --> 00:14:45.868 position:19% line:89% align:start
Things like spirits...

00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:47.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
I believe in them enough
to go visit

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
my relative's gravesites
at least once a year.

00:14:50.067 --> 00:14:52.467 position:38% line:83% align:start
But her?
Something's just different.

00:14:53.701 --> 00:14:55.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
Like she's...

00:14:55.601 --> 00:14:57.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
She seems artificial.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.834 position:33% line:83% align:start
People saying
she's wearing a mini-skirt

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:02.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
or is missing part of her face,

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:04.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
or swinging a steel beam...

00:15:04.868 --> 00:15:07.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
That all just sounds
like stuff

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
the society that drove
Karin Nanase to an early death

00:15:10.234 --> 00:15:12.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
would be excited to hear about.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
If she truly came back
to become a vengeful spirit,

00:15:16.534 --> 00:15:19.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
it seems strange that
she'd be dressed that way.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
That means, there must
be something else,

00:15:21.534 --> 00:15:25.901 position:7% line:83% align:start
something hiding in the shadows
other than an idol's will.

00:15:25.934 --> 00:15:27.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>He's right.</i>

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.801 position:10% line:83% align:start

 <i>logically, she probably</i>

00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:34.968 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.567 position:19% line:83% align:start

 <i>is a vengeful spirit,</i>

00:15:37.601 --> 00:15:40.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>but sadly, at this point,</i>
 <i>it's nearly impossible</i>

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.667 position:33% line:83% align:start

That's not all...

00:15:44.067 --> 00:15:47.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
The possibility does exist
that her accidental death

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
may have actually
been a murder and

00:15:48.834 --> 00:15:50.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
that's what caused

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:52.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Steel Lady Nanase

00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:55.000 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah! Right. Yes, of course.

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:56.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
The investigation files...

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you'd look through them
for me,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
and just explain the important
parts to me later.

00:16:00.868 --> 00:16:02.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
That would
be extremely helpful.

00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:03.133 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.968 position:19% line:83% align:start

00:16:52.801 --> 00:16:54.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
This illustration looks
exactly like

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
what I encountered yesterday.

00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:58.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
Between all the eyewitnesses,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.100 position:13% line:83% align:start

Karin Nanase looked like,

00:17:01.133 --> 00:17:03.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure something similar
could be drawn,

00:17:03.334 --> 00:17:07.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
but is it possible to
draw something this accurate?

00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:09.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
This illustration looks
like it was done

00:17:09.033 --> 00:17:12.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
by someone who saw
Steel Lady Nanase personally.

[gasp]

It's actually the opposite.

00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:18.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
If that's true,

00:17:18.734 --> 00:17:21.934 position:21% line:83% align:start

All the information

00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:28.701 position:24% line:89% align:start

00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:30.300 position:13% line:89% align:start

Oh...

00:20:58.634 --> 00:21:00.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
But my lady told me

00:21:00.033 --> 00:21:02.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
that you had rather
violent and brutal tendencies.

00:21:02.167 --> 00:21:04.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
And that I should be careful,

Okay. So, what does
she want with me?

00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:12.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's in regards

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:14.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
to the Steel Lady
Nanase situation.

00:21:14.367 --> 00:21:17.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
She wanted to humbly
request your assistance

00:21:17.434 --> 00:21:18.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
in the matter.

00:21:18.467 --> 00:21:19.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
She needs my help?

00:21:19.634 --> 00:21:21.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Gen'ichiro] If you cannot
offer any assistance,

00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:23.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
then from now on,

00:21:23.133 --> 00:21:25.968 position:19% line:83% align:start

00:21:31.634 --> 00:21:32.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
just as I have tonight.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
How many of you are there?

00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:36.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is basically
just bullying me!

00:21:36.868 --> 00:21:38.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, according to my lady,

00:21:38.701 --> 00:21:41.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
she wants to learn everything
there is to know

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
about the life
and especially,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.767 position:33% line:83% align:start
the death of
the human entertainer

known as Karin Nanase,

00:21:46.567 --> 00:21:47.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
So she can figure out

00:21:47.734 --> 00:21:49.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
how to defeat
Steel Lady Nanase.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.434 position:35% line:83% align:start
As for why
she wanted to know,

00:21:51.467 --> 00:21:54.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
she'd like to meet with you
and tell you herself.

Where at?

please tell her to either
wait for my return here

or go to where
Steel Lady Nanase has appeared.

Plus, I'm sure
she wouldn't mind

00:22:50.334 --> 00:22:52.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you touched her butt
or squished a boob or two.

All right!
