00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.601 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] Wow...

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:18.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
Talk about
a lack of personality...

00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:22.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Saki] So... How old are you?

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:24.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
I just turned nineteen.

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:27.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
And at present, I'm going
to the same university

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
that you and Kuro
both attended.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:31.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
I met you once
a long time ago

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:33.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
when you were at
the university hospital.

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:35.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
The university hospital?

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:38.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess I can't blame you
for not remembering.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
It was over four years ago.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
What you said earlier
was a lie, right?

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:47.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
That you're Kuro's girlfriend.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mean, you're not
Kuro's type in the slightest.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:55.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since someone who was
his type dumped him so cruelly,

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:58.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
it makes sense he might
seek out the complete opposite.

00:00:58.701 --> 00:00:59.901 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:00.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
I heard that Kuro's cousin in
the hospital had passed away,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
so maybe he talked to
this girl in desperation,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
and now, he just
can't get rid of her...

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
[angry grunt]

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
You think
you really know it all,

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:17.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
but behold how happy
we look as a couple

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
in this photo!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kuro clearly isn't happy
in this picture...

00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:23.968 position:30% line:89% align:start
He looks bored.

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:25.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's just because he's shy!

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:27.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
That lie won't work
on someone

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:29.367 position:33% line:83% align:start
who dated him
as long as I did.

00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:32.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:36.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
So... How is Kuro, anyway?

00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:38.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's still studying
at the university.

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:41.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since he's not getting
married to you,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
there really isn't a need
for him to rush

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:44.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
to get a job anymore.

00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:48.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
He had always talked about
heading on to graduate school.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our plans for marriage
were included in that.

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:53.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
And yet, the two of you
didn't get married.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
You did run away from
your fiancÃ©e, after all.

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:57.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, what could I do?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
The possibility of him
not being human

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:02.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
had never crossed my mind.

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:04.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
[kettle whistling]

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:09.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
It was...all too much.

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:12.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
Of course, you're not wrong
in your appraisal.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kuro seems perfectly human
to the untrained eye,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
but likely cannot
be classified that way.

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:21.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
But, I'm in
a similar situation too.

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:23.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
So that makes us
the perfect match,

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:24.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
don't you think?

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:26.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
Similar, you say?

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:28.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
So what are you?

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:30.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yokai, ayakashi,
and spectres...

00:02:30.534 --> 00:02:34.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
They all look to me
as their Goddess of Wisdom.

00:02:34.334 --> 00:02:37.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
Think of me as a priestess
who mediates their conflicts

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:40.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
and works on solutions
to their problems.

00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:43.300 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:46.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't think a priestess
can be deflowered...

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:57.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
[opening music]

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] More importantly,

00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:20.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase is
the issue at hand.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
Has the police department

00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:24.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
already started
an investigation?

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:26.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
One of our detectives
noticed something strange

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:29.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
going on in the city,
so he's looking into it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
Are there
any damage reports?

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:34.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's only a matter of time
until we see them.

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
That Steel Lady Nanase

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:39.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
was far more violent
than I'd heard about.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
If we don't do anything,
she might commit a murder soon.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes. Have to say
I'm afraid of that too.

00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:48.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
We need to deal with
her threat immediately.

00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:50.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whether it's a yokai
or urban legend,

00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:53.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
has there ever been
an incident serious enough

00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:54.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
to call for police action?

00:04:54.567 --> 00:04:57.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hard to believe that something
so uncertain, so vague

00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:00.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
could actually cause
an incident.

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:03.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
But Steel Lady Nanase
is different.

00:05:03.734 --> 00:05:05.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
A quite astute observation.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
Proper monsters tend
to be rather modest in public,

00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:10.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
and try not to
draw any attention.

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:12.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
But there's nothing proper
about her.

00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:15.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why, the respectable
ghosts and monsters

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:18.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
that have resided in the area
for quite some time

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
have been living in fear and
came to ask me for my help,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
even if it meant traveling
hundreds of kilometers.

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:28.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:30.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
By the way...

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:32.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why didn't Kuro make
the trip with you?

00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:33.167 position:41% line:89% align:start
[choke]

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
Since the yokai
are afraid of him,

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:36.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
he'd be pretty
useful right now.

00:05:36.868 --> 00:05:38.601 position:33% line:83% align:start
And besides,
he's not the type of person

00:05:38.634 --> 00:05:43.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
to let someone he cares about
go yokai-hunting on their own.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'd planned to finish quickly
and head straight home,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
so I didn't see
the need to invite him.

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:49.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
But the way you are,

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:50.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'd invite him like
it was a vacation.

00:05:50.968 --> 00:05:53.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yes, well, that's because...

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:55.834 position:33% line:83% align:start
he contracted
a highly infectious disease...

00:05:55.868 --> 00:05:57.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why'd you look away
when you said that?

00:05:57.934 --> 00:05:59.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
May I have some more coffee?

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:01.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
Answer me first!

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gulp]

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, okay, the truth is...

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:08.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
Kuro disappeared last week,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
and I can't get
a hold of him.

00:06:09.534 --> 00:06:12.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
He hasn't replied to
the voicemails I left him.

00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:16.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
Here. This was the last message
he sent me.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
"Something came up.
Don't look for me."

00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:20.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, seriously...
Kuro does not like you.

00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:22.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
Like I said,

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:25.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
Kuro just isn't very good at
expressing his feelings...

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
I told you lies like that
wouldn't work with me.

00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:32.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
[heartbroken cry]

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm the only one fit to be
with that big idiot!

00:06:34.968 --> 00:06:37.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why is he acting like this?!

00:06:37.767 --> 00:06:39.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
Back when Kuro and I
were dating,

00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:40.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
he never even once

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
ignored any of my phone calls
or text messages.

00:06:44.868 --> 00:06:46.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
He was always...

00:06:46.534 --> 00:06:50.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
right there by my side,
whenever I needed him to be.

00:06:50.734 --> 00:06:51.968 position:41% line:89% align:start
[angry]

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
You have some nerve bragging
when all it took

00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:56.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
was a little kappa
to scare you off!

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:57.701 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wha--?

00:06:57.734 --> 00:06:59.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm just worried about Kuro

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:01.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
because you're clearly
some kind of stalker!

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:02.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no reason
for a woman

00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:05.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
who severed all ties to Kuro
to be worried about him!

00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:06.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:07:06.534 --> 00:07:08.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
This has nothing to do
with me now.

00:07:08.534 --> 00:07:12.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
But it's unlike him to go
a week without contacting you?

00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:13.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
Definitely weird.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:14.567 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:15.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well, yeah.

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:16.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
Still though,

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:18.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's not like I don't
have any leads at all...

00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:21.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
Besides he won't actually die
even if you kill him.

00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:23.968 position:16% line:83% align:start

[Saki] <i>And so, Karin Nanase</i>

00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:40.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>Jumping from one hotel</i>
 <i>to another,</i>

00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:42.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>staying one step ahead</i>
 <i>of the paparazzi,</i>

00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:44.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>In late January,</i>

00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:46.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>she found herself</i>
 <i>in Makurazaka City...</i>

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>with no idea that</i>
 <i>she'd die a few days later</i>

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>not far from her hotel.</i>

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:08.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Saki] Detective Terada?

00:14:08.334 --> 00:14:09.367 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do you think
it's completely unfathomable

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:13.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
that Steel Lady Nanase
could actually be a ghost?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
And here we go again...

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
After taking a look
at Nanase's history,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
it could make sense for her
to reappear as a ghost.

00:14:20.267 --> 00:14:22.801 position:7% line:83% align:start
Suspicions that she was behind
her father's death

00:14:22.834 --> 00:14:24.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
were never cleared up,

00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:25.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
and those who spread
the rumors

00:14:25.767 --> 00:14:27.234 position:7% line:89% align:start
refused to take responsibility.

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:29.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure Karin Nanase was
doing whatever she could

00:14:29.934 --> 00:14:31.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
to get her name out there.

00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:32.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
I think I get it,

00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:34.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
how she'd come back
as a vengeful spirit,

00:14:34.868 --> 00:14:37.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
just to attack society
as a whole.

00:14:37.133 --> 00:14:38.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think I can believe
that much.

00:14:38.601 --> 00:14:39.801 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course,

00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:42.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
I realize the existence
of ghosts seems far-fetched.

00:14:42.968 --> 00:14:44.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't deny they exist.

00:14:44.734 --> 00:14:45.868 position:19% line:89% align:start
Things like spirits...

00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:47.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
I believe in them enough
to go visit

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
my relative's gravesites
at least once a year.

00:14:50.067 --> 00:14:52.467 position:38% line:83% align:start
But her?
Something's just different.

00:14:53.701 --> 00:14:55.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
Like she's...

00:14:55.601 --> 00:14:57.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
She seems artificial.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.834 position:33% line:83% align:start
People saying
she's wearing a mini-skirt

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:02.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
or is missing part of her face,

00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:04.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
or swinging a steel beam...

00:15:04.868 --> 00:15:07.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
That all just sounds
like stuff

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
the society that drove
Karin Nanase to an early death

00:15:10.234 --> 00:15:12.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
would be excited to hear about.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
If she truly came back
to become a vengeful spirit,

00:15:16.534 --> 00:15:19.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
it seems strange that
she'd be dressed that way.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
That means, there must
be something else,

00:15:21.534 --> 00:15:25.901 position:7% line:83% align:start
something hiding in the shadows
other than an idol's will.

00:15:25.934 --> 00:15:27.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>He's right.</i>

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>If the Steel Lady's supposed</i>
 <i>to be a vengeful spirit,</i>

 <i>logically, she probably</i>

00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:34.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
wouldn't be pandering

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>But Steel Lady Nanase</i>
 <i>is a vengeful spirit,</i>

00:15:37.601 --> 00:15:40.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>but sadly, at this point,</i>
 <i>it's nearly impossible</i>

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.667 position:33% line:83% align:start

That's not all...

00:15:44.067 --> 00:15:47.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
The possibility does exist
that her accidental death

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
may have actually
been a murder and

00:15:48.834 --> 00:15:50.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
that's what caused

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:52.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Steel Lady Nanase
incidents to begin.

00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:55.000 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah! Right. Yes, of course.

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:56.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
The investigation files...

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you'd look through them
for me,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
and just explain the important
parts to me later.

00:16:00.868 --> 00:16:02.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
That would
be extremely helpful.

00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:03.133 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.968 position:19% line:83% align:start

This illustration looks
exactly like

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
what I encountered yesterday.

00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:58.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
Between all the eyewitnesses,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.100 position:13% line:83% align:start

Karin Nanase looked like,

00:17:01.133 --> 00:17:03.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure something similar
could be drawn,

00:17:03.334 --> 00:17:07.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
but is it possible to
draw something this accurate?

00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:09.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
This illustration looks
like it was done

00:17:09.033 --> 00:17:12.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
by someone who saw
Steel Lady Nanase personally.

[gasp]

Except...
It's actually the opposite.

00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:18.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
If that's true,

00:17:18.734 --> 00:17:21.934 position:21% line:83% align:start

All the information

00:17:26.868 --> 00:17:28.701 position:24% line:89% align:start

00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:30.300 position:13% line:89% align:start

But my lady told me

that you had rather
violent and brutal tendencies.

And that I should be careful,

Okay. So, what does
she want with me?

00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:12.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's in regards

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:14.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
to the Steel Lady
Nanase situation.

00:21:14.367 --> 00:21:17.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
She wanted to humbly
request your assistance

00:21:17.434 --> 00:21:18.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
in the matter.

00:21:18.467 --> 00:21:19.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
She needs my help?

00:21:19.634 --> 00:21:21.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Gen'ichiro] If you cannot
offer any assistance,

then from now on,

How many of you are there?

00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:36.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is basically
just bullying me!

00:21:36.868 --> 00:21:38.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, according to my lady,

00:21:38.701 --> 00:21:41.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
she wants to learn everything
there is to know

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
about the life
and especially,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.767 position:33% line:83% align:start
the death of

known as Karin Nanase,

00:21:46.567 --> 00:21:47.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
So she can figure out

00:21:47.734 --> 00:21:49.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
how to defeat
Steel Lady Nanase.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.434 position:35% line:83% align:start
As for why
she wanted to know,

00:21:51.467 --> 00:21:54.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
she'd like to meet with you

please tell her to either
wait for my return here

or go to where

she wouldn't mind

00:22:50.334 --> 00:22:52.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you touched her butt
