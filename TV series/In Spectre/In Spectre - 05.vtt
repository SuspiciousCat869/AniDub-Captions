00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.968 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Saki] Hey, you!

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
What the hell is
the big idea?!

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:55.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
Your monster summons me,

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then, you just bail
on our meeting?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not to mention that
pervy ghost you left behind!

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:00.434 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:01.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>Why couldn't you have</i>
 <i>just waited</i>

 <i>at the restaurant?</i>

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
Say something--! [gasp]

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hurry, we have to save him!

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let things play out.
He will be fine.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
For what it's worth,
I'm sure he's even prepared

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
to have his head smashed in
at least once.

00:01:16.634 --> 00:01:17.434 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:20.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Kuro grunts]

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:27.000 position:38% line:89% align:start
K...Kuro!

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:40.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
[opening music]

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:03.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
But why is Kuro here?

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:04.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
Get too close,

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:05.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
and you might get caught
in the middle.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's just watch
for a bit.

00:03:08.868 --> 00:03:10.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:12.100 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:15.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
But it looks like he could
go down at any moment.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's tripping over
his own feet!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but it doesn't seem
like Steel Lady Nanase's

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.033 position:7% line:89% align:start
that much stronger than he is.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
It should be simple.

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:24.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
Especially if Kuro's willing
to take

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:26.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
a steel beam to the face.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
Even if he's close to death,

00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:32.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
he'll be able to get
right back up in no time at all,

00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:34.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
due to the immortality
he gained

00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:36.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
by eating mermaid flesh.

00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:41.067 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:48.067 position:41% line:89% align:start
[shock]

00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:49.601 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:55.534 position:41% line:89% align:start
[wham]

00:04:05.868 --> 00:04:06.834 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:07.734 position:38% line:89% align:start
[whimper]

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:09.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is this the first time
you've seen Kuro die?

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:13.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
Of course it is.

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:16.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
Really? Then why'd you
break up with him?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
I saw a cut on his hand
heal up immediately.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
I watched his severed fingers
grow back.

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:23.767 position:21% line:89% align:start
And when it happened,

00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:26.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
he acted like there was nothing
strange about it at all.

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:30.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, that's to be expected
with an immortal.

00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:32.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>A man in perfect health.</i>

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>Couldn't she just accept</i>

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>what a great husband</i>
 <i>he'd have made?</i>

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>That she'd never have</i>
 <i>to worry about him</i>

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:37.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>being injured or sick?</i>

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:39.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
 <i>No.</i>

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:42.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>The way she's acting now,</i>
 <i>I guess not.</i>

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Saki] Is it so strange to
suddenly feel scared

00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:46.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
at the thought of
becoming family

00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:48.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
with someone like that?

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
Am I not allowed to
reconsider that marriage?

00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:53.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
Dozens of his relatives
have died

00:04:53.367 --> 00:04:57.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
of strange illnesses
or unusual causes.

00:04:57.234 --> 00:05:00.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kuro's the only one of them
who's living a decent life.

00:05:07.701 --> 00:05:08.834 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] Oh.

00:05:08.868 --> 00:05:11.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
Looks like Kuro's back
in action.

00:05:11.868 --> 00:05:14.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
[tense music]

00:05:26.734 --> 00:05:28.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:31.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
If he gets that close,
she'll kill him again!

00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:43.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
[beam falling]

00:05:43.701 --> 00:05:45.067 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:49.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>He stopped just out of</i>
 <i>range of the steel beam's arc.</i>

00:05:51.033 --> 00:05:53.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kuro and Steel Lady Nanase
look like

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
they're following
a choreographed routine.

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:57.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
Everything seems calculated.

00:05:57.734 --> 00:06:00.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't believe that
he grabbed her so easily...

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:03.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, Steel Lady Nanase
is just wildly swinging

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
the steel beam
without thinking.

00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:06.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
The possibility of something
like this happening

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
is actually rather high.

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:11.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
And if the odds are good enough
that something will happen,

00:06:11.234 --> 00:06:13.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
it's not at all difficult
for Kuro

00:06:13.734 --> 00:06:15.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
to set that future in stone.

00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:19.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's another one of
Kuro's capabilities.

00:06:19.868 --> 00:06:21.801 position:33% line:83% align:start
The powers of
the prophet beast,

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:23.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Kudan, whose flesh
he ate as well.

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:26.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
The power to determine
the future.

00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:29.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>He said he'd never gotten</i>
 <i>the chance</i>

00:06:29.868 --> 00:06:31.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>to tell Saki everything...</i>

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>about the secrets of</i>
 <i>the Sakuragawas.</i>

00:06:37.267 --> 00:06:39.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] It all started about
ten generations

00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
before Kuro was born,

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
with the head of
the Sakuragawa family

00:06:42.868 --> 00:06:44.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
at that time.

00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:46.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
[head of the Sakuragawa]
If your liver is faulty,

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:47.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
consume the liver

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
of a creature with
a powerful one.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
If your eyes give out,
devour the eyes

00:06:51.868 --> 00:06:53.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
of a creature with
great vision.

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:54.968 position:27% line:89% align:start
Then it follows,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
if you ate the flesh
of a kudan,

00:06:56.868 --> 00:06:59.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
you could acquire
its prophetic powers!

00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:01.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I could look unhindered
into the future,

00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:05.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
I could gain an unlimited
amount of wealth!

00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:07.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] The kudan.

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:11.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
A yokai with the head of
a human,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.868 position:19% line:89% align:start
and the body of a cow.

00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:14.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
It can speak the language
of men,

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:17.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
and once it predicts
the future, it dies.

00:07:17.701 --> 00:07:20.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
Occasionally, it would predict
good futures,

00:07:20.234 --> 00:07:22.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
such as a good harvest
or a windfall.

00:07:22.534 --> 00:07:25.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
But most of its predictions
would be misfortunes,

00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:27.267 position:7% line:89% align:start
and they were always accurate.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
He got his hands on
kudan meat and

00:07:29.234 --> 00:07:31.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
fed it to several
in his household.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
Some died instantly after

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:35.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
having a bad reaction
to the meat.

00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:37.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
Some died after being
bedridden for a month.

00:07:37.534 --> 00:07:41.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
And others died after
they predicted the future.

00:07:41.367 --> 00:07:43.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
They say those predictions
turned out

00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:44.434 position:19% line:89% align:start
to be totally accurate.

00:07:45.534 --> 00:07:48.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
The head of the clan
continued his experiment.

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:50.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
But even those
who obtained

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
the yokai's ability
to see the future,

00:07:52.467 --> 00:07:53.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
died immediately...

00:07:54.734 --> 00:07:56.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just like the kudan.

00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:01.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Sakuragawa head]
I'm so close...

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm so close, and yet now..

00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:08.167 position:38% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
And then he realized...

00:08:16.968 --> 00:08:19.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those with the ability
to predict the future

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
simply needed to
have immortal bodies.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's when he started
having those of his line

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
consume mermaid flesh,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
along with the meat
from the kudan.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yet still, the number
of victims skyrocketed...

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the experiment
he sacrificed so much for

00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:36.133 position:33% line:89% align:start
never worked.

00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:39.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
Time passed by,

00:08:39.133 --> 00:08:44.200 position:5% line:83% align:start
and such nightmarish experiments
were eventually forgotten.

00:08:44.234 --> 00:08:45.434 position:38% line:89% align:start
Until...

00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:46.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Grandma] Kuro.

00:08:48.734 --> 00:08:50.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
Grandmother.

00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:52.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your dinner is waiting
for you.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:55.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
-We are grateful!
-We are grateful!

00:09:05.734 --> 00:09:07.167 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:08.634 position:38% line:89% align:start
Brother?!

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:09.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:09:09.567 --> 00:09:10.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?!

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:12.000 position:38% line:89% align:start
[choking]

00:09:17.834 --> 00:09:19.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
Grandmother, the others,
they're...

00:09:19.467 --> 00:09:20.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
They're all...

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
They...!

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:27.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think the food
has made them sick!

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes. And you, Kuro?

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
You feel completely fine,
do you, my dear?

00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:35.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
Any fever? Or nausea?

00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:37.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, I'm fine...

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.934 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's come true!
At long last!

00:09:40.968 --> 00:09:42.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] His grandmother
was still

00:09:42.734 --> 00:09:44.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
chasing her ancestor's dream.

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:45.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
She had been secretly

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
gathering kudan meat
and mermaid flesh.

00:09:48.634 --> 00:09:49.767 position:33% line:89% align:start
Grandmother.

00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:51.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
All the others are
really suffering.

00:09:51.868 --> 00:09:53.300 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please help!

00:09:53.334 --> 00:09:54.701 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's see...

00:09:54.734 --> 00:09:55.901 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'd love to know

00:09:55.934 --> 00:09:57.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
what the weather will
be like tomorrow.

00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:59.067 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
You should be able to
tell me that much, Kuro.

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:04.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
I need you to die once,
and go see...

00:10:04.434 --> 00:10:05.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
the future!

00:10:06.834 --> 00:10:08.234 position:41% line:89% align:start
[stab]

00:10:09.467 --> 00:10:10.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] And then,

00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:12.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
his grandmother,
in her madness,

00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:13.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
tried various experiments.

00:10:13.868 --> 00:10:15.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
Testing if he was immortal,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
and if he could predict
the future,

00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:18.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
she cut up his body,

00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:20.367 position:33% line:83% align:start
and mortally
wounded him frequently,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
until he very nearly stopped
feeling pain almost altogether.

00:10:24.767 --> 00:10:26.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Rilla] Kuro...
-Huh?

00:10:30.067 --> 00:10:31.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Rikka] There are
a lot of fireflies

00:10:31.868 --> 00:10:33.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
by the river out back.

00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:35.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wanna come watch them
with me?

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:36.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] Sure.

00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:40.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, come along.

00:10:44.634 --> 00:10:46.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong?

00:10:46.267 --> 00:10:49.167 position:41% line:83% align:start
Nuh-uh.
It's nothing at all.

00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:52.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] The dream of
the Sakuragawas

00:10:52.033 --> 00:10:53.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
had finally come true.

00:10:53.434 --> 00:10:56.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
But the abilities obtained
were slightly different

00:10:56.033 --> 00:10:58.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
from what they had hoped for.

00:11:00.067 --> 00:11:02.567 position:38% line:83% align:start
And while
he's technically human,

00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:04.501 position:10% line:89% align:start
he became something inhuman.

00:11:06.868 --> 00:11:08.234 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:11:14.767 --> 00:11:17.234 position:33% line:89% align:start

00:11:20.868 --> 00:11:23.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
[tense music]

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:43.267 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ah, Kuro...

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
The way he does something
like that with no hesitation

00:11:45.801 --> 00:11:47.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
is one of his charms!

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not looking for
a boyfriend who

00:11:49.567 --> 00:11:51.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
can snap a ghost's neck.

00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:53.267 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>Now, this is</i>
 <i>the real question.</i>

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>Will this actually be</i>
 <i>the end of Steel Lady Nanase?</i>

00:11:57.868 --> 00:11:58.567 position:35% line:89% align:start

Why am I not surprised?

00:12:10.734 --> 00:12:14.367 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:12:20.701 --> 00:12:21.734 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:21.767 --> 00:12:23.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
All right, Kuro,
that's enough.

00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:27.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're going to need
a new strategy

00:12:27.634 --> 00:12:29.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
to defeat Steel Lady Nanase.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
Saki.

00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:57.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
What are you doing here,
of all places?

00:12:57.133 --> 00:13:00.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
I work as a police officer
for the city.

00:13:00.033 --> 00:13:02.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
And what brings
you here, Kuro?

00:13:02.601 --> 00:13:04.100 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, well...

00:13:05.434 --> 00:13:06.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
Obviously,

00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:08.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
if your darling girlfriend
asks you to show up,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
you'll show up,
even if it means

00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:12.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
fighting a monster, right?

00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:13.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:13:14.834 --> 00:13:16.100 position:21% line:89% align:start
Something like that.

00:13:16.133 --> 00:13:18.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
Though I had no idea
you'd be here, Saki.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
Running into you is
a surprise for me as well.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.734 position:35% line:83% align:start
I, for one,
had no intention of

00:13:23.767 --> 00:13:25.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
letting you see each other.

00:13:25.868 --> 00:13:26.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
You mean to tell me

00:13:26.968 --> 00:13:28.400 position:30% line:83% align:start
she actually is
your girlfriend?

00:13:28.434 --> 00:13:31.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yes... This weirdo really
is my girlfriend...

00:13:31.868 --> 00:13:33.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, Kuro!

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why do you sound like
you hate it?!

00:13:34.868 --> 00:13:37.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because you're frustrating
as hell.

00:13:37.434 --> 00:13:38.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Saki.

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:41.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure Iwanaga
caused you some trouble.

00:13:42.534 --> 00:13:43.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
FYI, Kuro!

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:45.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
I actually saved Saki,
I will have you know!

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.767 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't deserve
this kind of treatment--

00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:49.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just say you're sorry.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
There is no way you didn't
cause any trouble.

00:13:52.334 --> 00:13:52.968 position:44% line:89% align:start
Grrr!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's all right.

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:57.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure we both caused
each other a little trouble.

00:13:57.133 --> 00:13:59.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Saki] What we should be
worried about right now

00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:00.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
is Steel Lady Nanase.

00:14:01.534 --> 00:14:05.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
So anyway, it's good
to see you, Kuro.

00:14:06.133 --> 00:14:08.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah. It's good to
see you, too...

00:14:08.868 --> 00:14:10.200 position:44% line:89% align:start

Let's get out of here now.

Lingering in the light
of a vending machine

00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:19.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
for too long is depressing.

 <i>we could've talked about this</i>

 <i>at the restaurant.</i>

 <i>home alone, but still...</i>

00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:42.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
Kuro? Are you staring

00:14:42.167 --> 00:14:43.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
at your ex-girlfriend
from behind,

00:14:43.868 --> 00:14:46.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
while your current girlfriend
is sitting right next to you?

00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:47.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're delusional.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
Nuh-uh, I saw you!

eating right.

I wonder if she looks
like skin and bones now

because of me?

00:14:56.133 --> 00:14:59.033 position:24% line:83% align:start

really nice, though."

I can tell that's what
you were thinking.

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:02.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
Quite impressive.

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's exactly what I was...

00:15:03.701 --> 00:15:04.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Kuro] just thinking.
-Oh!

00:15:04.601 --> 00:15:05.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
Saki is beautiful.

00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:08.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
You jerk! How dare you admit
that so quickly?!

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
And how dare you take
that kind of attitude

00:15:10.234 --> 00:15:11.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
after leaving your poor
girlfriend alone

00:15:11.834 --> 00:15:13.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
for an entire week?!

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why didn't you reply to
any of the messages I sent you?

00:15:16.601 --> 00:15:17.868 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, those were from you?

00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:20.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought they were
all spam messages.

00:15:20.868 --> 00:15:22.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
At least look at me!

00:15:22.033 --> 00:15:24.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
You two get along great.

00:15:24.534 --> 00:15:25.601 position:27% line:89% align:start
Of course, we do!

00:15:25.634 --> 00:15:26.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just so you know,

00:15:26.734 --> 00:15:28.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
we're usually way
more lovey-dovey!

00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:31.200 position:24% line:89% align:start
Saki, I'm curious.

00:15:31.234 --> 00:15:34.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you still unable
to eat fish or beef?

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've been working on it
and can eat some.

00:15:36.868 --> 00:15:39.901 position:33% line:83% align:start
But my job is
why I lost weight.

00:15:39.934 --> 00:15:41.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:15:41.934 --> 00:15:44.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
No, Kuro,
this isn't your fault.

00:15:44.234 --> 00:15:46.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>We broke up without</i>
 <i>straightening things out.</i>

00:15:46.534 --> 00:15:49.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>I thought I'd be more</i>
 <i>shaken up if I saw him.</i>

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>I wonder if the reason</i>
 <i>I'm staying calm</i>

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:52.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>is because of her.</i>

00:15:56.067 --> 00:15:59.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, so anyway,
back to the matter at hand.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>That said, she's still</i>
 <i>pretty intolerable...</i>

00:16:02.067 --> 00:16:03.367 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, you are right.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
So Kuro, were you really
fighting Steel Lady Nanase

00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:09.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
on direct orders
from Iwanaga?

00:16:09.334 --> 00:16:10.234 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh...

00:16:12.934 --> 00:16:14.834 position:35% line:83% align:start
I did come
to Makurazaka City

00:16:14.868 --> 00:16:16.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
because she asked me to,

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I'd just happened to run
into Steel Lady Nanase.

00:16:18.968 --> 00:16:20.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>When I got to the station</i>

00:16:20.701 --> 00:16:23.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>a goblin cat that had been</i>
 <i>attacked by Steel Lady Nanase</i>

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:27.367 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:16:30.067 --> 00:16:32.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>but after spending</i>
 <i>so much time with Iwanaga,</i>

00:16:32.434 --> 00:16:35.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>they started to see me as</i>

 <i>one-legged lady,</i>

00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:39.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>the yokai sought me out,</i>

00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:42.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>and started asking for</i>
 <i>my help, as well.</i>

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>There was no time to</i>
 <i>contact Iwanaga beforehand,</i>

00:16:45.868 --> 00:16:47.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>so I went to where</i>
 <i>Steel Lady Nanase</i>

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>appeared by myself.</i>

00:16:51.133 --> 00:16:53.000 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, well, that sounds nice.

00:16:53.033 --> 00:16:55.067 position:7% line:83% align:start
Maybe the kappa won't run away
from you

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
next time you see him then.

00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:59.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Them coming to me all
the time isn't much better.

00:16:59.567 --> 00:17:00.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
But that said,

00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:03.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase wasn't afraid
when she saw me.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, to yokai,
Kuro does look like

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
a horrifying evil jumbled mess
of a creature,

00:17:07.634 --> 00:17:11.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
that's an unsightly mix of
a human, mermaid, and kudan

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
to any non-humans unfortunate
enough to look upon him.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
It makes sense
they'd be scared.

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:18.767 position:10% line:83% align:start
Basically, even the monsters
consider him a monster.

00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:19.601 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:20.767 --> 00:17:22.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
So tell me, Iwanaga...

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
if Steel Lady Nanase didn't
react to Kuro that way,

00:17:25.267 --> 00:17:26.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
what does that make her?

00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:28.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
She's a monster.

00:17:28.133 --> 00:17:30.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
I could see that.
I'll rephrase.

00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:32.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is she something
we can defeat?

00:17:32.868 --> 00:17:33.133 position:41% line:89% align:start
She is.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
The reason that I wanted
to meet with you tonight

00:17:36.467 --> 00:17:37.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
was to discuss that.

00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:40.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase is different
from a normal spectre.

00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:43.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
She was created from
the delusions and desires

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
of modern-day humans.

00:17:44.868 --> 00:17:47.400 position:10% line:89% align:start
A monster of the imagination.

00:17:47.434 --> 00:17:48.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>I hadn't planned to</i>
 <i>tell her everything,</i>

00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:50.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>but at this point,</i>

00:17:50.534 --> 00:17:52.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'll tell her as much</i>
 <i>of the truth as I can</i>

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>so she can start to</i>
 <i>comprehend</i>

00:17:53.968 --> 00:17:55.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>how vastly different</i>
 <i>our world is</i>

00:17:55.834 --> 00:17:57.701 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>from the one</i>
 <i>she lives in every day.</i>

00:17:57.734 --> 00:18:00.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'll show her how radically</i>
 <i>different we are</i>

00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:01.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>from what she knows.</i>

00:18:01.534 --> 00:18:02.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>That's the best plan.</i>

00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:07.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
The traditional yokai,
monsters, spectres, mononoke,

00:18:07.767 --> 00:18:09.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
and beasts from urban legend,

00:18:09.734 --> 00:18:11.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
the ones we're familiar with

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
have monsters of
the imagination.

00:18:13.267 --> 00:18:15.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
It may all start off
as something trivial.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.767 position:21% line:89% align:start
Like somebody says...

00:18:17.801 --> 00:18:19.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
A super creepy pale lady
wearing a mask

00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:20.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
came up to me,

00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:22.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
but she was so frightening
I just ran away.

00:18:22.834 --> 00:18:24.634 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's how
the story would start.

00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:26.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
And then, what happened?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
But the story on its own
isn't very interesting, so...

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
Uh, when I took
a closer look,

00:18:32.067 --> 00:18:34.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
I realized her mouth was
split open under the mask.

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:35.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
I got so scared I ran away,

00:18:35.868 --> 00:18:37.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
and she came running
after me

00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:38.100 position:21% line:89% align:start
s fast as she could!

00:18:38.133 --> 00:18:40.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whoa, that's super creepy!

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
And now, a lie has been
added to the story.

00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:45.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
And before long,
that story starts to spread.

00:18:45.267 --> 00:18:47.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
[male voice] A pale woman
wearing a mask...

00:18:47.133 --> 00:18:49.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
[female voice] ...asked,
"Do you think I'm pretty?"

00:18:49.133 --> 00:18:51.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
[male voice] But under
the mask, her mouth was...

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
[female voice] But under
the mask, her mouth was...

00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:57.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] For now, this is all
still just a story.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
It only becomes a problem

00:18:59.734 --> 00:19:01.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
when this fiction
is given a name.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
The slit-mouth woman.

00:19:05.834 --> 00:19:07.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
They give that story
a single name,

00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:09.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
which manages to generally
describe

00:19:09.901 --> 00:19:11.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
what it ends up looking like.

00:19:11.501 --> 00:19:13.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
That weaves together
all the various strands

00:19:13.901 --> 00:19:16.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
of vague rumors
finally solidifying them

00:19:16.601 --> 00:19:18.300 position:21% line:89% align:start
into a uniform image.

00:19:18.334 --> 00:19:19.100 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:19:19.868 --> 00:19:21.734 position:38% line:83% align:start
At first,
it was just make-believe.

00:19:21.767 --> 00:19:24.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
But now, that the fiction
has a name and a shape,

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
it implants itself into
the minds of thousands,

00:19:26.934 --> 00:19:28.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
tens of thousands,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
perhaps even millions
of people's minds,

00:19:30.968 --> 00:19:32.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
which in turn gives it
flesh and blood,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.067 position:30% line:83% align:start
turning it into
something real.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
People's imaginations manage
to create a monster.

00:19:39.234 --> 00:19:41.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you honestly expect
anyone to believe

00:19:41.634 --> 00:19:42.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
this happens every day?

00:19:42.934 --> 00:19:46.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
You ask that after seeing
a kappa and a ghost?

00:19:46.634 --> 00:19:48.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
Under normal circumstances,

00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:51.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
monsters of the imagination
are nothing to be afraid of.

00:19:51.634 --> 00:19:52.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
Their popularity wanes,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
and even if they gain
a form, it's weak.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.734 position:33% line:83% align:start
And usually,
they disappear soon afterward.

00:19:57.767 --> 00:19:59.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
The slit-mouth woman
disappeared,

00:19:59.734 --> 00:20:01.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
as did the human-faced dog.

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:03.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Saki] In that case,
Steel Lady Nanase

00:20:03.834 --> 00:20:05.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
seems rather different

00:20:05.167 --> 00:20:07.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
from the other monsters
of the imagination...

00:20:07.601 --> 00:20:11.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
This monster's been given
the name "Steel Lady Nanase."

00:20:11.767 --> 00:20:13.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
And yet she's so powerful.

00:20:13.767 --> 00:20:14.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] Yes, precisely.

00:20:14.767 --> 00:20:15.968 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
How did this thing manage
to gain a form

00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:20.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
less than a year after
Karin Nanase's death

00:20:20.067 --> 00:20:22.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
and then, become as
powerful as it is?

00:20:22.334 --> 00:20:25.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
There is, in fact,
a way to make that possible.

00:20:25.267 --> 00:20:28.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
Usually, these monster rumors
take time to spread.

00:20:28.267 --> 00:20:30.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
So what can spread
these ideas instantly,

00:20:30.801 --> 00:20:32.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
where countless eyes
can see them?

00:20:32.868 --> 00:20:34.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
Only certain media outlets
even bothered

00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:36.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
reporting the accident.

00:20:36.267 --> 00:20:40.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
Seems like it was only really
popular on the Internet...

00:20:40.334 --> 00:20:41.200 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:20:42.234 --> 00:20:45.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
Right. The culprit
is the Internet.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
[kotoko] The Internet can relay
information

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
all around the world
in an instant,

00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:51.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
and billions of people
have access to it.

00:20:51.934 --> 00:20:53.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
And it's able to gather
and consolidate

00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:57.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
an immeasurable amount of
varying ideas in one place.

00:20:57.601 --> 00:20:58.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
In one place?

00:20:58.601 --> 00:20:59.934 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see,

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
like that Steel Lady Nanase
wiki page I found?

00:21:02.567 --> 00:21:03.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
So you know of it.

00:21:03.534 --> 00:21:05.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
That'll definitely
make this easier.

00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:07.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
That site is
the reason her name

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
and description are
so well defined,

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:12.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
and why it spread at
such an alarming rate.

00:21:12.133 --> 00:21:13.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
And with the illustration
of her

00:21:13.868 --> 00:21:16.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
on the top page of the wiki...

00:21:16.467 --> 00:21:17.934 position:21% line:89% align:start
That gave her a form

00:21:17.968 --> 00:21:20.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
that's difficult to attain
from rumors alone,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
defining her look
in an instant.

00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:25.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
That drawing of her.
You remember?

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:25.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mmhmm.

00:21:26.534 --> 00:21:28.767 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't you think
the Steel Lady on that page

00:21:28.801 --> 00:21:32.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
looked like the one we saw
down to the finest detail?

00:21:32.067 --> 00:21:33.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now that you mention it, yes.

00:21:33.601 --> 00:21:34.767 position:38% line:89% align:start
So what?

00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:37.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do you think it's possible
to illustrate a spectre

00:21:37.667 --> 00:21:39.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
made up entirely of rumors?

00:21:39.501 --> 00:21:42.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
And to do so precisely,
without eyewitnesses?

00:21:42.868 --> 00:21:44.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's quite improbable.

00:21:44.868 --> 00:21:46.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
Thus, the opposite happened.

00:21:46.634 --> 00:21:46.701 position:41% line:89% align:start
How so?

00:21:48.267 --> 00:21:49.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] The image in that
drawing wasn't modeled

00:21:49.868 --> 00:21:51.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
after the ghost.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
But because so many people
saw that illustration,

00:21:53.868 --> 00:21:55.734 position:33% line:83% align:start
they imagined
Steel Lady Nanase

00:21:55.767 --> 00:21:57.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
actually looked like that.

00:21:57.067 --> 00:21:59.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
So it was the form
the spirit took.

00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:02.701 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:04.534 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's backwards.

00:22:04.567 --> 00:22:05.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
The wiki wasn't created

00:22:05.767 --> 00:22:07.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
because there was
an actual ghost.

00:22:07.901 --> 00:22:13.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
Instead, the ghost was born
because the wiki was created.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
You could call this website
the true source of

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Steel Lady Nanase
phenomenon.

00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:28.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
