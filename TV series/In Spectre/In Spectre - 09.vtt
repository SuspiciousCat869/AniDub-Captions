[Kotoko] I will stop at nothing
to win this battle.

The committee to conquer
Steel Lady Nanase

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:22.300 position:24% line:89% align:start

[opening music]

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:03.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
Does Steel Lady Nanase
truly exist?

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:07.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
Or is she a fictional being,
mere rumor who was created

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:10.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
by someone for
a specific reason?

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
Isn't she nothing more
than an urban legend?

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:16.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] Saki.

00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:17.434 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you notice any significant
change with Kuro,

please let me know.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, all right.

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:27.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>That sort of thinking</i>
 <i>is exactly why</i>

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>the killer needed</i>
 <i>Steel Lady Nanase.</i>

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:33.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>In order to murder</i>

 <i>called her</i>
 <i>Steel Lady Nanase.</i>

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:40.367 position:24% line:89% align:start
They made a ghost,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
that has no way of existing
a suspect.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>Now, let's see how many</i>
 <i>will latch on.</i>

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
Detective Terada was
very good at his job.

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:08.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
He always kept an eye
on changes within the city

00:04:08.267 --> 00:04:11.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
he could almost sense when
a crime was going to happen,

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:12.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
and he wanted to take action

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
before the incident
got out of hand.

00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:17.033 position:41% line:83% align:start
He was
an excellent detective.

00:04:17.067 --> 00:04:20.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's what the killer tried
to take advantage of.

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:22.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
A small community on
the Internet was talking about

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
an urban legend
from Makurazaka City.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
By taking advantage
of that legend,

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
they committed real crimes
and attempted

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:33.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
even more, one crime
one right after the other.

00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:35.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
The killer dressed up

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
the way Steel Lady Nanase
had been perceived

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:39.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
and attacked people
night after night.

00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:42.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
They made their steel beam
from either wood or Styrofoam,

00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:45.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
and padded their chest to
help attract attention.

00:04:45.801 --> 00:04:47.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
With black paint on part
of their face,

00:04:47.534 --> 00:04:50.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
it would probably look
smashed in when seen at night.

00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:52.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
Top it off with
a large hair bow.

00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:55.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
Witnesses wouldn't have time
to think it through,

00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:58.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
so they'd just assume her face
had been smashed in.

00:04:58.367 --> 00:05:00.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
But is that even plausible?

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe not a hundred percent.

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:03.934 position:10% line:89% align:start
I mean, it is a lie, ya know.

00:05:03.968 --> 00:05:07.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
It just needs to be
somewhat believable.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
The killer waited
for statements like

00:05:09.167 --> 00:05:11.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
"I was attacked by
Steel Lady Nanase" to spread,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
not just as an online rumor,

00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:15.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
but in real reports taken
to the police.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
But the police didn't initially
take these stories seriously.

00:05:19.334 --> 00:05:21.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sure many victims
had second thoughts

00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:23.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
about filing a report.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
But if incidents like that began
occurring all over the city,

00:05:26.834 --> 00:05:28.167 position:7% line:89% align:start
wouldn't a good detective think

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
something was going on
and take action?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Terada] <i>Someone could be</i>
 <i>acting like a monster</i>

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:36.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>from an urban legend</i>
 <i>as part of a much larger plot.</i>

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>And with the work</i>
 <i>they're putting in,</i>

00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:41.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>it can't be dismissed</i>
 <i>as a mere prank.</i>

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:44.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>They might actually</i>
 <i>be planning some crime.</i>

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] That thought
crossed his mind,

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:48.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
so he began investigating
on his own.

00:05:48.334 --> 00:05:51.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is the exact response
that the killer wanted.

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:54.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
If Detective Terada
started investigating

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase by himself,

00:05:56.167 --> 00:05:59.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
they'd easily be able to
get the detective alone.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thus, the killer was able
to create a time frame

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
where the accomplished
detective would be on his own.

 <i>who don't believe in ghosts.</i>

00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:25.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
The killer, at that point,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
made contact with
the detective.

00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:32.434 position:30% line:89% align:start

but she dropped
her weapon and bow.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:43.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think they left
some footprints behind

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
that you may want

so please come alone.

00:06:48.834 --> 00:06:50.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] That's could be all
it took for Detective Terada

00:06:50.567 --> 00:06:53.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
to rush over to
the call on his own.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.868 position:33% line:83% align:start
And the place
he was summoned to

00:06:55.901 --> 00:06:57.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
ended up being
the scene of the crime,

00:06:57.734 --> 00:06:59.901 position:13% line:89% align:start
the abandoned gas station.

00:06:59.934 --> 00:07:01.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
If he'd been called
like that,

00:07:01.868 --> 00:07:03.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
Detective Terada might've
really gone

00:07:03.868 --> 00:07:05.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
to an abandoned gas station.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] In the time before
Detective Terada showed up,

00:07:08.934 --> 00:07:13.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
the killer rigged a few things
at the abandoned gas station.

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:14.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
First, they suspended

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:16.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
a massive pendulum
from the roof,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
by attaching a rope to
a hook on the edge

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
and secured a weight
at the bottom.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:23.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
The weight had to be
heavy enough

00:07:23.968 --> 00:07:25.234 position:27% line:89% align:start
and dense enough,

00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:27.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
that it could crack
someone's cranium open

00:07:27.067 --> 00:07:28.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
with a single swing.

00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:32.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
The angle of its swing
needed to be precise,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
and calculated for
the Detective's height,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
which the killer had
previously researched.

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:40.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
Once they had all
that finished,

00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:42.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
the killer would keep
the rope extended

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:44.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
take the end of the pendulum
that had the weight on it,

00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:46.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
and set the weight
on the other hook

00:07:46.868 --> 00:07:48.567 position:7% line:89% align:start
set up further along the roof.

00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:52.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
However, this hook was attached
to a mechanism that

00:07:52.501 --> 00:07:56.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
could undo it at any time,
by remote control.

00:07:57.868 --> 00:07:59.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
Once that hook
was disengaged,

00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:03.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
the weight would come flying
down at incredible speed.

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:07.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is an insane amount of work
just to kill one person.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
The killer would have to
get Detective Terada

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
to stand in the spot they
had previously chosen.

00:08:14.801 --> 00:08:16.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
But that wouldn't
be difficult.

00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:18.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
The killer could have held

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:20.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
an item of interest
to Detective Terada.

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:22.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
If they waited with
that in hand

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:23.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
at the abandoned gas station,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
Detective Terada would
undoubtedly stop his car

00:08:26.467 --> 00:08:27.434 position:27% line:89% align:start
near the killer.

00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:29.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
Detective! Here's the bow
that she dropped.

00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:33.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
And those footprints
are just over there.

00:08:33.534 --> 00:08:35.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's a bit dark,
so I'll go on ahead

00:08:35.334 --> 00:08:37.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
and turn on some lights
so that you don't trip.

00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:39.300 position:35% line:83% align:start
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

00:08:39.334 --> 00:08:40.467 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:42.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] And that's probably
all it took to get

00:08:42.267 --> 00:08:45.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
Detective Terada to stand
where the killer wanted him to.

00:08:45.434 --> 00:08:48.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
At that moment, the killer used
the remote control,

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
releasing the hook
that held the weight.

00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:55.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
The weight being held by
the rope would act

00:08:55.467 --> 00:08:56.534 position:30% line:89% align:start
as a pendulum,

00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:59.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
swinging across the dark,
abandoned gas station

00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:01.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
to split his head
with one blow,

00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:04.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
as Detective Terada unknowingly
stood in its path.

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:07.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
There were no residences
near the crime scene,

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
and cars rarely drove by,

00:09:09.133 --> 00:09:12.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
so no one would've noticed
the rigged pendulum above.

00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:15.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Detective wouldn't see
the pendulum set up to kill him

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.267 position:7% line:89% align:start
until it was already too late.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:20.634 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:21.901 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, I see!

00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:24.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now that better
explains the mystery.

00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:27.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is how a strong,
and highly skilled detective,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
could be dispatched so easily
without signs of a struggle.

00:09:31.033 --> 00:09:32.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
There was no way
he could have predicted

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
that he'd be attacked
by a pendulum,

00:09:34.734 --> 00:09:35.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
cracking his head open,

00:09:35.868 --> 00:09:38.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
without a chance
to defend himself.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
After murdering
Detective Terada,

00:09:40.033 --> 00:09:41.901 position:30% line:83% align:start
the killer puts
their setup away.

00:09:41.934 --> 00:09:43.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
They remove any trace
of being there

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:45.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
flee the scene.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
All that's left after that
is to burn

00:09:48.234 --> 00:09:50.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
the costume they used
as Steel Lady Nanase,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
as well as the rigging
for the pendulum.

00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:06.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
The killer researched
the traffic and

00:10:06.734 --> 00:10:10.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
knew that very few cars pass by
during the chosen time period.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
They experimented

00:10:14.868 --> 00:10:17.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
to determine where Terada
should stand.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
They did their research,
likely months in advance,

00:10:19.767 --> 00:10:21.200 position:13% line:89% align:start

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:49.634 position:35% line:83% align:start
Precisely.
The killer's pendulum setup

00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:52.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
was originally designed so that
the weight would strike

00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:54.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
the detective from behind,

00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:56.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
where he wouldn't be able
to see it coming.

00:10:56.267 --> 00:10:59.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's entirely possible
that Detective Terada

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:01.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
could sense that something
was coming toward him.

00:11:01.567 --> 00:11:04.100 position:35% line:83% align:start
The man was
an outstanding detective.

00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:05.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
He might've sensed that

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
the individual was trying
to kill him.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.834 position:33% line:83% align:start
He could have
even heard the hook

00:11:09.868 --> 00:11:12.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
being released by the remote.

00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:17.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why he instinctively
turned in that direction.

00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:19.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
But the weight came speeding
through the darkness.

00:11:19.868 --> 00:11:21.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
Too quickly to dodge.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
Which explains why he didn't
try to protect himself.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
And that's how Detective Terada
was killed

00:11:26.234 --> 00:11:29.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
by massive trauma to the face
by a blunt weapon,

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:30.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
without a struggle.

It's hard to know,
one way or another.

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:42.067 position:7% line:89% align:start
For the killer to intentionally

have hit Detective Terada
in the face...

00:11:44.534 --> 00:11:45.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
they drew his attention

- [killer] What's that!

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
If the killer looked in
a certain direction,

00:11:52.033 --> 00:11:53.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
or if they'd pointed,

00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:55.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
there's a good chance

00:11:59.968 --> 00:12:01.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
Indeed. In this case,

is that if they succeeded

00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:06.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
was killed out by being
struck in the face,

00:13:06.868 --> 00:13:08.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
the proposed description
of the suspect

00:13:08.868 --> 00:13:10.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
would probably be biased.

00:13:10.968 --> 00:13:12.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
If they couldn't figure out
the trick,

00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:14.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
they'd suspect a male
who had strength

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
equal or more to Terada's

00:13:15.801 --> 00:13:19.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
and who was most likely
an acquaintance of his as well.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
Which means the murderer
is the opposite.

00:13:23.167 --> 00:13:25.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
Instead, they were weaker
than him,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
and would never be able to
hit him with that much force.

00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:30.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
Somebody it would seem unlikely
for Detective Terada

00:13:30.334 --> 00:13:33.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
to be alone with in
the middle of the night.

00:13:33.868 --> 00:13:35.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
If they had murdered him
with poison,

00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:37.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
it would seem like
the most obvious method

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:40.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
for them to use to kill
a man of his stature.

00:13:40.868 --> 00:13:42.567 position:30% line:89% align:start
Which means...

00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:44.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
the killer is a woman!

00:13:55.934 --> 00:13:57.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
If the killer was
indeed a woman,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
it would seem unlikely
she'd meet a man

00:13:59.767 --> 00:14:02.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
in the middle of the night
in such a secluded area,

00:14:02.033 --> 00:14:03.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
unless they were dating.

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
It also seems unlikely that
she could kill him

00:14:07.067 --> 00:14:09.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
with a blow to the face
before he could respond.

00:14:11.067 --> 00:14:13.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Detective was
a judo athlete.

00:14:13.133 --> 00:14:16.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's no way he'd be easily
killed by a woman.

00:14:16.267 --> 00:14:17.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
- <i>That would allow the killer</i>
-[men discussing]

00:14:17.968 --> 00:14:19.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
-to avoid investigation.
-I knew it. Yeah.

00:14:19.834 --> 00:14:22.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's why they created a ghost
that would be popular,

00:14:22.801 --> 00:14:24.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
like Steel Lady Nanase!

00:14:24.334 --> 00:14:27.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Why did the killer need to</i>
 <i>create Steel Lady Nanase,</i>

00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:29.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>and why use such</i>
 <i>a specific way</i>

00:14:29.767 --> 00:14:31.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>of killing Detective Terada?</i>

00:14:31.367 --> 00:14:32.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
If we can just determine why

00:14:32.934 --> 00:14:36.434 position:7% line:83% align:start
they used a complicated murder
setup and fabricated a phantom

00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:40.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
that should help us narrow down
the possible suspects.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
The killer knew
Detective Terada's height,

00:14:42.334 --> 00:14:45.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
and set the pendulum trap
accordingly.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
The killer was able
to summon him

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
in the middle of the night
without it seeming suspicious.

00:14:51.133 --> 00:14:52.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
The killer was able
to forecast

00:14:52.801 --> 00:14:54.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
that the Detective would make
a move if he noticed

00:14:54.968 --> 00:14:57.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
something strange was
going on in the city.

00:14:57.968 --> 00:14:59.767 position:10% line:89% align:start
Our killer has to be someone

00:14:59.801 --> 00:15:01.834 position:33% line:83% align:start
who fits all
these descriptions.

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:03.267 position:33% line:89% align:start
The killer...

00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:06.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
is a female officer

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.067 position:7% line:83% align:start
working at the same department
as Detective Terada!

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
If they work at
the same department,

00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:16.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
it'd be easy to find out
the victim's height,

00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:18.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
as well as where
his head would be

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
in relation to something,
like a door.

00:15:21.133 --> 00:15:23.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
If they worked in
the same department,

00:15:23.133 --> 00:15:25.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
they'd also know
his reputation.

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:28.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
As an officer supposedly
attacked by a suspect,

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
they'd know how to
preserve evidence,

00:15:30.467 --> 00:15:32.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
and no one would
suspect a thing

00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:35.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
if they contacted a detective
they could rely on.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
The description of the killer
that comes from

00:15:37.601 --> 00:15:41.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
all these factors
can only be a female cop.

00:15:41.267 --> 00:15:44.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
Her motive for doing it
is anyone's guess.

00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:45.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
Perhaps the Terada had been

00:15:45.868 --> 00:15:47.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
pursuing the killer
romantically,

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:49.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
and she was troubled by that.

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:51.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
Considering the trouble
it took to set up,

00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:54.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
and that she went so far
as to kill him,

00:15:54.033 --> 00:15:55.501 position:13% line:89% align:start
the motive to take his life

00:15:55.534 --> 00:15:58.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
could have come from
an obsessive web of emotions.

00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:03.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>That should cover everything</i>
 <i>for my first claim.</i>

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Steel Lady Nanase is
not a ghost.

00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:07.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
She was created by
a female officer,

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:09.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
to misdirect people

00:16:09.133 --> 00:16:11.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
so she could eliminate
a detective.

00:16:11.567 --> 00:16:13.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
She's a means to a murder.

[sigh]

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Saki] Hey, hold on!

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
That suspect you described
is basically me!

00:16:56.467 --> 00:16:57.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, so you noticed.

00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
Did you assume I wouldn't?!

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:02.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
A female officer who worked
at the same police department,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
and who Terada
had feelings for,

00:17:05.033 --> 00:17:07.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even the chief could connect
those dots in one go!

00:17:07.767 --> 00:17:09.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
You'll have to bear with me.

00:17:09.167 --> 00:17:12.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't just frame a random
female police officer.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:17:13.334 --> 00:17:16.334 position:24% line:83% align:start

Wait, the flow changed again.

00:17:37.267 --> 00:17:39.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
The solution may not
be realistic, but it's odd

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
that they'd change their minds
again so quickly.

00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:46.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
Didn't the flow just change,
because of Kuro's ability?

00:17:50.267 --> 00:17:52.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Iwanaga, you said Rikka's
the one who's trying

00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:54.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
to give Steel Lady Nanase
a form, right?

00:17:54.467 --> 00:17:55.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:17:55.334 --> 00:17:57.367 position:35% line:83% align:start
And she has
the same ability as Kuro

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
that allows her to choose
the future, doesn't she?

00:17:59.868 --> 00:18:02.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes. As I said earlier.

00:18:02.367 --> 00:18:03.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:18:03.067 --> 00:18:04.334 position:33% line:83% align:start
But if then,
that's the case,

00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:06.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
Rikka can also force
the future she wants,

00:18:06.968 --> 00:18:08.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
just like Kuro...

00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:09.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes. And that's exactly why

00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:12.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
the tides turned
so quickly again.

00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:16.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
The idea that this is all
caused by a ghost is popular.

00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:19.567 position:7% line:83% align:start
All she had to do was point out
a few flaws in our solution,

00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:21.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
then die once.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
And she could easily shift
the flow back in her favor.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's entirely possible
that several of the posts

00:18:27.934 --> 00:18:30.067 position:35% line:83% align:start
are written
by Rikka personally.

00:18:31.534 --> 00:18:32.400 position:44% line:89% align:start

concurrent with
mass-posting by users,

00:18:45.367 --> 00:18:48.968 position:13% line:83% align:start

the truth never existed here.

Both Rikka and I know

00:19:31.467 --> 00:19:35.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
that Steel Lady Nanase
didn't exist before.

But Rikka is still trying

so far out of a total of four.

00:20:13.534 --> 00:20:16.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
All I need is for a portion
