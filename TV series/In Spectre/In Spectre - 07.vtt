 <i>The victim's entire head</i>

had been smashed in
by a blunt object.

It was so bad that
we couldn't identify

his face or match
any dental records.

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:18.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
but we're certain
that the victim

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
is Sergeant Tokunosuke Terada.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're still unsure
why Detective Terada

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
went to an abandoned
gas station by himself

in the middle of the night.

On his cellphone,

00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:30.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
we found some personal

the two of you.

The estimated

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
between the hours
of 2:00 and 3:00 AM.

There's a high likelihood
he was killed

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:44.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
due to a grudge incurred

00:02:54.868 --> 00:02:56.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
By the way, Yumihara...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is it true that
Detective Terada

00:02:58.534 --> 00:03:00.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
was investigating
Steel Lady Nanase?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes. I mentioned it
during my interrogation,

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:04.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
when I was asked.

00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:07.167 position:13% line:83% align:start

already knew...

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait, has the media gotten
that info?

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:11.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
No, it hasn't been leaked yet.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
But there are people who are
trying to connect

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:14.834 position:33% line:83% align:start
the incident
with Detective Terada

00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:16.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
to Steel Lady Nanase...

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
since his face was smashed in
during a late night encounter.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.834 position:35% line:83% align:start
Apparently,
that's making some people

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.067 position:30% line:83% align:start
believe it was
Steel Lady Nanase.

Talk about a sick joke.

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:28.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes. It is quite
irresponsible...

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:31.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
Inventing rumors about
somebody's death like that.

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:32.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just have a hard time
believing that

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:35.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
Detective Terada of all people,
was beaten to death.

learned his first name.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's not your fault.

00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:09.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
Detective Terada hated
that name.

00:06:55.067 --> 00:06:56.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
where you brushed against them!

00:06:56.634 --> 00:06:58.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
You had the opportunity!

00:06:58.133 --> 00:06:59.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I cared so much
about big boobs,

00:06:59.834 --> 00:07:01.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
I never would've dated
you or Saki.

00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:03.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
You may have yearned for
something different...

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just once in your life,
you might've wanted to

00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:09.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
manhandle those exceptionally
choice mounds of fat!

00:07:09.534 --> 00:07:12.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
Can you swear to Amaterasu
that you didn't have

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
such pervy thoughts cross
your dirty mind?!

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is starting to sound
like you're projecting...

00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:18.367 position:41% line:89% align:start
[groan]

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:20.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's get back on topic.

00:07:20.734 --> 00:07:21.868 position:30% line:89% align:start
At this point,

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:23.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's hard to dismiss
Steel Lady Nanase

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
as being nothing more than
a mere rumor.

00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:27.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
People are now more inclined
to believe it was a ghost.

00:07:27.934 --> 00:07:30.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was already happening
before now.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ever since the rumors of
Steel Lady Nanase began,

00:07:32.968 --> 00:07:35.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
the idea that this was
a ghost, and that

00:07:35.267 --> 00:07:38.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
it was harassing people
were well received.

00:07:38.934 --> 00:07:42.234 position:7% line:83% align:start
The scales are tipping too far
toward one side.

00:07:42.267 --> 00:07:44.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
Look, Kuro I'm going
to be blunt.

00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:45.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
Go on.

00:07:45.634 --> 00:07:49.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think that Rikka is heavily
intertwined with this case.

00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:52.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
In truth, I think
she's at its core.

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:54.934 position:33% line:89% align:start
I knew that,

00:07:54.968 --> 00:07:58.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I can't defend her
now that someone's dead.

00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:06.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[knock on the door]
-[Kotoko surprised]

00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:24.067 position:41% line:89% align:start
[creak]

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry for running late.

00:08:25.868 --> 00:08:27.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you okay, Saki?

00:08:27.901 --> 00:08:29.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm fine. Thank you.

00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:33.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no doubt, is there?

00:08:33.734 --> 00:08:36.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
The Steel Lady caused
Detective Terada's death.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.434 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] Correct.

00:08:37.467 --> 00:08:39.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] An ayakashi
who saw the incident

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:41.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
as it happened came to see me
this morning.

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:43.901 position:35% line:83% align:start
He gave me
an eyewitness account.

00:08:43.934 --> 00:08:45.133 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Saki] I see.

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:47.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
This may be a stupid question
to ask,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
but will Detective Terada now
be a ghost

00:08:49.567 --> 00:08:50.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
wandering this world?

00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, it's not as though
everybody who dies

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
just becomes a ghost,
and roams.

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
If he doesn't,
that's preferred.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're better off not
being left to wander.

00:08:58.434 --> 00:09:02.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
Of course. I guess it was
a stupid question.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:03.801 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:05.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
Regardless, this isn't good.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
True. We would've been
far better off

00:09:08.133 --> 00:09:11.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
if the culprit was anyone
other than Steel Lady Nanase.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
They say the victim's face
was smashed in!

00:09:13.133 --> 00:09:14.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
[internet user] Could it be...?

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:16.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] While people were
stirring over the fact

00:09:16.901 --> 00:09:18.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
that this might've been
an actual murder

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:19.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
by Steel Lady Nanase...

00:09:19.968 --> 00:09:21.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait, now they're saying

00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:22.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
that his death might have
been an accident?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] If that had
spread instead,

00:09:24.334 --> 00:09:26.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
this would've been confirmed
as rumor

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:27.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
and toned everything down.

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
At the same time,

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:31.734 position:7% line:83% align:start
the threat of Steel Lady Nanase
would've weakened,

00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:33.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
and her popularity
would've waned.

00:09:33.868 --> 00:09:35.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then we could use
Kuro's ability

00:09:35.534 --> 00:09:37.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
to find a more
favorable future and

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
discover a way to destroy
Steel Lady Nanase,

00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:40.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
once and for all.

00:09:41.868 --> 00:09:44.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
After I heard about what had
happened to Detective Terada,

00:09:44.601 --> 00:09:45.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
to be honest,

00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:48.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was hoping things would
turn out that way.

00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:51.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase was
behind his death.

00:09:51.234 --> 00:09:54.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
If the police are pursuing
this incident as a murder case,

00:09:54.334 --> 00:09:57.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
they're going to need to get
more consistent information,

00:09:57.634 --> 00:09:59.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
making things more difficult.

00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:02.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
But now, the bigger problem
is the fact that

00:10:02.534 --> 00:10:06.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase has instantly
become a more violent entity.

00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:08.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
Since she has now gone past
scaring people,

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
and actually committed
a murder...

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase is now
something more violent

00:10:13.067 --> 00:10:14.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
that pursues her victims
until they're dead.

00:10:14.868 --> 00:10:16.200 position:33% line:89% align:start
At this rate,

00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:19.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
there will no doubt
be another victim tonight.

00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:20.000 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:10:20.033 --> 00:10:21.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
The worst-case scenario,

00:10:21.334 --> 00:10:23.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
it might not be just
one or two.

00:10:23.167 --> 00:10:25.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
There could be
multiple victims.

00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:26.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, that can't be...

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is now being talked
about nationally.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
The fantasies are expanding
in an extreme way,

00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:34.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
causing the monster to
grow in an instant.

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:36.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
TV show Research teams

00:10:36.234 --> 00:10:38.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
are trying to verify
information on her

00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:40.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
and fanatics of the occult

00:10:40.067 --> 00:10:42.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
may even start flooding
into the city.

00:10:42.334 --> 00:10:45.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
If any of those groups happen
to run into Steel Lady Nanase,

00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:47.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
they'll be slaughtered.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lots of places have
security cameras.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
If they capture footage and

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:53.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
it ends up being leaked ...

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
more people will learn
about her,

00:10:54.534 --> 00:10:57.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
making her existence
even stronger.

00:10:57.601 --> 00:10:58.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
And from that point on,

00:10:58.934 --> 00:11:01.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
logical fiction would
be useless.

00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:02.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are we supposed to do?

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:04.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
If that happens,
then how can people still wish

00:11:04.868 --> 00:11:07.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
for the existence of
Steel Lady Nanase?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
They probably won't
wish for it.

00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:10.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
But at that point,

00:11:10.634 --> 00:11:13.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
too many people
will fear Steel Lady Nanase

00:11:13.067 --> 00:11:15.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
as an actual ghost,
not just an urban legend.

00:11:15.868 --> 00:11:17.501 position:7% line:89% align:start
Despite denying her existence,

00:11:17.534 --> 00:11:22.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
they'll also be praying that
she never crosses their path.

00:11:22.133 --> 00:11:24.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's no way to tell
what kind of power

00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:26.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
that ghost is about to get.

00:11:26.501 --> 00:11:27.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is messed up...

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
Has the truth always been
so paper thin

00:11:30.067 --> 00:11:31.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
you can rip it apart?

00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:34.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't say paper thin,
but you're correct to believe

00:11:34.133 --> 00:11:36.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
that it can be ripped
to pieces.

00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:37.968 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's exactly why,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
someone out there has
to protect that truth.

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:42.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
This'll decide everything.

00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:45.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
We have to defeat
Steel Lady Nanase,

00:11:45.701 --> 00:11:47.801 position:10% line:89% align:start
and we have to do it tonight.

00:11:47.834 --> 00:11:49.300 position:10% line:89% align:start
You want to do it by tonight?

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
But there's no time
left at all!

00:11:51.734 --> 00:11:52.601 position:44% line:89% align:start
Saki.

00:11:53.567 --> 00:11:54.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
I need information.

00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:56.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
In order to create
logical fiction

00:11:56.734 --> 00:11:57.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
to take the ghost down,

00:11:57.968 --> 00:12:00.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
I will need the truth
at all times.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] So there weren't
any traces

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
of drugs or alcohol
in Detective Terada's body.

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
Right. They weren't able to

00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:26.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
find out anything useful
from his body.

00:12:26.667 --> 00:12:27.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's just starting to
sound more and more

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
like Karin Nanase's death.

00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:33.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
The media hasn't
said anything

00:12:33.033 --> 00:12:35.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
about drugs or alcohol
in his system either.

00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:38.434 position:7% line:83% align:start
And on the Internet, they seem
to be amused by the fact

00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:41.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
that he was killed in such
an unusual and unique way.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.767 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because that seems more like
Steel Lady Nanase?

00:12:43.801 --> 00:12:45.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:47.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
Because how do you hope to win
a fight against a ghost?

00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:49.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
They all agree on one thing,
at least.

00:12:49.868 --> 00:12:51.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
They'd be helplessly
killed too.

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:53.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
But if this wasn't really
the work of a ghost,

00:12:53.767 --> 00:12:56.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
how were they able to beat
Detective Terada to death

00:12:56.767 --> 00:12:57.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
without a struggle?

00:12:57.767 --> 00:12:59.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
Needless to say,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
finding a way to explain
that will be difficult.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
But to really defeat
Steel Lady Nanase,

00:13:03.734 --> 00:13:06.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
we need to find a likely
culprit other than her.

00:13:06.467 --> 00:13:09.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
The fictional culprit can
be more than one person,

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
and they don't have to commit
the same crime.

00:13:11.868 --> 00:13:13.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
Surely, we can also
make it seem like

00:13:13.367 --> 00:13:16.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
the previous events
were unrelated, right?

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
The issue with that is,

00:13:17.767 --> 00:13:19.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
then we'd have to
explain why

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:21.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
the culprit wanted to make
their crimes seem like...

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
something Steel Lady Nanase
would be guilty of.

00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:28.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
What if Detective Terada's
death had nothing to do

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
with Steel Lady Nanase?

00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:32.534 position:7% line:83% align:start
Maybe the detective had crossed
the wrong people

00:13:32.567 --> 00:13:34.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
and someone with
a grudge killed him...

00:13:34.467 --> 00:13:38.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
But the way he died seemed
like Steel Lady Nanase did it.

00:13:38.868 --> 00:13:40.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you think that could work?

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even if they can't narrow down
who did it,

00:13:42.868 --> 00:13:44.400 position:35% line:83% align:start
if we give
a similar explanation,

00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:47.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
we can distance ourselves
from Steel Lady Nanase.

00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:50.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then, all we have
to do is explain

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
the motive behind the attack.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
From there, we give
other explanations

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:55.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
as to what happened.

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.167 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
"Divide each problem into
as many parts as possible.

00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:01.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
It sounds feasible,

00:14:01.667 --> 00:14:04.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
but it's likely impossible
to fully cut her off.

00:14:04.868 --> 00:14:06.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
People seek dreams
in their stories

and hope that reality
is similar.

Knowing it's just a coincidence
is more disappointing

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
than the much more
grand interpretation

00:14:14.834 --> 00:14:16.901 position:16% line:89% align:start
that something was fate.

the rumors of
the Steel Lady create

a surprisingly effective

for the outside observer.

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:03.067 position:19% line:83% align:start

and most importantly,

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.234 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>Rather than</i>
 <i>seeking the truth,</i>

00:18:08.267 --> 00:18:10.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>she's creating</i>
 <i>alternative facts</i>

00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:12.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>a new, ludicrous fiction.</i>

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>And with the pieces aligned,</i>
 <i>it's about to be completed.</i>

00:18:16.934 --> 00:18:19.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
[soothing music]

00:18:24.934 --> 00:18:27.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
[relishing taste]

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.534 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:32.434 --> 00:18:34.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's sweet.

00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:36.701 position:33% line:89% align:start
You got this?

00:18:36.734 --> 00:18:37.834 position:35% line:89% align:start
I think so.

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:40.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've come up with
four solutions.

00:18:40.601 --> 00:18:41.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now I'll use them,

00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:44.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
to round out a truth
that I want.

00:18:45.534 --> 00:18:49.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
I will defeat her tonight,
no matter what it takes.

00:18:52.767 --> 00:18:54.167 position:41% line:89% align:start
[smile]

00:18:58.234 --> 00:18:59.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:19:00.634 --> 00:19:02.067 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:11.100 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yawn]

00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:13.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna sleep for a bit.

00:19:13.133 --> 00:19:15.234 position:7% line:89% align:start
Please wake me up before 9:00.

00:19:15.267 --> 00:19:20.734 position:7% line:83% align:start
Until then, if there's word of
Steel Lady Nanase appearing...

00:19:20.767 --> 00:19:23.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
We can just play it by ear...

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's go and get some food
for Iwanaga

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
so she can eat when
she wakes up.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
That said, we should probably
grab something for us too.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:19:38.634 --> 00:19:41.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've ordered the yokai
and monsters around the city

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
to contact us if
they see Steel Lady Nanase.

00:19:44.534 --> 00:19:47.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
If they see her, I'll head
straight to the scene

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
and stop Nanase
from getting away.

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:52.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then, I can fight
all night if needed.

00:19:52.534 --> 00:19:56.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
Which means I can stop her
and prevent further victims.

00:19:56.801 --> 00:19:58.367 position:35% line:83% align:start
And what if
the Steel Lady escapes?

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll use our intel network
to find her again,

00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:02.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
and I'll stop her.

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:03.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sounds like trouble.

00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:05.968 position:38% line:83% align:start
And yet,
it's still the best way.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
If we hear from them,

00:20:07.467 --> 00:20:11.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
then I would like to ask you
to help me get to the scene.

00:20:11.067 --> 00:20:13.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've already lined up
a rental car.

00:20:13.267 --> 00:20:15.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry to get you involved
in all of this,

00:20:15.701 --> 00:20:17.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
but can I count on your help?

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.901 position:7% line:83% align:start
The last thing I want to see is
any more innocent victims.

00:20:20.934 --> 00:20:23.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
Plus, I need to get over
this already.

00:20:24.601 --> 00:20:25.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's been a while?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
I meant since you started
going out with her?

00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:32.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's been around two and a half
years since we first met.

00:20:32.167 --> 00:20:33.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
So right after we broke up?

00:20:33.868 --> 00:20:37.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, no, Iwanaga only started
talking to me in May...

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
and it's not like
we started dating immediately.

00:20:40.734 --> 00:20:42.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
I never really had
any intention

00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:43.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
of going out with her.

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:44.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, it's not like

00:20:44.567 --> 00:20:46.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
I have any right to
complain about it,

00:20:46.601 --> 00:20:48.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
but I believe you I guess.

00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:50.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
I mean, Iwanaga really is

00:20:50.033 --> 00:20:52.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
the exact opposite
of your type.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, you're totally
right about that.

00:20:55.267 --> 00:20:58.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>Yet you two seem to be</i>
 <i>doing perfectly fine.</i>

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Saki] I think it's good.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
You really shouldn't keep
chasing after Rikka anyway.

00:21:04.868 --> 00:21:06.067 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:12.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
Saki, why'd you bring up
Rikka's name?

00:21:12.734 --> 00:21:13.968 position:33% line:89% align:start
Well, Kuro...

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
Because Rikka is
one hundred percent your type,

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
whether you accept it or not.

 <i>three years older than him.</i>

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.501 position:19% line:83% align:start

 <i>she'd passed away since,</i>

00:21:26.534 --> 00:21:29.367 position:21% line:83% align:start

 <i>were still dating...</i>

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.467 position:10% line:83% align:start

 <i>at a university hospital.</i>

00:21:34.133 --> 00:21:37.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Saki] Hospitalized
for testing? For three years?

00:21:37.701 --> 00:21:39.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, a lot happened.

00:21:39.367 --> 00:21:42.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
I didn't visit her that often
in high school.

00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:44.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
But the hospital's so close
to the university,

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
I get to go visit her
more often now.

00:21:46.701 --> 00:21:48.100 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:21:48.133 --> 00:21:50.968 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then will you take me up there
to meet her sometime?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sure thing. That sounds nice.
