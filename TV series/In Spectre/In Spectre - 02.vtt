00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:16.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[Kotoko] Those are pretty.
-Huh?

00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:19.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you visiting
your cousin again?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
You seem to have
excellent timing, don't you?

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:23.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
Was it through deduction,

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
or did your yokai friends
tell you I was here?

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:28.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have an appointment for
my eye and leg today.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:30.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
What a coincidence!

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:49.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
[opening music]

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:09.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
After that last incident

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
the ayakashi won't stop
talking about you

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:13.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
and what you did that day.

00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:16.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
"He must be a yokai
of unrivaled power.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
-I bet he's gonna cook us up
-[Fallen Warrior] My lady!

00:02:17.868 --> 00:02:18.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
-and eat every one of us
-Please help us!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
-to the last one!"

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:21.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
So I helped you out

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:22.934 position:10% line:89% align:start
and that's the thanks I get?

00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:26.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, it's your power
that scares them.

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:27.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
Your left arm...

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.534 position:33% line:83% align:start
Are you sure
it's totally fine now?

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait, you're actually
worried about me?

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:36.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm the one
who got you involved.

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:42.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] See? It's fine.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ever since I ate
the flesh of a mermaid

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:47.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
at the age of eleven,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
my body repairs itself,

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:52.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
no matter how badly
it gets hurt.

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:59.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know, it's said
those that eat mermaid

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:02.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
will become immortal
and gain eternal youth.

00:03:02.968 --> 00:03:04.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
But I'm happy to say

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:06.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
that you definitely
don't look eleven.

00:03:06.434 --> 00:03:07.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
About that...

00:03:07.534 --> 00:03:09.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think it might be
because the other yokai

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:11.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
whose flesh I ate along
with the mermaid's

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:13.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
is nullifying some
of the effects.

00:03:13.734 --> 00:03:15.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
What was the other one?

00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
I have to get going.

00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:21.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll be late for
visiting hours.

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:24.601 position:44% line:89% align:start
Kuro.

00:03:26.234 --> 00:03:28.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
I actually had
a favor to ask you.

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:29.501 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:03:29.534 --> 00:03:32.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tonight, I'm heading off
to see a giant serpent

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
who is the guardian spirit
of the mountains

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:37.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
in the next prefecture over.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:38.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
Would you come with me?

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:40.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
A giant serpent?

00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:41.367 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:03:41.934 --> 00:03:43.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
About ten days ago,

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:45.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
one of its servants
came to visit me.

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:47.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
It said the guardian is
so troubled by something

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:50.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
that it can't even sleep
at night.

00:03:50.934 --> 00:03:52.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, this is a job for

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
the Goddess of
Wisdom to the Spectres.

00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:58.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're going to put yourself
in danger again?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
I mean, you don't even
have any special powers.

00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:01.634 position:38% line:89% align:start
How rude!

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have a very special power
that allows me

00:04:05.534 --> 00:04:09.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
to interact with the ayakashi,
and even touch ghosts!

00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:11.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
But that's it.
Am I right?

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
You can't fly,
you don't have super-strength,

00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:16.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
or talismans to create
supernatural phenomena.

00:04:16.534 --> 00:04:19.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
You don't have any physical
or spell-like powers.

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:22.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
What if you run into another
violent, aggressive monster

00:04:22.634 --> 00:04:23.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
like we did the other day?

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:25.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
At least my arm can regrow.

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:27.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you're so worried
about me

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:28.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
you should just come along.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
And if you were to
help them out

00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:33.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
despite how much
the yokai fear you, I'm sure

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
it'll make negotiations
and mediations go smoother.

00:04:36.634 --> 00:04:37.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can't tonight.

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:38.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:40.901 position:30% line:83% align:start
I want to enjoy
the pork miso soup

00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:42.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
I made last night.

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:43.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
So go by yourself.

00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:45.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:47.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] Honestly!

00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:49.100 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why is he like that?!

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:51.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
Who lets
a poor defenseless girl

00:04:51.067 --> 00:04:52.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
go off into the mountains
on her own

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
in the middle of the night?!

00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:56.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Yosozume] I'm terribly sorry
it's so late, my lady.

00:04:56.567 --> 00:05:00.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, look! The swamp's
coming into view.

00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:22.234 position:5% line:83% align:start
[serpent] I know you've traveled
a great distance

00:05:22.267 --> 00:05:25.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
to come and see me
as I had requested...

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
for which I humbly thank you...

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:30.167 position:38% line:89% align:start
my lady.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.100 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course.
That is my duty, after all.

00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:39.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's no need to thank me
for doing my job.

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:40.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
And besides,
the people here

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
once worshiped you
as a water god.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's only natural that
I come to see you

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
if you ever needed me.

00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:48.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's been quite a long time

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
since the humans worshiped me
as a water god.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
The small shrine has
long been forgotten,

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:57.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
and no one offers me anything
for it to rain anymore.

00:05:57.901 --> 00:05:59.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
Though, even when
they did pray to me,

00:05:59.868 --> 00:06:01.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
I never had the ability

00:06:01.234 --> 00:06:03.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
to control the weather
to begin with.

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:05.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
Considering me a god
was presumptuous.

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:08.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's no wonder
I've been forgotten.

00:06:09.367 --> 00:06:12.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
The human world develops
so quickly that

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:15.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
there are many things
I don't understand.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
That is why I sent
one of my servants

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
to summon you forth, my lady,

00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:22.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
so I could borrow some
of your great wisdom.

00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:24.434 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, well...

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:28.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
I apologize that I cannot
be more hospitable

00:06:28.834 --> 00:06:29.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
here in these mountains,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
but please do not
be angry with me.

00:06:32.567 --> 00:06:34.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, no! It's totally fine.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
If I seem to be
in a bad mood,

00:06:35.868 --> 00:06:37.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
it isn't because of you.

00:06:37.267 --> 00:06:39.167 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's due to
something personal.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
Something personal,
you say?

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:42.534 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:48.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have a moody boyfriend
named Kuro Sakuragawa.

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:49.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
I asked him to come
with me here tonight,

00:06:49.934 --> 00:06:51.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
but he declined saying

00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:54.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
he'd rather stay home
and eat pork miso soup.

00:06:56.868 --> 00:06:58.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [yokai greeting]
- [Kotoko giggles]

00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:01.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
So you had one of
your yokai track me down...

00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:05.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kuro! It's absolutely
imperative that you at this!

00:07:05.234 --> 00:07:05.901 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:07:05.934 --> 00:07:07.200 position:35% line:89% align:start
[sniffing]

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
You actually made
pork miso soup?

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't go barging
into people's homes!

00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:13.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wait...

00:07:13.367 --> 00:07:15.801 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're going into the mountains
dressed like that?

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:18.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
You noticed, Kuro!
I knew you would!

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a spring line.
My "I've been invited" dress!

00:07:20.834 --> 00:07:22.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
But you were invited to
a swamp in the mountains...

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] Wait, no!

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:26.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
-You shouldn't be so forceful!
-[Kuro] Just stay still!

00:07:26.968 --> 00:07:28.968 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is this?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
The jacket I wore when
I went mountain climbing

00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:32.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
in grade school.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
How did you dig this up
so quickly?!

00:07:34.634 --> 00:07:35.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko gasping]

00:07:35.734 --> 00:07:36.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now what are you doing?!

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's some bug repellent.

00:07:43.868 --> 00:07:46.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
What the heck
do you think you're...

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:48.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
Here's some pork miso soup
to take with you.

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:50.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
And rice balls, too.

00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:51.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wait...

00:07:52.467 --> 00:07:53.334 position:44% line:89% align:start
Kuro!

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:56.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't do anything rash again.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.968 position:35% line:83% align:start
So you see,
even though I told him

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
I would be meeting
with a giant serpent

00:08:01.868 --> 00:08:03.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
that might like
to dine on humans,

00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:04.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
he refused to join me.

00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:06.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
Goodness, no!

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
I would never dream
of eating you, my lady!

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
Besides, humans are far
too hard to eat

00:08:11.601 --> 00:08:14.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
with the clothes and metal
accessories that they put on.

00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:17.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
So you have actually eaten
some humans before?

00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:19.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can't say I haven't...

00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:21.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was rumored to be
a man-eating serpent

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:23.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
back in the day,

00:08:23.067 --> 00:08:25.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
but humans don't really
taste that good.

00:08:25.734 --> 00:08:26.901 position:33% line:89% align:start
And nowadays,

00:08:26.934 --> 00:08:28.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
it would cause far
too much trouble,

00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:30.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
which I would prefer
to avoid.

00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:31.801 position:21% line:89% align:start
By the way, my lady,

00:08:31.834 --> 00:08:33.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:08:33.267 --> 00:08:35.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
if you were able to
bring your soup here,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
couldn't your boyfriend
have brought his

00:08:37.501 --> 00:08:38.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
to eat here, as well?

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:40.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] Err...

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
I mean, he probably didn't
have another thermos!

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:46.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
That must be it, I'm sure!

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
We've gone off track.
Down to the issue at hand.

00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:53.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're concerned about
the murdered corpse you found

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
in your swamp recently,
aren't you?

00:08:56.968 --> 00:08:59.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes. I cannot fathom
why that woman

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
came all the way to my swamp
to dispose of the body.

00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:03.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
So I'd like to hear

00:09:03.968 --> 00:09:07.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
an explanation that
I can be satisfied with.

00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:08.868 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
About a month ago,

00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:11.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
on April 23rd,
just past 2 PM,

00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:14.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
two hikers who were out
picking mountain vegetables

00:09:14.167 --> 00:09:17.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
found a man's body floating
here at Tsukuna Swamp.

00:09:17.367 --> 00:09:20.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because he'd been stabbed in
the chest with a sharp knife,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
they ruled it a murder.

00:09:22.601 --> 00:09:25.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
However, despite
having a few days passing

00:09:25.267 --> 00:09:26.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
since he was murdered,

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:29.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
and him having no cellphone
or ID on his person,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
they identified him
immediately.

00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:35.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hiroo Yoshihara,
35 years old.

00:09:35.267 --> 00:09:37.367 position:33% line:83% align:start
He worked for
a large construction firm.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.567 position:7% line:83% align:start
Eventually, a 30-year-old woman
was arrested as a suspect.

00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:43.934 position:35% line:89% align:start
Aoi Tanio.

00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:46.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
I admit, it was me.

00:09:46.133 --> 00:09:47.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
They got a confession
from her.

00:09:47.934 --> 00:09:50.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
While many unanswered
questions remain,

00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:54.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
they're working mostly on
gathering evidence right now.

00:09:54.133 --> 00:09:55.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
That means it's pretty much

00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:57.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
an open and shut case
for the time being.

00:09:57.834 --> 00:10:00.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
I assume she threw the body
into the swamp to hide it,

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:03.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
or to perhaps stall
its eventual discovery?

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nay! It was not to
hide the body!

00:10:06.267 --> 00:10:09.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just happened to see her
as she dumped it in...

00:10:11.334 --> 00:10:12.200 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:10:13.868 --> 00:10:16.167 position:21% line:89% align:start
[woman panting hard]

00:10:20.834 --> 00:10:23.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
[woman struggling]

00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:26.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
[splash]

00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:29.701 position:38% line:83% align:start
[serpent]
That woman did indeed

00:10:29.734 --> 00:10:32.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
do something so spiteful
as to throw that corpse

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
into this swamp whose waters
I drink from.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
But there are times when
animal corpses float in it,

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:40.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
as well as humans who
throw trash into it.

00:10:40.133 --> 00:10:42.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I have the ayakashi
that live in these mountains

00:10:42.968 --> 00:10:44.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
clean the swamp regularly.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
Which is fine and all,

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:50.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
but something's still amiss
about all of this.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
The woman didn't put
anything on the body

00:10:52.534 --> 00:10:54.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
to weigh it down when
she threw it in.

00:10:54.934 --> 00:10:59.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
So the corpse rose to the top
and was discovered quickly.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
Above all, at that moment

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.767 position:30% line:83% align:start
I clearly heard
the woman say this...

00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:08.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Aoi] I hope with all my heart
that they find you.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
[serpent] Despite taking
the time and effort to

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.934 position:13% line:89% align:start
dispose of the corpse here,

00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:15.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
she talked about

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:17.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
how she wanted
his body to be found.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] At first glance,
it seems like her actions

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
don't really make
much sense at all.

00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:24.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
[serpent] Yes!
I don't understand it!

00:11:24.467 --> 00:11:26.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] It must be difficult
for a woman

00:11:26.367 --> 00:11:28.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
to push a wheelbarrow
with a body in it

00:11:28.701 --> 00:11:30.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
up a mountain at night.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
The police doubted that part,
so they asked her about it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
"Why did you bother
carting his dead body

00:11:36.067 --> 00:11:37.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
all the way up there
to that swamp?"

00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:41.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
And that's when the suspect,
Aoi Tanio, told them...

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's a huge serpent
living in that swamp

00:11:43.467 --> 00:11:46.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I've heard that
sometimes it eats people,

00:11:46.033 --> 00:11:47.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought if I dumped
the body there,

00:11:47.734 --> 00:11:49.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
the serpent would eat it.

00:11:50.868 --> 00:11:52.801 position:30% line:83% align:start
It was a rather
irrational confession

00:11:52.834 --> 00:11:55.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
so it even appeared
in newspapers.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.167 position:38% line:83% align:start
[serpent]
Yes, I too saw that confession.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
Aoi Tanio's family home

00:12:01.067 --> 00:12:02.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
is right at the base
of this mountain.

00:12:02.834 --> 00:12:04.133 position:35% line:83% align:start
It could be
she actually believed

00:12:04.167 --> 00:12:05.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
the legends she'd heard
as a child

00:12:05.634 --> 00:12:07.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
about a man-eating serpent
in the swamp.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
And in a desperate attempt

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
she brought the corpse
all the way up here

00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:12.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
to get rid of it...

00:12:12.367 --> 00:12:14.100 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course,
that's not the case.

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:15.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
She actually brought
the body up here

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
with the intention
of hiding it.

00:12:17.767 --> 00:12:19.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
She wasn't trying to bury it

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
or let it sink down
into the swamp.

00:12:21.133 --> 00:12:23.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
She wanted to give it
to you to devour it.

00:12:23.434 --> 00:12:26.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well then, what about
what that woman said

00:12:26.601 --> 00:12:28.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
when she dumped the body?

00:12:28.734 --> 00:12:29.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
She didn't mean it like

00:12:29.868 --> 00:12:31.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
"I brought it all
the way up here,

00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:32.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
so I hope someone
will find it."

00:12:32.968 --> 00:12:34.868 position:33% line:83% align:start
It was really
quite the opposite.

00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:36.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
What she meant was that

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
she hoped you would
find the body first

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
and deal with it for her.

00:12:39.234 --> 00:12:41.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nay! Even if I had found
the body

00:12:41.868 --> 00:12:43.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
there was no guarantee
that I'd eat it.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
If the woman really wished
to dispose of the body

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
she would've said
something along the lines

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:51.033 position:7% line:89% align:start
of "I truly hope it eats you."

00:12:51.067 --> 00:12:52.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>For being so huge,</i>

00:12:52.701 --> 00:12:56.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>this guardian really</i>
 <i>gets hung up on little details.</i>

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
This brings up
another question.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why did that woman give
the police a false confession?

00:13:02.167 --> 00:13:04.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>Oh man... This is going</i>
 <i>to take a while.</i>

00:13:05.033 --> 00:13:06.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, in all likelihood,

00:13:06.434 --> 00:13:08.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
to conceal the real reason
she dumped the body here.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
Aye. I would like to
hear an answer

00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:13.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can be satisfied with.

00:13:24.534 --> 00:13:26.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Let's go back over
the details of this case.

00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:28.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
Despite your wisdom,

00:13:28.234 --> 00:13:31.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
we need to make sure
there aren't any discrepancies.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
It all started
five years ago.

00:13:33.634 --> 00:13:35.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
Aoi Tanio had a boyfriend.

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:37.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
It was a serious relationship

00:13:37.267 --> 00:13:40.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
with a young man named
Yoshikazu Machii.

00:13:40.367 --> 00:13:42.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
But he died in the arms
of a different woman

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.801 position:21% line:89% align:start
who was his coworker,

00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:48.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
in what looked like
a double suicide.

00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:50.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
Machii worked in
the accounting department

00:13:50.167 --> 00:13:51.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
of a large construction firm,

00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:53.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
but after he died,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
it came to light that
he'd messed with some numbers

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.501 position:33% line:83% align:start
and embezzled
a large sum of money.

00:13:57.534 --> 00:14:00.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
Machii realized he wouldn't
be able to hide the fact

00:14:00.267 --> 00:14:01.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
that he had embezzled
the money

00:14:01.968 --> 00:14:04.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
so he convinced the woman
to die with him.

00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:07.634 position:33% line:83% align:start
Or, at least,
that was what everyone believed.

00:14:07.667 --> 00:14:09.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aoi was deeply hurt by this
and came back

00:14:09.467 --> 00:14:14.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
to her family home at
the base of Mount Tsukuna.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
She lived as a shut-in
for about two years

00:14:17.334 --> 00:14:19.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
but she eventually found
a job near home

00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:23.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
and began to gradually
get back on her feet again.

00:14:24.868 --> 00:14:27.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
And it was right around
that time...

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:32.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
April 21st of this year,
a Friday night seven-thirty,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hiroo Yoshihara showed up
at Aoi's house.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry for what
I did five years ago.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.801 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yoshihara was
a coworker of Machii's,

00:14:40.834 --> 00:14:43.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
so Aoi knew his name and face.

00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:45.767 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Yoshihara]
I embezzled the money!

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:47.400 position:30% line:83% align:start
And I'm the one
who killed Machii...

00:14:47.434 --> 00:14:51.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
Machii and that woman
realized what I had done.

00:14:51.367 --> 00:14:55.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
They said they'd make it public
unless I confessed...

00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:56.501 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's why I killed them...

00:14:57.667 --> 00:15:00.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Hiroo Yoshihara's plan
went accordingly.

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:02.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
He got away with
the embezzlement

00:15:02.367 --> 00:15:05.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
and it's said he was living
a decent life afterwards.

00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:06.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
But starting this year.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
he was met with
a series of misfortunes.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
He made a mistake at work
that cost millions.

00:15:13.334 --> 00:15:15.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
An accident killed
his wife and child.

00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:16.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
On top of that,

00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:19.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
they found a malignant tumor
growing in his body.

00:15:19.734 --> 00:15:22.834 position:35% line:83% align:start
A series of
unfortunate events.

00:15:22.868 --> 00:15:24.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yoshihara thought
this was happening

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
because of what
he had done five years prior,

00:15:26.868 --> 00:15:28.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
so he visited Aoi
in the mountains

00:15:28.868 --> 00:15:30.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
to repent for his crimes.

00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:32.234 position:33% line:83% align:start
He thought if
he showed remorse now

00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:34.267 position:30% line:83% align:start
he could escape
his fateful punishment,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
and that he might at least
get away with his life.

00:15:39.868 --> 00:15:41.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry...

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:45.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry!

00:15:46.534 --> 00:15:51.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
And that pretty much sums up
Aoi Tanio's confession.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
Apparently, Yoshihara
had also contacted

00:15:53.534 --> 00:15:55.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
Machii's younger brother
beforehand,

00:15:55.734 --> 00:15:57.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
asking if they could
meet up soon

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
regarding what had happened
five years ago.

00:15:59.968 --> 00:16:01.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Machii's brother was
at work at the time

00:16:01.567 --> 00:16:04.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
so he couldn't talk
to him in detail.

00:16:04.234 --> 00:16:08.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
That probably prompted
Yoshihara to go see Aoi first.

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:11.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Aoi gasps]

00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:12.367 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
As the investigation went on,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
the embezzlement and
supposed double suicide

00:16:14.934 --> 00:16:16.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
came back to light.

00:16:16.033 --> 00:16:17.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
They also learned that
Aoi Tanio

00:16:17.868 --> 00:16:19.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
the person connected
to the case,

00:16:19.234 --> 00:16:20.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
lived at the base
of the mountain

00:16:20.767 --> 00:16:23.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
where the corpse was found,
and made the connection.

00:16:24.834 --> 00:16:26.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Aoi] Yoshihara was about
my size

00:16:26.801 --> 00:16:30.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
and his body had already wasted
away due to his illness,

00:16:30.234 --> 00:16:33.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
so it wasn't that much trouble
to get him up the mountain.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] The next day,
Saturday the 22nd,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
no one came to the swamp,

00:16:37.534 --> 00:16:39.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
possibly because
it rained that day.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
So the body wasn't discovered
until two days later,

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:43.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
on the 23rd.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Aoi] I figured the serpent
wouldn't want to eat

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
the man's wallet
or his cellphone,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
so I decided to remove them.

00:16:48.901 --> 00:16:50.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then I burned his ID at home,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I threw the knife into
the swamp with the body.

00:16:54.634 --> 00:16:55.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.267 position:35% line:83% align:start
It did not
eat the corpse.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
[serpent] The police have been
coming to this swamp

00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:03.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
quite often during the day
ever since it happened.

00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:06.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
It would seem they are looking
for the knife that killed him.

00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:09.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sure they'd have
a tough time finding it here.

00:17:09.868 --> 00:17:11.033 position:21% line:89% align:start
About the suspect...

00:17:11.067 --> 00:17:12.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
Did she throw anything
in the swamp?

00:17:12.868 --> 00:17:14.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
I mean, aside from the body?

00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:17.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hm, I'm not certain...

00:17:18.167 --> 00:17:20.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sadly, the information
I can get is limited

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I'll just have to
use my imagination

00:17:22.968 --> 00:17:24.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
to fill in some of
the blank spots...

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I still believe
the suspect dumped the body

00:17:27.267 --> 00:17:29.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
into the swamp for
a very simple reason.

00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:31.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
A simple reason?

00:17:31.734 --> 00:17:32.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:33.834 position:24% line:89% align:start
In cases like this,

00:17:33.868 --> 00:17:36.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
it's often done to protect
the real killer.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hiroo Yoshihara had contacted
Aoi Tanio beforehand

00:17:40.234 --> 00:17:42.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
saying that he'd like
to come see her.

00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:44.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
He was from a dark part
of her past.

00:17:44.801 --> 00:17:46.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
I doubt she'd agree
to see him alone.

00:17:46.868 --> 00:17:48.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
That is a good point...

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
No one would
suspect anything

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
if she had someone with her
when Yoshihara came over.

00:17:52.901 --> 00:17:54.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, I know. I think

00:17:54.267 --> 00:17:57.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
Machii's younger brother
would be a perfect example.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yoshihara told Machii's brother
on the phone

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
that he had also contacted
Machii's former girlfriend.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
He might have had
a bad feeling about that

00:18:04.601 --> 00:18:06.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
and contacted Aoi.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
After learning the truth
of his brother's murder

00:18:08.801 --> 00:18:11.000 position:5% line:89% align:start
he impulsively killed Yoshihara.

00:18:13.434 --> 00:18:15.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Aoi screams]

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] But he still had
a future.

00:18:16.968 --> 00:18:18.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
On the other hand,

00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:19.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
Aoi had been living
as a shut-in

00:18:19.868 --> 00:18:22.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
and had very little to lose.

00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:25.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why she decided
she would protect him.

00:18:25.934 --> 00:18:27.934 position:33% line:83% align:start
After sending
the real killer away,

00:18:27.968 --> 00:18:29.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
she decided to
dump the corpse

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
at the swamp in
the mountains.

00:18:31.067 --> 00:18:32.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
There are three reasons
for this.

00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:33.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
The first:

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
to let the swamp water
wash off any traces

00:18:35.667 --> 00:18:38.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
of the true killer that may
have ended up on the corpse.

00:18:38.968 --> 00:18:40.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
The second:

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
to give the true killer
an alibi.

00:18:42.834 --> 00:18:45.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
But then,
why did the woman say,

00:18:45.133 --> 00:18:47.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
"I hope with all my heart
that they find you"?

00:18:47.767 --> 00:18:49.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't understand.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.033 position:33% line:83% align:start
Like I said,
there's a third reason

00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:52.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
why she dumped the body here.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
Aoi Tanio tried to
get rid of any trace

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
of the true killer
at her house.

00:18:56.667 --> 00:18:58.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
If she carefully cleaned
every inch of her home

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
that could be possible.

00:19:00.868 --> 00:19:03.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
But what about outside
the house?

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no telling
what traces Machii's brother

00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:08.901 position:21% line:89% align:start
could've left behind.

00:19:08.934 --> 00:19:10.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
And that's the main reason

00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:12.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
why Aoi chose to bring
the corpse to your swamp!

00:19:12.834 --> 00:19:14.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

00:19:14.334 --> 00:19:15.200 position:35% line:89% align:start
What else?

00:19:15.234 --> 00:19:17.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
She wished for rain
and the rain came!

00:19:17.601 --> 00:19:18.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
[serpent realizing]

00:19:18.834 --> 00:19:20.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
You were known as
a water god and

00:19:20.267 --> 00:19:23.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
received prayers for rain
in the past, didn't you?

00:19:23.067 --> 00:19:25.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
If it started pouring,
tire tracks and

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
anything else he might've
accidentally dropped

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
would just get washed away.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
[serpent]
A moment please...

00:19:30.467 --> 00:19:31.634 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:35.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was regarded as a water god
a very long time ago.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Besides, dropping a body
into the swamp

00:19:37.133 --> 00:19:38.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
as an offering is unheard of!

00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:40.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
And did they really think
they'd be blessed with rain

00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:43.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
by throwing in the corpse
of a filthy middle-aged man?!

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
If they wanted to
give me an offering

00:19:45.501 --> 00:19:47.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
it should've been a beautiful,
living girl!

00:19:47.801 --> 00:19:52.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
Give me a girl
as a sacrifice!!!

00:19:52.167 --> 00:19:53.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Uh, Guardian?
-Huh?

00:19:53.601 --> 00:19:54.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
There are usually two types

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.934 position:30% line:83% align:start
of rain rituals
someone can try.

00:19:56.968 --> 00:19:59.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
The first option is
to pray to a water god

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
and have them choose
to grant your wish.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's the orthodox method.

00:20:03.167 --> 00:20:05.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
But there is also
the opposite method

00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:07.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
of making the water god
absolutely furious

00:20:07.234 --> 00:20:09.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
so that they go on a rampage
and make it rain.

00:20:09.567 --> 00:20:13.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, I do believe I've heard
that somewhere before.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it appears that
you were indeed enraged,

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:16.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
wouldn't you say?

00:20:16.534 --> 00:20:17.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
Goodness me...

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:21.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now I remember it actually
did rain the next day...

00:20:21.801 --> 00:20:23.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, this would explain why

00:20:23.267 --> 00:20:25.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
you heard her say
she wished he'd be found.

00:20:25.834 --> 00:20:27.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
Aoi Tanio wanted you to find

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yoshihara's corpse and
go completely berserk.

00:20:31.567 --> 00:20:32.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's why she let

00:20:32.667 --> 00:20:34.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
"I hope with all my heart
that they find you"

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.501 position:13% line:89% align:start
slip out without thinking.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
[serpent] Nay! That explanation
is still lacking!

00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:43.834 position:33% line:83% align:start
In that case,
wouldn't she have said

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
"I really hope
it pours down," or

00:20:46.234 --> 00:20:48.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
"I really hope
the giant serpent finds him

00:20:48.734 --> 00:20:50.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
and becomes enraged"?

00:20:51.367 --> 00:20:52.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
Why of course!

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:53.334 --> 00:20:55.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
If somebody not involved
in any way

00:20:55.234 --> 00:20:56.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
had been visiting here
by car,

00:20:56.701 --> 00:20:58.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
they would've witnessed
what she was doing.

00:20:58.934 --> 00:21:00.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
The police would
investigate that too.

00:21:00.901 --> 00:21:04.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
to see if there might've been
another killer or accomplices.

00:21:04.467 --> 00:21:08.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
You seem to deny your own
claims rather readily...

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:11.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why the only suspect
is Aoi Tanio.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
Most of what she confessed
to the police

00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:15.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
about what happened is true.

00:21:15.133 --> 00:21:17.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think the only thing that's
different is her reasoning

00:21:17.868 --> 00:21:19.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
for dumping the corpse
in this swamp.

00:21:19.767 --> 00:21:21.634 position:38% line:89% align:start
[excited]

00:21:21.667 --> 00:21:22.968 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
[joyful sounds]

00:21:26.767 --> 00:21:29.434 position:38% line:89% align:start
[excited]

00:21:31.801 --> 00:21:32.734 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:21:32.767 --> 00:21:34.234 position:38% line:89% align:start
[signing]

00:21:38.567 --> 00:21:39.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
So you came!

00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:40.801 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:42.767 position:35% line:83% align:start
So that is
my lady's boyfriend...

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
How terrifying...

00:21:45.334 --> 00:21:46.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
[terrified]

00:21:46.734 --> 00:21:48.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm your boyfriend now?

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.901 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm so glad
you could make it.

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:51.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why don't you tell him that

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm not really
your boyfriend?!

00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:54.634 position:35% line:83% align:start
We can have
our lovers' quarrel later.

00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:58.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
Right now, we have to resolve
any lingering questions he has.

00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:01.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes. Precisely, my lady.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
And how are you planning
to do that?

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, if you were listening
this whole time,

00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:07.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
I wish should've
come out sooner.

00:22:07.767 --> 00:22:08.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
My lady!

00:22:09.534 --> 00:22:11.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
So what is the real reason
the suspect

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
threw the corpse into
my beloved swamp?

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ending music]
