00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:09.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
[serpent] My lady!

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:12.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
So what is the actual reason
the suspect threw

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
the man's corpse
into this swamp?

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:17.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
Simple. It was so Aoi Tanio
could have the police

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
track down something
she wanted found.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
She had previously tossed
something away in this swamp

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
and after murdering
Hiroo Yoshihara,

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
she decided it was time
to try and retrieve it.

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:30.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
But it was going to be
an impossible task for her

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:33.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
to find what she had thrown
into this swamp all on her own.

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:37.133 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's why she decided to get
the police to help her look.

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:39.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
If she told them she had dumped
the murder weapon here,

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:40.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
there's a good chance

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
the police would've
searched the swamp.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then what about the thing
she whispered?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
It wasn't the murdered body
she wanted them to find.

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:50.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was something she had
tossed into the swamp before.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
Though she tossed it in
quite a while ago,

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:55.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
so there was no guarantee
it would be found.

00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:58.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why she was unable
to stop herself

00:00:58.067 --> 00:00:59.467 position:7% line:89% align:start
from uttering a little prayer.

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:04.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Aoi] I hope with all my heart
that they find you.

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:09.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that was the whisper
that you overheard that day.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
[opening music]

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.901 position:7% line:83% align:start
[serpent] Then she didn't need
to go through the trouble

00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:43.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
of bringing the corpse
out here.

00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:46.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
She could have just said
the weapon was in the swamp.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
But that brings up some
inconsistencies in the story.

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:51.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
To carry out her plan,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aoi Tanio needed the police
to find out about the incident,

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:56.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
believe that she was
the culprit and arrest her,

00:02:56.734 --> 00:02:58.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
and hear her confess that

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:00.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
she threw the murder weapon
into the swamp.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
So first, how would
she get the police

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
to find out about the incident?

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:07.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
Someone would have to have
discovered the victim's body.

00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:09.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes that's precisely it, Kuro!

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:10.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
And how would she go about

00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:12.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
making sure that
that really happened?

00:03:12.634 --> 00:03:13.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
Well...

00:03:13.534 --> 00:03:14.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
Confess immediately?

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:16.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't think so--
most certainly not.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
The fact she threw
the weapon into the swamp

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:20.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
would mean she was trying
to conceal the crime.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:23.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
And a suspect like that
wouldn't admit to their crimes.

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:24.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
Exactly.

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:26.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
Many hikers come
through here everyday

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
so the body would've
been found quickly.

00:03:28.868 --> 00:03:30.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
And she mentioned during
her interrogation

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:33.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
that she wanted the giant
serpent to eat the body.

00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:35.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
That alone should cause
the police to question

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:38.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
her sanity and work harder
on the investigation

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:39.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
to discover the truth
behind what happened.

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:40.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:43.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
So what is that woman trying
to get them to find?

00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:47.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
What do you believe she threw
into the swamp long ago?

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure it was something
that had to do

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:52.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
with her former boyfriend,
the late Machii Yoshikazu.

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:54.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure she must
have resented him

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:56.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
after the incident
five years ago.

00:03:56.267 --> 00:03:59.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
But this was all set up
by Hiroo Yoshihara.

00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:01.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
She found out her boyfriend
was innocent.

00:04:01.968 --> 00:04:03.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
It can be presumed

00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:06.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
that she deeply regretted
the fact she'd doubted him.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
I see. It makes sense
that she would want

00:04:08.868 --> 00:04:12.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
to get rid of any reminders
of the man who betrayed her.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
But now she was trying
to retrieve it.

00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:17.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
Isn't this all rather
dramatic just to

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:20.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
reclaim a single item
she'd long ago thrown away?

00:04:20.734 --> 00:04:21.200 position:38% line:89% align:start
Totally.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:24.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
After what had happened
with her boyfriend,

00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:25.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
she made the decision
to return home

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
after living all by herself
in the city.

00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:30.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
She probably got rid of
a lot of things during the move

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:32.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
like the stuff related
to her boyfriend.

00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:35.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even if she had kept a couple
of pictures and presents,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
she could've just thrown them
in the trash or burned them.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then what are you implying
that she threw

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
into the swamp?

00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:49.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
Something important...

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
Perhaps it was a baby
she had with her boyfriend.

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:57.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
Shortly after
the unexpected death

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.634 position:16% line:89% align:start
of her boyfriend Maachi,

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:02.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
and then, her subsequent move
back into her family home...

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:04.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
Aoi came to the realization

00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:07.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
that she was pregnant
with his child.

00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:09.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not knowing the truth
at the time,

00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:12.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
she saw it as the child
of the man who betrayed her.

00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:14.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
Though the child was blameless

00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:17.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
Aoi likely still wondered
what she should do.

00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:19.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
But then one day,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
she ended up having
a miscarriage at home

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:24.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
and the fetal corpse
ended up in her hands.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
How would she dispose of it?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
She brought it here.

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:31.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then, last month
she found out the truth

00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:33.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
about her boyfriend's death

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:35.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
and regretted her actions
even more.

00:05:35.734 --> 00:05:36.934 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Aoi crying]

00:05:36.968 --> 00:05:38.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
She felt she should try
to find the fetus

00:05:38.934 --> 00:05:40.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
and give it a proper burial.

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:43.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why she came up
with the plan

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
to have the police
dredge through the swamp.

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:47.634 position:38% line:83% align:start
[serpent]
So with their help,

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:50.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
that woman's dead infant
would eventually be found?

00:05:50.868 --> 00:05:52.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, I don't think so.

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:55.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, you said it
yourself earlier...

00:05:55.434 --> 00:06:00.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
that you ask the ayakashi
to regularly clean your swamp.

00:06:00.267 --> 00:06:02.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's most likely
that her baby sank

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:04.934 position:30% line:83% align:start
into the swamp
about four years ago.

00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:06.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
So the mountain ayakashi

00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:09.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
probably pulled it out
a long time ago.

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:11.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
Aoi Tanio tossed
a tiny corpse

00:06:11.734 --> 00:06:13.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
into the swamp years ago.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sure she came up
these mountains

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
alone one night so that
she wouldn't be found.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's what drove her
to think of

00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:22.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
disposing of the man's body
at night in the same fashion...

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:23.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
like before.

00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:26.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
By throwing that new corpse
into the swamp,

00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:28.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
she wanted to retrieve
the precious little corpse

00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:30.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
she had lost.

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:35.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
This theory doesn't contradict
anything you said

00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:37.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
and seems the most plausible.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:44.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
Humans truly concoct and
commit such horrendous acts.

00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:46.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
Indeed, they do.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'd say you're also terrifying,
my lady,

00:06:49.133 --> 00:06:51.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
but there's something
even more...

00:06:51.367 --> 00:06:52.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:54.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, how absolutely frightful!

00:06:55.767 --> 00:06:57.267 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kuro] Was that deduction
really true?

00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:01.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
That stuff about her baby?

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:03.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
What I do know
is that everything

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
Aoi Tanio told the police
was definitely not a lie,

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.267 position:30% line:83% align:start
and apparently,
she really did want

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
the Guardian to
eat Yoshihara's corpse.

00:07:11.133 --> 00:07:12.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
Before meeting with
the Guardian,

00:07:12.868 --> 00:07:14.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
I sent a ghost to check in

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:17.801 position:33% line:83% align:start
on Aoi Tanio
in her holding cell...

00:07:17.834 --> 00:07:19.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did the serpent not find
the body or

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:20.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
was it not interested?

00:07:20.968 --> 00:07:23.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] And the ghost
heard her say that.

00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:24.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] So you knew that

00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:26.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
and lined up one lie
after another.

00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:28.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:07:28.367 --> 00:07:30.701 position:35% line:83% align:start
Even still,
my explanation made sense

00:07:30.734 --> 00:07:32.534 position:35% line:83% align:start
and seemed
ompletely reasonable.

00:07:32.567 --> 00:07:33.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
For the most part.

00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:35.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
However, there's really
no guarantee that

00:07:35.868 --> 00:07:38.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
the suspect would
act rationally.

00:07:38.334 --> 00:07:39.200 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:07:39.234 --> 00:07:41.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Guardian of the swamp
had said that

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:42.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
if the woman wanted them to
eat the corpse

00:07:42.868 --> 00:07:44.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
to make it disappear,

00:07:44.033 --> 00:07:45.300 position:13% line:89% align:start
she would've just said so.

00:07:45.334 --> 00:07:46.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
But Aoi knew nothing
would start

00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:48.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
until they found the body

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.501 position:33% line:83% align:start
which is why
she whispered that.

00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:52.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
I believe that is
all quite possible.

00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:54.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
[agreeing]

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
This may be going too far,

00:07:55.868 --> 00:07:57.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
but there is also
the possibility that

00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:00.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Guardian misheard
what Aoi Tanoi whispered.

00:08:00.434 --> 00:08:03.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
If so, that would completely
destroy the original premise.

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:06.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
And a great yokai who's
as renowned as the Guardian

00:08:06.968 --> 00:08:08.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
would never admit
to mishearing someone.

00:08:08.734 --> 00:08:09.801 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:08:09.834 --> 00:08:11.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's why I used
some of my wisdom

00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:13.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
to navigate the problem.

00:08:13.334 --> 00:08:15.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think I understand
your powers now.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
But with all of that aside,

00:08:17.734 --> 00:08:19.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
you really should
be more cautious

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:20.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
about the danger
you put yourself in.

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:23.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I wouldn't ever have to
worry about stuff like that

00:08:23.133 --> 00:08:25.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
if you would just stay
by my side...

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
You never mentioned
helping you exterminate yokai

00:08:27.868 --> 00:08:29.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
as a condition for
going out with you.

00:08:29.334 --> 00:08:33.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
Interesting you finally admit
we're dating then.

00:08:33.567 --> 00:08:35.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, I didn't.

00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:36.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
[dozing off]

00:08:36.467 --> 00:08:37.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:57.834 --> 00:08:59.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Teenager] So yeah.

00:08:59.133 --> 00:09:02.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
The new girl up at work
is a total super hottie.

00:09:02.234 --> 00:09:05.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
And bonus points, man!
They were freaking huge.

00:09:05.801 --> 00:09:07.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
What? What am I talking about?

00:09:07.634 --> 00:09:09.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
Her boobs...

00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:11.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
They're huge...

00:09:12.734 --> 00:09:15.133 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:25.767 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Terada] Hey, Yumihara.

00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:26.567 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Saki] Yes?

00:09:26.601 --> 00:09:27.834 position:30% line:89% align:start
The other day,

00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:29.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
when I invited you out
for some yakiniku,

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
you declined saying that
eating beef reminds you

00:09:31.534 --> 00:09:34.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
of an ex-boyfriend you had
a nasty falling-out with

00:09:34.133 --> 00:09:36.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
and it makes you feel sick
to your stomach.

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:39.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
If so, why are you eating
the kalbi lunch right now?

00:09:39.234 --> 00:09:42.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
I realized I shouldn't let
the past hold me back,

00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:45.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
so I'm doing everything
I can to get over it.

00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:46.567 position:38% line:89% align:start
I see...

00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:47.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, when you do tell me,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll be sure to
invite you out again.

00:09:49.868 --> 00:09:51.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, I've been meaning to ask...

00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:53.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
You handled that river wreck
the other day, right?

00:09:53.601 --> 00:09:54.901 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:09:54.934 --> 00:09:57.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
The report says
the young man thought he saw

00:09:57.767 --> 00:09:59.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
a puppy jump out
in front of him.

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:00.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
So he panicked and
drove through the guardrail

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:02.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
and then into the river.

00:10:02.133 --> 00:10:03.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I heard he had
a different story

00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:05.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
to tell at first.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
He'd just been pulled
from the river

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
when he said that.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.534 position:38% line:83% align:start
He was in
a state of hysteria.

00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:11.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
Once he'd calmed down,

00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:14.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
he confirmed that was
not actually the case.

00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:16.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
But it's true that
this college student

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:17.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
initially told you...

00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:19.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
That a girl wielding
a steel beam

00:10:19.934 --> 00:10:21.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
about two meters long

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
who was wearing a flashy,
frilly red and black dress

00:10:23.901 --> 00:10:27.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
and a huge bow in her hair,
but who somehow had no face,

00:10:27.868 --> 00:10:29.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
suddenly appeared in
front of his car.

00:10:29.868 --> 00:10:32.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
So he panicked and
swerved off the road.

00:10:32.868 --> 00:10:33.667 position:33% line:89% align:start
He said that?

00:10:33.701 --> 00:10:34.834 position:41% line:89% align:start
He did.

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:36.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then why did you use
the statement

00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:37.868 position:21% line:89% align:start
regarding the puppy?

00:10:37.901 --> 00:10:39.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
Because it doesn't matter

00:10:39.167 --> 00:10:41.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
if it was a puppy or
a ghost that popped out.

00:10:41.901 --> 00:10:43.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
But they are pretty different...

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Detective Terada...
-Hmm?

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you looking for
Steel Lady Nanase?

00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:50.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
[cop] Steel Lady Nanase?

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:51.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've never heard of her?

00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:53.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
Heard of Karin Nanase?

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:54.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Saki] Oh, isn't she...?

00:10:54.467 --> 00:10:57.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
She's the idol who died at
the beginning of the year?

00:10:57.133 --> 00:10:59.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
I remember hearing
the media was abuzz

00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:00.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
about some unsavory rumors.

00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:02.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's right.

00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:03.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
And to get away from
the crazy paparazzi,

00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:07.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
she holed up in a hotel
right here in Makurazaka City.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
But then, she died
when a steel beam

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:11.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
from a nearby construction
site fell on her.

00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:13.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
I heard she had
a huge rack.

00:11:13.234 --> 00:11:16.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
But there are rumors swirling
'round about her again.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
What? Like you mean
it was suicide?

00:11:18.534 --> 00:11:19.734 position:44% line:89% align:start
No...

00:11:19.767 --> 00:11:20.567 position:35% line:89% align:start
It seems...

00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:21.667 position:33% line:89% align:start
[interested]

00:11:21.701 --> 00:11:24.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
She appears every night
in Makurazaka City.

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:27.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's even wearing
her idol outfit, and now,

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:30.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
she wields the steel beam
that crushed her...

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
The frightening faceless ghost
of Karin Nanase.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
And what do you think
about all that?

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought it wasn't
the best idea

00:11:37.133 --> 00:11:39.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
to put any stories about
ghosts in writing.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's not the point
I'm talking about.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want to know what
your gut tells you.

00:11:43.734 --> 00:11:45.067 position:38% line:83% align:start
Tell me,
do you honestly think

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
that there's a ghost
or a monster

00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:49.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
named "Steel Lady Nanase"
out there?

00:11:51.367 --> 00:11:54.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
The college student's
terrified face, the tire tracks

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the guardrail
that was busted through.

00:11:57.434 --> 00:11:58.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
And...

00:12:00.133 --> 00:12:02.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
that eerie feeling
in the air...

00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:04.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
All of those things
were real.

00:12:04.934 --> 00:12:06.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
I do believe that
the college student

00:12:06.901 --> 00:12:08.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
really saw something
on the road

00:12:08.767 --> 00:12:10.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
that shouldn't have been there.

00:12:10.767 --> 00:12:11.200 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
At police call boxes
all around the city,

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:16.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
many people are claiming
that they have witnessed

00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:18.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
or were nearly attacked

00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:20.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
by someone resembling
Steel Lady Nanase.

00:12:20.968 --> 00:12:23.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're reporting
at police boxes?

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
The officers onsite are
shrugging it off

00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:27.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
by saying they were all
just seeing things

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
but ever since the middle
of last month,

00:12:29.434 --> 00:12:32.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
there have been cases
involving random attacks

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.968 position:16% line:83% align:start

have been on the rise

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.167 position:21% line:89% align:start
throughout the city.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Detective Terada.
-Huh?

00:12:36.534 --> 00:12:39.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you honestly believe
that Steel Lady Nanase

00:12:39.267 --> 00:12:42.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
actually exists and
is attacking people?

00:12:42.868 --> 00:12:43.100 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:44.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hey, come on now.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm just trying to clarify.
Don't make me sound crazy!

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
Of course, I don't believe
in ghosts.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure this is the work
of the living.

00:12:53.834 --> 00:12:55.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
If someone truly is
appearing in

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
various locations around town
dressed like that,

00:12:58.033 --> 00:12:59.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
it seems like a lot of trouble

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
for a mere prankster or
kidnapper to go through.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's the part
that bugs me too.

00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:07.033 position:7% line:83% align:start
If it's necessary to go through
all that trouble to do this,

00:13:07.067 --> 00:13:09.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
there must be a significant
reason or objective

00:13:09.734 --> 00:13:11.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
behind these actions.

00:13:11.868 --> 00:13:13.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
Something that's not
just a prank,

00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:15.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
but an actual crime.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
These reports first started
happening within the city

00:13:18.267 --> 00:13:20.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
over the past two weeks.

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:22.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
We started seeing
more information

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:24.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
on the Internet
around then too.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
They've had from when
the rumors started spreading

00:13:26.334 --> 00:13:28.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
until two weeks ago
to prepare.

00:13:28.868 --> 00:13:30.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
And more recently,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
they finally started
making their move.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
A police officer taking rumors
like this seriously

00:13:35.634 --> 00:13:37.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
looks kinda bad.

00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:40.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
But something's definitely
going on.

00:13:40.601 --> 00:13:42.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
As of right now,
the suburbs have suddenly

00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:45.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
become a hotbed of activity
for organized crime.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
Meaning somebody should
definitely keep an eye out.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
There is still the possibility

00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:19.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
that yokai and ghosts exist
in this world.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, I haven't seen
any ghosts,

If you don't believe

00:14:31.834 --> 00:14:33.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
it's possible that
there are beings

in saying this.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because I didn't believe
that was the case,

00:14:46.234 --> 00:14:49.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
I ended up having to

It's a prosthetic.
It's fine.

It's built to come off

from it staying on.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
How'd you make contact
with that thing

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
when my hand went

Oh... No, ma'am.

00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:43.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm kind of somewhere
in between, I suppose...

00:20:45.434 --> 00:20:46.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
Whoever you are,

00:20:46.534 --> 00:20:48.968 position:21% line:83% align:start

I'll take care of
Steel Lady Nanase

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.200 position:7% line:89% align:start
in the not-too-distant future.

00:20:55.234 --> 00:20:57.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the whole reason
I came here.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd rather not bother
getting the police involved,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I ask you not to tell
anyone about me either.

00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:07.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can tell me more
at the station.

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:09.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's just at the bottom
of the hill.

00:21:09.467 --> 00:21:10.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:21:10.067 --> 00:21:11.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
Your leg might be okay,

00:21:11.434 --> 00:21:13.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I'm sure you have bruises
and cuts everywhere.

00:21:13.968 --> 00:21:15.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll treat them for you.

00:21:15.767 --> 00:21:17.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:21:17.033 --> 00:21:18.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't plan to get
a statement from you

00:21:18.968 --> 00:21:21.200 position:7% line:89% align:start
or try to contact your family.

00:21:21.234 --> 00:21:24.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
But there are a series
of incidents the police think

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:26.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase
is responsible for,

00:21:26.367 --> 00:21:28.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
so I can't just let this go.

00:21:28.367 --> 00:21:33.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
An officer with the traffic
division, Saki Yumihara...

lost weight...

00:21:44.834 --> 00:21:47.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah! That's why
I didn't realize it!

00:21:47.067 --> 00:21:48.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
Augh! I never would've
saved you

00:21:48.968 --> 00:21:50.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
if I knew you were you!

00:21:50.334 --> 00:21:52.767 position:13% line:83% align:start

that thing kill you,

00:21:52.801 --> 00:21:54.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
but really...

00:21:54.868 --> 00:21:56.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
Explain so I can understand.

00:21:56.767 --> 00:21:59.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
It seems like you know me?

00:21:59.133 --> 00:22:02.000 position:10% line:83% align:start

ever meeting before.

we've properly greeted
each other.
