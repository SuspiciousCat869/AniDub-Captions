[Kotoko] In the end,

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
the majority concluded
that Steel Lady Nanase,

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:47.968 position:7% line:89% align:start
was nothing more than fiction.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
And the schemes of Rikka
Sakuragawa were rejected.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:09.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
[opening music]

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:32.267 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Huh...
Well, well...

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just received an email.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
Happens to be from Rikka.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've been posting
from Kuro's laptop,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
guess she knows
his email address.

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:43.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
So Rikka knew that it was
the two of you

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:45.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
getting in her way
this entire time?

00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:46.934 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>I guess that makes sense.</i>

00:02:46.968 --> 00:02:48.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>The only one who could</i>
 <i>get in the way of</i>

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>her determining the future,</i>
 <i>would be Kuro</i>

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>who has the same ability.</i>

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:55.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>And she's the only one</i>
 <i>who would know how to do this.</i>

00:02:55.434 --> 00:02:56.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
Seriously, Rikka?

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:58.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've had to ask you
half a dozen times

00:02:58.267 --> 00:03:00.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
to not call me
by my first name.

00:03:00.634 --> 00:03:03.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
What're you saying?
Don't you like "Kotoko"?

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:05.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have difficulty
saying it myself,

00:03:05.868 --> 00:03:07.367 position:24% line:89% align:start
and others do too.

00:03:08.634 --> 00:03:10.033 position:21% line:89% align:start
And because of that,

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:12.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
it just doesn't feel right
when I hear people say it.

00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:14.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's why I've always had
Kuro call me by my surname.

00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:16.367 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now I understand why he
calls you by your last name,

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:20.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
even though you're going out.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
So what?

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you saying you had doubts

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
whether Kuro and I
were actually dating?

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, that's what I've said
from the beginning.

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.200 position:35% line:89% align:start
Forget it.

00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:31.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
What did Rikka's email mean
when she said "this time."

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:32.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
I assume she'll try to make

00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:34.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
another monster
of the imagination.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
This wasn't enough
to dissuade her either.

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
But why is Rikka doing
something so horrible?

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
People's imaginations hold
an infinite amount of potential.

00:03:45.334 --> 00:03:48.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Making yokai, phantoms,
and demons too.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
We give life to monsters
without even realizing it.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:57.567 position:41% line:83% align:start
And so,
anything's possible.

00:03:57.601 --> 00:03:59.400 position:10% line:89% align:start
One might even create a god.

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:02.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
But... But that's...

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's not an answer at all.

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:09.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
What point could there be
in creating a god?

00:04:21.467 --> 00:04:22.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
You did great, Kuro!

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:25.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
After dying and coming
back to life so many times,

00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:27.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
your energy must be low.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
Time to replenish
your nutrients.

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:30.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
I got you this.

00:04:30.501 --> 00:04:34.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're the one who needs
to recharge her batteries.

00:04:34.701 --> 00:04:36.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
Creating those possibilities,

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:39.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
countless futures sent
right where I could grab them.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know more than anyone
how much energy that takes.

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:45.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now, don't be like that.
Just eat.

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:47.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it'll put Saki
at ease, too,

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:49.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
if she sees you
eating like a human.

00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:53.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
But I have one request:

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
that I get to partake
of your banana

00:04:54.968 --> 00:04:57.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
when we get back
to the hotel.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm too tired...
Please, I'm begging you.

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:03.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
No vulgar jokes like that
at a time like this.

00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:04.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
[ghost cat] Oh, glorious day!
That awful

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:07.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
[ghost cat] Steel Lady
Nanase has been vanquished!

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray!

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:33.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
Three cheers for our lady!

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:52.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's head back home.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's so important that
you couldn't let me

00:05:56.834 --> 00:05:59.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
enjoy the praise
a little bit longer?

00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:03.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's Saki.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think she's about
to have a heart attack.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] I'm sorry, Saki.

00:06:09.634 --> 00:06:12.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I'd tried to stop Rikka
just a little bit earlier,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
we might've been able
to deal with this

00:06:14.367 --> 00:06:17.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
before Detective Terada
was killed.

00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:19.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
What happened was terrible.

00:06:19.133 --> 00:06:22.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
But how could either of you
have predicted that?

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:25.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
It was out of all of our hands
in the long run.

00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:29.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your ability to determine
the future

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
isn't powerful enough
to save everyone,

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
no matter how much
you'd like it to be...

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:40.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Saki] As <i>for the spectre</i>
Steel Lady Nanase,

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:43.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>few people speak of,</i>
 <i>or believe in her, anymore.</i>

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:46.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Their interest transferred</i>

00:07:05.234 --> 00:07:07.934 position:13% line:83% align:start

 <i>different from our own.</i>

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:17.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>Like the type of story</i>

Hi, Saki.

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:58.067 position:33% line:83% align:start
Uh, hang on.
Where's Iwanaga?

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
Still asleep at the hotel.

00:08:59.868 --> 00:09:02.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
What? She's been out
for an entire day?

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:04.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
She spent the entirety

00:09:04.601 --> 00:09:05.901 position:21% line:89% align:start
overworking herself.

00:09:05.934 --> 00:09:08.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
I kinda figured
this would happen.

You should try acting
a little more concerned.

00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:12.434 position:41% line:83% align:start
I will,
when it's needed.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Kuro] You wanted to know
about Rikka, right?

00:09:16.634 --> 00:09:17.834 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:09:17.868 --> 00:09:19.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
What do you think it is
that she's after?

00:09:19.667 --> 00:09:22.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
Iwanaga changed the subject
when I asked her.

00:09:23.868 --> 00:09:24.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll tell you...

00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:26.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
After enough time,

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:29.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've accepted what's happened,
and moved on.

00:09:29.634 --> 00:09:31.033 position:33% line:89% align:start
As it stands,

00:09:31.067 --> 00:09:34.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
my body has been growing,
and aging at a normal rate.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
And while accidents
or injuries won't kill me,

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:38.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm hopeful that one day,

00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:41.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can still die from
complications of old age.

00:09:41.434 --> 00:09:43.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
In order to choose
between different futures,

00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:44.901 position:30% line:89% align:start
I have to die.

00:09:44.934 --> 00:09:48.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
And so typically, I prefer to
avoid dangerous situations.

00:09:48.634 --> 00:09:52.200 position:7% line:83% align:start
So I like to think that I'll be
able to live a normal life.

00:09:52.234 --> 00:09:54.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
 <i>Normal?</i>
 <i>Far from it...</i>

00:09:54.968 --> 00:09:56.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
But that's not
the case for Rikka.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
She'll use her ability
as much as she can

00:09:59.334 --> 00:10:02.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
in an attempt to return
to being a normal human.

00:10:03.734 --> 00:10:05.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is that even possible?

00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:09.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
Even if she used her power to go
through all available futures...

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
Finding one where
she's a normal human being?

00:10:12.701 --> 00:10:15.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
It would have to
take a miracle!

00:10:15.467 --> 00:10:16.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
 <i>That's right.</i>

00:10:16.434 --> 00:10:18.300 position:38% line:83% align:start
 <i>Back at</i>
 <i>the university hospital,</i>

00:10:18.334 --> 00:10:20.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>Rikka tried to find out</i>
 <i>if it was medically possible</i>

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>to return to normal.</i>

00:10:24.267 --> 00:10:26.767 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>In the end,</i>
 <i>logical methods provided</i>

00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:28.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>no further opportunities</i>
 <i>for her.</i>

00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:29.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>She decided to grasp</i>

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>the future she wanted</i>
 <i>for herself.</i>

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>And then what happened?</i>

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] Anything's possible...

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:39.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
One might even create a god.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.100 position:35% line:83% align:start
In essence,
Rikka aims to create

00:10:43.133 --> 00:10:45.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
a new monster of
the imagination,

00:10:45.133 --> 00:10:47.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
one strong enough
to grant her wish...

00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:50.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
And so, she'll make something
that has godly powers

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.767 position:30% line:83% align:start
just to become
a normal human being?

00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:57.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's Rikka, so I'm sure
she'll do whatever it takes.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't know what
she's thinking.

00:11:01.267 --> 00:11:06.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
She wants to be normal,
but always acts abnormally.

00:11:06.868 --> 00:11:08.100 position:35% line:89% align:start
Back then,

00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:10.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
before she consumed
yokai flesh,

00:11:10.767 --> 00:11:12.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
I can't help but think

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
that she may have always
been a monster at heart.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
And the toughest part of it...

00:11:19.767 --> 00:11:21.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
is that you still
love her, right?

00:11:21.734 --> 00:11:23.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
It makes things difficult.

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:26.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
So what's next?

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
Rikka's going to keep trying
to make a monster, isn't she?

00:11:29.868 --> 00:11:32.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
But Iwanaga won't let her.

00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:35.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
No matter who tries,
no matter the reason

00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:38.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
anyone creating a monster
for their own desires...

00:11:38.734 --> 00:11:40.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
goes against the natural order.

00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:42.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's basically the reason

00:11:42.434 --> 00:11:45.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
she sacrificed her
right eye and left leg.

00:11:47.534 --> 00:11:51.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
It sounds like you're not
going to let it slide either.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
As much as I hate to admit it,
I think you're right...

00:11:58.434 --> 00:12:01.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, my phone number...
Did you end up deleting it?

00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:02.667 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:04.634 position:13% line:89% align:start
Iwanaga nagged me about it.

00:12:04.667 --> 00:12:06.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
No way you could've kept it.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's not the type
to let that slide.

00:12:09.734 --> 00:12:12.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes, but what's the harm?

00:12:12.267 --> 00:12:15.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's not like we could just
start all over, could we?

00:12:16.567 --> 00:12:17.834 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:12:17.868 --> 00:12:22.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
Seeing you after all this time
just proved it's impossible.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
I feel okay sitting across
the table from you,

00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:28.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
but even still, I'd be
a bit hesitant to touch you.

00:12:28.567 --> 00:12:29.834 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Kuro.

00:12:29.868 --> 00:12:31.200 position:47% line:89% align:start
No,

00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:35.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
it's all my fault for keeping it
a secret from you.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:38.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's all right.
Just take care of Iwanaga.

00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:38.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
I already do.

00:12:39.834 --> 00:12:43.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
Iwanaga's never cared much
about the danger she's in.

00:12:43.868 --> 00:12:45.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
I am an immortal,

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:47.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
yet she's more fearless
than I am.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's been injured
several times

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
trying to resolve conflicts
between angry monsters.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
If I'm being perfectly honest,

00:12:57.133 --> 00:13:00.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
I didn't want to involve her
in the Rikka problem.

00:13:00.133 --> 00:13:03.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wanted to deal with it
before she got involved.

00:13:04.133 --> 00:13:06.000 position:7% line:89% align:start
But after this little incident,

00:13:06.033 --> 00:13:07.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
Rikka's come to
the realization that

00:13:07.634 --> 00:13:13.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
Iwanaga is the biggest obstacle
and all that stands in her way.

00:13:13.133 --> 00:13:15.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
Which means that
Rikka's next step

00:13:15.067 --> 00:13:17.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
might be to go after
Iwanaga herself.

00:13:18.901 --> 00:13:21.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>That hadn't even</i>
 <i>crossed my mind.</i>

00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:23.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>Considering Rikka's</i>
 <i>capabilities,</i>

00:13:23.868 --> 00:13:26.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>if she thinks</i>
 <i>Iwanaga is in her way...</i>

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
So that's why you came
looking for Rikka

00:13:29.534 --> 00:13:31.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
without telling Iwanaga.

00:13:31.067 --> 00:13:32.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
Though I'm sure
if you had told her,

00:13:32.534 --> 00:13:35.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
then Iwanaga definitely
would've gotten involved.

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:37.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
I won't let Iwanaga die.

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:41.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
After all, she's someone
who deserves to be happy.

00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:46.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>Now, I feel like I can</i>
 <i>finally get some closure.</i>

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.334 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>I doubt that</i>
 <i>I'll ever see him again.</i>

00:13:51.467 --> 00:13:52.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Saki] Are you sure?

00:13:52.534 --> 00:13:54.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're really just
giving me this bike?

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:55.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
Iwanaga bought this thing

00:13:55.767 --> 00:13:58.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
so she could get around
the city.

00:13:58.033 --> 00:13:59.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
It'd be a pain
to take it with us,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
so Iwanaga said
she wanted you to have it.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.501 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, she also
asked me to tell you...

00:14:04.534 --> 00:14:07.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
she told the monsters around
the city to leave you alone.

00:14:07.767 --> 00:14:09.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
Another gift.

00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:11.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
Tell her thanks...

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>Doesn't make me</i>
 <i>feel much better...</i>

00:14:14.968 --> 00:14:16.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll see you around!

00:14:30.133 --> 00:14:32.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>I still get scared at night.</i>

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
 <i>But now...</i>

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>I know someone's protecting</i>
 <i>the order of things.</i>

00:14:47.534 --> 00:14:52.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>I feel a sense of peace...</i>
 <i>our world's in capable hands.</i>

00:15:10.901 --> 00:15:12.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] I messed up again!

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
I keep making mistake
after mistake!

00:15:15.133 --> 00:15:18.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't believe I slept
for a day and a half...

00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:20.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh wow! Is it still
only six o'clock?

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
I feel pretty refreshed for
only having slept four hours...

00:15:23.634 --> 00:15:25.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wait, September sixth?

00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:28.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did I seriously just sleep
for twenty-eight hours?!

00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:29.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>I'm such an idiot!</i>

00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:31.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>I can't believe I gave</i>
 <i>Kuro and Saki</i>

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.601 position:33% line:83% align:start
 <i>so much time</i>
 <i>to spend alone together!</i>

00:15:37.634 --> 00:15:39.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>Biggest screw-up of my life!</i>

00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:43.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
Iwanaga?

00:15:44.767 --> 00:15:46.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, where'd she go?

00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:47.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
Just a sec!

00:15:49.467 --> 00:15:50.834 position:35% line:89% align:start
My face...

00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:52.200 position:35% line:89% align:start
Found her.

00:15:54.534 --> 00:15:56.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't rush on my account.

00:15:57.267 --> 00:15:58.801 position:21% line:89% align:start
If you need the rest,

00:15:58.834 --> 00:16:01.067 position:30% line:83% align:start
we can probably
book another night.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
You reek of Saki!

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:08.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's impossible.

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:10.701 position:24% line:89% align:start
I know you saw her!

00:16:10.734 --> 00:16:12.367 position:41% line:83% align:start
I did.
Just like you wanted.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
You said we should
give the bicycle to Saki.

00:16:15.133 --> 00:16:16.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
I figured the sooner
the better.

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:18.701 position:19% line:89% align:start
And I had time to kill.

00:16:18.734 --> 00:16:21.000 position:35% line:83% align:start
Well, yes,
I did say that, but...

00:16:21.033 --> 00:16:23.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
How'd you get her number?

00:16:23.033 --> 00:16:24.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
On the way back in the car
the other night,

00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:27.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
we exchanged contact info...

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.334 position:33% line:83% align:start
But I already
deleted it from my phone.

00:16:30.367 --> 00:16:32.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
Saki and I are
only friends now, anyway.

00:16:32.868 --> 00:16:34.834 position:10% line:89% align:start
That isn't the problem here!

00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:36.634 position:35% line:83% align:start
You need to
dry yourself off first.

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:38.033 position:21% line:89% align:start
You'll catch a cold.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wait! What are you doing,
you maniac?!

00:16:43.634 --> 00:16:46.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
Cut it out! This is
my only clean shirt!

00:16:48.767 --> 00:16:50.434 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just give in, damn it!

00:16:54.834 --> 00:16:56.400 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] Thanks for everything.

00:16:56.434 --> 00:16:59.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
[receptionist] Thank you.
We hope you enjoyed your stay.

00:17:03.834 --> 00:17:05.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
So are you still angry?

00:17:05.234 --> 00:17:09.234 position:33% line:83% align:start
No, I'm not.
I was simply reflecting.

00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:12.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
I should've been awake and alert
after twelve hours of sleep.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
Clearly, I need to work on
increasing my endurance.

00:17:25.634 --> 00:17:26.868 position:33% line:89% align:start
Take a taxi?

00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:29.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
The station isn't very far.
We can walk.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
It looks like
it's going to rain.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm going to get stuck
sitting around on a bench

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
as you take another nap,
aren't I?

00:17:36.868 --> 00:17:38.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even I couldn't possibly
doze off

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
after sleeping for 28 hours,
Mister Smarty-Pants!

00:17:44.467 --> 00:17:45.634 position:44% line:89% align:start
Kuro.

00:17:45.667 --> 00:17:48.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Something tells me Rikka
won't try to make another move

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:49.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the immediate future...

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I'm going to get
the word out

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
to monsters across
the country

00:17:53.133 --> 00:17:56.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
to let me know if they see
anything out of the ordinary.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.100 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course,
I'd rather not go through

00:17:58.133 --> 00:17:59.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
all that trouble again.

00:17:59.868 --> 00:18:01.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
The best way to handle
this situation

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
is to find her
and talk face to face.

00:18:03.033 --> 00:18:04.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
And going forward,

00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:06.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
when you come across
any new information,

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
please don't act without
telling me about it first, okay?

00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:10.701 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll keep that in mind.

00:18:10.734 --> 00:18:11.868 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, will you?

00:18:11.901 --> 00:18:13.267 position:35% line:89% align:start
Iwanaga...

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
You knew about the Kuebiko.

00:18:15.868 --> 00:18:17.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
You must know about
Princess Iwanaga.

00:18:17.968 --> 00:18:19.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
From the Kojiki.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's phonetically the same
as my surname,

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:24.000 position:33% line:83% align:start
so naturally,
I'd know about it.

00:18:25.067 --> 00:18:26.934 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] Princess Iwanaga.

00:18:26.968 --> 00:18:29.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
Princess Konohana-no-Sakuya's
older sister.

00:18:29.133 --> 00:18:30.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
They were both given
in marriage

00:18:30.567 --> 00:18:33.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
to Ninigi-no-Mikoto,
descendant of Amaterasu.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
But Ninigi-no-Mikoto
only married

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
Princess Konohana-no-Sakuya

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
and sent Princess Iwanaga
back home.

00:18:40.968 --> 00:18:43.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
That decision enraged
the princesses' father,

00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:45.434 position:27% line:89% align:start
Lord Oyamatsumi.

00:18:45.467 --> 00:18:47.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
I had a specific reason
in mind,

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
when I sent you both sisters,
you ingrate!

00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:51.000 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just as the "iwa," or "rock"

00:18:51.033 --> 00:18:52.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
in Princess Iwanaga's name
suggests,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
she was able to bear life
as eternal as stone...

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
which never changes,
month to month, year after year.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
But because Ninigi-no-Mikoto
didn't marry her

00:19:01.868 --> 00:19:03.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
and returned her to her father,

00:19:03.868 --> 00:19:05.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
he and his line had short lives,

00:19:05.534 --> 00:19:08.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
scattered about like
flower petals in the wind.

00:19:08.834 --> 00:19:10.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
They all became mortal.

00:19:11.834 --> 00:19:13.200 position:24% line:89% align:start
You get it, right?

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
As someone who's immortal,

00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:18.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't belong
with Princess Sakuya.

00:19:18.868 --> 00:19:21.300 position:41% line:83% align:start
I need
Princess Iwanaga instead.

00:19:25.801 --> 00:19:28.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sure that sounded really
smooth inside your head,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
but you know the actual reason

00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:33.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
why Princess Iwanaga
was returned home, don't you?

00:19:33.467 --> 00:19:35.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about
minor details...

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:36.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's not minor!

00:19:36.767 --> 00:19:39.567 position:5% line:83% align:start
The real reason Princess Iwanaga
was sent back to her father

00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:41.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
was because she was ugly!

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
You couldn't have chosen
a worse metaphor

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
to try and impress a girl!

00:19:45.501 --> 00:19:46.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
But not you.

00:19:46.601 --> 00:19:47.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're pretty as a flower,

00:19:47.801 --> 00:19:51.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
only a complete fool
would think of sending you away.

00:20:13.634 --> 00:20:14.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
However you meant it,

00:20:14.868 --> 00:20:18.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
judging someone by their
physical appearance is boorish.

00:20:20.234 --> 00:20:22.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're just some
yokai/human hybrid.

00:20:22.968 --> 00:20:25.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
Stop trying to sound so cool.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kuro, will you be staying
at my place tonight?

00:20:44.801 --> 00:20:46.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
My parents want to see you.

00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:47.634 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah,

00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:50.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
I still need to apologize
for inconveniencing them.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no need to be
so formal.

00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:54.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
I want you to think of them
and the house

00:20:54.767 --> 00:20:56.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
as if they were your own.

00:20:56.234 --> 00:20:57.133 position:38% line:89% align:start
I can't.

00:20:57.167 --> 00:20:59.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not ready to get
fenced in just yet.

00:21:01.133 --> 00:21:04.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you honestly think you still
have a say in the matter?

00:21:15.267 --> 00:21:19.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
