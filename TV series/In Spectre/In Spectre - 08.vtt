[Saki] <i>The first time</i>
 <i>I met her, I knew instantly...</i>

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>This woman must've been</i>
 <i>Kuro's first love.</i>

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:26.300 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.133 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Rikka]
She seems nice, Kuro.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is my girlfriend
Saki Yumihara.

00:00:37.868 --> 00:00:39.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
We go to the same college.

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:41.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's nice to meet you!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm heading to
the cafÃ© downstairs.

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:47.834 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:47.868 --> 00:00:49.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
I think I'm in the way here.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just wanted a chance
to say hello.

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:53.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
So you can take
your time, okay?

00:00:53.868 --> 00:00:55.267 position:35% line:89% align:start
Excuse me.

00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:04.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>She's important to Kuro...</i>

00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:08.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>But she felt "off"...</i>

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>Like she was somehow...</i>

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>silently corrupting</i>
 <i>those around her.</i>

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:14.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>That's how she seemed.</i>

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:16.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
[woman] I hear
Miss Sakuragawa was taken

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
to the operating room
again yesterday.

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:21.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
[woman 2] Really?
She tried suicide again?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even if it was another attempt
to take her own life,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.534 position:30% line:89% align:start
she's not dead.

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:28.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I'd say it's doubtful
she has very long to live.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
She was tying you down,
and you couldn't see it.

00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:37.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
But if going out with Iwanaga

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
will help you break free
of that...

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think it's a good thing,
despite conflicted feelings.

00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:49.968 position:35% line:83% align:start
Look, Saki,
I do love Rikka, of course.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
And I might be tied down...

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:56.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
But sometimes, I also wish
she wasn't around.

00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:58.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are you saying?

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:01.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
I...thought Rikka
had passed away?

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:04.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
Rikka hasn't passed away, no...

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:06.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
That simply isn't possible.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.801 position:35% line:83% align:start
After all,
Rikka is my flesh and blood.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:14.100 position:41% line:89% align:start
[shock]

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:17.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>Don't tell me</i>
 <i>she's also like Kuro...</i>

00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:30.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
[opening music]

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:51.901 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>I screwed up...</i>

00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:54.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>I can't believe</i>
 <i>I messed up so bad.</i>

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>How could I be dumb enough</i>
 <i>to create time</i>

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>for Kuro and Saki to be</i>
 <i>alone together?!</i>

00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:00.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>What in the world happened?</i>

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:03.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Why are things so awkward</i>
 <i>between them now?!</i>

00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:04.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
Iwanaga.

00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:05.100 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:07.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
Here, in case you need
to refuel.

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:09.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's about time for

00:04:09.934 --> 00:04:13.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase to
make her appearance.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I'm here, the ayakashi
that come to tell you

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
about Steel Lady Nanase
might get scared away.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
Saki, I'll be waiting
over here by the exit.

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:22.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right. Then I guess

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll be waiting for news
in the car with Iwanaga.

00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:28.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>Someone Saki was friends</i>
 <i>with has been murdered,</i>

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>and now she and Kuro,</i>
 <i>who's such a nice guy...</i>

00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:33.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>They are a man and woman</i>

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:35.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>who planned to get married</i>
 <i>at one point.</i>

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:37.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>I was fast asleep</i>
 <i>in the hotel</i>

00:04:37.234 --> 00:04:38.968 position:35% line:83% align:start
 <i>for about</i>
 <i>an hour and a half.</i>

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>Ninety minutes.</i>

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>You could do a lot</i>
 <i>in ninety minutes...</i>

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.400 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>And I mean a lot! Especially</i>
 <i>when they're young...</i>

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:48.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
[shriek]

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:49.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Saki] Iwanaga.

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:52.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
Have you ever met Rikka,
by chance?

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, I've met her...

00:04:54.868 --> 00:04:57.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
The hospital where Rikka
was admitted

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.801 position:30% line:83% align:start
was also where
I was staying for a time.

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:02.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
I see. So you know
that she also ate

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:05.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
the flesh of a kudan
and a mermaid.

00:05:05.334 --> 00:05:08.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>Kuro mentioned that</i>
 <i>Rikka's condition was something</i>

00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:11.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>he never wanted Saki to</i>
 <i>have to worry about...</i>

00:05:11.434 --> 00:05:13.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
 <i>Is she trying to get me</i>
 <i>to spill something?</i>

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, very well.

00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:17.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, that I know,

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:20.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
because Rikka is also
terrifying to the monsters.

00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:23.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
Though neither she nor Kuro
have told me the details...

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
she was apparently
hospitalized long-term

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
so that her body and abilities
could be thoroughly examined.

00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:31.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>That's what it was?</i>

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
And how is she lately?

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:36.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
Rikka had been living
in my mansion

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
up until about a month ago.

00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:39.767 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:39.801 --> 00:05:41.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
She was discharged
rather suddenly

00:05:41.734 --> 00:05:43.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
at the beginning of the year.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
But why would she go
to your house?

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
As his girlfriend,
I'd have to be out of my mind

00:05:47.834 --> 00:05:51.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
to let Rikka and Kuro
live together.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:55.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
A new director was appointed,
and Rikka was soon discharged.

00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:57.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
The political climate of
the new administration

00:05:57.133 --> 00:05:59.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
did not work in her favor.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.434 position:7% line:83% align:start
After all, the hospital really
didn't know what to do with her

00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:03.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the long run...

00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:07.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure there were many there
who were happy to see her go.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
For whatever reason,
perhaps because of

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
that general sense of relief
from her leaving,

00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:14.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
there were rumors that Rikka
didn't have long to live.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.067 position:7% line:83% align:start
[director] So what do you say?
Exciting, huh?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
How do you feel about
leaving the hospital?

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
[doctor] Do you think it's wise
to say it that way?

00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:22.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
What if she resists?

00:06:22.434 --> 00:06:25.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then I'm afraid we'll be
left without a choice.

00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:27.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Rikka] All right.
I understand.

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:31.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd like to thank you
for all you've done.

00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:34.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
I still need to get
my things together,

00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:36.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
so could you call
my cousin Kuro?

00:06:37.767 --> 00:06:38.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
Rikka.

00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:39.467 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:41.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
Given the suddenness
of your discharge,

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
have you found a place
to stay yet?

00:06:43.634 --> 00:06:44.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not as of yet.

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:45.601 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:48.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you think I could stay
at your place for a while?

00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:50.968 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
No, you can't!
My place is really small!

00:06:53.734 --> 00:06:54.567 position:41% line:89% align:start
So, no?

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.601 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:06:56.734 --> 00:06:58.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
What if I promised
to do housework?

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:00.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
W-What?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>Welcome home, Kuro.</i>

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:09.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
 <i>Your bath is ready, Kuro.</i>

00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:12.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>Goodnight. Sweet dreams.</i>

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.501 position:33% line:83% align:start
What's wrong?
Did I say something strange?

00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:20.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
No! But, it's just...
I only have the one bed...

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.067 position:35% line:83% align:start
Well yeah,
you live on your own.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
Right! Which is why...

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've got it! I'll talk
to Iwanaga about it.

00:07:28.334 --> 00:07:30.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
Iwanaga's folks know
a lot of people,

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:33.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
so they might be able
to come up with something.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
You don't have to go
through all that.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
If I can't stay with you,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
I could always sleep
in a park...

00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:38.968 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Iwanaga?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's something
I wanted to run by you.

00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:42.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, Kuro! What's up?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's unusual for you to
turn to me for help.

00:07:45.267 --> 00:07:47.200 position:35% line:83% align:start
- <i>You see--</i>
 <i>-H</i> old on.

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:49.634 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:52.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'll need to charge</i>
 <i>a consultation fee.</i>

00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:56.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Goddess of Wisdom is
charging for consultations?

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
Indeed. But depending
upon the client,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd much prefer favors
or offerings over cash.

00:08:01.234 --> 00:08:03.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry,
I won't ask for much.

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:06.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
But what if the discussion
were to involve you, as well?

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.334 position:38% line:83% align:start
Tell me,
where are you right now?

00:08:09.467 --> 00:08:10.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
The special lecture,

00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:12.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
the one you wanted to attend
at the university?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's happening right now.

00:08:15.267 --> 00:08:17.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>Yet you've chosen</i>
 <i>to call me instead,</i>

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:20.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
 <i>and ask me for</i>
 <i>a favor of some kind.</i>

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:21.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
- <i>This is no ordinary matter.</i>
-Huh?

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:23.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
-And that very familiar
- <i>The time is now 5:00 PM.</i>

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
-recording I hear
- <i>Please be aware that</i>

00:08:25.334 --> 00:08:26.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
-over the phone tells me you're
- <i>visitations will conclude</i>

00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:28.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
-at the hospital right now.
- <i>in an hour.</i>

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
Which means that whatever
you're about to ask me

00:08:30.934 --> 00:08:32.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
has to do with Rikka.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>All the more reason</i>
 <i>I should be allowed</i>

00:08:35.934 --> 00:08:37.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>to be a bit forceful</i>
 <i>about this.</i>

00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:40.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
But don't you worry, Kuro.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't ask for anything
too difficult.

00:08:44.868 --> 00:08:46.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
What're your conditions?

00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:48.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
You'll let me have
the spare key

00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:49.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
to your apartment.

00:08:50.367 --> 00:08:51.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't be stupid.

00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:53.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's so stupid about
your girlfriend asking

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
for the spare key
to your apartment?!

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's not like I'm planning
to do anything unacceptable.

00:08:58.367 --> 00:09:00.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>Wouldn't it be lovely</i>

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:04.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:09:04.467 --> 00:09:05.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:08.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>Welcome back home, Kuro!</i>

00:09:08.868 --> 00:09:10.100 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>I didn't cut corners</i>

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>preparing your meals</i>

00:09:14.901 --> 00:09:17.167 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>Co-sleep! Co-sleep!</i>

00:09:18.868 --> 00:09:21.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
Kuro! I found
a nice place to stay.

00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:22.334 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:24.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
This place here.

00:09:26.467 --> 00:09:27.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
 <i>Okay, fine.</i>

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:30.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'll give you my key,</i>
 <i>so just help me out.</i>

00:09:30.067 --> 00:09:31.801 position:19% line:89% align:start
This makes me so happy.

00:09:31.834 --> 00:09:32.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
After so much waiting,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.467 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm finally
your common-law wife!

00:09:35.501 --> 00:09:36.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
 <i>Yeah, no.</i>

00:09:36.434 --> 00:09:38.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] And so, I went
to the hospital

00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:39.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
to pick them up immediately,

00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:42.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
and Rikka left the only home
she'd known for years.

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:45.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
So, anyway...

00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:47.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
We had plenty of
vacant rooms available,

00:09:47.834 --> 00:09:49.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
so we welcomed her
into our home.

00:09:49.567 --> 00:09:51.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
And since she was
a mysterious patient

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
who had been in the hospital
for half a decade...

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:56.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
once she left, rumors spread
that she had passed away.

00:09:56.934 --> 00:09:58.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>And those rumors were</i>
 <i>somehow able</i>

00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:00.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
 <i>to make their way to me?</i>

00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:02.834 position:35% line:83% align:start
In reality,
she was doing rather well.

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:04.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not only is Rikka
quite beautiful,

00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:06.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
but she's also well-mannered,

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:09.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
so my aunt welcomed her
with open arms.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
So what, you mean Rikka
didn't hate you?

00:10:12.067 --> 00:10:15.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why do you just have to assume
that Rikka hated me?

00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:17.100 position:35% line:89% align:start
[irritated]

00:10:17.133 --> 00:10:20.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
I first met Rikka when she was
still in the hospital...

00:10:23.334 --> 00:10:26.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kuro, I don't think
she's a good match for you.

00:10:31.834 --> 00:10:33.200 position:38% line:89% align:start
I agree!

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's cringe worthy.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.567 position:41% line:83% align:start
I know.
It was a personal low-point.

00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:40.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
The best part was when
Rikka scrambled

00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:42.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
to remedy the situation.

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:43.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
I mean, she's not good
for you,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
but she might not be
the worst for you, either.

00:10:45.734 --> 00:10:48.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
You actually made Rikka
feel bad about something?

00:10:48.767 --> 00:10:50.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah, you bet I did.

00:10:50.267 --> 00:10:52.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
After that, we made up,
and occasionally went out,

00:10:52.868 --> 00:10:54.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
just the two of us.

00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:56.067 position:7% line:83% align:start
We even threw birthday parties
for each other...

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
with cake, of course!

00:10:57.467 --> 00:10:58.801 position:30% line:89% align:start
You and Rikka?!

00:10:58.834 --> 00:11:00.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
 <i>Happy birthday!</i>

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:03.868 position:35% line:89% align:start
 <i>Thank you!</i>

00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:05.434 position:38% line:89% align:start
 <i>Hooray!</i>

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well then, what is Rikka
up to now?

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:12.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
You said she was at your place
until a month ago, right?

00:11:12.167 --> 00:11:14.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're not sure where she is.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.067 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.534 position:33% line:83% align:start
A month ago,
she told my parents

00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:19.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
that she had finally found
a job and a new place to stay,

00:11:19.767 --> 00:11:21.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
and she left immediately
thereafter.

00:11:21.868 --> 00:11:23.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
We couldn't contact her
on her cell,

00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:25.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the new address
and workplace

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:26.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
she'd given us were fake.

00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:30.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
And what did Kuro do after
he heard about it?

00:11:30.534 --> 00:11:31.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kuro went berserk
and pushed me down,

00:11:31.767 --> 00:11:33.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
onto the bed...

00:11:33.334 --> 00:11:36.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
and used my young body
to vent his frustrations...

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:38.200 position:27% line:89% align:start
Answer seriously.

00:11:38.234 --> 00:11:38.868 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:11:38.901 --> 00:11:40.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
Nothing, at first.

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:42.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
He just said that Rikka
probably had something

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:44.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
very different in mind.

00:11:44.634 --> 00:11:45.701 position:21% line:89% align:start
But two weeks later,

00:11:45.734 --> 00:11:48.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
he started trying to get
a hold of her repeatedly,

00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:52.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
then he sent me a single
message before disappearing.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
So tell me, Saki,
what's bothering you?

00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:57.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
What did you and Kuro
talk about at the hotel

00:11:57.767 --> 00:11:59.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
while I was still sleeping?

00:11:59.901 --> 00:12:02.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
It didn't take you long
to realize

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
that Rikka was behind
Steel Lady Nanase.

00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:07.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kuro didn't come
to Makurazaka City

00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:09.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
because you called for him.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
He was here looking
for Rikka.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Something must've
gotten Kuro and Saki

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
 <i>talking about Rikka.</i>

00:12:16.467 --> 00:12:19.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>Well, not like I really care</i>
 <i>if she found out about it.</i>

00:12:19.534 --> 00:12:23.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>But that must mean nothing</i>
 <i>happened between them.</i>

00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:25.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>Guess I can relax.</i>

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why did you keep that
information from me?

00:12:28.167 --> 00:12:30.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because I still don't have
any proof.

00:12:30.267 --> 00:12:32.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even when she was staying over
at my place,

00:12:32.434 --> 00:12:34.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
Rikka would mess with
the computer a lot,

00:12:34.467 --> 00:12:37.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I never actually looked
at what she was doing.

00:12:37.334 --> 00:12:40.133 position:10% line:83% align:start
I never would've assumed that
she was keeping herself busy

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:42.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
by creating a wiki page and

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
bringing Steel Lady Nanase
to life.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I didn't really know
about Steel Lady Nanase

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
until the monsters came
to talk to me about her.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
I only came to the realization
that Rikka was involved

00:12:54.133 --> 00:12:55.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
when I was doing
some research and

00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:58.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
saw the picture on
the wiki page.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wait, you mean the picture
on the main page?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.767 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, precisely.

00:13:03.801 --> 00:13:07.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
That image was painted in
the same style that Rikka uses.

00:13:20.434 --> 00:13:23.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] I'd say it was about
a year ago...

00:13:23.267 --> 00:13:26.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
She suddenly became
very serious about painting.

00:13:27.968 --> 00:13:29.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
Looking back on it now,

00:13:29.334 --> 00:13:31.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
I believe Rikka
fully intended to create

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
a monster of the imagination
even back then.

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:35.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
In order to consolidate

00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:37.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
hundreds of thousands
of fantasies,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
and give them a shared vision
of a monster,

00:13:39.767 --> 00:13:42.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
name and shape are key.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
The most effective way
to do so would be

00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:45.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
to illustrate the story.

00:13:45.634 --> 00:13:47.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
Once its visualized,
everyone would have

00:13:47.968 --> 00:13:50.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
the same specific image
in mind.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure Karin Nanase's
accident gave her

00:13:52.834 --> 00:13:55.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
the perfect material
to work with.

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:57.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
Karin was an idol
in the public eye.

00:13:57.734 --> 00:13:59.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
She was involved
in a dark scandal

00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:01.701 position:7% line:89% align:start
and died a very dramatic death.

00:14:01.734 --> 00:14:04.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
Add a ghost to the mix and
it has ample opportunity

00:14:04.934 --> 00:14:08.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
to evolve into a yokai
or an urban legend.

00:14:08.133 --> 00:14:09.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
There might've already
been rumors

00:14:09.868 --> 00:14:11.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
of the ghost of Karin Nanase

00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:12.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
appearing in the city
she died in...

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
But the one who
amplified them and

00:14:14.601 --> 00:14:18.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
gave them a unified vision,
was Rikka.

00:14:19.367 --> 00:14:22.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm assuming the one
who gave her the name

00:14:22.534 --> 00:14:23.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
"Steel Lady Nanase" and

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
made up the accompanying
stories was also Rikka.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.300 position:33% line:83% align:start
Kuro came to
this realization as well.

00:14:30.334 --> 00:14:32.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
While he was trying
to track Rikka down,

00:14:32.434 --> 00:14:34.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
he heard rumors
about Steel Lady Nanase

00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:36.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
and sensed something.

00:14:36.033 --> 00:14:38.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
After seeing the picture
on Steel Lady Nanase's wiki,

00:14:38.934 --> 00:14:41.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
he knew for sure,
and came here.

00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:45.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
Saki, you're someone who
decided to live your entire life

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
seeing only the real world.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
Knowing what lies
in the shadows,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
what will you do now?

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
Kuro probably didn't tell you
because he didn't want

00:14:53.133 --> 00:14:55.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
to get you any further involved
in this mess

00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:56.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
than you already were.

00:14:56.634 --> 00:14:57.901 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Saki] I see.

00:14:57.934 --> 00:15:00.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's because Rikka,
was pulling the strings,

00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:03.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
with the same kudan ability
that Kuro uses...

00:15:03.267 --> 00:15:07.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
Thus allowing Steel Lady Nanase
to mature more quickly.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
Most likely.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
Rikka may have died
over and over again

00:15:10.234 --> 00:15:11.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
to find the future
where the internet

00:15:11.701 --> 00:15:14.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
wouldn't stop talking
about the Steel Lady,

00:15:14.801 --> 00:15:16.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
and then Rikka resurrected.

00:15:17.767 --> 00:15:19.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
But why would she do that?

00:15:19.434 --> 00:15:21.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
What good comes out of
creating a monster

00:15:21.767 --> 00:15:23.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
that kills indiscriminately?

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:26.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
Rikka has the power
to determine the future,

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:29.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
but it's not as impressive
as it sounds.

00:15:29.767 --> 00:15:31.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kuro always says
the same thing.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
He can only choose futures
that are available,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
and within the scope of his own
talents, potential, and effort.

00:15:37.534 --> 00:15:41.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
Which means he's not all that
different from a normal person.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
But she successfully
created a monster.

00:15:43.834 --> 00:15:45.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's probably testing
her limits,

00:15:45.434 --> 00:15:47.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
trying to find out
just how far she can go

00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:51.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
with her ability
to decide the future.

00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:54.067 position:35% line:83% align:start
She stacks
possibility upon possibility

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
and chosen future
on chosen future.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you take a phenomenon that
has a fifty-fifty chance,

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
and make it happen
ten times in a row...

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
you get something that has
a probability of 1 in 1,024.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
You can toss a coin and

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
have it come up heads
10,000 times in a row.

00:16:10.167 --> 00:16:12.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
Normally, the Steel Lady
would have little chance

00:16:12.767 --> 00:16:14.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
of coming to life,

00:16:14.067 --> 00:16:16.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
but she's one of
those possible variations.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not like you can
get anywhere

00:16:24.033 --> 00:16:26.033 position:19% line:89% align:start
by creating a monster.

00:16:27.567 --> 00:16:29.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
[goblin cat] My lady.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
That infernal Steel Lady
has appeared.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please do allow me
to guide you there.

00:16:34.634 --> 00:16:36.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's just a little goblin cat.

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:38.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no reason
to be afraid.

00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:40.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's time to go, Saki.

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:42.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
So weird...

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:45.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
We'll have to put Rikka's goals
aside for now and

00:16:45.033 --> 00:16:48.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
concentrate on defeating
Steel Lady Nanase.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.033 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Whatever Rikka's goal
may be,

00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:53.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
it doesn't change anything.

[Rikka] Tonight...

00:17:25.133 --> 00:17:29.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Definitely. It's time.
I need to have more.

00:18:30.701 --> 00:18:32.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase all night.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just because he has
the power to come back to life,

00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:36.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
doesn't mean I want
to watch my boyfriend

00:18:36.734 --> 00:18:38.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
get killed over and over again.

00:18:39.334 --> 00:18:41.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've just connected to
the wiki page.

00:18:44.033 --> 00:18:46.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
All the posts that had
settled down for a while

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
are starting to
pick up again.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
After what happened
to the detective,

00:18:50.067 --> 00:18:51.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sure people want
more information

00:18:51.934 --> 00:18:53.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
and to provide
their own theories.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
But if the person managing
the site is Rikka,

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
couldn't she simply censor
what you post,

00:18:58.834 --> 00:19:01.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
or even delete it outright?

00:19:01.133 --> 00:19:03.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
I really don't think
that she'd do that.

00:19:03.467 --> 00:19:05.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
If she censors or
deletes any posts

00:19:05.467 --> 00:19:07.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
concerning doubts
about the story,

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
that'll give the impression
that the admin

00:19:09.334 --> 00:19:12.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
has some kind of problem
with those sorts of statements.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Which would force
many users to believe

00:19:16.234 --> 00:19:18.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
that these posts are
being censored

00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:20.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
because the ghost
doesn't actually exist.

00:19:21.467 --> 00:19:23.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
That would be disadvantageous
for someone who is trying

00:19:23.534 --> 00:19:27.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
to make Steel Lady Nanase
manifest into our reality.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
So she has no choice

00:19:30.234 --> 00:19:33.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
but to leave all the posts
on the wiki page alone.

00:19:35.834 --> 00:19:36.767 position:33% line:89% align:start
Fair enough.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.133 position:33% line:89% align:start
At the hotel,

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:40.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
you'd mentioned that you
came up with four solutions.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
But doesn't it all
come down to numbers?

00:19:42.868 --> 00:19:44.200 position:7% line:89% align:start
Sometimes, that's all you need

00:19:44.234 --> 00:19:45.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
for lies to break
through the truth

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.400 position:35% line:83% align:start
and create
a new reality altogether.

00:19:49.968 --> 00:19:51.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
The discussion
we're about to start on

00:19:51.767 --> 00:19:53.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
the Steel Lady Nanase
wiki page...

00:19:53.133 --> 00:19:55.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
might resemble
a committee to discuss

00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:56.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
a proposed bill in
a parliament,

00:19:56.801 --> 00:19:58.167 position:7% line:89% align:start
a company's board of directors,

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
or a foundation's
board of trustees.

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:03.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
The matter being raised
for discussion is

00:20:03.801 --> 00:20:05.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
if the ghost named
Steel Lady Nanase

00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:07.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
truly exists or doesn't.

00:20:09.367 --> 00:20:11.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
Rikka's work has already
gained majority support,

00:20:11.801 --> 00:20:14.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
and she has enough data
and a well-grounded argument

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.767 position:35% line:83% align:start
to support
her creation's existence.

00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:18.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
So will I be able to overturn
the majority opinion

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
and win the vote?

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
This is where my true skills
start to really shine.

00:20:23.868 --> 00:20:25.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
If she's already won over
most opinions,

00:20:25.968 --> 00:20:27.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
won't it be nearly impossible
to reverse?

00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:29.367 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.834 position:7% line:83% align:start
If this was a normal parliament
or board of directors,

00:20:31.868 --> 00:20:33.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
those with voting rights

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
would have banded together,
forming alliances.

00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:38.734 position:7% line:83% align:start
And there are too many risks in
declaring the opposite opinion

00:20:38.767 --> 00:20:39.934 position:21% line:89% align:start
at the eleventh hour.

00:20:39.968 --> 00:20:41.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
Instead, the ones who have

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
the voting rights
in this committee

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
are the people viewing
the site.

00:20:45.167 --> 00:20:46.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tens of thousands of people

00:20:46.634 --> 00:20:48.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
who have almost no relation
to each other.

00:20:48.868 --> 00:20:50.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
Their opinions are everything.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:54.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Saki] Irresponsible judges who
have no idea they're involved.

00:20:54.434 --> 00:20:56.767 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's scary
in and of itself.

00:20:56.801 --> 00:20:57.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
Certainly.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
But if you look at it
another way,

00:20:59.901 --> 00:21:02.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
this assembly bears
no responsibility.

00:21:02.033 --> 00:21:03.300 position:10% line:89% align:start
Nothing will hold them back.

00:21:03.334 --> 00:21:06.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not the law, or justice,
or even the truth itself.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.067 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even if the solution arrived at
is unjust or simply untrue...

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
we win, as long as the majority

00:21:13.133 --> 00:21:15.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
of the ten-thousand-plus
site viewers support it.

00:21:15.901 --> 00:21:17.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
If we present a plausible story

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
that fits with enough
of the facts,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
and is interesting enough...

00:21:20.467 --> 00:21:22.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
the masses will irresponsibly
support it,

00:21:22.934 --> 00:21:24.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
and vote for our side.

00:21:25.734 --> 00:21:27.601 position:33% line:83% align:start
Which means,
with this committee,

00:21:27.634 --> 00:21:29.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
anything goes!

00:21:29.901 --> 00:21:32.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can obscure and
hide the real data

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
make claims that
black is white,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
as well as present several
contradictory answers.

00:21:36.834 --> 00:21:38.100 position:21% line:89% align:start
So that at a glance,

00:21:38.133 --> 00:21:40.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
the argument can seem
totally reasonable,

00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:42.267 position:35% line:83% align:start
as well as
rather entertaining...

00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:47.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then we can transform
fiction into fact.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can actually get away
with that here.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
I will stop at nothing
to win this battle.

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:02.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I will pour everything
I have into these lies.

00:22:08.534 --> 00:22:11.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
The committee to conquer
Steel Lady Nanase

00:22:11.467 --> 00:22:13.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
