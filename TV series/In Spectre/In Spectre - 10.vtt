00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
I will be victorious!

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:19.567 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait!

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:21.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought your game plan
revolved around the idea

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:23.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
that Steel Lady Nanase
was not a ghost.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
The unreasonable won't bow
to reason,

00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:27.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
so we'll be inconsistent, too.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the best way to
establish logic from within.

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:32.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
If we can convince them

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
of a particular reason for
a ghost to appear,

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.567 position:7% line:83% align:start
we will inevitably find the way
to make that ghost disappear.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.000 position:10% line:89% align:start
Take away its raison d'etre,

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:42.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then the ghost will
stop appearing.

00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:45.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
Solution number two is go!

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:57.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
[opening music]

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:17.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase
isn't imaginary.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
She's a real, bonafide ghost.

00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:21.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
The question is:

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:23.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
why did Karin Nanase
reappear as a ghost

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:25.901 position:13% line:89% align:start
and start attacking people?

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:27.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Anon] <i>What?</i>

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:29.067 position:41% line:83% align:start
 <i>Wait,</i>
 <i>we're doing this again?</i>

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
The one who killed
Detective Terada

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
was Steel Lady Nanase.

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:39.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
He was out by himself
investigating the Steel Lady,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
and was unlucky enough
to meet the real one,

00:02:41.868 --> 00:02:44.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
who crushed his head
with a steel beam.

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:46.901 position:7% line:83% align:start
Detective Terada didn't believe
in ghosts,

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:49.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
so when he met a real one,
he was shocked...

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:50.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:51.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
And that's when he was hit.

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:53.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
He never had a chance
to fight back.

00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:56.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
The reason the crime scene
looked so incomprehensible,

00:02:56.267 --> 00:02:58.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
is because it was the work
of a ghost.

00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:00.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
So what could be the reason

00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:03.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
compelling Karin Nanase
to reappear as a ghost?

00:03:03.234 --> 00:03:06.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
What were the regrets
she left behind in this world?

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:08.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Anonymous] <i>Wouldn't dying</i>

00:03:08.734 --> 00:03:09.968 position:38% line:83% align:start
 <i>count as</i>
 <i>a compelling reason?</i>

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.234 position:21% line:89% align:start
Karin Nanase's death

00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:13.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
is considered
something akin to suicide,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
even though it was an accident.

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:19.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
That night, Karin Nanase was
so overwhelmed with despair,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
she accepted the fact her face
was about to be crushed

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
by a falling steel beam.

00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:25.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
It could even be argued
that she chose to die.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:29.033 position:10% line:83% align:start
So why come back as a ghost,
to wander this world again?

00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:30.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
And why would she pick
a steel beam

00:03:30.801 --> 00:03:31.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
as her weapon of choice

00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:33.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
after letting one
crush her face?

00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
If she became a ghost to
strike back at the society

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
that drove her to
an early death...

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:39.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think it's safe to say

00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:42.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
that she's finally
gotten her revenge.

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:44.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
Since emerging as
Steel Lady Nanase,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
she's become a bigger star
than she ever was.

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:49.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
We have to ask,
what made her turn violent

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:52.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
and go as far as
killing someone?

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
The real reason Nanase
was chased

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
out of the spotlight
as an idol,

00:03:57.334 --> 00:03:59.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
is because of the death
of her father.

00:03:59.267 --> 00:04:01.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
A rumor started that
she had killed him.

00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:03.367 position:33% line:83% align:start
That in mind,
her ghostly return,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
would only instill fear and
stir up further criticism.

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:10.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
Therefore, the reason
Karin Nanase became a ghost,

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:12.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
wasn't her hatred
toward society.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
She appeared, because
she wanted to tell the world,

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:17.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
about a different problem,
and a different truth.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
And because the world refused
to understand

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
what she was trying to say,

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:25.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
it was only a matter of time
before she became violent.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just think about it.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
She hadn't been cleared
of suspicion of murder.

00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:32.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
It followed her all the way
to the grave.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
But if Karin Nanase really
had murdered her father,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
what message would she
be trying to tell

00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:38.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
the world right now?

00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:43.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's enraged because
she didn't kill her father.

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:45.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
So she returned as a ghost

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.367 position:33% line:83% align:start
to make sure
everybody knew the truth.

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:51.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
But then,
is that truly the core of it?

00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:54.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
Isn't her unbridled rage
actually an indicator

00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:56.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
she's longing for
something else?

00:04:56.868 --> 00:04:58.133 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.200 position:10% line:89% align:start

[Kotoko]
True. For the second solution,

00:05:04.234 --> 00:05:06.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm nothing more than
a mere fiction writer.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
The readers here seem
to believe in ghosts,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
and support theories
that include them.

00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:12.634 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll solve this mystery,

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
and ritualistically,
make our ghost problem

00:05:14.868 --> 00:05:16.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
a thing of the past.

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:18.567 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
Let's go back to the beginning.

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:22.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why did Karin Nanase, who had
a cult following at best,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
suddenly become the target
of mass media allegations

00:05:24.868 --> 00:05:27.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
of something as horrible
as patricide?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
Someone plotted against her,

00:05:29.367 --> 00:05:32.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
and forged these
nefarious allegations.

00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:34.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
Karin Nanase had fallen
into a trap.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:38.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
And that's why she's reappeared
in our world as a ghost.

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:40.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
Karin Nanase's return
is a protest,

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:43.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
against the sinister person
who tricked her,

00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:45.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
and drove her to
commit suicide.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
We have to take what
we know for sure,

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:51.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
and find out the truth behind
these ghastly allegations.

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:53.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
Who was the first to accuse
Karin Nanase

00:05:53.534 --> 00:05:55.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
of killing her father?

00:05:55.834 --> 00:05:57.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
 <i>What I'm proposing is risky,</i>

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
 <i>but I have to take</i>
 <i>the chance while it's here...</i>

00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:02.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
The suspicion was first put
on her by the one

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:04.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
who would later
become her alleged victim...

00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:06.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
Karin Nanase's father.

00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:08.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
Her father suspected she was
going to try to kill him,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.968 position:7% line:89% align:start
and even left that in writing,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
in a notebook found
after his death.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
How could anything
be more convenient?

00:06:16.534 --> 00:06:19.968 position:7% line:83% align:start
If Karin Nanase truly did push
her father down the stairs,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
intending to make it look
like an accident...

00:06:22.067 --> 00:06:23.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
she likely would've
been mindful

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:25.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
about any handwritten notes
he'd left behind,

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:27.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
and disposed of them
immediately.

00:06:27.868 --> 00:06:30.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
Besides, it's hard to believe
she'd actually murder him

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
while he was telling others
that she scared him.

00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:36.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
She would've instantly been
a person of interest.

She didn't harbor

00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:14.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
The strangest thing
about this story...

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
It could be true...

00:07:16.033 --> 00:07:18.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
One can only imagine
the dynamics

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:20.067 position:41% line:83% align:start
of how
their relationship worked.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
There are reports
he quit his job

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
because he expected part
of his daughter's earnings.

00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:25.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Nanase's father]
That girl's made

00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:27.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
a damn fool of me, I tell ya.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's always rubbed
her superior intelligence

00:07:29.734 --> 00:07:31.200 position:35% line:89% align:start
in my face.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
[friend] But wait,
she's your daughter.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
How can you say such
awful things about her?

00:07:36.968 --> 00:07:38.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're crazy.

00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:40.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko] It's probably true

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
that her father was wary
of their relationship.

00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:45.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
He was surviving

00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:47.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
on his daughter's flashy job,
after all.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
But he also developed
an inferiority complex

00:07:49.868 --> 00:07:51.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
because of it.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
He was suffering,
and felt like no one cared.

00:07:54.968 --> 00:07:57.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's what caused him
to resent his daughter.

00:07:57.467 --> 00:07:59.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
If he couldn't achieve
the same amount of success

00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:00.701 position:33% line:89% align:start
as she could,

00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:03.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
he would commit suicide and
drag her down with him.

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:06.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
That was the purpose
of his death.

00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:08.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
It was his last show of pride.

00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:10.801 position:33% line:83% align:start
To that end,
he left a time bomb...

00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:14.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
implicating his daughter
via his note.

00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:15.968 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
And as he'd planned,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
Karin Nanase was
looked down upon

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
and treated with suspicion.

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:23.033 position:19% line:89% align:start
[reporter] Miss Nanase,

00:08:23.067 --> 00:08:25.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
would you care to comment
on your father's journal,

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:26.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
specifically the last note
he wrote?

00:08:26.834 --> 00:08:27.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
I really don't know anything!

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:30.133 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, hold on!

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:31.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
In this reporter's opinion,

00:08:31.734 --> 00:08:34.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
the note your father left
behind was perfectly clear!

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
[reporter] He said that
you were going to kill him.

00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:38.133 position:33% line:89% align:start
Miss Nanase!

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:41.100 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
That's what drove her away,

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:42.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
and led her to an accident

00:08:42.868 --> 00:08:45.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
that many considered
borderline suicide.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's how Karin Nanase
left this world.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.067 position:33% line:83% align:start
And her soul,
moved to the afterlife.

00:08:57.767 --> 00:08:59.000 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.200 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
And in the next world,

00:09:01.234 --> 00:09:03.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
she was reunited with
her late father,

00:09:03.868 --> 00:09:05.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
where she heard
the awful truth,

00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:07.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
straight from his own lips.

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:08.868 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:09.934 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Saki] Huh?

00:09:09.968 --> 00:09:11.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
"She heard the awful truth

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.634 position:33% line:83% align:start
straight from
her father's lips"?!

00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:14.033 position:21% line:89% align:start
Are you kidding me?!

00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:17.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
Where else was she supposed
to find out the truth?

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:18.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
After finding out
her own father

00:09:18.968 --> 00:09:20.701 position:7% line:89% align:start
maliciously tried to ruin her,

00:09:20.734 --> 00:09:22.200 position:7% line:89% align:start
she became filled with regret,

00:09:22.234 --> 00:09:25.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
and her soul was unable
to fully move on.

00:09:26.868 --> 00:09:28.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why she came back
to our world

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:31.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
and is desperate to
tell people the truth.

00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:34.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
She wanted us to know
the tragedy

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
that she did not
kill her father,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
despite all the hearsay.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
It was her father
who killed her.

00:09:40.734 --> 00:09:42.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's why she came back.

00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:45.067 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's why her spirit has gone
on a rampage.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
Her father's betrayal
turned her evil.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
She devolved into a monster.

00:09:51.267 --> 00:09:53.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
But if we remember her
as she was,

00:09:53.267 --> 00:09:55.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
and wish for her soul to
move on...

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
then Steel Lady will stop
haunting our streets at night.

are the ones who can
bring her peace.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
All of you must be the judges!

00:10:11.868 --> 00:10:13.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
Karin Nanase,

00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:15.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
also known as Haruko Nanase.

00:10:15.133 --> 00:10:17.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
Let us lay her tormented soul
to rest

00:10:17.567 --> 00:10:19.167 position:13% line:89% align:start
with our combined prayers!

00:10:38.868 --> 00:10:41.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
despite her bringing up

Hey, look...
I think she's weaker.

00:11:05.234 --> 00:11:07.767 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] I assume this means
that Rikka failed to predict

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:10.968 position:7% line:83% align:start
that we would switch over from
such an orthodox solution

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
to its absolute opposite
so quickly.

00:11:13.267 --> 00:11:16.300 position:13% line:83% align:start
I tried to convince people
who want to believe in spirits,

00:11:16.334 --> 00:11:19.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
that there was indeed a ghost
involved in this case.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
That meant they would support
that argument even more.

00:11:22.267 --> 00:11:25.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think Kuro had an easier time
choosing that future, too...

00:11:25.634 --> 00:11:26.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
which doesn't hurt.

00:11:26.767 --> 00:11:28.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
But this still
doesn't guarantee

00:11:28.133 --> 00:11:29.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
that we've won the battle.

 <i>She even killed a detective.</i>

00:11:46.534 --> 00:11:49.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
Rikka's started exerting
her control over the flow.

00:11:49.901 --> 00:11:51.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
If Karin Nanase's ghost

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
appeared more clearly
before now,

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:54.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
and came across
as more spiteful,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
the second solution
might've been able

00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:58.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
to conclude everything.

00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:01.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
But unfortunately,
Steel Lady Nanase's fame

00:12:01.734 --> 00:12:03.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
is a huge obstacle to overcome.

00:12:03.567 --> 00:12:04.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's hard to believe that

00:12:04.767 --> 00:12:07.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
a spirit who had such
valid complaints or requests

00:12:07.234 --> 00:12:10.367 position:21% line:83% align:start
would become a ghost
so bent on wreaking havoc.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nevertheless, Rikka wasn't able
to completely deny my story.

00:12:21.234 --> 00:12:22.767 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
If we're going to go on

00:12:22.801 --> 00:12:24.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
weaving the tapestry
of our story...

00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:26.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
we'll have to focus on
making it something

00:12:26.634 --> 00:12:29.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
that people across the internet
will find palatable...

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then Rikka will have to accept
certain premises of our story,

00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:34.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
since it's been so persuasive.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're in the minority with
a disadvantage,

00:12:36.868 --> 00:12:38.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
but everybody loves
an underdog...

00:12:38.767 --> 00:12:40.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
especially when they turn
the tables

00:12:40.267 --> 00:12:41.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
on the reigning champion

00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:44.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
who everyone was sure
had a clear leg up.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now then, time for...

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
our third solution.

00:12:51.567 --> 00:12:52.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:13:05.834 --> 00:13:08.067 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
Let's try another hypothesis.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
Steel Lady Nanase is not
a spectre.

00:13:10.567 --> 00:13:13.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
She is a fake ghost created
by a living human being

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
for an unknown purpose.

00:13:15.267 --> 00:13:18.901 position:7% line:83% align:start
Which means the one who killed
Detective Terada is also human.

00:13:18.934 --> 00:13:22.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because Steel Lady Nanase
is not Karin Nanase,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
its arrival and her death
don't match up.

00:13:27.167 --> 00:13:29.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
That in mind, let's look
at the circumstances

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
around Karin Nanase's death.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.734 position:30% line:83% align:start
There are still
some inconsistencies

00:13:33.767 --> 00:13:34.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
about her demise.

00:13:35.534 --> 00:13:37.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
Plenty have argued that
it doesn't sound like

00:13:37.701 --> 00:13:39.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
the way someone like her
would go.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.200 position:30% line:83% align:start
What's certain
is she felt trapped.

00:13:41.234 --> 00:13:43.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
She had lost
her hard-earned place

00:13:43.133 --> 00:13:44.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
in the entertainment business,

00:13:44.868 --> 00:13:47.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
and a comeback
was proving difficult.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
She was accused of killing
her father, on top of that.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
And if those accusations
stemmed from

00:13:52.033 --> 00:13:53.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
her own father's
handwritten notes,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
then her whole life had
basically been shattered

00:13:56.467 --> 00:13:57.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
beyond all repair.

00:13:57.934 --> 00:14:00.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
The motives for a suicide
are there.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
And yet, her older sister
has expressed doubts

00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:06.400 position:10% line:83% align:start
about the likelihood of Karin
committing suicide.

00:14:06.434 --> 00:14:07.801 position:24% line:83% align:start

[Kotoko] When a family member
commits suicide,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
there are times when
the remaining family members

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:21.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
can't readily accept it.

00:14:21.334 --> 00:14:23.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
If the reason behind
that suicide

00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:25.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
is another family member,

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
they find a way to shift
the blame to someone else

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
so they won't be suspected.

00:14:29.434 --> 00:14:32.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
But her older sister made
statements to the police

00:14:32.067 --> 00:14:34.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
that only made her
a more suspicious character

00:14:34.467 --> 00:14:35.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
in their eyes.

00:14:35.767 --> 00:14:37.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
Would she have said all that

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
simply to shift the blame
somewhere else?

00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:45.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
She'd had her doubts from
the very beginning.

00:14:45.367 --> 00:14:49.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did Karin Nanase,
AKA Haruko Nanase,

00:14:49.467 --> 00:14:50.801 position:33% line:89% align:start
truly perish?

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:52.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
Couldn't it have been
someone else

00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:54.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
whose face was crushed
by the steel beam?

00:14:55.567 --> 00:14:56.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Anon] <i>Wait. A double?</i>

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Anon-B] <i>A double is</i>
 <i>pre</i> tty much a given

00:14:58.367 --> 00:15:00.100 position:19% line:83% align:start

 <i>without a face.</i>

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:02.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
The authorities
took the proper steps

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:04.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
to identify the corpse.

00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:06.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
Her clothes, blood type,
fingerprints,

00:15:06.601 --> 00:15:07.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
physical appearance...

00:15:07.868 --> 00:15:11.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
But in all frankness,
how trustworthy is any of that?

00:15:11.767 --> 00:15:13.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
Clothes can be changed.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
And she wasn't the sort
of person whose fingerprint

00:15:15.267 --> 00:15:17.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
would already be on file
with the police.

00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:19.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
You could quite easily switch
out the personal belongings

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.100 position:35% line:83% align:start
in her room
with someone else's.

00:15:22.133 --> 00:15:23.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
Her teeth were smashed
to pieces

00:15:23.868 --> 00:15:25.000 position:21% line:89% align:start
along with her face.

00:15:25.033 --> 00:15:26.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
There are plenty of
other people

00:15:26.567 --> 00:15:27.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
who share her blood type.

00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:29.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can't dismiss
the possibility

00:15:29.234 --> 00:15:31.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
that she'd been switched
with someone else.

00:15:31.467 --> 00:15:32.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
[surprise]

00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:34.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Which means
it's theoretically possible

00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:36.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
to have a double.

00:15:36.033 --> 00:15:38.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because her face had been
smashed in,

00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:39.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
dental records would
be useless.

00:15:39.434 --> 00:15:42.534 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's possible someone could've
planted a double.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:43.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Anon] <i>Let's get real.</i>

00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:45.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
 <i>Switching bodies would've</i>
 <i>been impossible.</i>

00:15:45.434 --> 00:15:48.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] The rules of reality
don't matter here.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
What's important, is that
Karin Nanase's older sister

00:15:50.801 --> 00:15:53.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
actually had suspicions that
this corpse could've been

00:15:53.734 --> 00:15:55.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
the remains of somebody else.

00:15:55.501 --> 00:15:59.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
Her younger sister had died in
a very uncharacteristic way.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
The sassy little sister,
who was smart,

00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:03.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
and on the road to becoming
a popular idol.

00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:06.701 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no way
she'd die like that.

00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:07.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course she'd think
that way.

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:09.334 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Kotoko] Or...
-[sobbing]

00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:11.667 position:30% line:83% align:start
The more spite
you might've bottled up inside,

00:16:11.701 --> 00:16:15.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
the more likely you are
to suspect someone else.

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:17.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
So who was responsible for

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
leaking her father's journal
out to the media?

00:16:19.834 --> 00:16:23.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
The only probable answer is
Karin Nanase's older sister.

00:16:23.801 --> 00:16:27.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
Was Hatsumi actually fond
of her little sister Haruko?

00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:30.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's safe to assume she had
been unfairly compared

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
to her glorious little sister
their whole lives.

00:16:33.267 --> 00:16:35.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
The siblings most likely were
not on very good terms

00:16:35.934 --> 00:16:36.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
at the time.

00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:40.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
Allegations that Karin Nanase
killed her father arose,

00:16:40.868 --> 00:16:42.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
yet Hatsumi never made
any statements

00:16:42.767 --> 00:16:44.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
in her sister's defense.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
She didn't even try
to criticize the media

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
that had driven her sister
to the brink of suicide.

00:16:49.267 --> 00:16:51.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
I believe Hatsumi sent
the media her father's note,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
to get a bit of revenge against
her sister.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
But the results of
her sending the note,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
probably far exceeded
her expectations.

00:17:00.634 --> 00:17:02.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's why...

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hatsumi] There's no way
Haruko would just

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
let herself die so easily...

00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:10.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
Isn't it possible that
someone else killed her?!

00:17:12.734 --> 00:17:14.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
 <i>Someone else?</i>

00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:16.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>This corpse must be...</i>

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>someone else's body...</i>

00:17:20.033 --> 00:17:21.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] She began wondering
if her sister

00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:24.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
had faked her death
to get revenge.

00:17:24.534 --> 00:17:25.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
Realistically speaking,

00:17:25.934 --> 00:17:28.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
switching out the bodies
would've been difficult.

00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:30.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
But also not impossible.

00:17:30.868 --> 00:17:33.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
And to Hatsumi,
it seemed entirely likely

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
that her sister would do
something exactly like that.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
Haruko had always seemed
like the type

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
that would try to get revenge
if she found out

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.434 position:27% line:83% align:start
about the person
who had caused her misery.

00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:46.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>I'm probably going to end up</i>
 <i>killed like that, too...</i>

00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:49.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>Haruko would totally</i>
 <i>do that.</i>

that it started affecting

[man] I just need to make it

00:18:49.067 --> 00:18:51.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
so the ghost of

[Kotoko] He took on
Steel Lady Nanase's form

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:56.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
and started attacking people
on the streets at night

00:18:56.868 --> 00:18:58.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
to fake the existence
of this ghost,

00:18:58.868 --> 00:19:01.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
and to start rumors
spreading about it.

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
Most people wouldn't exactly
feel at ease

00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:08.434 position:7% line:83% align:start
if the ghost of a family member
were to suddenly reappear,

00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:09.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
but for Hatsumi,

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
it was a needed step
for recovery.

 <i>Hatsumi's boyfriend?</i>

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
The chances of that are low.

00:19:17.934 --> 00:19:19.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
A boyfriend would've
had to leave

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:20.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the middle of the night.

00:19:20.767 --> 00:19:22.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hatsumi would've noticed that.

00:19:22.868 --> 00:19:24.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
The suspect is
someone resourceful,

00:19:24.868 --> 00:19:26.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
with plenty of time
on their hands,

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
who would do whatever
it took to help Hatsumi.

00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:29.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
We can also assume

00:19:29.901 --> 00:19:31.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
it was someone who was single

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
and showcased
deviant tendencies.

00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:36.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
The suspect dressed as a ghost
named Steel Lady Nanase,

00:19:36.334 --> 00:19:39.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
which hadn't existed prior,
all for the sake of Hatsumi,

00:19:39.434 --> 00:19:42.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
then killed Detective Terada
in a random encounter.

00:19:42.834 --> 00:19:44.167 position:21% line:89% align:start
The suspect panicked

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
after murdering
the police officer for Hatsumi,

00:19:46.467 --> 00:19:49.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
and might've wanted
to further their relationship,

00:19:49.067 --> 00:19:51.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
potentially harming her
if rejected.

[gasp/scream]

Steel Lady Nanase
isn't a spectre.

00:19:57.801 --> 00:20:00.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
We must track down this
dangerous degenerate quickly

has a tendency

assaulting random people...

Unable to avenge herself
when she was alive,

wouldn't she think that
her sister's ghost

00:21:13.868 --> 00:21:15.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
was trying to attack her?

00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:21.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
Besides, now that
he's committed a murder,

she would be terrified of him.

Therefore...

If the motive falls apart,

that means the solution
