Oh...must be time already.

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:54.501 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:13.267 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hello...
It's been a while.

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:17.133 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:18.667 position:44% line:83% align:start
Wait.
You don't remember

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:20.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
what the person who saved
your life looked like?

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:22.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's safe to say
I haven't been through

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
any life-threatening events
in the last decade at least.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was two years ago,
it happened here...

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:36.834 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:38.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[children laughing]
-[Kuro gasp]

00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:51.734 position:33% line:83% align:start
Are you going
to be all right?

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:52.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:58.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
Uh, thank you.
I guess you saved me.

00:01:58.601 --> 00:01:59.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, sorry!

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:01.367 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's fine.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
As the one who saved
your life,

00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:05.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
all I ask is that
you remember me forever.

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:07.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's going
a bit overboard.

00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:10.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
Although...

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:12.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess it is possible
to die that way.

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:14.367 position:21% line:89% align:start
Right, I'll remember.

 <i>"love at first sight"?!</i>

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:57.934 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Kuro] Oh...
That girl was you?

00:02:57.968 --> 00:02:59.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
But that girl wasn't
wearing a beret.

00:02:59.968 --> 00:03:01.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
I feel like I would have
remembered that...

00:03:01.868 --> 00:03:03.367 position:35% line:83% align:start
And you can
only tell girls apart

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
by which hat they're wearing?

00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:05.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, sorry.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not that good at
remembering girls' faces.

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:10.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
And if I remember them
too well,

00:03:10.701 --> 00:03:12.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
it just makes Saki grumpy.

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:14.901 position:33% line:89% align:start
In that case,

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:17.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
please try to remember
it again.

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
My name's Kotoko Iwanaga.

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
Written with the characters
for "koto" like the instrument,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
then "child," "rock,"
and "eternity."

00:03:27.601 --> 00:03:31.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm seventeen years old,
and quite lively.

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:34.501 position:44% line:83% align:start
Cool.
I won't forget this time.

00:03:35.868 --> 00:03:37.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'm so sure...

00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:40.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
considering I heard that
you and Saki broke up.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
How'd you know that?

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.634 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Saki]
What are you doing, Kuro?

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:49.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, Saki...

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
Uh, actually...
she sort of saved my life.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.200 position:41% line:89% align:start
I saw.

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:58.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry for
the trouble he caused.

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:01.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
And thank you.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Kotoko] Why are you</i>
 <i>the one apologizing?</i>

00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:06.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
-[Kuro] I lost my balance.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
 <i>[Kotoko] What is she?</i>
 <i>His older sister?</i>

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
 <i>Actually, she could</i>
 <i>be his younger sister...</i>

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:15.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Nurse 1] His name is
Kuro Sakuragawa.

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:18.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's a second-year at
Homei University, studying law.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
He comes here often to
visit his cousin

00:04:20.734 --> 00:04:22.501 position:13% line:89% align:start
who's a long-term patient.

00:04:22.534 --> 00:04:23.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is this cousin of his

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
a somewhat tall woman
with long, dark hair?

00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:27.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nurse 2] Oh no, they're not
related to each other.

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:29.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's Saki.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's a year older
and his girlfriend.

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
They've dated since
they were in high school.

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:36.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
Kuro even decided to go
to the same university

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
that she was attending.

00:04:56.267 --> 00:04:58.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
 <i>Then, two years</i>
 <i>after our first encounter...</i>

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
Apparently, Kuro and Saki

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
are getting married
after they graduate.

00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:06.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
I heard they just met
each other's parents recently.

00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:07.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasp]

00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:09.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
They'll be getting
married any day now.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
[grunt]

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:19.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
 <i>He's alone today?</i>

00:05:20.767 --> 00:05:23.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>Did Kuro and his girlfriend</i>
 <i>break up or something?</i>

00:05:23.968 --> 00:05:25.434 position:27% line:89% align:start
What? I doubt it.

00:05:25.467 --> 00:05:28.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know...he stopped talking
about his girlfriend

00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:29.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
right around February.

00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:30.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:33.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
And he hasn't really talked
to anyone recently.

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:36.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Kuro] What is this
hospital's policy

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
on handling personal
information, anyway?

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
They said they had
no obligation to protect

00:05:41.167 --> 00:05:43.601 position:35% line:83% align:start
a visitor's
personal information.

00:05:43.634 --> 00:05:44.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is that how it works?

00:05:44.868 --> 00:05:46.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
It really is a bit shady.

00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:48.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
Though to be fair,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
they never did tell me
who your cousin is

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:51.968 position:7% line:89% align:start
or why they're in the hospital.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.801 position:19% line:89% align:start
Never even said a word.

00:05:53.834 --> 00:05:55.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're better off
not knowing.

00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:58.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
The reasons people are
hospitalized long-term

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
aren't usually that amusing.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, in regard to the rumors

00:06:02.734 --> 00:06:05.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
that you and Saki broke up
right before spring...

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:07.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
They don't care about
my privacy at all, do they?

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:08.801 position:19% line:89% align:start
You weren't kidding...

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:10.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
The point here is,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
that you're back to
being single again.

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:13.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
Have you maybe thought
about trying

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.901 position:33% line:83% align:start
a fresh start
with someone new?

00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:20.434 position:33% line:83% align:start
Could you get
to the point already?

00:06:20.467 --> 00:06:21.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
Very well then.

00:06:21.434 --> 00:06:25.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
How about dating me
with marriage in mind?

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:28.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've held this one-sided love
for two years,

00:06:28.133 --> 00:06:30.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
just waiting for this moment!

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're surprisingly direct,
despite how you look.

00:06:36.367 --> 00:06:39.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
And if you waited two years,
pretty persistent, too.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
A young lady can
always wait for fate.

00:06:42.267 --> 00:06:44.067 position:33% line:83% align:start
The thing is,
there'd be problems,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.834 position:19% line:83% align:start
on account of you being
a middle schooler...

00:06:45.868 --> 00:06:47.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
[furious] I told you!

00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:48.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm seventeen years old
and in high school!

00:06:48.834 --> 00:06:52.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
I even plan on applying to
your university next year!

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
What, do you have
the memory of a chicken?!

00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:02.167 position:19% line:83% align:start
Was what I said really
that funny?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.167 position:41% line:83% align:start
Nah...
It just made me feel happy.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
A high school girl just
asked me to go out with her.

00:07:07.901 --> 00:07:10.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess maybe I'm not
a total lost cause.

00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:12.667 position:33% line:83% align:start
Haven't felt
this great in a while.

00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:15.067 position:41% line:83% align:start
I see.
Did Saki dump you?

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
It wasn't Saki fault.

00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:19.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
There was no way
around it.

00:07:20.534 --> 00:07:24.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, I'm not sure
I'm ready to see anyone new.

00:07:25.868 --> 00:07:28.067 position:30% line:83% align:start
So what was it,
and be specific,

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
that ended your courtship
in a sudden break-up?

00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:34.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
Over the winter...

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
Saki and I went on
a trip to Kyoto.

00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:37.868 position:16% line:89% align:start
But you weren't married!

00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:39.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
What would people think?!

00:07:39.534 --> 00:07:42.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
What decade were
you born in anyway?

00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:44.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] So, late one night,

00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:47.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
when we were walking
along the Kamo River...

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:50.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:56.234 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
Those things that show up
on shorelines?

00:07:58.033 --> 00:07:59.934 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yup. It was a kappa.

00:07:59.968 --> 00:08:02.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
It wasn't a gataro,
suiko, or hyosube?

00:08:02.734 --> 00:08:04.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
You sure know
your stuff.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.567 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kuro]
Whatever it actually was,

00:08:06.601 --> 00:08:09.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
calling it a kappa
seemed to fit best.

00:08:09.267 --> 00:08:10.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
All I know is that
what I saw

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.267 position:27% line:83% align:start
wasn't a human or
an animal.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
But it was definitely
some kind of

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:17.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
moving, breathing life form.

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:22.100 position:35% line:83% align:start
The moment
we realized that,

00:08:22.133 --> 00:08:24.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
it became something
so terrifying,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
that it felt like all
the rules of our world,

00:08:26.868 --> 00:08:28.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
were about to crack open.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
But generally speaking,
kappas aren't bad.

00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:33.000 position:35% line:83% align:start
These days,
they're very trendy creatures

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:35.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
that can recommend good sushi
or shrimp chips.

00:08:35.334 --> 00:08:37.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, the one I saw
looked like

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
he'd drag you into
the river...

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
and suck out every last drop
of your blood.

00:08:41.734 --> 00:08:43.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] The next day,

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
they actually found a body
in the river near there.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was ruled an accident...
cause unknown.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
Saki's a brave,
no-nonsense girl,

00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:55.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
and she doesn't believe
in yokai or ghosts.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
But she saw that thing
and got so scared,

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:59.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
she just clung to me,
shaking.

00:08:59.033 --> 00:09:01.234 position:38% line:83% align:start
And then?
What happened?

00:09:01.267 --> 00:09:03.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
Without a second glance
Saki's way,

00:09:03.567 --> 00:09:05.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, there were
some cowardly whimpers,

00:09:05.868 --> 00:09:08.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
and running off
like a scared rabbit.

00:09:09.868 --> 00:09:11.033 position:19% line:89% align:start
 <i>Well, it was a kappa.</i>

00:09:11.067 --> 00:09:12.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Kuro] After that,

00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:15.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
she said she never knew
I was that kind of person,

00:09:15.734 --> 00:09:17.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
and things got awkward.

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:20.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
She was already planning
to move away for her new job.

00:09:20.267 --> 00:09:22.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
That was her excuse
to break up.

00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:24.467 position:33% line:83% align:start
And honestly,
who could blame her?

00:09:25.601 --> 00:09:27.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't really care
if you believe me or not.

00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:29.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
If you don't,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
then I'm just a crazy
college kid who blames

00:09:31.534 --> 00:09:35.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
a kappa for the fact that
his girlfriend dumped him.

00:09:35.334 --> 00:09:36.200 position:44% line:89% align:start
Or...

00:09:36.234 --> 00:09:38.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe I'm a college kid
who went crazy

00:09:38.801 --> 00:09:40.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
from the shock of
getting dumped.

00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:44.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
Regardless, I'm not worthy
to be your boyfriend.

00:09:45.767 --> 00:09:48.067 position:38% line:83% align:start
Gotta go,
my bus'll be here soon.

00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:52.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] But we aren't
done talking yet.

00:09:52.934 --> 00:09:55.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please clarify the subject
of your statement.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.334 position:33% line:83% align:start
Who, exactly,
left Saki and ran off?

00:10:02.267 --> 00:10:05.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
It wasn't you that ran off.
It was the kappa, right?

00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:07.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
The kappa saw you
next to Saki,

00:10:07.234 --> 00:10:10.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
got scared, and ran off.
There's no doubt.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
An awful experience
for that kappa,

00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:17.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
just randomly running into you
in the middle of the night.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.033 position:21% line:89% align:start
I feel sorry for it.

00:10:19.067 --> 00:10:21.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Saki saw that
terrifying yokai run away

00:10:21.634 --> 00:10:23.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
after seeing you.

00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:26.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
She wondered who you
really were...and got spooked.

00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:27.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
And that's when she said

00:10:27.634 --> 00:10:30.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
she never knew you were
that kind of person.

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:31.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right?

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've made one key mistake
in your investigation.

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:37.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kappas don't exist
to begin with.

00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:39.901 position:35% line:83% align:start
Even though
you just said they did?

00:10:39.934 --> 00:10:41.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, that was a lie.

00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:42.901 position:30% line:89% align:start
Think about it.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
Like I'm gonna tell a girl
about my break-up.

00:10:45.133 --> 00:10:48.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm really only slightly
acquainted with kappas,

00:10:48.133 --> 00:10:50.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
but I am quite
knowledgeable about

00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:51.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
creatures like it.

00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:54.734 position:33% line:83% align:start
This town...
and even this hospital,

00:10:54.767 --> 00:10:58.067 position:7% line:89% align:start
has yokai, ayakashi, spectres.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
And, even demons
are lurking everywhere.

00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:03.534 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] In the shadows of
the azaleas,

00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:05.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
and atop the dogwoods,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
they are quietly
observing all we do.

00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:12.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
Most of them are
just curious

00:11:12.534 --> 00:11:13.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
and mean no harm,

00:11:13.534 --> 00:11:16.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
but they do in fact exist
everywhere you look.

00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:18.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hear them whisper
when they see you,

00:11:18.767 --> 00:11:20.968 position:5% line:89% align:start
their voices strained in fear...

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
"He's something different.

00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:25.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's... He's terrifying."

00:11:25.801 --> 00:11:26.868 position:38% line:89% align:start
[crunch]

00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:28.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
Who the hell are you?

00:11:28.467 --> 00:11:32.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
And what makes you so certain
that these things exist?

00:11:32.868 --> 00:11:34.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
When I was eleven,

00:11:34.267 --> 00:11:36.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was kidnapped for
two straight weeks

00:11:36.634 --> 00:11:38.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
by these mythical creatures.

00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:41.033 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Deep in the mountains
where they took me,

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:44.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
they pleaded with me,
the girl they had kidnapped...

00:11:44.467 --> 00:11:45.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
"We beg you.

00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:49.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please become our Goddess
of Wisdom," they said.

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:50.767 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Kuro]
Goddess of Wisdom?

00:11:50.801 --> 00:11:53.334 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] Most of these creatures
were of low intellect,

00:11:53.367 --> 00:11:56.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
so they were looking for
someone who could help them,

00:11:56.267 --> 00:11:58.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
someone to quell
their fighting,

00:11:58.067 --> 00:12:00.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
and to establish peace
among them.

00:12:00.567 --> 00:12:01.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Voices] Please!

00:12:01.734 --> 00:12:04.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please help us,
we beseech you.

00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:06.834 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko]
So I gave them my answer...

00:12:06.868 --> 00:12:09.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'll do it!

00:12:09.601 --> 00:12:11.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Voices] My lady!

00:12:16.701 --> 00:12:18.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thus, ever since then...

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
whenever they have
problems or conflicts,

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
they come from all over
the country

00:12:23.267 --> 00:12:26.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
to ask me to mediate
or find solutions.

00:12:26.734 --> 00:12:28.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's hard to believe.

00:12:28.334 --> 00:12:29.067 position:38% line:89% align:start
Too true.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
Since that's the case,

00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:33.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
find a newspaper
from July six years ago.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.968 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Kotoko] There's an article
about a fifth-grade girl

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
named Kotoko Iwanaga,

00:12:36.367 --> 00:12:38.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
who disappeared from
this town rather suddenly,

00:12:38.901 --> 00:12:41.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
and how, two full weeks
after vanishing,

00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:42.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
the girl was found
napping quietly

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
on a park bench in town.

00:12:44.767 --> 00:12:47.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
Though her left leg
was severed...

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:50.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
and also, her right eye
had been completely

00:12:50.734 --> 00:12:52.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
gouged out of the socket.

00:12:56.267 --> 00:13:00.701 position:16% line:83% align:start

the culprit was never caught.

00:13:00.734 --> 00:13:02.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's time. Bye now.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.033 position:16% line:89% align:start

Please tell me
you're all right!

00:13:55.934 --> 00:13:57.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
I was so frightened,

00:13:57.567 --> 00:14:00.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
I thought that vile creature
might try to eat you alive!

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.868 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's no need
to worry so much.

00:14:02.901 --> 00:14:05.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
He didn't even lay
a finger on me.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
But my lady,
what could you possibly see

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
in that smelly,
terrifying monstrosity?!

00:14:09.534 --> 00:14:13.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm sure it's difficult
for all you yokai to imagine,

00:14:13.434 --> 00:14:14.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
but to me, well...

00:14:14.834 --> 00:14:17.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
this Kuro guy is
quite the looker.

00:14:17.634 --> 00:14:18.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Kotoko giggles]

00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:19.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
Erm, could it be possible

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
that your left eye
was taken out as well?

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
Do you want to
get forcibly exorcised?

00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:25.601 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, my lady!

00:14:25.634 --> 00:14:26.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
I still have so many

00:14:26.868 --> 00:14:28.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
Harlequin Romance novels
left to read!

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
I couldn't possibly move on
to the afterlife just yet!

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those are probably
the last words

00:14:32.868 --> 00:14:34.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
I ever expected to hear
from you.

00:14:34.267 --> 00:14:36.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
But that creature
I mentioned before

00:14:36.067 --> 00:14:37.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
is still at the library,

00:14:37.267 --> 00:14:39.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
so I haven't been able
to go in days.

00:14:39.534 --> 00:14:42.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
Please get rid of that thing
as soon as you can.

00:14:42.567 --> 00:14:44.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
I haven't forgotten...

00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:47.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
I might be able to
take care of it tomorrow.

00:14:47.033 --> 00:14:49.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
As long as Kuro is able
to help me out,

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
it shouldn't be too hard.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.334 position:35% line:83% align:start

That's all I found.

There's still not any proof

Indeed.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.868 position:27% line:83% align:start

What?!

00:19:21.534 --> 00:19:23.701 position:24% line:83% align:start

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:28.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's in such a panic

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
that it can't see
what's going on around it.

00:19:30.033 --> 00:19:31.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
So in other words,

00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:32.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
you only wanted me
for my body?

your body like this
on our very first date.

Do you have
some kind of plan?

Any talismans you can use?

If it doesn't want
to listen to me,

00:19:43.033 --> 00:19:44.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
we'll have to use force.

00:19:44.567 --> 00:19:45.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
Use force?

Ah...that's it...

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
I definitely prefer
being held like this.

I feel so close
to you now.

This isn't the time
for that...

00:20:13.868 --> 00:20:16.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
I suppose you
DO have a point.

Kuro, what gives?

00:20:26.067 --> 00:20:27.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can do all the naughty
things you want later...

00:20:27.834 --> 00:20:29.000 position:38% line:89% align:start
Not that.

00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:31.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't let you do
anything reckless.

Run, Kuro--

[Kotoko] Two years ago,
and now...

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have that same
unfazed look on your face.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why are you so calm?!

00:21:03.434 --> 00:21:07.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
How can you be so unfazed
when you're in danger?!

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:09.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
Someone as reckless
as you

00:21:09.467 --> 00:21:11.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
shouldn't be lecturing me
on that.

00:21:11.334 --> 00:21:12.434 position:38% line:89% align:start
Besides,

00:21:12.467 --> 00:21:14.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
I thought you'd already
figured it out by now.

00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:15.567 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

[gasp]

00:21:26.267 --> 00:21:30.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I guess my flesh really
is poisonous to them.

00:21:51.601 --> 00:21:52.901 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wait, Kuro...

00:21:52.934 --> 00:21:56.000 position:33% line:83% align:start
I wanna know.
Who are you, really?

00:21:56.033 --> 00:21:58.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
You mean the ones
asking for your wisdom

00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:00.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
won't tell you who I am?

Everyone avoids talking
about certain things,

especially if those things
terrify them.

00:22:05.601 --> 00:22:06.734 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right.

If I were to
borrow your words...

When I was just eleven,

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:17.534 position:7% line:83% align:start
I consumed two different kinds
of yokai flesh...

00:22:17.567 --> 00:22:19.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
All I could eat.
