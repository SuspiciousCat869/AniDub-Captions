1
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:11,166
Our lips.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,541
They became one
in a sweet embrace.

3
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:16,875
Hold on.

4
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,333
This time I have a reason
not to give in to you.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,875
Come on. Try acting
like grown men, please.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,541
[TSUBAKI]
This has nothing to do with you.

7
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:32,875
Fine then.

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,916
I suppose it's time to
throw my hat in the ring.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,333
[AZUSA]
A red rose.

10
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,833
[NATSUME]
Just for you.

11
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,875
[TSUBAKI]
And only you.

12
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,625
[ALL]
With love.

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,500
[EMA]
Of course we love each other.

14
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,750
We're family. Aren't we?

15
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,375
[AZUSA]
You're wrong.

16
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,541
I'm acting like this 'cause
I'm worried about you.

17
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,458
Just shut up!

18
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,875
No, I won't.

19
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,625
I don't care what
you think, anyway.

20
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,083
Leave me the hell alone.

21
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,750
[gasps]

22
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:36,166
Leave her be.

00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,625
[gasps]

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,041
[AZUSA gasping]

25
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,833
No, please.

26
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,333
Hey, I'm home!

27
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,708
[EMA]
He just collapsed.

28
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,041
Is something wrong with him?

29
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,833
[MASAOMI] Hurry. I need
you to call an ambulance!

30
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,000
[EMA]
Okay!

31
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,416
[MASAOMI]
Yes, hello? This is Dr. Asahina.

32
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
How busy is the ICU tonight?

33
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,875
Yes. It's my younger brother.

34
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,166
He collapsed suddenly.

35
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,958
No, no. We have an
ambulance on the way.

36
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,083
Prep for our arrival.

37
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,375
Oh, god, Azusa.

38
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,916
[MASAOMI]
The drugs will keep him asleep

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,875
until sometime in the morning.

40
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,375
So you can call it a night
and go home, if you want.

41
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,291
Okay. What do I tell Tsubaki?

42
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,416
Good question.

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,958
We'll need to run
a bunch of tests,

44
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,916
which means keeping him here,
but his condition is stable.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,541
Let's tell him not
to worry about it.

46
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,291
Are we agreed?

47
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,791
Agreed.

48
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,791
Oh, I guess someone
needs to tell Natsume.

49
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,666
I can call and let
him know, if you'd like.

50
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,458
I appreciate that.
I'm glad you're here.

51
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,208
It's really helped.

52
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:56,625
[phone ringing]

53
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,958
[EMA]
Hello?

54
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,291
[gasps] What did you say?

55
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,500
[gasps]

56
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,958
[EMA] Hey, Tsubaki.
I'm back for the night.

57
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,791
How's Azusa?

58
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,458
Looks like he'll be okay.

59
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,416
[TSUBAKI]
Thank God.

60
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,708
You must've called Natsume
and told him, then.

61
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:26,541
Thank you. He's already talked
to our manager about it.

62
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,583
I, I couldn't think
straight at all.

63
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,416
[TSUBAKI]
Hey. You know what?

64
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,666
There's this old
myth I heard once.

65
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,000
Siblings born together share
one soul between them.

66
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,458
No matter how many
bodies it splits into.

67
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,291
There's still only one soul.

68
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,291
According to the myth,
even when you're apart,

69
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,958
you can tell what the other
person is going through.

70
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,583
The funny thing is,

71
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,041
I used to think it was true.

72
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,875
[EMA]
Tsubaki...

73
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,500
Not anymore, though. Heh.

74
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,625
Now, I don't feel
that way at all.

75
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,500
I can't sense Azusa.

76
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,708
It feels like he's already gone.

77
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,250
Stop talking like that.

78
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,750
[TSUBAKI]
It hurts. Right here.

79
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:16,875
You say something kind to me,
and my heart burns like fire.

80
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,041
I mean--

81
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,875
Ever since we met,
I can't keep focused,

82
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:20,958
I've lost my cool.

83
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,666
Sorry to hear that.

84
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,458
[TSUBAKI] Listen. If I did
something beyond stupid,

85
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,875
and hurt you...

86
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,291
I know there'd never be a
way to make things right.

87
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,958
Azusa stopped me, and honestly
saved both of us from myself.

88
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:37,208
And now he's sick.
I am such a jerk.

89
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,875
Well, look. If I were
stuck in your situation,

90
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,958
and I'm not trying to
tell you what to do,

91
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,000
but it seems the best thing
would be to tell him.

92
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,333
Tell him what?

93
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,166
[EMA] Just tell him how
you're feeling right now.

94
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,416
There's no way!

95
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,416
But why?

96
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,750
After the awful things I said.

97
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,208
I practically put him
in the hospital myself.

98
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,541
[EMA] I don't think Azusa would
see things that way at all!

99
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,083
[TSUBAKI]
Of course he won't!

100
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,416
I know my brother
will just forgive me.

101
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,583
And that's the point!
It's because of him

102
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,583
that I can't forgive myself!

103
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,458
[gasps]

104
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,666
[TSUBAKI]
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,916
I know I don't deserve to
be close to you right now.

106
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,708
[EMA]
Poor Tsubaki.

107
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,916
He still hasn't recovered
from the shock of it all.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,750
[JULI] Hm. That boy's normal
attitude really grinds my gears,

109
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,458
but it's even worse
when he's depressed!

110
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,000
I just hope he and Azusa

111
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,708
are able to patch
things up soon.

112
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,000
It's probably hard for them,
when things go wrong.

113
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,583
Because they've
always been so close.

114
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,375
[EMA] Excuse me. I'm here
to see Azusa Asahina.

115
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,625
[NATSUME]
Look who it is!

116
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,166
[EMA]
Oh, hey! Good morning!

117
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,125
It's great to see you.

118
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,875
Is it okay for you to
be up and walking around?

119
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,208
Yeah.

120
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,375
And I've also been cleared
to receive visitors now.

121
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,500
That's great news!

122
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,625
Well, I gotta go.
Take it easy, okay?

123
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,791
I will. See you soon.

124
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,166
He needs to get some rest.
Take care of 'im?

125
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,708
Right!

126
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,333
Hey, so thanks.

127
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,541
For coming out to visit me.

128
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,916
Sure. Here's some
clothes and stuff.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,791
From Ukyo.

130
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,375
I really appreciate it.

131
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,625
[UKYO] So the hospital
is allowing visitors?

132
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,208
That's good news, right?

133
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,041
Yes. He's currently
in stable condition.

134
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,291
But what does that
mean? How is he?

135
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:36,083
How long will he
be in the hospital?

136
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,625
Well, he's completely
ambulatory now.

137
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,833
If we're being
realistic, though,

138
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,166
he's gonna need more time.

139
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,375
[YUSUKE] But if his recovery
takes too much time.

140
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,208
Will he have to turn
down his new role?

141
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,166
[UKYO] For the time being,
Azusa's best bet

142
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,541
is to simply focus
on getting better.

143
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:53,666
No fair. Is Azzie gonna die?

144
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,166
He's gonna be fine.

145
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,625
I know! I'll make him
a "get well" card!

146
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,333
[KANAME sighs]
In paradise, surrounded by

147
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,666
dozens of angels in white!
Gotta say, I'm jealous!

148
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,875
Exactly what I'd expect
from that pervert!

149
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,500
[KANAME] Oh yeah!
Where did Sis run off to?

150
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,208
She's out visiting Azusa.

151
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,583
Under ordinary circumstances,
I would've joined her,

152
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,791
but it wasn't meant to be.

153
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,250
Of course. The hospital
would frown on that.

154
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,833
They tend to be
squirrel-free zones.

155
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,375
[JULI grumbles]

156
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,375
[UKYO] She's so helpful.
She went to the hospital for me.

157
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,875
I sent her with a care package.

158
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,000
[YUSUKE]
What? I would've gone, too!

159
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,583
[IORI]
You would've gone, too?

160
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,291
You weren't rushing to volunteer
until you found out she'd gone.

161
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,791
[LOUIS] Yeah, but can you
really blame the poor guy?

162
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,750
Yo. Good morning, everyone.

163
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,875
Hey, as of today, Azusa's
allowed to have visitors.

164
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,833
Oh. Cool.

165
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,708
[phone vibrates]

166
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,875
[BROTHERS gasp]

167
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,750
[phone vibrating]

168
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,916
Ugh...

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,958
[vibrating continues]

170
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,916
Would you give it a rest?

171
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,541
[phone ringing]

172
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,625
[TSUBAKI] You have got
to be freakin' kidding me.

173
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,500
Hello? I told you.

174
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,833
You can keep asking,
but I'm gonna say no.

175
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:14,958
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,375
You're already
talking about finding

177
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,958
a replacement for my brother?

178
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,375
Think you could give him
a few days to recuperate?

179
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,750
Hey, be honest. Deep down,
you want the role.

180
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,500
[TSUBAKI gasps]

181
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,750
Pathetic.

182
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,041
That kind of attitude
can only hold you back.

183
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,875
[yelps, pants]

184
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,208
Oh man. It's just a dream.

185
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,375
Masaomi?

186
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,416
You're awake.

187
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
[TSUBAKI]
Yeah. Mostly.

188
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,291
Look.

189
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,958
There's no easy way
to break this to you.

190
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,875
Azusa. Well, he passed away.

191
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,458
No. That can't be.

192
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:57,416
[yelps] Again? Oh man.

193
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,291
Just a nightmare. Dumb brain.

194
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,625
Hey, Tsubaki.

195
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,708
[gasps] Oh, Hey. I just
had the most awful dream.

196
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,958
I'm so sorry. Truly.

197
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,708
But I can't go out
with you, Tsubaki.

198
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,666
[gasps]

199
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,750
[yells]

200
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,041
Uh...

201
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,041
Natsume? Hey.

202
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,166
No offense, man, but what
are you doing here?

203
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,083
Oh calm down, I just
thought I'd swing by

204
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,833
and see how you were.

205
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:23,625
Stop that!

206
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,208
Good. You felt that?

207
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,166
So this isn't
another dream, then?

208
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,375
Traditionally,

209
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,375
you're the one who's
supposed to get pinched.

210
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,625
[AZUSA]
Yeah, so.

211
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,458
According to Masaomi,
I have a condition

212
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,041
known as meningitis.

213
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,166
[EMA]
What's that mean? Meningitis?

214
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,583
To put it in layman's terms,
it's basically a disease

215
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,125
that causes the membrane
around the brain to swell.

216
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,750
Wow. Sounds awful.
That seems pretty serious.

217
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,416
Yeah. But with treatment,

218
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm told I can expect
almost no after effects.

219
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,041
They said with modern medicine,

220
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,541
I don't have too much
to worry about.

221
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,416
Oh, good, what a huge relief.

222
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,166
As far as work's concerned.

223
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,958
The timing couldn't
be any worse.

224
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,458
[AZUSA] But there's not much
point in fretting about it.

225
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,250
The only thing that's
left for me to do now

226
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,666
is get better as
quickly as possible.

227
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,541
I think that you're right!

228
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,375
[AZUSA] Oh, by the way.
How are things?

229
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,750
At home, I mean.

230
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,125
[EMA]
Same as usual, I guess.

231
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,791
[EMA]
So, uh...

232
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,958
[AZUSA]
What is it?

233
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,208
Well, he, uh...

234
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,750
By "he" you mean Tsubaki?

235
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,458
[gasps] Yes.

236
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,750
He's depressed.

237
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,666
The whole thing's
just gnawing at him.

238
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,375
He feels responsible

239
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,041
for everything that's
happened to you.

240
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,666
I had a feeling.

241
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,083
[EMA] He thinks he caused
you too much stress.

242
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,041
And it's all because of the
situation that's developed.

243
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,000
[AZUSA]
Situation?

244
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,208
[EMA]
Yeah, you know.

245
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,250
Like with the lead role
in that anime.

246
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,083
And, uh...

247
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,916
[AZUSA]
I have a question.

248
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,708
I'd like to know how you
really feel about Tsubaki.

249
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,708
[EMA] I, I love him just
like an older brother.

250
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:12,958
[AZUSA]
What about as a man?

251
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,958
[EMA] I never thought
of him that way at all.

252
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:18,833
That's why...

253
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,708
I'm grateful you stopped
him that one evening

254
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,666
when we ended up on the couch.

255
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,875
[AZUSA] Listen to me.
You've got it wrong.

256
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,375
I don't want you
thinking I'm some

257
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,375
selfless hero or something.

258
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,166
It's just like Tsubaki told you.

259
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,166
I was butting in
because I was jealous.

260
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,416
[gsaps]

261
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm jealous. Because I am
in love with you!

262
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,708
Not as your step-brother.
But as a man!

263
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,666
[gasps] I'm sorry.

264
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,166
I should've kept my mouth shut.

265
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,791
I just wanted you to know.
Tsubaki's not alone.

266
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,041
Several of us have developed

267
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,958
those kinds of
feelings for you lately.

268
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,500
And clearly that kind of
attention bothers you.

269
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,166
I apologize.

270
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,125
[sighs]

271
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,750
[NATSUME] I see your room
is as messy as ever.

272
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,750
Can't walk without
stepping on something.

273
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,875
Hey, man, would you stop
trying to clean up?

274
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,625
There's something
soothing about the chaos.

275
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,125
So.

276
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,750
Are you planning on going to
the hospital to visit Azusa?

277
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,125
I don't see why I should.

278
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,875
What? Why the hell not?

279
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,541
[sighs] 'Cause it's
all my fault!

280
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,916
Don't know how to fix
everything I screwed up.

281
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,375
Right. Spill it.

282
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,916
What in the world happened
between you and him, anyway?

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,166
It's weird. I don't know.

284
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,375
Was it over her?

285
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,541
Look, I'm not trying
to be nosy. It's just...

286
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,625
I mean come on, you know him.

287
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,875
He'd never let a
girl get between you.

288
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,625
He just wants you
to be happy, man,

289
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,375
can't you see that?

290
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,625
[gasps]

291
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,916
When I went to
visit him yesterday,

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,208
he kept asking me
how you were doing.

293
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,250
As if the entire reason for me
to visit was to talk about you.

294
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,375
[TSUBAKI]
But he's sick!

295
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,375
And he's worried about me?

296
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,583
[NATSUME]
Yep. Think about that.

297
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,875
[TSUBAKI]
God, I'm the worst.

298
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,958
Yeah, maybe you are the worst.

299
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,958
The real issue, though,
isn't what you did.

300
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,500
It's what you're going
to do moving forward.

301

--[gasps]
--[door clicks]

302
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,083
What can I do? If only I
had some kind of a sign.

303
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:26,916
[phone vibrates]

304
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,333
[KANAME] Welcome back,
my darling Little Sis!

305
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,666
Hi Kaname! Are you
heading out tonight?

306
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,125
Yes. Nighttime monkly duties.

307
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,708
Oh! Cool.

308
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,333
You went to visit Azusa,
isn't that right?

309
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,458
So what did you think?
Is he well?

310
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,333
Yes. He seemed much better.

311
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,958
I'm glad to hear it.

312
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,583
[EMA] Tsubaki! Are you
heading out too?

313
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,208
Yeah. Just for a bit.

314
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,500
[EMA]
So, uh...

315
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't worry.

316
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,916
I'm gonna go and
pay him a visit soon.

317
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,916
I promise I will.

318
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,333
[sighs]

319
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,083
But there's something else
I have to do before I go.

320
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,750
It looks like Tsubaki's
going to be just fine, too.

321
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,291
[MASAOMI groans]

322
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,625
[JULI]
Hm...

323
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,250
[EMA]
Good morning, Masaomi!

324
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,833
[yawns]

325
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,458
Hey! This one's been
sitting here looking puzzled

326
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,000
for about an hour now.

327
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,666
Is everything all right?

328
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,541
Azusa emailed me
a list of things

329
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,583
he wanted me to
bring to the hospital.

330
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,416
But I don't know what
any of this means.

331
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,666
[YUSUKE]
What the?

332
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, yeah.

333
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,625
These are a bunch of comic
and light novel titles.

334
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,791
And everything else on the list

335
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,958
are just anime DVDs
he wants us to grab.

336
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,250
I see.

337
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,750
He's using this down time
to do some research

338
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,458
for work down the line.

339
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:56,375
But as a physician, I'd rather
he get some rest instead.

340
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,125
I really hate to ask.
But could you take care of it?

341
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,291
I still can't make heads
or tails of this list.

342
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,833
I'd be glad to.

343
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,083
That's a bunch of stuff.

344
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,708
Hunting it down
alone would suck.

345
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,208
I guess I could help you out.

346
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,291
Great, thank you!

347
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,041
We're just doing
Azusa a favor, 'kay?

348
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,541
[YUSUKE]
I think Masaomi is right.

349
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,125
Azusa should prolly take it
easy while he's still sick.

350
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,500
[EMA]
He just needs something to help

351
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,500
waste away the time.
I bet he's feeling restless.

352
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,750
[YUSUKE]
It's weird.

353
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,166
You seem like you
really understand

354
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,791
my big brothers, y'know?
Better than I do, in some ways.

355
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,666
Huh?

356
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,208
[YUSUKE]
Nah. Forget it.

357
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,625
[BOTH]
Found it!

358
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,833
Next stop is a video store.

359
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,625
We may have to go to
a few different places

360
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,166
to get the ones he asked for.

361
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,416
But first, maybe we should
drop off the comics we got him.

362
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,791
Good idea.

363
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,958
[gasps]

364
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,541
[AZUSA]
I missed you.

365
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,791
[TSUBAKI] Idiot. That's
supposed to be my line.

366
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,583
When you collapsed
the other day.

367
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:58,333
I... just couldn't think
straight anymore. You know?

368
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,416
I'm sorry... that I bailed.

369
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,041
Doesn't matter anymore.
Because you're here now.

370
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,958
I'm sorry. So sorry
I didn't listen to you.

371
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,416
For flat out ignoring you.
And being a total pain.

372
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,708
I should've said something
about it earlier.

373
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,583
Calling you out in front
of her like that?

374
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,833
Anybody'd get upset.

375
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,666
No. Dude. Even if
she wasn't there.

376
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,625
I still would've
been too defensive.

377
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,916
I was dumb. I'm so sorry.

378
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,458
[AZUSA]
Give yourself a break, okay?

379
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,666
I don't blame you for any of it.

380
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,875
It's not like I'm
innocent in all this.

381
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,125
We just got too
emotionally involved.

382
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,291
I love you, man.

383
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:53,125
[EMA] I'm glad they made up.
I'll leave them alone.

384
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,166
[car honks]

385
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,375
[NATSUME] Yo! Hop on in.
I'll give ya a ride back home.

386
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,625
So Tsubaki finally
went to see him?

387
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,875
I thought he might do that.

388
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,750
Why, did something happen?

389
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,541
I heard it through the grapevine
around the studio the other day.

390
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,875
The director's settled on
Tsubaki to replace Azusa.

391
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,666
Wait. Isn't that bad news?

392
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,750
It'll all work itself
out from here.

393
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,333
I guess they just had
to learn the hard way

394
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,041
to be there for each other.

395
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,291
You're right.

396
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,333
You can call it a gut feeling,

397
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,500
but I don't really need
anything more concrete.

398
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,375
I mean we're still
triplets, after all.

399
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,166
[EMA] You mean the
sharing one soul thing?

400
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,458
[NATSUME]
What are you talkin' about?

401
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,375
Tsubaki told me all about it.

402
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,083
He said that siblings
born at the same time

403
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,458
share the same soul.

404
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,750
Ha. I imagine he was
referring to his bond

405
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,375
with Azusa, but then
again. Scary thought.

406
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,708
What if I am linked up
with those two weirdos?

407
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,375
[laughs]

408
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,833
[NATSUME]
That's what I like to see.

409
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,541
Your smile gives
us all strength.

410
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,333
You think you can keep
that positive energy?

411
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,291
You have no idea
how much it'll help.

412
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,583
Guess I can try.

413
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:58,875
Well I'd appreciate it.

414
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,791
Because your smile is
a lot easier on the eyes

415
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,291
than mine is.

416
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,833
Oh goody, Big sis is home!

417
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,708
Are those manga?
I wanna see! I love manga!

418
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,833
We picked these up
just for Azusa.

419
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,416
[WATARU]
Oh, they're for Azusa.

420
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,291
Yeah, I get it.

421
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,458
[YUSUKE]
What gives?

422
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,625
I thought you were gonna
give those to him!

423
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,500
I was, but Tsubaki was there.
I didn't want to disturb them.

424
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,416
For real? Tsubaki finally went?

425
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,791
He really went to see him?
Well, that's a huge relief!

426
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:32,666
Yeah.

427
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,166
Ah. By the way.

428
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,916
To apply for a passport,
you'll need the family register.

429
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,250
So I had a copy of it
sent to our offices.

430
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,250
When you have the time,
just swing by and pick it up.

431
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,333
Oh, that was
thoughtful of you!

432
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,791
[AZUSA] Yeah. I think
that's a strong approach.

433
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,041
Uh-huh. I wrestled
with that phrasing too.

434
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,541
But in the previous episode,

435
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,791
you've got the same back and
forth with the chief and...

436
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, yeah, get back to the booth!

437
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,125
Yeah. Sure, break a leg!

438
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,583
[EMA]
There you are!

439
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,083
Well, this is a nice surprise!

440
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,083
Hello! I brought you the DVDs
and stuff you asked for.

441
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,541
[AZUSA]
Wow! Thank you.

442
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,791
But don't tell me you
bought them all yourself!

443
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,000
I did! But I never would
have found them all

444
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,625
if Yusuke hadn't helped me out.

445
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,250
[AZUSA]
I see. And where is he?

446
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,500
He had planned to come
with me for today's visit.

447
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,291
But his mini-test results
weren't what he was hoping.

448
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,125
Ugh! I hate math!

449
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,375
So he had to stay
for study group.

450
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,416
[AZUSA]
Sounds about right.

451
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,708
Was that a work phone call
that I walked in on?

452
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,708
Not quite. It was Tsubaki.

453
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,208
Oh? Tsubaki?

454
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,875
He called from the job.
Looking for my advice.

455
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,458
Are you talking about the
lead role in that anime?

456
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,000
[AZUSA] Mm-hm. He's doing
some excellent work.

457
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,750
Rather than copying
the same nuances

458
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,291
I was going for in my reads,

459
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,083
he's completely made the
role his own, on his terms,

460
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,416
while paying homage to
the groundwork I laid.

461
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,875
From time to time,

462
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,083
he'll call me up out of the
blue just to pick my brain

463
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,500
over some line in the script.

464
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,416
And that's just like him.

465
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,041
I have a new
found appreciation

466
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,916
for how talented
he is. But then,

467
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,666
there's this other feeling,
deep in my gut, growing slowly.

468
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,458
What other feeling is that?

469
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,791
[AZUSA]
I never want to lose Tsubaki.

470
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,333
[EMA]
Of course not!

471
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,000
[AZUSA]
But... I can't.

472
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,916
I can't give up the
way I feel about you.

473
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:20,958
[gasps]

474
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,250
[AZUSA]
I'm through making apologies.

475
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:28,000
I love you. And I'm
not afraid to say it.

476
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,583
[gasps]

477
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,375
I don't want you to feel rushed.
Think about it. If you want me,

478
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,333
I'll be here waiting.

479
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,291
[CLERK 8A] You must be
Mister Asahina's sister.

480
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,708
He said you'd come.
This envelope's for you.

481
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,125
Oh, thank you very much.

482
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,333
I wonder what they have
to put in an official copy

483
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,875
of a family register.

484
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,000
I've never even looked at one.

485
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,833
[gasps]

486
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,291
[LOUIS]
Kaname, you're like, a monk.

487
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,333
What do you think about going

488
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,166
with a close-cropped
look for once?

489
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,500
[KANAME]
What?

490
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,041
But the ladies love my
flowing locks, I couldn't!

491
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,041
[LOUIS] Sure, but the ladies
also like a bit of style, too.

492
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,791
Like maybe cornrows,
or a zigzag pattern buzz?

493
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,000
[KANAME]
Put me down as a no.
