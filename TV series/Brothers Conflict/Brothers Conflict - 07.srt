1
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:23,291
[FUTO] Don't even bother,
you're too stupid for her.

2
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,833
[YUSUKE]
And, you're nothing but a sick,

3
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,750
twisted bastard.
She could never love you.

4
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,000
[FUTO] You'll have to choose
one of us eventually.

5
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,750
So hurry up and decide.

6
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,291
[YUSUKE] I'll wait for you
as long as it takes.

7
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,166
[FUTO, YUSUKE]
I love you forever.

8
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,875
[EMA] Of course you do.
After all, we're family.

9
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,250
[FUTO chuckles] Wow.
Who'd've thought we'd ever

10
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,666
lounge around and watch
the sun rise together?

11
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,958
It's like a dream come true.

12
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,708
I love you. Do you know that?

13
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,958
Always have. Always will.
Till the end of time.

14
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,125
[VOICE OVER 7A]
Looking to make memories

15
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,375
with that special someone?

16
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,083
Then try Pan Pacific
Travel Service.

17
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,875
[YUSUKE]
Ugh! What a load of crap!

18
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,833
[KANAME]
Heh. Any work is good work.

19
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,750
Let's watch it again!

20
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,125
[FUTO chuckles]
Wow. Who'd've thought--

21
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,500
[YUSUKE]
Okay, no more!

22
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,666
[WATARU]
Hey!

23
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,166
[YUSUKE] Look, I'm
really sorry, but if you

24
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,208
make me watch
that garbage again,

25
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,291
I'm gonna puke in my mouth!

26
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,291
What? But Fu's like, super cool!

27
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,958
And every one at school
thinks I'm the greatest

28
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,541
'cause I'm his little brother!
They're totally jealous!

29
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,583
Well. Then they're all stupid.

30
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,416
Yeah, but this
commercial has been

31
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,625
pretty successful, right?

32
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,791
That's true.

33
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,625
And he's real popular
with older women.

34
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,291
It's like they can't
keep their hands off him.

35
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,500
[UKYO] Pan Pacific took
a risk with Futo.

36
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,916
[EMA]
What makes you say that?

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,916
[UKYO] They've done lots
of commercials before,

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,541
but they've never
hired a celebrity

39
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,333
to be the face of their brand.

40
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,250
He really is something else.

41
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,041
[UKYO] Indeed he is.
The gamble paid off though,

42
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,583
because the
New Caledonia resort,

43
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,958
where the commercial was shot,
has been selling like crazy.

44
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,166
Wow, that's amazing!

45
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,583
Lame.

46
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,291
It's not like the dude landed
on the moon or anything.

47
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,916
Look out everybody,
bitter, party of one?

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,458
I just tell it like it is!

49
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,000
[MASAOMI]
Yusuke.

50
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,291
Cut the crap. You're
Futo's older brother.

51
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,625
the least you could do is
pretend to be happy for him.

52
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,916
Yeah, whatever.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,625
Hey guys! Look how
pretty that water is.

54
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,375
We oughtta take
a family vacation!

55
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,916
To "New Calorie" resort!

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,666
That's not a place.
You mean "New Caledonia!"

57
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,291
Hey, Sis. We could go,
just the two of us.

58
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,625
That sound like fun?

59
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,500
No, thank you, I think I'm good.

60
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,250
Guys. Why not go
overseas? All of us.

61
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,041
Huh?

--Huh?
--Huh?

63
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,250

Wow! Really?

"New Currie"
resort here we come!

65
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,916
[UKYO]
So you mean the entire family?

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,083
[MASAOMI]
Mm-hm.

67
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,791
Summer break is right
around the corner.

68
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,916
Hey. Tell us what you think.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,500
You are the one I aim
to please, after all.

70
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,916
I'm sure you have
exams to think about.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,791
But, you know, sometimes a break
is exactly what the mind needs.

72
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,833
[YUSUKE]
Yeah. I guess.

73
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,833
So, what's the deal?

74
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,416
How do you feel about
the trip thing?

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,041
[EMA]
Huh?

76
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,125
Come on.

77
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,208
Masaomi's whole
vacation idea, you in?

78
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,500
Oh, yeah.

79
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,875
Well, I would like to go,
but I have my exams.

80
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,750
But, ya know, when you
really think about it.

81
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,500
A little "r and r"
in paradise could be

82
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,208
a good way to clear our heads.

83
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,458
Speaking of.

84
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,625
Nobody thought to ask--
do you have a passport?

85
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,458
Oh. I don't have one.

86
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,916
Heh. Don't worry about it.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,500
I'm sure we'll
figure something out.

88
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,500
Ukyo. He can help!

89
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,666
And then you and I'll
be paradise bound!

90
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,875
Yeah, that's true. It'll be fun!

91
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,708
[YUSUKE] Resorts are
usually near a beach.

92
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,291
Which means she'd
be wearing a bikini.

93
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,208
[FUTO] Well, well, well,
if it isn't my idiot brother.

[FUTO] Don't pretend like
I didn't just catch you

ashamed of yourself!

Dude. Shut your hole.

100
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,041
Tell me I'm wrong.

101
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,416
Cause when I walked up,
I'm pretty sure

102
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,083
you were checking out
our sis's back side

103

You deaf?

you to 'shut it!'

Hey look! Is that Futo Asakura?

Whoa. That is him!

108
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,208
Not nice to beat up
on a national treasure.

109
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,125
Relax, big bro.

[GIRL 7C] Futo! Is that
really your older brother?

112
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,833
Yep.

113
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,583
I look up to this guy
more than anyone else.

with your exams, buddy.

116
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,583
Don't fail.

117
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,125
[SASAKURA] The Culture Festival
is next month, guys,

118
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,125
but I promise it'll be
here before you know it.

119
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,291
And we still
haven't even decided

120

what our class
project's gonna be.

121

This will be your
last Culture Fest.

122
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,291
So, if I were in your shoes,
I'd wanna make it count.

123
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,875
Be sure to pick something
you'll be proud of

124
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,666
when it's all said and done.

125
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,791
Wow, I can't believe
this is our last one.

126
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,333
Time flies.

127
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,791
What was that Yusuke?
Do you have an idea to share?

128
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:45,291
Oh. Well, uh, not really, no.

129
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,791
We could do a café.
That might be rad.

130
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,708
Great idea!
Not bad at all, man!

131
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,958
[IMAI]
Ooh! Ooh!

132
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,000
[SASAKURA]
Imai? What's up?

133
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,875
I like the idea,
but we can't just do

134
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,541
a regular boring cafe.

135
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,875
I say we spice things
up a little bit!

136
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,166
Here's an idea:

137
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,625
We'll do a butler café instead!

138
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,750
Aw, great.

139
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,791
I was worried she
was gonna say that.

140
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,791
[FEMALE STUDENTS]
Ooh!

141
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,541
[SASAKURA]
We're screwed.

142
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,000
Votes are in, everybody.

143
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,458
The Butler Café wins the day!

144
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,500
[FEMALE STUDENTS]
Yay!

145
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,916
Man, this sucks.

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,291
Our bikini carwash idea
didn't stand a chance.

147
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,250
[IMAI] Hey, you're Futo's
big brother, right?

148
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,166
Huh?

149
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,666
We won that vote
fair and square,

150

so get your costume ready!

What the heck
does my little brother

152
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,541
have to do with this?

153
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,083
I think this'll be a
really fun thing to do.

154
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,166
Uh. Yeah.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,875
[UKYO] A butler café?
Sounds interesting.

156
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,875
[YUSUKE] And by "interesting"
you mean "dumb." Right?

157
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,416
[KANAME] There's one thing
I don't understand.

158
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,250
Aren't butler cafés

00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,458
[TSUBAKI]
Hey.

476
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,666
[EMA]
What?

477
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,791
Do you feel like telling me

478
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,166
who gave you that
hickey on your neck?

479
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,875
[gasps]

480
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,791
What, don't have
anything to say?

481
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,791
You know how painful this
stuff is for me, don't you?

482
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,041
Listen, I'm not happy
about the way it happened.

483
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,291
But I meant every single
word I said to you before.

484
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,875
So I want you to give
me an honest answer.

485
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,250
But Tsubaki, I--

486
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,875
[AZUSA] What exactly do
you think you're doing?

487
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:43,750
[TSUBAKI] Azusa. Why don't
you mind your own business?

488
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,500
She looks upset and that
makes it my business.

489
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,500
Back off. Do the right thing
and leave her alone.

490
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,250
Don't tell me to
leave her alone!

491
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,250
This doesn't have anything
to do with you, okay?

492
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,708
Tsubaki. Listen to me.

493
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,125
What is it with you, man?
What's your deal?

494
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,958
Why do you act all weird
when it comes to her?

495
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,500
Why are you protective?

496
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,916
Maybe you want the
same thing I do.

497
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,291
you're just too damn
scared to admit it!

498
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,666
[AZUSA]
You're wrong.

499
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,791
I'm acting like this 'cause
I'm worried about you.

500
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,666
Huh?

501
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,125
[AZUSA]
Yeah, I act weird.

502
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,500
'Cause when you
treat her like this,

503
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,375
I honestly don't
know what to say.

504
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,375
Stop being a jerk
and just think.

505
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,625
Think about how you might
be making her feel!

506
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,833
She's your family.

507
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:20,916
Shut up!

508
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,541
No. I won't.

509
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,333
I don't care what
you think anyway.

510
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,166
Leave me the hell alone.

511
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,541
I'm trying to help. Can't you--

512
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,250
[gasps]

513
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,208
[AZUSA grunts]

514
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,291
[TSUBAKI]
Azusa?

515
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:41,666
Leave her be.

516
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,333
[EMA, TSUBAKI gasp]

517
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,125
[gasps]

518
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:26,416
[AZUSA gasping]

519
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,416
No, please.

520
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,875
[TSUBAKI] It's true it might
be a risky operation.

521
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,125
but we have no other
choice but to do it!

522
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,333
[AZUSA]
Right now isn't a good time.

523
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,500
[TSUBAKI]
Listen to me!

524
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,000
I didn't become a
doctor just to stand by

525
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,500
and watch my patients die!

526
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,583
[AZUSA] I appreciate your
passion, but you and I both know

527
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,625
you're not a doctor,
so cut it out.
