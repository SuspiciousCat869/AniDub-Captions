And Futo was less than pleased
that his cover had been blown.

19
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,875

shocking things to say to me.

As punishment, you'll have

Don't do it, Chii!

If you let a wolf like

a reason to be upset.

[EMA]
It's so surreal.

67
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,541
A few days ago,
Futo was a handsome face

68
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,833
shining from the TV,
and now he's right here.

69
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,500
[FUTO] I gotta say,
that was incredible!

70
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,333
Right? I mean that last scene.

71
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,791
The one where
the main character

72
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,208
was just lounging around?

73
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,125
You don't even have
a clue, do you?

74
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,791
Non-industry types never do.
Acting natural in casual scenes

75
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,583
is always the hardest
part of the job.

76
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,166
I hadn't thought of that.

77
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,916
[FUTO] Scenes where all you're
doin' is walking and sitting;

those are the parts where
you see how good someone is.

79
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,166
Because if you're
faking your way through

80
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,000

it's transparent.

and I've come up short.

I'm just as good as him.

00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,541
You're one of the
beasts I have my eye on.

161
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,041
Because, you know,

162
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:22,750
it's my job as her brother.
Don't you think?

163
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,208
Come on. Trust me.

164
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,041
[JULI] We have a
gentlemen's agreement.

Good. Pleasure working with ya.

[SCHOOL BELL ringing]

167
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,916
[YUSUKE groans] This is
pointless. I can't choose.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,166
[EMA] Trying to pick
which school to go to?

169
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,250
[yelps] Uh. I, mean,
hello what's up?

170
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,625
What about you? Have you picked?

171
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,666
[EMA]
Well, more or less.

172
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,375
So is there something
you wanted from me?

173
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,958
Yeah. I wanted to ask for
your advice about whose name

174
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,875
I should put down
under "Guardian."

175
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:57,958
[YUSUKE]
Oh yeah.

176
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,375
Your old man's
been workin' overseas

177
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,708
for a while now, huh?

178
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,208
[EMA] He said he wouldn't
be able to make it back

179
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,041
until next month,
for the wedding.

180
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,583
[YUSUKE]
Gotcha.

181
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,333
So he's pretty much comin' back
just in time to get hitched.

182
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,333
Yeah. I can't wait
for him to get back.

183
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,208
It feels like forever
since I've seen him!

184
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,625
Right.

185
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,208
It's kinda the same for me
and my brothers sometimes.

186
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,666
For now, why don't you just
put Masaomi's name down?

187
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,375
I'll ask him to deal with it.

188
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,958
What? On my form?

189
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,041
He wouldn't mind?

[YUSUKE]
Hey, it's no problem!

191

Our parents are getting
married, aren't they?

192

We'll all be family soon enough!

193
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,333
So no sweat.

194
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,833
[EMA] Of course.
You're absolutely right.

195
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,041
Oh, I appreciate it, Yusuke!

196
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,500
Hey. No skin off my back,
not like it's a big deal.

197
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,250
Well, it is a big deal to me.
Anyway, thanks again!

No problem at all, little lady.

If there's anything else you
need, don't hesitate to ask.

These parent-teacher
conference things.

I never thought they
were a ton of fun.

211
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,458
Far from it.
They're actually boring.

212

It's been so long since
I had anyone around to go.

you doing here, Kaname?

And I happened to be free, so
he asked me to fill in for him.

four of us in one meeting?

up any more time than necessary.

Yes. That's right.

00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,916
[KANAME] Did you choose it
because Subaru is there?

If that's the case, I'll cry.

mean to gush like that.

definitely the toughest one.
