Oh, I'm sorry.

314
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,416
I really don't know
a lot about basketball.

315
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,583
I may not be right.

316
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,958
Oh, no, you're right.

317
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,041
And there's no need to
apologize for being excited.

318
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,083
Uh-oh, looks like we might
be in for some rain.

319
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,250
You want a ride?
My car's parked nearby.

320
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,083
[EMA] Oh, no, thank you.
But I'll be fine.

321
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,208
Why are you being ridiculous?
You'd rather get wet?

322
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,625
No. Guess not.

323
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,333
[phone rings]

324
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,541
I've gotta take this
it's business.

325
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,541
You mind hangin' out here
for just a bit longer?

326
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,666
Yes. This is Asahina.

327
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,416
[SUBARU]
Hey!

328
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,875
[EMA]
Subaru!

329
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,500
Did you watch me?

330
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,458
I did. You were amazing.

331
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,333
[SUBARU]
Thank you. I owe it all to you.

332
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,416
[EMA]
What?

333
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,791
[SUBARU]
We won because you were here.

334
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,125
Because you watched the game.

335
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,125
You're why I played
so well again.

336
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,791
[EMA]
I-I'm sure that's not, um...

337
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,875
[SUBARU]
So, hey.

338
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,166
I have something that
I wanna ask you about.

339
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:19,916
'Kay.

340
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,875
[SUBARU]
It's just, um...

341
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,541
Do you have, like, a
boyfriend or whatever?

342
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,541
I need to know.

343
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,541
No, but I don't get
why that's important.

344
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,958
Well the thing is, I kind of...

345
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,791
I don't know how
to say this, but...

346
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,333
I want you, I need
you to be with me.

347
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,500
[NATSUME]
Subaru.

348
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,166
[SUBARU] Natsume.
What are you doing here?

349
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm wondering the same thing.
Why are you out here?

350
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,666
Why aren't you
with your teammates?

351
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,916
Celebrating your big win?

352
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,708
You should be with
your team manager.

353
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,708
And with your coach.
Thanking them.

354
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,916
[SUBARU]
Yeah, I know that.

355
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,958
[NATSUME] Don't lose
your head just because

356
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,208
you had one good game.
Focus, man.

357
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,708
This is only round two.

358
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,000
You can't even
celebrate anything yet.

359
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,000
Get your butt back in there.
Save all this drama.

360
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,333
You can waste your time with
that stuff when you're great.

361
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,666
And you're not great, yet.

362
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,250
I don't have to take
this from some loser

363
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,791
who gave up on the game.

364
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,708
You may not have to,
but you will.

365
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,000
Because even as a loser,
I never pulled this crap.

366
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,041
[sighs] I'm so sick of this.

367
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,708
Think about what
I said earlier, okay?

368
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,666
So, how 'bout it?

369
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,000
Are you goin' out
with Subaru or what?

370
00:20:56,041 --> 00:21:01,833
I don't-- I don't know
what's going on anymore.

371
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,083
I mean he's my brother.

372
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,166
This is so confusing.

373
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,708
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,333
The last thing I wanted
to do was to upset you.

375
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,291
I hope you can forgive me.

376
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,791
Now listen up, Jack!

377
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,375
Don't let that fact
that Chii cheered you on

378
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,208
go to your head, do ya feel me?

379
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,500
So guess what, Juli. Earlier?

380
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,708
I asked your best friend if
she wanted to go out with me.

381
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:24,083
[JULI hissing] Bastard face!
How dare you harass my Chii?

382
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:27,375
Well, how would you feel
if the two of us got together?

383
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,000
Homicidal!

384
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,708
[UKYO] Who's responsible
for making this rolled omelet?

385
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,750
[NATSUME] Um, I am.
What's wrong? Is it bad?

386
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,833
[UKYO] It is extremely bad.
You live alone, Natsume.

387
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,583
If you go around making
rolled omelets like this,

388
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,916
where does that leave me?

389
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,541
[NATSUME]
So you're saying it's good.
