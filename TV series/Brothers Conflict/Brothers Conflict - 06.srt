True, I may be the
hopeless eldest son.

But you make me want
to be a better man.

3
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,583
And I may be the
youngest brother,

4
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,708
but I'm not a
little kid anymore!

We can see each other
whenever we want.

00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,291
Maybe when I grow up,

00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,333
I'll be able to
take care of you!

I just want you to be happy.

Of course we love each other.

shiny and new, don't they?

[giggles] I bet two years ago
the seniors were saying

16
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:35,750
the same thing about us.

[YUSUKE]
Huh?

00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,958
What? Azusa?

Yes. Top of the morning.

What's wrong? Do I have
something on my face?

22
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,041
Uh-- No!

23
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,250
It's just that you look much
more formal than usual.

24
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,333
Yeah!

25
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,750
Why are you all
dressed up like that?

And more importantly,
what the heck're you doing here

in the first place?

28
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,875
[AZUSA] I hadn't planned
on being the one

to school today.

much of a choice.

too busy to make it in time.

00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,250
Apparently, I'm fourth in
line to play your guardian.

You're our guardian? For what?

Azusa, come on.

36
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,250
You're sorta confusing
us here, dude.

I don't get what's
confusing about this.

Uh, what the hell?

Surprise. Does it
make more sense now?

Isn't that Futo Asakura?

No way!

It's Futo.

be freakin' kiddin' me, man!

Hey, good morning, guys!

00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,166
I am super-psyched about
my first day at Hinode High.

50
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,458
My name's Futo Asahina.

51
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,666
I should be in the
roster here. Right there.

[gasps] Why do I have the
feeling something really bad

53
00:03:55,041 --> 00:04:00,375
is about to happen?
Chii! Please stay safe!

Chii!

[sighs] That was weird.

00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,666
Were you as shocked as
I was, or did you know

57
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,375
Futo decided to come here?

58
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,875
You kidding? I had no clue
this was gonna go down.

59
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,583
Man, as if being
related to a pop star

60
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,875
isn't punishment enough.

61
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,875
Sometimes I really hate
that smarmy jerkwad

62
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,041
No, you don't.

63
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,875
This is Futo's first
day of high school,

64
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,750
so why don't we partner up
to show him around and stuff.

65
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,166
It might not be what we wanted,

but at least we're almost
out of this place.

Yeah. I guess that's
one way to look at it.

68
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,750
Speaking of what we want,

69
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,833
didn't you go to Subaru's
game the other day?

70

How'd that go? It's not
really my business.

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,708
But ever since then,
things have seemed a bit off.

around each other.

But running into you out here
beneath the tree's shade

was definitely a happy accident.

I've been getting
taller recently.

Know what that means?
Now I can do this!

Much better for my leading
ladies, don't you think?

You wanna run,
now's your chance.

So? You're not gonna run, huh?

don't mind if I make a move?

much else for that matter!

What? You really want to?

159
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,958
Absolutely!

160
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,541
We should have some
of Mom's old frames

161
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,833
lying around this place.
I'll start looking for them.

162
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,000
[EMA]
Okay!

163
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:10,791
[MASAOMI]
Hm. Yeah. A little dusty, but.

164
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,666
[EMA]
Wow!

165
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,208
And take a look at
what else I found

166
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,875
lying around in here!

167
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,000
[TSUBAKI] The party's here,
guys! Well, well, well.

168
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,125
Looks like you already
started without me.

169
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,000
Are we having fun?

170
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,000
[EMA]
Yeah!

171
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,000
[MASAOMI]
Welcome home!

172
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,000
[WATARU]
We found photo albums!

173
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:33,041
Aw! How cute! Is that
you holding baby Yusuke?

174
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,291
Yep, that's right.

175
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,291
[gasps] What else you
do you have in there?

176
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,583
What about me?
Show my pictures!

177
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,000
[MASAOMI] I think all our
photos of you are in this album.

178
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,125
[WATARU] Hey, there aren't
very many pictures of me.

179
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,625
You haven't been
alive long enough

180
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,541
to have that many taken.

181
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,916
[EMA]
Huh. There's Natsume and Subaru.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,583
Yeah. Back when
Subaru was younger,

183
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,833
those two kids were
practically inseparable.

184
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,583
Really? I had no idea.

185
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,625
What's this? It was just
loose between the pages.

186
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,166
Is that Tsubaki?

187
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,250
[MASAOMI]
No, I think it's Azusa.

188
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,333
[KANAME] We don't have
too many pictures of him.

189
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,583
Alone, that is.

190
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,333
[HIKARU]
Growing up, Tsubaki and Azusa

191
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,041
were stuck together like glue.

192
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,833
You're the one who took this,
aren't you, Tsubaki?

193
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,333
See? It's blurred.

194
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,916
That's why it wasn't
kept in the sleeves.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,791
[TSUBAKI]
Hey. I was a kid!

196
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,208
[HIKARU] I guess Mom
couldn't bring herself

197
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,375
to throw it away.

198
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,416
Oh, come on. Maybe I
was being artistic.

199
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,208
It's got a certain style to it.

200
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,166
Oh, I like it.

201
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,791
After all, I don't have
too many photos of myself

202
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,041
from when I was little.

203
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,166
Let alone enough for an album.

204
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:41,083
I admit, I'm a little
jealous. Must be nice.

205
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,000
I hope we can pack
more albums full

206
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,541
of happy memories like these.

207
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,291
Do you want to keep it?
That photo of me?

208
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,291
[BROTHERS gasp]

209
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,458
Huh?

210
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,458
Oh. That wasn't what
you meant, was it?

211
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,958
Sorry if I made things weird.

212
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,500
No. I'd like that.

213
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,666
But is it really okay
for me to keep it?

214
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,750
[gasps]

215
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,458
Of course it is! If you
want it, then it's yours.

216
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,208
What do we have here?

217
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,291
Are you trying to
steal her heart?

218
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,791
[AZUSA]
What? No, man, you're demented.

219
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,166
Azusa, you sly old dog!

220
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,583
What's going on?

221
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,583
[laughs]

222
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,250
[AZUSA]
Well. Good night.

223
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:28,125
[TSUBAKI] Don't let 'em bite.
Hey, so listen.

224
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,333
Just so you know.

225
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,750
I'm not backing down
when it comes to her.

226
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,833
Not for anybody in the world.
Not even for you, Azusa.

227
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,250
Do you understand?

228
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,500
Very well, then.

229
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,250
[giggles]

230
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,166
[JULI]
You look pretty chipper, Chii!

231
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,875
Yeah. I am.

232
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,333
Growing up alone I
never had any siblings.

233
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,625
Much less pictures
of them as kids.

234
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,500
It just makes us
feel more like family!

235
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:06,041
[JULI yawns] That's nice.
Just don't stay up too late.

236
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,125
[EMA] We need to finish those
leeks before they go bad.

237
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,041
Maybe I'll make some
leek and tofu miso soup

238
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,791
for dinner tonight.

239
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,500
[SUBARU]
Why are you here?

240
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,041
[NATSUME] I do like to come
home every once in a while.

241
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,666
Plus I have something
I need to drop off.

242
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,791
Why are they just
standing there outside?

243
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,916
So then, how are things?

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,541
None of your business.

245
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,666
Look, I know you're holding crap
I did in the past against me.

246
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,333
But I don't know what
I'm supposed to say

247
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,166
that's gonna change that.

248
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,916
And the problem
you've got right now,

249
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,375
you did to yourself.

250
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,791
If you plan on seriously
pursuing basketball,

251
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,750
you need to give it
your full focus.

252
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,958
Don't let unnecessary
things distract you.

253
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,958
Unnecessary things? What do
you know about who I am?

254
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,708
And what the hell makes
you think I care at all

255
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,750
what you have to say about me?

256
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,458
Maybe what you're
really saying has less

257
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,250
to do with me,
and more to do with her!

258
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,416
[gasps]

259
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,958
[gasps]

260
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,833
[sighs]

261
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,375
Oh, hi.

262
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,875
[EMA] Uh, I, I'm sorry.
I overheard your conversation.

263
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,541
[NATSUME]
Oh. That's mildly awkward.

264
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,958
Anyway, I'm actually
here to give you this.

265
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,541
See? A sample of our new game.

266
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,916
[EMA]
Nice. Thank you, Natsume!

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,375
And about what Subaru said.

268
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,416
Don't worry about it.
He's just a bit upset.

269
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,750
Oh right. I figured as much.
Well, I'm not worried about it.

270
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,875
I appreciate you making
this less awkward

271
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,541
than it could be. Thank you.

272
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,125
Remember, if you need
anything just call me.

273
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,000
[sighs]

274
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,333
[IORI]
What are you sighing about?

275
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,791
[EMA]
Iori.

276
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,333
I take it you were
in the back yard,

277
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,500
checking on your garden?

278
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,583
[IORI]
Yep. Checking and watering.

279
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,583
Forget that. Is something wrong?

280
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,083
Yeah, it's Subaru and Natsume.

281
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,458
Bit of drama
between those two?

282
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,958
Don't worry about them.
In the end, they're brothers.

283
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,791
[EMA]
I suppose.

284
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,333
Come on, smile.

285
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,291
Smile and I promise to bring you
some more beautiful flowers.

286
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,958
It's a deal.

287
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,791
[EMA]
Oh, hi, Azusa.

288
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,041
[AZUSA]
I'm glad I caught you.

289
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,291
Do you have just a second?

290
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,125
[EMA] Yeah, sure.
Just let me get the door.

291
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,666
I wanted to come by and
give you a little something.

292
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,166
It's not much, but I thought
you might like it.

293
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,208
[EMA]
Huh?

294
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,875
It's a book!

295
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,375
A photo album.

296
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,250
You told us that you'd never
had one of your own, right?

297
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,625
So I wanted to
give you this one.

298
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,000
That was sweet.

299
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,916
[AZUSA]
It's a thank you gift.

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,458
Consider it a token
of my appreciation.

301
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,041
[EMA]
For what?

302
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,416
That anime project.

303
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,541
We're really starting
to pick up some steam.

304
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:12,083
Oh! That's really awesome!

305
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,416
[AZUSA] I know I made you
stress out about all of it.

306
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,666
I just wanted to
thank you and apologize.

307
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,583
You didn't need to.
I didn't do anything special.

308
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,791
No. If you hadn't
talked with me,

309
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,083
I would've turned down
a great opportunity.

310
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:28,333
Or worse, I might've ended up
hurting Tsubaki's feelings.

311
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,333
Without you, things might
not have worked out

312
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:33,333
the way they did.
We owe you so much.

313
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,375
If you say so.

314
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,958
But I should be thanking you!

315
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,000
It was very thoughtful
to give me this album.

316
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,291
Come to think of it.

317
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,458
This is the first time
we've talked like this.

318
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,500
Without my shadow
lingering about.

319
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,916
That's the hard thing about
having an identical twin.

320
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,500
[EMA giggles]

321
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,958
And it's not like we
haven't had time

322
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,416
to get to know each other.

323
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,708
I mean we've already been
living together for a while!

324
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,583
[EMA]
There's something about Azusa.

325
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,083
Whenever I talk with him,
it just feels so easy.

326
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,958
I wonder if this is what
having an older brother

327
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,208
is supposed to be like?

328
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:13,041
Hey man, sorry to call so late.
I didn't mean to make you worry.

329
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,291
Figured the least I could do
is talk with you myself.

330
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,125
Fill you in on
some of the details.

331
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,666
Well aren't we considerate?

332
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,125
I'm glad you guys worked
things out so amicably.

333
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,541
Are you sure you're
okay with this, though?

334
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,708
'Cause you should know.

335
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,041
They green-lit a game
based on the show.

336
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,083
Don't want you over-worked!

337
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,333
Hey, I make no promises here!

338
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,958
[NATSUME] Huh. Gotta say
I'm kinda surprised.

339
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,333
I thought for sure you'd
have turned down that role!

340
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,541
Yeah, I have her to
thank for it, too.

341
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,583
[NATSUME] Her? Wait a minute.
Did something happen?

342
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,583
A bit of this and that.

343
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,333
[NATSUME] Ah, jeez. I told her
to let you guys handle it!

344
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,916
[AZUSA]
She was just helping.

345
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,583
And you really listened to her?

346
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,791
Never known you to take advice
from anyone but Tsubaki before.

347
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,208
[AZUSA]
Is that a fact?

348
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,000
I feel like I've listened
to your attempts at advice

349
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,541
at least once or twice before.

350
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,666
[NATSUME] Now you're confused.
I don't give advice.

351
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,458
Hey, is it just me?

352
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,000
Or have you guys done
a little growing up?

353
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:08,916
What?

354
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,208
[NATSUME]
I dunno.

355
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,666
You guys just seem a
little different, is all.

356
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,958
Especially compared to when
I moved out of the condo.

357
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:19,375
I'm just wondering
if it's because of her.

358
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,791
Well, is that it?

359
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:25,000
[AZUSA] No. I mean that would
be weird, wouldn't it?

360
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:38,000
[snoring]

361
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,208
[EMA giggles] I can't even
get to sleep, I'm so happy.

362
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,708
I feel like a little kid again!

363
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:02,625
[TSUBAKI] Oh, hey! Can't sleep?
You mind if I join you?

364
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,166
Uh-- Let me get this
stuff out of your way

365
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,250
so you can work on
your new script.

366
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,666
You're treating that photo
with an awful lot of care.

367
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,458
The kind of reverence you'd have
for a picture of your boyfriend.

368
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,708
[EMA]
What? No, it's just that--

369
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,583
It should go in
the family album.

370
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,000
So that's the only reason?
You wouldn't lie to me, right?

371
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,333
[EMA]
Huh?

372
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,375
Can't you understand?
I need you, damn it!

373
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,916
I apologize for the
way I acted before.

374
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,166
I was selfish. And my
selfishness hurt you.

375
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,833
But time stopped the
first time I kissed you.

376
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,916
[EMA gasps]

377
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,666
[TSUBAKI] And scene!
Just wanted to run a few lines.

378
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,791
[EMA]
O-Oh, right.

379
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,375
[TSUBAKI] What clichéd,
hackneyed crap, huh?

380
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,583
[EMA gasps]

381
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,708
No, you know what,
I won't pretend.

382
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,416
I won't lie. I meant that kiss.

383
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,208
It wasn't a mistake or a
spur of the moment thing.

384
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,041
And those aren't
lines from a script.

385
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,208
Here, let me prove it.

386
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,750
[EMA gasps]

387
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,041
I love you. I adore you.

388
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,875
And I want you.

389
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,708
I won't let anyone
else have you.

390
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,833
[AZUSA, TSUBAKI grunting]

391
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,583
[TSUBAKI]
Azusa?

392
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,125
You asked me to meet you here

393
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,375
to do a read-through of that
new script you're working on.

394
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,750
Or did you forget?

395
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,583
There must be something
going around.

396
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,291
'Cause you forgot.
I won't give her up.

397
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,250
Not even for you, Azusa!

398
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,125
Yeah. You told me.

399
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,500
That means you're
doing this on purpose!

400
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:16,583
Yes, that's right. I am
doing this on purpose.

401
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,416
[gasps]

402
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,250
[AZUSA] Why don't you
go to your room, okay?

403
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,250
There's been quite enough
excitement for one night.

404
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,041
Yeah, whatever. Just forget it.

405
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,500
Tsubaki...? [gasps]

406
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,625
Goodnight.

407
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,041
[AZUSA sighs]
Are you okay?

408
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,625
Yes. Fine.

409
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,083
[EMA]
Are you okay?

410
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,875
You should go back
to your room, too.

411
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,833
Otherwise I might end up
becoming a hypocrite.

412
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,500
[EMA]
What?

413
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:19,375
[whispering] Damn it.
I'm just like him.

414
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,125
[EMA gasps]

415
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,250
[IORI]
Hello, Louis!

416
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,875
[IROI] Did you fall asleep
in the living room again?

417
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:12,625
Uh-huh. Nice photo.

418
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:16,500
Yeah. She was sweet enough
to put that up for us.

419
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,958
[FUTO]
Yo, Iori!

420
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,541
You're Mister Green Thumb,
right? What's that one?

421
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,083
[IORI]
Anemone.

422
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,541
In the language of flowers,
it means: "the pain of love."

423
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,750
[FUTO]
And that one?

424
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,625
[IORI] Kamchatka Lily
it means: "A curse."

425
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,125
[FUTO]
That one?

426
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,166
[IORI] Pincushion flower means:
"I have lost everything."

427
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,000
[FUTO chuckles]
New favorite!
