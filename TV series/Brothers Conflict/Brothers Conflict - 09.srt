my parents must've thought
I wasn't worth the trouble.

00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm really sorry about that.

159
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,416
You don't have to apologize.

160
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,958
Remember, you can
always talk to me.

161
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,666
I'll be here if
you ever need to.

162
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,541
Thank you. That means a lot.

Um, Chii?

Hey, Louis.

[JULI]
Chii! Chii!

172
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,541
[NATSUME] I'm gonna let
him in. Do you mind?

173
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,000
They know.

174
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,958
Sorry, I called last night
after you got in the shower.

175
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,333
I had to at least tell
them you were here.

176
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,916
Otherwise, someone probably
would have called the police.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,625
Definitely would have
called the police.

178
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,791
That's how worked up
they all were.

179

[EMA] I didn't know everyone
would be so worried about me.

Well hello there.

I'm sorry, you guys. I really
didn't mean to worry you.

Oh, we know you didn't mean to.

183
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,333
It's no problem.

00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,166
And please, no need
to apologize.

You're safe, so we're happy.

Thank you, Louis.
And you, Juli. Forgive me?

There's nothing to forgive.

No, Juli. Natsume's good.

He helped. He kept Chii
safe. Isn't that right?

That's right! Juli, you
have to believe me.

Natsume helped me. That's all.

Be quiet, Chii.

that, Chii. It was yummy.

You're welcome.

So anyway, what's the deal
with this "Chii" thing?

I don't know what you mean.

Oh, it's just a silly nickname.

Huh.

Oh! Whoops! I almost forgot!

it if you would try it on!

If you want, I'll style
your hair, too.

Wait. Don't you
need to be getting

back to the condo sometime soon?

Not necessarily.

Besides, this'll
make her feel better.

213

You may be right. Fine.

214
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,958
I'll head over to
the condo, then.

215
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,916
I can let everyone
know what's goin' on.

You okay with a
little pampering?

times better already.

can do, right now,

I'm here, and I'll
do whatever I can.

If you need me, all you
have to do is ask.

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,916
Thank you.

229

Hey, me too!
Louis and I have formed

230
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,416
the Coalition to Protect Chii,
so that's our job.

231
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,250
So tell us. About yesterday,
what in the world

232
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,791
could have upset you that much?

233
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,541
[EMA] I know this must be
a shock to you, too, Juli.

234
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,916
Who would've thought
I wasn't actually

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,291
related to Dad, right?

236
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,291
Yeah... Um.

237
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,958
You know what, why don't
we go to the park?

238
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,833
Huh?

239
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,250
A boat ride. Sound fun?

240
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,208
It's nice.

241
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,625
[LOUIS]
Isn't it? I'm sorry.

242
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,375
I've just been wanting
to do this forever.

243
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,833
About what you said.

244
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,791
I understand how you feel, Chii.
More than you know.

245
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,666
[EMA]
Hm?

246
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,041
I was adopted.

247
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,291
This family of ours, I'm not
really related to them.

248
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,541
[EMA]
What?

249
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,791
[LOUIS] Does that come
as a surprise to you?

250
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,708
I get it. You'd never know.

251
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,416
But, I used to live
in an orphanage.

252
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,916
When I was two, Miss Miwa was
kind enough to take me in.

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,750
I owe everything to her.

254
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,500
By the time I joined the family,
they had seven boys already.

255
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,166
The ones up through
Natsume know I was adopted,

256
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,000
but the five from Subaru
on down weren't born yet.

257
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,791
They still haven't
been told the truth.

258
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,083
As a kid, there was
a period of time

259
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,541
that was really
difficult for me.

260
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,666
I was surrounded by
all these brothers

261
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,041
who were actually related,
and I felt like I didn't belong,

262
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,250
but Mom always treated me
like one of her boys.

263
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,458
I was her son. Strangely,

264
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,958
I think that made me
more conscious of it.

265
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,000
Of the fact that I was adopted.

266
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,875
And when you start accepting
that you're different,

267
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,750
you start noticing what
makes you that way.

268
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:04,666
Like they shared quirks.
It was so crazy.

269
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,541
But there I was. My quirks
weren't like theirs.

270
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,000
I wasn't one of them.
I wasn't a real brother.

271
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,750
I wasn't family. It was so hard.

272
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,666
I felt like, since I
wasn't related by blood,

273
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,958
I was somehow wrong.

274
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,916
So, you second-guess yourself

275
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,333
and where you belong.
Then, you start feeling lost.

276
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,833
It just sucks.

277
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,541
That about sums up the general
feeling, don't you think?

278
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,333
Or am I wrong?

279
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,625
You're not wrong at all.

280
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,250
Deep down, you
understand you're not

281
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,166
being logical, and yet,
knowing that doesn't

282
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,041
make it easier.

283
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,875
Eventually the way I chose
to look at it changed.

284
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,208
My mother is Miwa Asahina.

285
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,458
and she along with her
boys are my family.

286
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,416
It took time, but I got there.

287
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,083
Chii. The most important
thing isn't blood.

288
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:03,500
it's how you feel about
each other. It's the love.

289
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,875
[EMA]
The love?

290
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,208
[LOUIS] I don't remember
anything about them.

291
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,416
my birth parents, I mean. But,

292
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,125
with everyone in my real family,

293
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:16,083
I have tons and tons of memories
that I will cherish forever.

294
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,000
All the things
that have happened

295
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,291
from when I was
adopted until now.

296
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,333
I remember everything.
And you know what?

297
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,875
You're a part of
my family, now, Chii.

298
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,666
Will you do me a favor?

299
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,125
I want you to think
of me as your brother.

300
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,833
I want you to think of all
of us as your brothers.

301
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:39,291
I think we should go home.
Back to the condo.

302
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,208
Because that's where
our family is. Okay?

303
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,791
[EMA sighs]
Okay.

304
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,916
[LOUIS]
We're so lucky to have you.

305
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,750

314
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,041
I think he can
finally relax now.

315
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,625
Poor lil' guy.
He didn't get much sleep.

316
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,250
He was practically beside
himself with worry last night.

317
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,666
Oh, I had no idea.

318
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,083
[LOUIS] I'm feeling
a little tired myself.

319
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,333
[yawns]

320
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,958
You're so sweet.

321
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,916
I didn't mean to make you worry.

322
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,583
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:54,000
[JULI]
Chii? Chii.

324
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,750
Huh?

325
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,791
It's me. Juli.

326
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,375
[gasps]

327
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,666
[JULI] It might be hard for you
to believe, but it really is.

328
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,458
Yes, I believe you.
It definitely seems strange.

329
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:14,041
but I know it's you
somehow. You're Juli.

330
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,500
I've always wanted to
see you face to face.

331
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,625
And I wanted you to see me as
a true companion for you.

332
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,833
Now my dream has come true.

333
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,625
First things first. I need
to apologize to you.

334
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,041
[EMA]
Apologize for what?

335
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,916
[JULI] Did you forget? I've been
around your entire life.

336
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,375
I know everything
about your past.

337
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,541
Huh?

338
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,333
[JULI] The truth about
your biological parents

339
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,000
is they passed away,
one after the other,

340
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,875
not long after you were born.
Rintaro stepped in

341
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,541
and took care of you
as if you were his own.

342
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,583
He raised you. He did
it all on his own.

343
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,791
and he gave you his whole heart.

344
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,333
He loves you, Chii.
Don't ever question it.

345
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,750
You are his real daughter.

346
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,291
I know it's been on his mind.
Telling you the truth.

347
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,416
He just couldn't figure out how.

348
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,375
He didn't want you
to doubt his love.

349
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,375
I didn't want that, either.

350
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:14,208
That's why I never said
anything. I couldn't.

351
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,333
Please believe me.

352
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,791
Our fault was
loving you too much.

353
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,583
For any grief I've
caused you, I'm so sorry.

354
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:26,375
[EMA] Mm-mm. I'm happy
that you told me.

355
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,666
But what really matters
is that you and Dad

356
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,500
are my real family, right?

357
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,791
Right.

358
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,291
All the time I've been
able to spend with you,

359
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,750
all the memories together:

360
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,583
they're incredibly
special to me, and now,

361
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,791
I'll treasure this
moment as well.

362
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,416
I can treasure this,
too. Oh, Juli.

363
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,458
You've always been
there by my side.

364
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,666
Thank you for that.

365
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,041
I love it when you smile.

366
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,500
It's all I ever
wanna see you do.

367
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,875
I didn't intend to say
any of this to you,

368
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,000
but there is something
I need you to know.

369
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,416
I love you, Chii.

370
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,958
[EMA] Was that just a dream?
It must have been.

371
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:30,875
[phone vibrates]

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,125
[gasps]

373
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,041
[RINTARO]
I heard what happened.

374
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,791
I'm sorry for putting
you through this grief.

375
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,083
I wanna sit down
and talk with you.

376
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,500
I'll be returning
to Japan soon. Dad.

377
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:51,541
[gasps] It's the same.
What I saw in my dream.

378
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,791
[EMA] I'm really sorry,
I never wanted to worry you.

379
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,041
We're just glad you're
home. Welcome back.

380
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,458
Hope you're feeling better.

381
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,125
I'll make a few
phone calls and let

382
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,083
everyone who's out
know that you're back.

383
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,750
I'm so sorry!

384
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,166
[IORI]
Welcome home.

385
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,416
Yeah, I'm glad you're all right.

386
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,166
We were all freakin' out.
Don't ever do that again, 'kay?

387
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,666
[WATARU]
Yay!

388
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,166
Be prepared to be
punished for worrying me.

389
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,291
Huh?

390
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:30,125
[giggles] It's a note from Futo.

391
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,666
[MASAOMI]
That's enough, Wataru.

392
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,625
Give her room to breathe.
I bet you're tired.

393
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,875
[EMA]
Oh, no.

394
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,041
You sure you don't wanna
rest for a little while?

395
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,625
I haven't made dinner yet,
so you have plenty of time.

396
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,250
[EMA] No, please.
Let me make dinner tonight.

397
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,583
I was hoping I could.

398
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,916
As you wish.

399
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,791
[WATARU] Yay! Can we have
haumburger steak please?

400
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:55,875
Wait!

401
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,916
I think I wanna
eat curry, too! I know!

402
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,666
How about hamburger steak curry?

403
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,000
Is that okay, can you make that?

404
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,750
Sure. I can make us
hamburger steak curry.

405
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,708
Yay! I don't mind
helping if you want.

406
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,250
[BOTH giggle]

407
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,791
The most important
thing isn't blood.

408
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,375
It's how you feel about
each other. It's the love.

409
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,875
[EMA] What Louis said
is right, and I think

410
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,291
that means I should
be open with everyone.

411
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,291
If I'm ever going to
be able to make memories

412
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,125
with them as a family, that's
the only way it can be done.

413
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,750
Yeah, okay!
I think I can do this!

414
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,541
Huh?

415
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,291
[BOTH laugh]

416
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,750
[JULI]
I love it when you smile.

417
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,458
It's all I ever
wanna see you do.

418
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,916
[EMA]
Hm?

419
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,416
[MASAOMI]
When Rintaro isn't here,

420
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,916
I have to be like
a father to her.

421
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,958
Well, that certainly
complicates things.

422
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,083
[TSUBAKI]
What's up, Futo?

423
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,625
You're wearing shades,
a hat, a mask.

424
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,333
[FUTO muffled] It's a disguise
to keep people from

425
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,791
recognizing me, naturally.

426
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,625
[TSUBAKI]
Just makes you look sketchy.

427
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,750
I don't see a disguise.
I see a pervert.

428
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,041
[FUTO]
Hey, don't call me that!

429
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,958
[TSUBAKI]
A pop pervert?
