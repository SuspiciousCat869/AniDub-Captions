[UKYO]
I knew you were special

2
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,791
from the very
first moment we met.

3
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,958
[HIKARU] Really? If that's
the case, you sure have

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:21,208
taken your sweet time
making a move.

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,583
With me, it's not as if
we can see each other

6
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,416
whenever we want.

7
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,958

It's complicated.

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,250
I realize I shouldn't
have these feelings.

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,083
[UKYO, HIKARU]
But I love you. Forever.

10
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:48,875
[EMA] Of course you do.
After all, we're family.

11

Thank you all for coming!

12
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,208
We'd like to welcome
you to this celebration

13

for the brand new game,

Are you ready to have
a blast with us today?

23

24

[TSUBAKI]
That was awesome.

25
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,125
[AZUSA]
Can't disagree with the truth.

26
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,333
Get your butt over here
and toast with us, Sweets.

27
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,291
But I, well,
I didn't do anything.

28
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,750
It was all you.

29
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,208
[AZUSA] I don't think you
understand how toasts work.

30
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,291
you're here, so you get
to toast. Is tea all right?

31
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,958
[EMA]
Yes, that's great. Thank you.

32
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,916
So? Did you have fun?

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,333
And were you impressed
by our riveting performance?

34
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,833
Oh, yes!

35
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,083
I've never been to anything
like this in my entire life!

36
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,708
Plus, I love video games,
so it was super cool!

37
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,083
That's "super cool" to hear.

38
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,333
[EMA]
By the way, do you know when

39
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,791
it's gonna be released?

40
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,750
I don't think it's gonna be
until sometime next year.

41
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,166
But I'll get all the
details from Natsume.

42
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,125
[EMA]
From Natsume?

43
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,583
[TSUBAKI]
Yeah.

44
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,750
His company is the one who's
actually making this game.

45
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,083
Hey, y'know what? He has
the demos of the game.

46
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,250
I can get him to send you
one if you want me to.

47
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,000
[EMA]
What? Are you serious?

48
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,750
Just consider it done.

49
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,041
Um, hello?

50
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,875
I'm still in the room, you know!

51
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,375
[TSUBAKI]
Oh, you're still here?

52
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,958
Anyway, what kinda
lame toast can you make

53
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,291
with just water and some tea?

54
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,541
[AZUSA] We have a session
this afternoon, genius.

55
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,250
Besides that, we've
got an important

56
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,916
audition later,
so no alcohol for us.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,166
[EMA]
What are you auditioning for?

58
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,000
Well the gig is still top
secret, so I can't tell you

59
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,583
the title, but the anime
that actually got both of us

60
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,458
into being voice actors
has been green-lit

61
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,916
to do a brand new series.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,916
They're holding auditions
today for the lead role.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,416
"Both of us" isn't
entirely accurate, though.

64
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,291
Hey, if I had never
become a voice actor,

65
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,958
then you never would
have been influenced

66
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,500
to become one yourself.
I'm totally accurate.

67
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,000
Wait, you're talking
about the show

68
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,333
that was originally responsible

69
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,250
for getting you
into voice acting.

70
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,541
Whoa! For real?

71
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,083
Did I not just tell you
this was top secret?

72
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,708
You better not say anything
to anyone until it's announced,

73
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:35,541
have you got me?

74
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,958
[YUSUKE]
Yeah, I got ya.

75
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,916
Sounds like a big deal.
I sure hope you get the role!

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,583
Thank you. It's funny.

77
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,416
I don't know why, but I have
a good feeling about it.

78
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,000
And when he says
he's got a good feeling,

79
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,541
he always gets the part.

80
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,291
Sure... Hey. And you're
really auditioning

81
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,875
for the same role, too, Azusa?

82
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,625
Technically.

83
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,125
Really?

84
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,916
But the part I'll most likely
be up for isn't the lead.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,208
I'm hoping to be
cast as his rival.

86
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,958
That would be so
awesome if you got cast

87
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,416
to play each other's rivals!

88
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,583
I know, right?

89
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,125
Tell you what,
once we get the roles,

90
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,500
you'll be the first to know!

91
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,083
Sound good? Wish us luck!

92
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,250

Chii! Was everything okay?

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,083
I was worried about you,

96
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,708
since you were with
Tsubaki and Yusuke.

97
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,583
Don't be silly. I had a blast.

98
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,791
Would you mind terribly
finishing up for me?

99
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,875
I have a really important
trial tomorrow.

100
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,500
and I still need
to prepare for it.

101
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,625
[EMA]
Yeah, sure. No problem.

102

Okay so far,
Wataru is the only one

00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,000
Tsubaki and Azusa
both have work.

105
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,375
Iori is attending lectures.

And Louis is working
a late shift.

107
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,833
According to the schedule,
they all should be

108
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,708
taking care of food themselves.

109
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,666
As far as the rest
of the gang...

110
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,791
I don't know what
they're up to,

111
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,500
but they're not home yet, so...

112
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,666
Wait, wasn't Yusuke was
supposed to be with you?

113
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,041
[EMA] He was, but he said he
needed to stop by a bookstore

114
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,666
to buy study guides.

115
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,083
Sounds about right.

116
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,833
If he's really planning on
attending the same college

117
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,833
as you and Subaru,
then he's going to have to

118
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,666
step up his game significantly.

119
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,041
I guess he was
more aware of that

120
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,166
than I had thought.
Honestly, that's a relief.

took a turn for the worse,
so I won't make it back home.

160
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,625
But you spent the night
up there yesterday, too.

161
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,958
Are you sure you'll be okay?

162
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,958
Don't worry. Oh, sorry,
I need to go.

163
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,750
It looks like Masaomi
will be staying late

164
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,041
at the hospital again today.

165

[UKYO]
Of course.

166
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,208
What I don't get is why they're
all calling or messaging you.

167
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,083
[EMA]
Huh?

168
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,458
It's just a little different.

169
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,000
Because, you know, those
calls used to come to me.

170
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,083
Oh...

171
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,625
[UKYO] Well. I'll leave
it to you, then.

172
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,000
How are you?

173

--[JULI hisses]
--[EMA] Oh, hi, welcome back.

Um. What's the deal?
Where is everybody?

175
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,500
[EMA] It seems they're all
coming home late today.

176
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,791
I can go ahead and get dinner
ready for you, though.

177
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,333
Thanks, that'd be great.

178
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,500
[SUBARU]
Thanks for the food.

Betcha that one has ADHD.

180
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,041
[EMA] I wonder if he feels
as awkward as I do.

181
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,375
So right now, the coach
has taken me out of the line-up.

182
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,541
But I'll get back.

183
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,375
I'm going to be in
the main line-up again.

184
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:23,750
And when that finally happens,
I want you to watch me play.

185
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,750
Yeah, I'd love to.

186
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,375
Okay. I wonder what
the hell that was all about.

Hello? Yes, it's me.

For real? I got the part
from the audition?

That's awesome!

Wait, no, hold on
just a minute.

192
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,708
That role should've
gone to Tsubaki.

00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,375
Yeah, but--

194
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,208
Have you already talked
to him about the casting?

195
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,333
[gasps] Natsume.

196
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,333
Tsubaki, wait!

197
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,458
Thanks again.

198
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,250
I just got the game
demo from Natsume!

199
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,708
Hey, have you seen
Tsubaki today?

200
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,375
Yeah, he just
walked out the door.

201
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,791
Why, did something happen?

Hey, I'm back.

[EMA]
Oh yeah, I'm fine.

205

feeling after seeing

Tsubaki and Azusa downstairs.

Things seemed a
little off, you know?

Hey, y'don't have to tell me.

209

Those guys seemed a
little off to begin with.

210
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,583
Whatcha got in there?

211
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,291
Did someone send
you something cool?

212
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,458
[EMA]
Yeah, check it out!

213
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,166

demo of the game

[JULI]
Ah, the absentee triplet, huh?

[TSUBAKI, AZUSA]
Panzer of the Dead.

217
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,875
Cool!

218
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,250
[EMA] This game is
about switching tanks.

219
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,708
The goal is to survive a
battlefield that happens to be

220
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,041
crawling with zombies.

221
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,458
[JULI] So, you mean it's
gonna give me nightmares?

[TSUBAKI]
Follow me, Michael!

223
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,416
We'll break through
the enemy line!

224

[AZUSA] All right, Walter!
Right behind you.

Juli, will you stop it?

227
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,375
[TSUBAKI]
Looks like I screwed up.

228
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,041
[AZUSA]
Don't worry about it.

229
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,375
It's just a scratch.

I-I just have to go
get you some help.

231

[TSUBAKI]
You, you really suck at lying.

232
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,541
I gotta admit,
this is really weird.

233
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,291
I'm getting emotional
over a silly zombie game.

234
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,875
It's Tsubaki and Azusa.

235
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,500
They're both so good,
and they complement each other.

236
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,958
[JULI] Such is the power
of talented voice acting.

wiped out in the desert zone

Well, well, someone
got here awfully early.

[WOMAN 4B] Yeah, but it
looks like he's meeting up

think we're a couple?

[EMA]
Yes. I'm fine. Totally fine.

You've been sitting
here for a while,

251
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,250
so you might as well
order something.

Please, it's my treat.

253
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,291
[EMA]
No. That's not fair.

254
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,875
I'm the one who
asked you to meet me,

255
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,000
so it should be my treat.

Heh. Well I appreciate that.

257
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,250
It's always nice when
a girl doesn't assume

258
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,541
she's eating for free.
But don't worry.

Well, I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.

[NATSUME] Have you adjusted
to your new world, yet?

262
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,000
It's been 4 months,
so at this point,

263
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,750
I think I'm used to
most of the quirks.

264

That's good. I'm glad
it's going so well.

265
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,083
[NATSUME] Now, where do
you keep getting stuck?

266
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,333
[EMA]
In the desert zone.

267
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,625
I beat all the mobs but
didn't gain any levels.

268
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,458
Must be why I can't
beat the final boss.

269
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,625
No matter what I do, I can't
manage to defeat him.

270
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,708
You've put an awful
lot of time into it.

271
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,875
But still, you need to
go back and level up

272
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,208
in the previous zone.

273
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,125
Otherwise, you're never
gonna get past the desert.

274
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,625
Yeah, that's what I figured.

275
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,958
[NATSUME]
Do me a favor?

276

Let me know if
you can't beat it.

277

If not, we might have to
make changes to that level.

What?

279
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,708
Are you saying that
I'm the benchmark?

280

You put a lot of time and energy
into playing our product, right?

You're our target market.

We gotta make sure people can
play our games effectively.

Otherwise they aren't gonna
sell very well, are they?

Is everything okay?

Apparently Tsubaki didn't
bother to come home yesterday;

Tsubaki went out, and
Azusa almost immediately

might've happened?

The truth is,

I heard some shocking
news at work.

310
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,625
It was about one of
their anime shows.

[EMA]
What about it?

312
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,541
[NATSUME]
We're a video game company,

313

so a lot of our projects
use voice actors.

314
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,208
We hear a lot of gossip.

315
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,208
Actors always love to
talk about casting.

316
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,708
Now, it hasn't been officially
announced quite yet,

317
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,500
which means I can't name
the title, but a certain anime

318
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,875
is the reason Tsubaki
got into voice acting.

319
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,666
And a new series got
green-lit for that anime.

320
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,875
Right. Tsubaki and Azusa told me

321
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,458
that they were
auditioning for that show.

322
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,125
They were really
excited about it.

323
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,375
[NATSUME]
I know.

324
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,250
And, ever since the show
was announced online,

325
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,583
Tsubaki's been saying
he wants to play the lead.

326
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,500
And since he's so
popular at the moment,

327
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,833
we all thought the producer
would be into that idea.

328
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,000
Then, did he get it?

329
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,958
This information hasn't
been released yet,

330
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,500
but I heard Tsubaki didn't
end up getting chosen.

331
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,250
In the end, they went
with someone else.

332
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,375
You're kidding. Why not him?

333
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,416
Well, a lot goes into
the casting process,

334
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,875
like how he sounds
with other actors.

335
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,833
Poor Tsubaki. He wanted
that role so badly, too.

336
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,500
[NATSUME] Yeah, I'm not
done with the story, though.

337
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,375
Huh?

338
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,875
Guess who they gave the part to?

339
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,750
When they finally
landed on a voice actor

340
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,875
for the role, it was Azusa.

341
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,458
It was?

342
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,833
Azusa told me he was auditioning
for a different role, though.

343
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,458
It's not unusual to see
casting upsets like that.

344
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,958
Actually, it's more
normal than not.

345
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,666
[EMA] But, the two
of them are brothers,

346
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,583
and if it's a role that has
a special meaning for Tsubaki.

347
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,833
I dunno, it just shouldn't
be that easy to rationalize.

348
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,208
And I'm sympathetic
to that, I am.

349
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,416
I'm only trying to say that
it's not worth agonizing over.

350
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,041
Look, he's been cast, so it's
his job as a professional

351
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,083
to take on the role.

352
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,583
Anyway, they'll work it out.

353
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,166
The last thing they
need is a new sister

354
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,750
worrying about them
all the time.

355
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,916
Nothing manly about that, right?

356
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,041
[EMA] I feel bad
having you walk me back.

357
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,708
[NATSUME] Just until we're
close to the station.

358
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,208
And I don't mind.

359
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,333
On top of that, it's dark.

360
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,416
If something happened to you
and my mother found out

361
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,250
I forced you to walk alone,
she would kill me.

362
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,500
[EMA] The city is in
Christmas mode already.

363
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,166
[NATSUME] That it is.
Do you have any plans?

364
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,541
[EMA]
No, not really.

365
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,708
[NATSUME]
A pretty high school girl

366
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,541
with no holiday
parties to attend?

367
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,916
What's the world coming to?

368
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,125
[EMA]
Then, what about you?

369
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,833
Do you have any plans?

370
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,458
Are you serious?
Tis' the season, right?

371
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,250
We toy companies make
our biggest profits now.

372
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,083
I wish I could take time off,
but with it being so busy,

373
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,166
there's no way.

374
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,666
[EMA] No personal plans
for you either?

375
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,833
Who sounds lonely now?

376
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,083
Ah, touché. Hey, listen.

377
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,875
Do you always wear your hair
up in a ponytail like that?

378
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,458
What? Ponytail?

379
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,166
Oh, I guess for the most part,
I do wear it up.

380
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,750
[NATSUME]
I see. Then, here.

381
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,375
It's a bit early for Christmas.

382
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,500
However, since I won't
see you day of,

383
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,083
I want you to take this
in lieu of an actual gift.

384
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,041
Look, it fits.

385
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,458
No, really--

386
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,041
Ah. It's for the poor high
school girl with no plans.

387
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,083
From the poor toy company
man with no plans.

388
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,291
So, Merry Christmas.

389
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,791
Merry Christmas to you.

390
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,791
I'll catch ya later, kid.
I gotta head home.

391
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,583
Can't afford to get sick
and miss any work.

392
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,833
[EMA]
Azusa?

393
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:02,291
Oh, hey, welcome back home.

394
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,541
[EMA] What are you
doing sitting out here?

395
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,750
[AZUSA]
Just felt like it.

396
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,833
I couldn't manage
to relax in my room.

397
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,416
But if you catch
a cold, it'll affect

398
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,083
your work, won't it?

399
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,500
Well, it's not like
I have a project

400
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,708
I need to worry about.

401
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,083
But I thought you were
cast in that anime.

402
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,458
[BOTH gasp]

403
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,083
You heard from Natsume, yeah?

404
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,083
Yes, and um. Congrats?

405
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,125
And I'm sorry.

406
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,166
Don't be. It doesn't
really matter.

407
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,666
I never wanted that role anyway.
I'm gonna turn it down.

408
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,083
Huh?

409
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,083
[AZUSA] I just can't.
There's no way I can take it.

410
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,875
[EMA]
You sure you wanna do that?

411
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,250
[gasps]

412
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,041
Even if it is for
Tsubaki's sake.

413
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,291
Turning down a role in
deference to someone else.

414
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,916
That could hurt your career.

415
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,333
[AZUSA]
No one asked you, did they?

416
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:47,250
So stop talking.
That role belongs to Tsubaki.

417
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,458
Yes, but--

418
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,583
Look, he's been cast,
so it's his job

419
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,833
as a professional
to take on the role.

420
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,375
You were the one
who was cast, Azusa.

421
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,375
You know how
significant that is.

422
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,875
Besides that, I like
your voice a lot.

423
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,791
So I think, well, I, I think
you'd be great no matter what.

424
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,208
You should do it.

425
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,791
[AZUSA] That's enough!
I don't care what anyone says.

426
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,416
I will not play that role!

427
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,166
There's no way I
could ever accept it,

428
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,916
so I'm turning it down.
I'll refuse to do it.

429
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,250
After that, they'll obviously
give the role to him.

430
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,000
Even if you turn it
down and you're right

431
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,375
and Tsubaki somehow
ends up getting cast.

432
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,541
How do I put this?

433
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,416
Well, do you think
Tsubaki would be happy

434
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,625
getting the role that way?

435
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,291
[gasps] Yeah, I do!

436
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,583
[TSUBAKI]
Well, you're wrong, stupid!

437
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,000
[EMA]
Tsubaki!

438
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,625
[AZUSA]
Tsubaki.

439
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,916
[TSUBAKI]
Aw, man.

440
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,708
Can you believe I spent
the whole night awake

441
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,541
knowing you'd refuse them
and trying to figure out

442
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,666
a way to talk you
into accepting it?

443
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,625
I was gonna come in at
the end, set you straight,

444
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,125
and wind up being the hero.

445
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,958
But this little lady kinda
stole my thunder, huh?

446
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,541
Azusa, do it for me.
Please, man.

447
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't want it
to go to anyone else.

448
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,875
You know I'm your
number one fan.

449
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,541
There's no way
you can turn me down.

450
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,541
I want to hear you voice it.

451
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,916
Will you let me hear
that role in your voice?

452
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,166
Will you do that for me?

453
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,958
Aw, jeez. Fine, I'll do it.

454
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,083
[TSUBAKI]
Thanks, man. Thanks.

455
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:16,083
I swear. I'll do my best
to make you proud. 'Kay?

456
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,666
As if I would
let you get away

457
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,333
with a half-assed
performance, bro.

458
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,458
So, pinky swear on it?

459
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,125
[TSUBAKI] Go on, call your
manager and tell 'em.

460
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,250
You know, before it's too late.

461
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,958
[AZUSA]
Right. I'm on it.

462
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,166
Hey, you.

463
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,125
Wanna keep me company
since I'm all bummed?

464
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,458
[TSUBAKI] Yeah, to be honest,
I'm really disappointed.

465
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,875
I mean like, who
wouldn't be, you know?

466
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,916
I was the one who first wanted
to become a voice actor.

467
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,166
And if it weren't for me,
Azusa wouldn't have been

468
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,916
dragged into it to begin with.

469
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,291
Somewhere along the way,
he surpassed me.

470
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,541
It's always been like that
between the two of us, you know.

471
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,458
Azusa comes out on top,
no matter what we do.

472
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,416
[TSUBAKI] We're supposedly
from the same egg, right?

473
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,416
So how come he's
such a better actor?

474
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,541
I can see it.

475
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,833
The best actor for
the role was Azusa.

476
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,916
And I think knowing that is
what... what disappoints me.

477
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,750
[EMA]
It's understandable.

478
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,125
[TSUBAKI]
That reminds me.

479
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,250
There's something that
I wanted to ask you.

480
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,250
What you said just a minute ago.

481
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,791
About Azusa, and how much
you like his voice.

482
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,125
Well, what about me?

483
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,375
[EMA]
Of course, I love your voice.

484
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,916
I'm not an expert, though.

485
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,166
I mean, regarding acting
and how that all works.

486
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,375
But I don't think it's
about who's better.

487
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,416
I guess I just think you should
stay true to you, Tsubaki.

488
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,708
Because there are
sure to be roles

489
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,750
that only you
can play, you know?

490
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,166
Oh, I'm sorry.
What do I know?

491
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,041
I shouldn't have said anythi--

492
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,291
I'm sorry about that.
But you must know.

493
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,125
For a depressed boy
to get back on his feet

494
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,041
and feel good again,
what helps him more

495
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:15,166
than anything is a kiss
from a pretty girl like you.

496
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,125
Hey, so by the way,
this has kinda been

497
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,625
bothering me for a bit now.

498
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,041
[EMA]
What?

499
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,666
I usually like your style,
but that's a guy's scarf.

500
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,333
[TSUBAKI]
It's just the design.

501
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,166
I don't know, it's well,
it's kinda my style, actually.

502
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,458
I don't know why,
but it pisses me off.

503
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,958
Oh me, oh my.

504
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,791
Such naughty children.
Shame on you.

505
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:27,333
I wonder who's going to be
the one to get the last laugh.

506
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,791
[HIKARU]
What? I have to open my mouth?

507
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,625
[MASAOMI] You've been living
overseas a long time,

508
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,666
it's just a precaution.
Say, "Ah."

509
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,250
[HIKARU]
Honestly. Ahh.

510
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,083
[MASAOMI] Hmm, I see no
swelling, so you should be fine.

511
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:43,875
However...

512
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:44,958
[HIKARU]
However?

513
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:45,750
[MASAOMI]
Your stubble's coming in.

514
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:46,958
[HIKARU]
No!
