You can be a man of faith or

We have stamps of approval
from the head temple.

It's just a little
summer festival,

there's nothing for anyone

Sounds amazing.

I've never been on

Just to watch your back!

Great! Let's let everyone know,

to dress as a man again.

True!

We'd better get going. If we
don't hurry, we'll be late.

more time to think.

I could go with you guys.

enjoyed yourselves today.

317
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,541
You shoulda come too, Ukyo,
you woulda had fun.

318
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,416
Yeah right, I'm sure
you mean that.

319
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,791
No kidding.

320
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,708
Hey. Why don't you two just
mind your own business?

321
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,833
No tellin' what'll happen
when we get together.

322
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,250
But it's always interesting.

323
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,333
We drivin' you crazy
yet, little lady?

324
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,208
Or is it fun?

325
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,291
Fun! Although...

326
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,125
[BROTHERS]
Hm?

327
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,833
I dunno...

328
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,750
I'd like to become
a part of this family

329
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,666
in a meaningful way.

330
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,208
[BROTHERS grunt]

331
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,333
But you already are.
Don't you know that?

332
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,708
You being here has been
a blessing for all of us.

333
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,541
He's right. You're the coolest!

334
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,208
That means a lot to me.

335
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:33,208
But, see, the thing is, I want
all of us to be even closer.

336
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,958
What gives?

337
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:41,041
Did you achieve some kind of
enlightenment at our temple?

338
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,041
[laughs]

339
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,166
[KANAME]
Trouble sleeping?

340
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,166
[gasps] Hey, Kaname.

341
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,125
I was just looking at
these beautiful stars.

342
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,041
You don't get to see stuff
like this in the city.

343
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,375
No, you sure don't.

344
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,916
[EMA]
Thank you.

345
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,833
I really appreciate you inviting
me to the Festival today.

346
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,083
It meant a lot to me
that you were there.

347
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,000
But, how about a
tiny favor in return?

348
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,250
[gasps]

349
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,833
[KANAME]
Let me hold you.

350
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,833
Stay here with me for a while.

351
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,041
[EMA]
Is that a sword?

352
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,416
Yeah. You ever heard the saying,

353
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,166
"the pen is mightier
than the sword?"

354
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,083
It means that in the end,
words will always

355
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,625
transcend violence. However.

356
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,708
In this world, there's
something even more powerful

357
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,333
than pens and swords and
everything else combined.

358
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,416
And that thing, is love.

359
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,541
[KANAME] Your love of family
came across back there.

360
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,500
Loud and clear.

361
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,791
But tonight, I need you
to know how I feel.

362
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,916
[EMA]
What?

363
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,750
You thanked me for
inviting you today.

364
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,500
But I'm the one who should
be saying "thank you."

365
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,875
You're precious.

366
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,833
I just hope you understand
how much you mean to us.

367
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,500
[FUTO] Your stupid speech
meant nothing to me.

368
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,708
'Cause you're mine.
Don't you know that?

369
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,166
It's your fault.

370
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,583
[FUTO gasps]

371
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:43,791
[FUTO breathes heavily]

372
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,541
[FUTO]
I tried. I really did.

373
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,791
I already gave you your chance.

374
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,458
See, the thing is, I want
all of us to be even closer.

375
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:57,333
[FUTO sobbing]

376
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,291
It's too hot.

377
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,583
[door slams]

378
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,166
You're up awfully
early, aren't you?

379
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,791
[FUTO sighs]

380
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,833
You mind turning that down?
I'll freeze my tits off in here!

381
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,250
[FUTO] What the hell
are you talkin' about?

382
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,583
This heat is killing me!

383
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,083
It's cool outside.

384
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,000
And the windows have
been open all night long.

385
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,375
[grunts]

386
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,750
Did something happen to you?

387
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,958
Mind your own
business! I'm fine!

388
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,208
I didn't do anything.

389
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,875
[yawns] Good morning.

390
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,083
Futo?

391
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:46,166
Well, the bratty one
is like a cat in heat.

392
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,333
The air's so clean
and refreshing.

393
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,416
I really wish Juli was
here with me though--

394
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,458
[gasps]

395
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,625
Hey!

396
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,250
You almost fell.

397
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,708
Yeah. Good catch.

398
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,208
Are you hurt or anything?

399
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,208
No. I'm okay, actually.

400
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,833
What are you doing out here?

401
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,375
Oh, uh. A little training.

402
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,333
But, we're here.
Do you have a minute?

403
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,708
Uh, I guess so, yeah.

404
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,291
I don't know if you
know this or not,

405
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,666
but Japan has a pretty decent
professional basketball league.

406
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,541
Yeah?

407
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,041
[SUBARU]
Yeah.

408
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,458
And, the thing is, I'm being
scouted by one of the teams.

409
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,041
That's neat.

410
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,583
Hey, is that who you were
on the phone with yesterday?

411
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,041
[SUBARU]
Right.

412
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,458
If I say "yes," then I get
to play ball professionally.

413
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,958
[EMA]
That's really great.

414
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,166
[SUBARU]
Yes and no.

415
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,000
You see, the offer's
from a team in Kyushu.

416
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,291
I definitely wanna be a pro.

417
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,833
Just not so far away.
'Cause I'd never see you!

418
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:56,875
[gasps]

419
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,208
[SUBARU]
I'd ask you to come with me.

420
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:02,583
But I know you have entrance
exams to study for.

421
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,833
Um, I think you need
to focus on what's best

422
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,041
for your professional career
and not worry about me.

423
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,666
I don't want you
to quit basketball

424
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,250
and I don't think
you do either.

425
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,500
Playing basketball makes
you happy, right?

426
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,458
So, play it.

427
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,166
[gasps]

428
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,500
I shouldn't have anything
to do with your decision.

429
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,833
Okay.

430
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,875
I appreciate you being
honest with me about this.

431
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,125
Means a lot.

432
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,875
And I guess I have some
things to think about.

433
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,333
Thanks.

434
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,458
[MASAOMI] We'll have
breakfast just as soon

435
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,375
as Subaru gets back.

436
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,708
[EMA]
Kay. Sounds good.

437
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,375
I'll put something
together, then.

438
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,791
[MASAOMI]
Thank you. By the way.

439
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,583
There's somewhere special
we'd like to take you

440
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,958
on our way back home.
Is that all right?

441
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,375
Sure.

442
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,541
Here we are, then.

443
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,083
This is where your real
parents are buried.

444
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,750
[gasps]

445
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,416
We found out
from Rintaro recently.

446
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,833
We asked him about it.

447
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:25,541
'Cause I guess, we wanted
to pay our respects, too.

448
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,666
[whimpers]

449
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:41,541
[EMA] Mom, Dad,
I just want you to know.

450
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,750
I have some truly
wonderful brothers now.

451
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:48,291
And Rintaro-- No, Dad...

452
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:52,291
Dad and Miss Miwa and
all of my new brothers.

453
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:56,458
Well, I guess they're
my family now.

454
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:01,041
So anyway, Mom, Dad.

455
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,166
Thank you for
choosing to have me.

456
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,458
Because I'm so happy.

457
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,541
Hey, are you working?

458
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,458
No way. Having fun.

459
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,958
[WATARU]
Whoa! What's this?

460
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,208
Take a look.

461
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,541
The title I've chosen
is "Brothers' Conflict".

462
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,333
You must know all about that.

463
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,375
Yeah, I guess.

464
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,833
I do have a whole
lotta brothers.

465
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,791
Indeed. So, tell me,
out of these options,

466
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,083
who do you think will win?

467
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,958
Uh...

468
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,541
E. G. O.

469
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:05,625
[HIKARU]
Right.

470
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,750
[WATARU]
I don't really understand

471
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,333
what this means, but...

472
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,791
Ooh. This one!

473
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,291
What made you pick that one?

474
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,833
'Cause number 13 is the biggest,

475
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,916
which means it has the
biggest attack power!

476
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,916
Uh, well, you're right
about it being

477
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,166
the biggest number of the bunch.

478
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,833
I'm right? Seriously? I knew it!

479
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,166
Dear.

480
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,125
These numbers are odds,
not attack power, got it?

481
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,375
[WATARU]
Odds. Not attacks.

482
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,666
[WATARU]
Hey! It's no fair!

483
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,208
Don't just keep giving
her all the games!

484
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,791
Give me some, too, okay?

485
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:37,708
[NATSUME]
Just so I understand what

486
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,083
you're complaining about here,

487
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,833
what kind of games
do you want, Wataru?

488
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,375
[WATARU]
Games we can all play together!

489
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,166
Sis would love that,
I just know it!

490
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,333
Don'cha think that'd be fun?

491
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,916
[NATSUME]
Hell no!
