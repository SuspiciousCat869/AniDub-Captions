How're you, Chii?

158
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,333
[EMA] That's weird.
Juli's the only one

159

who's ever
called me Chii before.

Thinking what I am?
That that is

161
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,250
really, really weird?

162
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,291
[EMA]
Um, are you all right?

163
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,750
[LOUIS]
Yeah. I'm just silly.

164
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,083
I was aiming to
sleep on the sofa,

[EMA] Are you done
with work for the day?

167
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,500
[LOUIS] Nope.

168
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:08,583
Uh. I kinda came back
for you. Or your hair.

169
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,875
[EMA] Huh?

170
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,458
You know, today is
Subaru's birthday after all,

171
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,625
and there's the party.

172
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,958
[LOUIS] I thought I could,
uh, make you look cute.

What? This guy came back
just for that?

175
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,625
[EMA] He's amazing.
He really is.

176
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,208
I don't know why, but I feel
so comfortable and relaxed.

177
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,458
[LOUIS] Almost done.

178
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,833
Well? Do you like it?

179
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh yes! I love it!

180
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:45,375
Well, in that case.
Time for the big finish!

181
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,916
Crap. I think it's broken.

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,291
[EMA] Oh no.

183
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,666
[LOUIS] Sorry,
I'll go get another one.

184

No, please don't!

185
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,750
This is more than
enough already.

186
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,416
It's been fun.
Let me finish.

187
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,583
He just wants to make
sure the job's done right.

188

He's a professional.

189

I suppose there are
times when it's

to decline a favor.

[JULI] Hm?

Hey you. Where's Louis?

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,125
[EMA] Oh, he just stepped away.
He'll be right back.

194
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,083
Oh, great--
you've gotta be kidding!

195
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,750
I asked the salon, and they
said he'd be right here!

[EMA] He was--
are you in a hurry?

Yeah, I don't think so.

something had changed until

204

You should have
seen your face.

You thought I was serious.

214
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,041
Did you think
changing your hairstyle

215
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,583
would make you a princess?

Okay, fine, I'm coming.

Man, it totally sucks that

That's the truth.

Wow. Thank you all very much.

I've ever seen, ever!

Now, Wataru. Try to
remember that Sis made this

236
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,041
especially for Subaru,
so you should let him

237
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,708
be more excited
about it than you are

238
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,041
and try not to get upset
when he gets the first piece.

239

Understand?

240

Yeah, I get it.

about that, Subaru.

I'm sure it would be
so much tastier,

--Huh?
--Say what?

474
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,250
How dare you
say that to my Chii?

475
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,791
What am I gonna do
if the other customers

476
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,875
figure out I'm here?

477
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,166
Oh, yes, that's right.
I'm sorry.

478
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,666
[FUTO]
Let's go. Seriously.

479
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,791
[EMA] Wow. Are you
renting all of those?

480
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,208
It's research for a gig.

481
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,958
Really, Futo.
You're going to be in a movie?

482
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,500
[FUTO] Will you shut up?

483
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,958
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL 2A]
Oh my god, it's totally him!

484
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,375
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL 2B]
What? No way!

485
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,625
[HIGH SCHOOL GIRL 2C]
I heard that he lives...

486
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,791
Well, great. Now I can't
take my time browsing

487
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,083
because of your loud mouth.

488
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,333
Oh, that's too bad.

489
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,833
Yeah, just take
responsibility and

490
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,958
rent these for me.
I'll be waiting at home.

491
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,208
[JULI hissing]

492
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,958
Oh. Have you been waiting?

493
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,833
You're late! How long
were you planning to

494
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,208
keep me waiting
for some stupid DVDs?

495
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,291
I really am
sorry about this.

496
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,333
An apology won't
get you off the hook.

497
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,916
Don't fool yourself, princess.

498
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,916
As punishment, you'll
have to do all sorts of things.

499
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,666
Most of them in your room.

[EMA gasps]

501
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,666
[TSUBAKI] Azusa, have you
decided what song

502
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,541
we're gonna
sing at the wedding?

503
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,458
[AZUSA] Are you really
gonna make me sing too?

504
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:01,750
Yeah, of course.

505
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,583
Who else can I find
to harmonize perfectly

506
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:04,708
with me other than you?

507
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,666
[cell phones ringing]

508
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,958
[BOTH gasp]

509
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,500
Well, that's a surprise.

510
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,291
So he's coming after all.

511
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,833
We haven't seen him
in what seems like forever.

512
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,291
It'll be his first time
meeting her, too!

513
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,625
I hope nothing too awkward
happens with her there.

514
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,916
Now, why do you look like
you're up to something?

515
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,250
Hey, I can't help but
imagine what might go down

516
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,375
when he comes
face-to-face with Subaru.

517
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,916
[AZUSA] I'm guessing there's
more to it than that.

518
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,666
[MASAOMI] So Subaru,
what do you want

519
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,208
for your twentieth
birthday present?

520
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,833
[SUBARU] I don't
care about that stuff.

521
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,291
[MASAOMI]
I figured you'd say that.

522
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,916
So, here, say, "Ah."
Come on, don't be shy.

523
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,666
[SUBARU] Masaomi, can this be
the last checkup for a while?

524
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,916
The lollypop's not worth it.
