to forget about all of it.

00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:13,916
[SUBARU] Please forget
about all the things

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,208
I said to you before.
The way I am now.

5
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,541
There's no way I could
ever make you happy.

6
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:24,250
[EMA] With those parting
words, Subaru left.

7
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,958
He just walked away.

8
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,083
[EMA]
It's been a while since then,

9
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,708

are starting to bloom.

10

[JULI] Don't tell me you're
still worried about Subaru.

11
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,750
[EMA]
I can't help it.

12
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:13,625
I wonder where he is and
if he's eating okay.

13
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,875
[JULI] Listen, that guy's
not a kid. He'll be fine.

14
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,250
[EMA]
Yeah.

15
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,958
[EMA]
Oh, Masaomi.

16
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,250
I thought you'd like to know
we heard from Subaru.

17
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,750
Oh, really? That's great!

18
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,250
It's about time.

19
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,166
He said he's just gonna be
staying put at the university

20
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,916
for a while and that he
didn't want us to worry.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,083
[EMA]
I see.

22
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,666
This is a big year, I guess.

23
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,958
Subaru is clearly having a major
turning point in his life.

24
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,958
Kaname's going into more
training at the head temple,

25
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,541
and Iori's set to study abroad,

26
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,666

be leaving, too.

They're all dealing with
some positive changes.

30
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,958
[EMA] Maybe so, but it still
seems kinda lonely to me.

31
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,291
We're breaking apart.

32
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,625
I get it, but I think
that's just how things go

33
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,750
with families.

34
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,208
After all, everyone will have

35
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,708
to leave this little
nest eventually.

36
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,416
Sure, it can seem lonely.

37
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,958
But, if this house can
always feel like home

38
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,458
and be a place the
family comes back to.

39
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,875
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

40
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,708
And of course,
that includes you.

41
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,208
Good.

It's a reward for being
such a good girl.

45
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,666
[EMA] And then, the day
came when the university

46
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,083
announced who had been accepted.

No. And it's weird.

He checked on me first.

Maybe to be considerate? Yeah.

72
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,208
I bet he wanted me to have
a chance to be happy

just in case he didn't get in.

He's rough around

that kind of compassion.

It's Tsubaki and Azusa.

160
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,333
[TSUBAKI] You may be busy,
with your graduation ceremony

161
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,708
coming up, but if
you're up for it,

162
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,583
[TSUBAKI, AZUSA] how about the
three of us go have fun together

163
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,458
[AZUSA]
next Sunday? To celebrate your

164
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,208
college acceptance.

165
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,833
Wait, the three of you?
That's interesting.

166
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,208
What do you think it means?

167
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,291
Maybe those silly fools have
finally given up on you.

168
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,000
[EMA]
I have to go.

169
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,541
I need to tell Tsubaki and
Azusa how I really feel,

170
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,333
and the sooner the better.

171
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,791
--[TSUBAKI] Woo-hoo!
--[EMA screams]

172
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,333
[TSUBAKI] I could ride
that one over and over,

173
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,333
and never get bored.

174
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,583
How about you?
Having a good time?

175
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,125
Yes.

176
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,708
I've never been to a place like
this with my family before!

177
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,000
[TSUBAKI]
The view here is incredible.

178
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,791
[AZUSA] I think we caught
it at the perfect time,

179
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,166
right before it gets dark.

180
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,291
Oh yeah. Plus, it's
just us three.

181
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,208
Which is kinda
the best, after all.

182
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,208
Absolutely.

183
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,625
[gasps] You guys!

184
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,833
[TSUBAKI, AZUSA]
Yeah, what is it?

185
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:38,750
[TSUBAKI]
Jinx!

186
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,000
[AZUSA laughs]

187
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,416
[EMA] You two really
are close, aren't you?

188
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,625
You keep saying the
same things today.

189
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,500
[TSUBAKI]
Of course we are.

190
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,916
[AZUSA]
Yep.

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,458
The thing is, ever since
I became a part of your family,

192
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,125
a lot of really crazy
things have happened.

193
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,125
There've been several
arguments, and,

194
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,375
those issues weren't a
problem before I came.

195
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,625
[TSUBAKI, AZUSA grunt]

196
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,458
I want you to know that
I've thought about this.

197
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,458
About you both and the things
you've told me separately.

198
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,666
And, then I realized
what mattered most.

199
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,916
And what was that?

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,708
I'd be interested
to hear it, too.

201
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,458
[EMA] What matters is
that I genuinely love you.

202
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,208
Both of you.

203
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:18,083
But I love you
just as my brothers.

204
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,875
And I simply can't return
the love you feel for me.

205
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,375
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,666
[TSUBAKI, AZUSA]
Don't apologize. We understand.

207
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,041
[gasps]

208
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,333
[TSUBAKI]
Nevertheless.

209
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,500
There's something we need
to make sure to say.

210
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:42,208
Something that we need to
make sure you recognize.

211
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,833
[TSUBAKI, AZUSA]
No matter how you feel.

212
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,000
We'll still love you, forever.

213
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,208
[gasps]

214
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,125
[EMA] I wonder if I
got my feelings across

215
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,791
to them well enough.

216
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,416
Hey, you got a sec?

217
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,333
[EMA]
Subaru!

218
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,000
[SUBARU] I just wanted
to tell you I'm sorry.

219
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,208
I didn't mean to make
you worry when I left.

220
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,625
[EMA]
Oh, no.

221
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,375
I'm glad you came home though,
and that you're okay.

222
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,375
That day,

223
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,000
when I punched
Natsume and stuff.

224
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:33,625
I feel guilty about it.
Everything was all mixed up.

225
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,583
I knew that I
needed to apologize,

226
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,375
but I couldn't manage to do it.

227
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,541
I can't believe
how selfish I was.

228
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,791
Whenever I think about it,

229
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,041
I can't help but be
ashamed of myself.

230
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,250
I never imagined what I did
would be hurtful to you, too.

231
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,208
I wasn't thinking about anyone.

232
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:57,875
I was so wrong. And I'm sorry.

233
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,083
I know that words
won't be enough

234
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:04,625
to earn your forgiveness.
But, still.

235
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,083
I had to come back here
to apologize to you.

236
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,208
Anyway, that's it.

237
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,750
[EMA]
Subaru?

238
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,083
Thank you for saying that.

239
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,458
For being completely honest.

240
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,250
And it's okay.

241
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,750
Good.

242
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,416
Right now, I've still
got a long way to go,

243
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,916
but I promise you,
I will get there one day.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,833
I'm going to be a
good man for you.

245
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,291
[EMA] And that's how
I ended my last night

246
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,416
as a high school student.

247
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,083
[YUSUKE]
We're finally graduating.

248
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,750
[EMA] Yeah. I feel like
it all went by so fast.

249
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,583
Right. And you're
off to college.

250
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,958
But I hope we can
stay in touch.

251
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,875
Oh. Wait, what am I saying?

252

Congratulations!

[YUSUKE]
Um, what's this?

258
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,208
[TSUBAKI]
It's a surprise party, doofus.

259
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,750
Well? You two
gonna come inside?

Wow. It looks great!

Yusuke, get that.

264
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,000
[YUSUKE]
What?

265
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,083
Wait, am I not having a party
thrown for me right now?

266
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,833
[HIKARU] Well, technically,
but you were more like

267
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,333
an afterthought.

268
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,458
[YUSUKE] Did you seriously
just call me an afterthought?

269
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,916
[MASAOMI]
Yusuke, what's wrong?

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,500
You look like you've just
seen a ghost or something.

271
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,500
[YUSUKE]
Here, look.

272
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,416
[HIKARU]
What is it?

273
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,750
"Backup Candidate Acceptance."

274
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,833
Nice!

275
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,250
[WATARU]
You did it! You got accepted!

276
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,666
[NATSUME]
Good for you, man.

277
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,041
[AZUSA]
Yeah, congrats.

278
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,791
[UKYO] Now, we really do
have a reason to celebrate.

279
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,875
[MASAOMI] See, all that
hard work paid off!

280
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,333
[EMA]
Yusuke?

281
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:20,750
Okay. I really got wait listed?
So like, for real though?

282
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,666
I mean it's a real
acceptance letter?

283
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,916
Like, uh...

284
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,458
Basically, I'm wondering
if this means

285
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,916
I get to go to the same
college that you're going to.

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,666
From what I understand, yes.

287
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,916
Really, like for real?

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's right.
Really, like for real!

289
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,375
Okay, understood.

290
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,000
So, what you're
saying is I get to go

291
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,416
to the same college as you.

292
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,166
Yes!

293
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,958
Awesome! All right.

294
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,083
That's a relief.
I'm not a loser.

296

[YUSUKE]
Honestly.

297
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,750
I thought that compared
to my other brothers.

298
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,083
I wouldn't amount to much.

299
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,791
But this whole process helped
me figure something out.

300
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,583
I'm good at tons of stuff!

301
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,625
And I was right!

302
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,708
So I'm not gonna
give up ever again!

303
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,041
Good speech!

304
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,208
Nothing like awkward
to start a party, yeah?

305

That's for sure,
now who's hungry?

00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,833
[CROWD cheers]

317
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:37,958
Hey, everyone!

318
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,458
[HOST 12A]
Now, from what I understand,

319
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,375
there's someone you're hoping
to get a message to today.

320
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,333
Is that right?

321
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,625
[FUTO]
Yes.

322
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,625
My sister actually graduated
high school today.

323
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,583
I wanted to congratulate her
since I couldn't be there.

324
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,708
Okay.

325
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,583
First, congratulations.
I also wanted to say thanks

326
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,291
for all the good times
you've given me.

327
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,750
I know there'll be more.
Better get ready!

328
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,500
[CROWD cheers]

329
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,291
Ugh, what a tool.

330
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,875
[FUTO] Finally. I have a
declaration for all of you.

331
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,625
I can never see myself
belonging to any one person.

332
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,000
But I will do whatever it takes

333
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,958
so that you'll
wanna belong to me.

334
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,125
And I never give up either,
so you better watch out!

335
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,208
[HOST 12A]
All right!

336
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,666
A cryptic message
for his fan girls

337
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,791
to tweet about for months!

338
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,625
--[WATARU laughs]
--You gotta be kidding me.

339
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,291
That was not a message
for his fans, not at all.

340
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,416
He's a jerk.

341
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,458
Yeah, he pisses me off.

342
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,375
[gasps]

343
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,416
[EMA]
As for who turned off the TV.

344
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,291
Well, I never did find out.
Even after the party was over.

345
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,666
[EMA]
Hey, do you have a second?

346
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,000
There's something I'd
like to talk to you about.

347
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,625
[NATSUME]
Of course.

348
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,958
[EMA]
I've finally come to a decision.

349
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:00,750
A decision?

350
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,916
Yes. I'm just not ready

351
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
to get into a
relationship with anyone.

352
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,958
Right.

353
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,083
[EMA] After I came here,
a lot of things happened

354
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,166
I wasn't prepared for.
I was shocked.

355
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,250
And honestly didn't
know how to respond.

356
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,791
It seemed easier not
to address any of it,

357
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,291
which only ended up
making things worse.

358
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,583
[NATSUME]
You were being nice. That's all.

359
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:30,125
[EMA] I thought so,
but I could've done better.

360
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,583
Please understand.

361
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,666
To me, you're all my brothers,

362
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,458
and what matters the most is
that the entire family is happy.

363
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,000
At the time, I thought
my choices were helping,

364
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,541
but I was wrong.

365
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,666
I should've expressed myself
clearly a lot earlier.

366
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,666
Yeah. That makes
sense. I get it.

367
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,208
It's not gonna be
awkward now, is it?

368
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,541
Of course not.
We won't let it be.

369
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,750
This family is too important.
And I love you guys.

370
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,250
[NATSUME]
Good, I'm glad.

371
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,875
[EMA]
I'm sorry. Have a good night.

372
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,250
[NATSUME]
Wait.

373
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,250
I think I should be
clear about one thing.

374
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,000
No matter what,
I will still love you.

375
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,250
In fact, I don't think
I'll ever stop loving you.

376
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:19,916
[NATSUME] I wish I could.
More than you know.

377
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,916
I'm sorry.

378
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:37,250
[NATSUME] I'm right here,
and I always will be.

379
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,458
Good night.

380
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,375
[HIKARU] You got hit
by a counteroffensive.

381
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,500
[gasps] Oh, Hikaru!

382
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,291
[HIKARU]
You did good hanging in there.

383
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,791
It takes some
strength to turn down

384
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,083
people's declarations
of love. No joke.

385
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,750
I think your response
was on the money.

386
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,125
The greatest part
is that it's sure

387
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,250
to allow everyone to be hopeful.

388
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,375
[EMA]
Wait, what do you mean by that?

389
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,875
[HIKARU]
Let me take a wild guess.

390
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,708
Your goal was to put
an end to all the drama

391
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,125
you've been dealing with?

392
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,041
Well, I think you inadvertently
made them love you more.

393
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,625
I hope not.

394
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,958
[HIKARU]
You see this?

395
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,375
I was looking forward to
seeing who'd win you over.

396
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,208
So I put together an odds chart.

397
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,416
[EMA]
An odds chart?

398
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,000
Yup, but now after
hearing what you said,

399
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,250
it seems my odds chart
is pointless.

400
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,083
It's kind of a bummer.
All that hard work for nothing.

401
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,791
[HIKARU] So now, a new,
more exciting race

402
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,875
will have to begin.
In other words.

403
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,541
Our little Brothers Conflict?

404
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,708
It's going to last
a while longer.

405
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,208
Should be a good time, though.

406
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,750
After all, I'll be
entering the race myself.

407
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,166
[EMA]
Huh?

408
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,041
[HIKARU]
I hope you have a good evening.

409
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,916
You might as well enjoy
this moment of peace

410
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,625
while you have it.

411
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,250
[JULI]
What's wrong, Chii?

412
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,458
Did something happen
with those boys again?

413
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,583
[EMA] No, but I did finally
tell them how I felt.

414
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,833
[JULI] You seem like it's
all got you pretty down.

415
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,750
But I know you'll be fine.

416
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,916
Remember, Chii,
I'm here to protect you!

417
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,666
And I'll do everything
I can to make you happy!

418
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,083
Hey, Juli. Have you ever...?

419
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,541
[JULI]
Hm?

420
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,416
Nah, nevermind me.

421
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,666
[EMA]
I'm not certain about anything.

422
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,708
And maybe there will be
times when my heart wavers,

423
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,541
but someday. I know for sure.

424
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,000
I'll be a real sister
to all of them.

425
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,416
We'll be a real family.

426
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,208
[SUBARU]
You here to see her?

427
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,375
[NATSUME] Aren't you
here for the same reason?

428
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,125
I thought you moved
out of the condo.

429
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:47,500
[SUBARU chuckles] I did. Just
wanted to see her face again.

430
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,708
You know. I'm gonna win
her heart eventually.

431
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,375
[NATSUME]
Oh yeah? How?

432
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,250
[SUBARU] Because I respect
her and the way she feels,

433
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,708
and I won't force the issue.

434
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,958
So down the road a bit,
when she is ready

435
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:01,625
for a relationship,
I'll be right there.

436
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,125
She'll know I was the one
who stood by her side.

437
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,791
And I'm the man for her.

438
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,708
Well said.

439
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,458
[NATSUME] Alright, man. You win.
I'll leave her be for now.

440
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,875
[SUBARU]
For real?

441
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,041
[NATSUME] But don't think
that means I'm giving up.

442
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,750
Just watch, she'll
choose me eventually.

443
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,458
Yeah, you think so?

444
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,541
[TSUBAKI] There they are,
going at it again.

445
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,791
[AZUSA]
You think so?

446
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,250
They look kind of like
they're getting along.

447
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,666
Eh, as long as
they're distracted,

448
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,875
it works out well for us.

449
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,250
True.

450
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,708
All we need is some quality
time with her this year,

451
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,875
just the three
of us. That way...

452
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes.

453
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,375
That way, it comes
down to you and me.

454
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,916
And when that time comes,
I won't hold back.

455
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,791
Good, because I won't either.

456
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,958
Aw, man. This sucks.
I take the time to visit home,

457
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,625
and I have to run
into the idiot.

458
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,500
[YUSUKE]
What was that, you jack wagon?

459
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,125
Don't judge me.
You're the one who gets off

460
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,416
having 12 year olds
lust after you!

461
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,958
[FUTO] Like I'm gonna
be bothered by the bozo

462
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,291
who thinks he's
special just because

463
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,208
he's going to the
same college as her.

464
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,791
When will my
brothers understand?

465
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,458
As long as I'm around, you
don't stand a chance in hell.

466
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,166
Face it. I've got
this thing in the bag.

467
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,750
Yeah, sorry, but there's
no way she won't choose me.

468
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,416
[BOTH]
Tch.

469
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:13,541
