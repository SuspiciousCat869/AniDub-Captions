No. I'm okay. Really.

00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,958
And at last we meet.
You look lovely.

If you're ever in the mood for
a riveting Buddhist sermon,

I would be delighted
to give you one, my dear.

Is it too cold in here?

Do you want me
to turn the air down?

170
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,916
Oh. No. It's all right.

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,250
[KANAME] No it's not.
In fact, it's a little stuffy.

172
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,125
Compression of

Right. Yes.

I knew about all of you,

He's on tour.

204

I was wondering
where he went.

I knew I hadn't
seen him around.

Last thing I heard
he was in Hokkaido.

Have you ever been there?

208

We'll ask him to bring you
a souvenir if you want.

Thanks. That'd be nice.

Futo is our little
rockstar brother.

211

All his fans know him
as Asakura, though.

212
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,083
Can you believe that
he's this famous already?

213

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,250
I bet with this many brothers
he needed a way to stand out.

219
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,666
And his dad was gone a lot,
just like mine.

That always made me
want to travel.

221
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,458
He probably likes
being on tour so much.

I understand him.

There's no need to apologize.

that it might be exhaustion?

to a whole new world,

by the natives

and learning their language.

the medicine is working.

Great.

She should still take
it easy for a little while.

Maybe some nice
rice soup for dinner?

Sure. Sound okay?

Sounds perfect.

[UKYO] Oh, by the way,
the plumbing down here

277

go to take a bath later,

00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,416
use the one on
the fifth floor. Cool?

I don't think so.

a lot of things on your own.

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,333
Why don't you
call me brother?

317
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,375
[EMA gasps]
Brother, right.

318
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,083
Sounds lovely from your lips.

319
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,541
Please, say it for me again.

320
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,416
Um. Brother?

321
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,083
[KANAME chuckles]

322
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,416
[JULI] Kitty litter. Trees.

323
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,708
Are you sleepy yet?

324
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,000
[EMA]
I'm getting there. Thanks.

325
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,416
Will it help if your
big brother sleeps next to you?

326
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,000
[EMA] I don't think so.

327
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,333
Aww. Well. That's too bad.

328
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,083
If you get scared or
need anything, let me know.

329
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,166
I'm always
here for you, Baby Sis.

330
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,333
Thank you.
That means a lot to me.

331
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:56,083
[KANAME] Me too.
Have a good night, my dear.

332
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,541
[JULI] I saw that!

333
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,416
[EMA] For a second I thought
you were going to kiss me.

334
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,625
[JULI] Mm?

335
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,458
[KANAME] I'm sorry.

336
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:11,375
But you never know.
Maybe I'll do that someday.

337
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,958
Now I know for sure
you're just teasing me.

338
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,750
[KANAME] Uh.

339
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,875
I mean you are,
aren't you, Kaname?

340
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,333
Sorry, I'm still so fuzzy.

341
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,625
[KANAME] Get some rest.

342
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,541
We don't need your temperature
raising any higher.

343
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,333
I couldn't handle being
responsible for that.

344
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,291
[KANAME] We'll talk again
once you're well.

345
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,208
[KANAME]
And I promise next time...

346
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,708
the kiss won't be
at all confusing.

347
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,916
[EMA quavered exhale]

348
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,750
[pleased exhale]

349
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,083
[Come on, toothbrush.
I know you're in here.

350
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,166
Are you really gonna
take a bath right now?

351
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,416
It's kinda late, isn't it?

352
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,916
Yeah. I already got
a little bit of sleep,

353
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,041
and I think it would
help relax me.

354
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,083
[JULI] Well you're
not going by yourself!

355
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,833
I call "Bath Chaperone!"

356
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:11,333
But why?
I'm just going upstairs?

357
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,166
[EMA] Guess it's left.

358
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,875
[JULI grunts]

359
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,666
[EMA]
What are you doing, silly?

360
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,083
You never know what's around
the corners in this place.

361
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,166
The toilet's over there.

362
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,083
So, then.
The bath is that way.

363
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,708
Hey what's up?

364
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,333
[EMA gasps]

365
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,291
Is everything all right?

366
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:43,166
Um. Yeah. I'm sorry.

367
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,583
[EMA] Uh...!

368
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,666
[SUBARU] Oh, my bad!

369
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,916
[EMA] No. Uh...

370
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,791
[EMA] Sorry to bother you!

371
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,708
[EMA sighs]

372
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,333
That was so awkward.

373
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,833
What did I say?
You shouldn't be living here

374
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,750
with a bunch of random guys!

375
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,041
[TSUBAKI] Listen.
There's something I've wanted

376
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,958
to tell you for a while.

377
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,250
[JULI] Who dat?

378
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,500
[TSUBAKI] This is hard.

379
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,666
We've been together
for so long now.

380
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,125
Naturally.

381
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,958
But lately. I don't know,
I can't explain it.

382
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,500
[TSUBAKI]
Something's changed.

383
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,416
You lost?

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,541
[EMA gasps]

385
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,750
[TSUBAKI]
When I'm with you,

386
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,000
my heart races and
my palms start sweating.

387
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,833
Also, I don't really know why,

388
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,333
but I get so upset
when you're with other guys.

389
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,500
[AZUSA] What?

390
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,583
I... I think I love you.

391
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,916
[TSUBAKI]
And I want you to be mine.

392
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:43,750
[JULI] Whaddaya know?
Could have told you

393
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,666
they swung that way.

394
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,583
Well yeah,
but they're... brothers.

395
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,875
So they couldn't really be--

think you heard?

something in my room!

Uh. Bye.

[EMA] Uh. I'm good.

Oh dear. Your face
still looks flushed.

403
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,458
Careful, could be a fever.

404
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,166
No. I'm fine, really.

405
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,291
Uh... Is there something
you want to talk about?

406
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,208
No. I'm just tired.

407
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,041
[TSUBAKI] I know what it is.

408
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,000
Sleeping in a
new place is rough.

409
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,291
If you're scared,
you can sleep in my bed, eh?

--[EMA] I'm not.
--[SUBARU] Tsubaki, come on.

411
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,458
You can talk to
us about anything.

412
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,500
That's what big
brothers are for, right?

413
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,416
Um. Yeah...

414
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,125
[JULI] Chii!
You might as well tell them

415
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,625
what you heard earlier.

416
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,958
No reason to be cagey if they're
gonna be so open about it.

417
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,666
Fine! You have my
support no matter what!

418
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,375
We're family and I love you.

419
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,833
Thanks, I feel better now.

420
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,541
Uh. Good? But uh...

421
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:56,208
Yeah. I may have
overheard, uh, your,

422
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,208
your conversation earlier.

423
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,833
Conversation? The one we
just had downstairs?

424
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,333
Ah. It all makes sense now.

425
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,541
The time was right.

426
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,083
I'd been suppressing
my feelings for so long.

427
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,125
I finally had to tell Azusa
I'm in love with him.

428
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,458
Uh. You're what?

429
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,625
I hope you're not mad at me.

430
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,208
[TSUBAKI] Of course not!
It's about time

431
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,125
we came out with the truth.

432
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,625
Right, Pussycat?

433
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,125
[AZUSA clears throat]
Okay, that's enough.

434
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,000
[EMA] I'm happy
for you both! Goodnight!

435

[TSUBAKI laughing]

436
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,916
You guys are hysterical!

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,666
Best reactions ever!

438
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,916
[EMA] Huh?

439
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,208
[AZUSA] Tsubaki's a jerk.
We were just doing

440
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,750
a read-through of a script.

441
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,541
[EMA] A script?

442
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,583
[TSUBAKI] Yep.

443
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,916
I always like to
rehearse before our gigs.

444
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,041
[EMA] It wasn't real?

445
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,625
No. These two jerks
are voice actors.

446
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,458
You were acting.

447
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,875
I thought you were freaks.
My bad, fellas!

448
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,333
[EMA gasps]

449
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,750
Oh, please forgive me.
I interrupted your rehearsal!

450
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,083
I'm so sorry!

451
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,375
It's cool.
We're over it! But...

452
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,166
I would love to have a female
reader if you're interested?

453
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,083
It would really help me
with my character.

454
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,375
Oh stop. Don't you think

455
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,958
she's had enough
of that tonight?

456
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,916
[TSUBAKI laughs]
Yeah, I guess so.

457
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,750
You're still
on the mend, right?

458
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,375
Hm.

459
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,916
Sorry about that.
They're weird.

460
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,958
We've all thrown
a lot at you today.

461
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,833
It's... fine.

462
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,916
[EMA sighs]

463
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,291
Feels like my heart's gonna
burst out of my chest.

464
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,541
[JULI] Finally!
It's about time you laid down.

465
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,041
I'll stay here and keep an eye
on you till you fall asleep.

466
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,500
Thanks, Juli.
I'm glad you're here.

467
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,250
Where am I exactly?

468
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,875
[EMA] It's like we've discovered
a bizarre new universe.

469
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:25,833
[YUSUKE]
Crap! Why is this happening?

470
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,750
Why did it have to be
her of all people?

471
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:35,500
[UKYO] Pink? Actually no.
That's much too predictable.

472
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,916
[YUSUKE]
What are you talking about?

473
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,041
[UKYO] I'm trying to figure out
