1
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,708
[HIKARU]
Whether you mean to or not,

2
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,208
you torment those boys.

3
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,000
[IORI] I know I shouldn't
have these feelings,

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,958
but they just keep
growing stronger.

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,416
[HIKARU]
You have every one of us

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,333
confessing our love for you.

7
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,333
[IORI]
I just can't help myself.

8
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,416
[HIKARU]
You're the one for me.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,833
[IORI]
You're the one for me.

10
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,041
[IORI, HIKARU]
I love you.

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,583
[EMA]
Of course we love each other.

12
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,625
[EMA]
We're family.

13
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,125
[EMA] Our trip to Yatsugatake
came to an end.

14
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,291
And before I even
knew it, entrance exams

15
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,541
were just around the corner.

16
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,708
There are still so many
issues weighing on my mind.

17
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:36,041
But for now, I just need to
look ahead and try to focus.

18
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,583
And yet...

19
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,291
[groans]

20
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,916
Ugh. How did my mock
test grade go down so much

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,458
after such little time off?

22
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,416
[JULI] It's not the end
of the world, is it?

23
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,541
Practically every student
gets a D at some point.

24
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,500
I think Ukyo was
disappointed in me.

25
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,916
[JULI] Hey, it's perfectly
normal to bomb the dry run

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,291
but ace the real deal.

27
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,583
That's part of the
"entrance exam blues."

28
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,666
Really? And how many
exams have you taken?

29
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,333
Uh--

30
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,166
[doorbell rings]

31
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,500
[EMA]
Just a second!

32
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,708
Yes?

33
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,000
Hey. Can you spare
a couple minutes?

34
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,416
[EMA]
Sure! What's up?

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,375
Just thought of a way to
help out with your studies.

36
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,916
I made us brunch!

37
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,333
[EMA] Wow! You really
made all of this?

38
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,166
[UKYO] Yes. And since I
had a few assistants today,

39
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,500
I thought it'd be
appropriate to go all out.

40
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,833
Yeah, we practically worked

41
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,333
our fingers to the bone,
you old meanie.

42
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,375
And yet, somehow,

43
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,000
you still proved
completely useless.

44
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,666
[EMA] Sorry, this was supposed
to have been your day off.

45
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,125
Today was my turn to
make lunch for us.

46
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,625
Hey, not a problem.

47
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,916
The entrance exams are less
than a week away, after all.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,041
We really don't mind picking up
a bit of the extra slack

49
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,500
if it helps you and Yusuke out
over the next couple of days.

50
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,041
So why do I feel
like I had to do

51
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,958
just as much work around
here as I normally do?

52
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,500
[TSUBAKI]
That's right!

53
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,166
I meant to wish you luck on
your entrance exams too, bro.

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,708
[AZUSA] You could sound
a bit more sincere.

55
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,250
Even if his chances are abysmal,
let's be supportive.

56
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,666
[YUSUKE]
Dude!

57
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,750
[giggles]

58
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,250
Yay! She smiled!
We totally did it, guys!

59
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,416
All right!

60
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,583
[EMA]
What?

61
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,125
You were super sad
when your test results

62
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,541
came back with such a low grade.

63
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,541
So we all decided to
try and cheer you up.

64
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,125
Wataru!

65
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,708
[UKYO, TSUBAKI, AZUSA groan]

66
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,000
Thanks, guys.
I really appreciate it.

67
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,541
You've all been so
considerate of my feelings.

68
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,875
But I'll be just fine, promise.
I've applied to a safety school.

69
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,500
And I can still get
a major in the field

70
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,083
I wanna study there. So it's
no big deal in the long run.

71
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,958
[YUSUKE]
Now wait a damn minute!

72
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,875
Second best is unacceptable!

73
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,291
Don't give up before
you've even tried!

74
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,916
[EMA]
I didn't mean that.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,958
There are always things
that won't go your way,

76
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,583
that's just part of life.

77
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,666
But no matter how
hopeless it might seem,

78
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,333
there's always a chance
if you don't give up.

79
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,666
I'm applying to Meiji
with no safeties.

80
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,125
If I study hard enough,
they have to take me.

81
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,333
I know you can get in, too.

82
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,833
For someone who barely passes

83
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,833
any of his evaluations, I really
admire your new attitude.

84
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,541
Are you really going
for your top choice,

85
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,958
with no safeties?

86
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,375
That sounds incredibly reckless,

87
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,333
which is what we've come
to expect from you.

88
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,291
Well, we're all pulling
for you, regardless.

89
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,458
Great. Thanks for the
vote of confidence.

90
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,833
I'm gonna do it just
to spite you guys.

91
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,375
Yusuke's right! I refuse
to give up, too!

92
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,958
I'm going to study hard,
and get into Meiji with you!

93
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,958
Yeah? Let's do it! Together!

94
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,083
[WATARU]
College? You? Yeah right!

95
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,125
Wow. Thanks, kid,
I love you, too.

96
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,375
Lookie.

97
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,125
To help out, I made you
this super cool present.

98
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,166
You made a present?

99
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,250
Yup! Here you go.

100
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,916
That's the Helper Ticket.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And the Play a Game
Together Ticket.

102
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,458
One more. Here you go!

103
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,500

[YUSUKE coughing]

105
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,833
Oh uh, it's the
thought that counts?

106
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,166
Why you look weird?
What happened?

107
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,791
[EMA]
Cool. All done.

108
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,125
I don't know.

109
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,916
Seems like it would create
an emotional disconnect

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,916
from the previous scene.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,416
Yeah.

112
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,375
This whole chunk has nothing
to do with the through line.

113
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,375
I'd see what the director
thinks about it.

114
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,083
[TSUBAKI] Guess that's
the only shot I've got.

115
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,375
Director's a real 'auteur' type.
I don't wanna screw anything up.

116
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,416
[footsteps scuffing]

117

--[AZUSA grunts]
--[TSUBAKI] Hm?

118
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,291
[EMA] Hi guys.
Are you two heading out?

119
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,625
[AZUSA]
Yeah.

120
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,333
We've both been scheduled
for some voice-overs.

121
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,250
The studios are in
the same direction.

122
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,291
So, we figured maybe
we could share a ride.

123
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,541
[TSUBAKI]
Besides.

124
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,500
I needed to go over the
script a few times more.

125
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,416
So I asked my dear brother
if he could give me a lift.

126
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,916
[EMA]
Well, that's sensible.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,708
[gasps] Hang on a sec.

128
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,291
There. Sorry.

129
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,250
I need to step outside
and call the director.

130
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,333
Sure thing.

131
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,750
I'll grab the keys
and follow along.

132
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,416
Cool. Thanks. Ciao!

133
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,541
[EMA]
Yeah! See ya later.

134
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,458
[AZUSA] Tsubaki's certainly
changed, don't you think?

135
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,125
It all started when I was sick
and he took over my role for me.

136
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,541
It's like he's way more serious
about his acting since then.

137
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,666
And the people at the
studio are noticing.

138
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,083
I'm glad for him.

139
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,375
Being able to make your own way

140
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,666
in the job of your dreams
is totally awesome.

141
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,958
I've seen how hard you've
been studying, you know.

142
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,458
Keep up the good work,
and you'll be

143
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,500
the same as him one day. Right?

144
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,208
Right. I won't let you down.

145
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,125
I've never seen Tsubaki
so focused before.

146
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,333
It's bad luck that your health
kept you from playing the part.

147
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,666
But I'm excited he'll get to
play the role he always wanted.

148
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,791
[AZUSA] Oh. Is that what
you think happened?

149
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,541
I believe there's an
entirely different reason

150
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,083
for his new found drive.

151
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,208
No. The person
Tsubaki has become

152
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,083
is more captivating
than he ever was before.

153
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,500
So when you think of him,

154
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:36,208
see the man he is now,
not the boy he used to be.

155
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,458
And, who knows?

156
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,125
That might push me to
accomplish more as well.

157
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,458
[EMA]
Um, okay.

158
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,375
[AZUSA] I hope you'll take
that into consideration.

159
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,416
When you find an answer to
the way we feel about you.

160
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,583
[gasps]

161
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,416
[AZUSA] I won't press
you for a response

162
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,041
until after the exams.

163
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,750
And no matter what
answer you give,

164
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,833
I'll accept it with grace.

165
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,916
[sighs]

166
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,708
[EMA]
Subaru? You look nice.

167
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,666
Hey, have you got a minute?

168
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,416
[SUBARU]
I told you before.

169
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,708
I was approached by
a scout for the pros.

170
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,500
I've decided to
accept the offer.

171
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,958
[EMA gasps]

172
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,500
[SUBARU] They asked me to
come to their headquarters.

173
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,833
So I'm heading off to Kyushu
for final negotiations.

174
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,791
I'm leaving today.

175
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,625
Congratulations!
I'm so happy for you!

176
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,916
Looks like I'll have
to be out there

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,166
for quite a while.
And by the time I get back.

178
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,375
You'll be finished
with your exams.

179
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,666
I feel bad because
you're applying

180
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,625
for my school, but I won't
be able to help out.

181
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,166
Oh, it's fine. Please,
don't worry about it.

182
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,666
[SUBARU] Listen. I know
your scores dropped.

183
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,208
Don't let that get you down.

184
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,916
All of the hard work you've
put in will pay off big time.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,125
Thanks.

186
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,083
It may be tough, but I
know you'll get by.

187
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,125
Just stay strong.
And that stuff with me?

188
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,541
It can wait until you're done.

189
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,833
[gasps]

190
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,250
So. Yeah. I should get going.

191
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,208
Oh. Sure.

192
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,375
[EMA]
Have a nice flight. And...

193
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,875
Good luck to you, too.

194
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,375
Thanks a lot.

195
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:24,708
[giggles] I'll do my very best.
I owe everyone that much.

196
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,458
[EMA]
And at long last.

197
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:35,041
The day of the entrance
exam was upon us.

198
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:35,750
[JULI]
Chii!

199
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,666
[EMA]
What is it?

200
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,291
Do you have your
exam pass ready?

201
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,875
[EMA]
I've got it.

202
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,500
What about your pen case?
Did you grab that?

203
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,458
Yes! I've got it right
here, okay? You see?

204
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,291
[gasps] Oh no, it's empty!

205
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,500
[JULI]
Now calm down, Chii!

206
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,083
[EMA] That's pretty rich
coming from you!

207
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,250
--[doorbell rings]
--[JULI] Here's a pen.

208
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,333
--[doorbell rings]
--No, wait, that's me!

209
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,958
Oh. Coming!

210
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,583
Good morning! You ready?

211
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,625
I guess so.

212
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,458
[JULI]
Hm?

213
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,541
Good luck.

214
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,500
I have to head out
for the day, now.

215
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,958
But I wanted to come by
and be supportive!

216
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,958
Thanks. I really appreciate it!

217
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,208
[JULI] Me too! She needed
some good vibes!

218
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,000
What's wrong?

219
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,250
Louis?

220
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,208
Stray hair.

221
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,583
Huh?

222
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,458
There. I'm all done.

223
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,791
I like having my hair in place.
Makes me feel sharper.

224
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,583
[EMA laughs]

225
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,833
Heh. That's Louis for ya.

226
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,125
He understands all that
self-confidence crapola.

227
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,541
Yep. Yep.

228
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,041
[LOUIS]
And there's this.

229
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,916
It was sitting in
front of your door.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,750
[EMA]
How pretty. Iori?

231
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,833
[LOUIS] An iris. In the
language of flowers.

232
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,833
"Faith in good things to come."

233
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,041
[EMA chuckles]

234
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,375
Your packed lunches.

235
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,000
[YUSUKE]
Thanks a lot, Ukyo.

236
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,291
[EMA]
Thanks.

237
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,791
Just try to keep yourselves
relaxed, alright?

238
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:50,833
But don't be so relaxed

239
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,458
that you can't
give it everything.

240
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,583
And do double-check your
work for random mistakes.

241
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,041
Ah.

242
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,166
They say you should always
go with your first instinct

243
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,666
when taking a test.

244
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,250
Either you studied
well and know it,

245
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,416
or you didn't and don't.

246
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
[UKYO] What do I know?
I'm just a lawyer.

247
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,583
[HIKARU] Well. Our charming
sister is one thing.

248
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,875
But you'd better go over your
work with a fine-tooth comb.

249
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,041
Thanks for the confidence.

250
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,458
[phone rings]

251
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,791
[NATSUME]
It's finally time.

252
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,708
When you're done,
I'll have a reward for you.

253
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,708
So good luck.

254
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,625
Thanks, Natsume.

255
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,458
[phone rings]

256
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,583
Who is this? Hello?

257
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,125
[FUTO]
Nice.

258
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,666
I'm puttin' in the effort to
call during my break at work,

259
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,625
the least you could do
is pick up faster.

260
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,916
[EMA]
Futo?

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,083
[FUTO]
If I remember correctly.

262
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,458
You're takin' your
big test thing today.

263
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,916
And so, my gift is the honor
of hearing my sexy voice.

264
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,500
But if you fail, you can
always stay back another year.

265
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,125
Then you and I can
have a lot of fun

266
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,000
being in the same
class together.

267
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,875
Great. Did you just
call to tease?

268
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,583
Are you still there?

269
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,250
Seriously though, good luck.

270
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,583
I'll be cheering you on.

271
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,208
[phone clicks]

272
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,416
[EMA] Can't believe he took
the time just to call me.

273
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,666
I wonder if he really
meant what he said,

274
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,250
or if he was just
teasing me again.

275
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,291
[YUSUKE] Let's get going
before we're late!

276
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,333
[EMA]
'Kay!

277
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,125
[EMA] They each have
different ways of doing it.

278
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,000
But everyone's rooting for me.

279
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,791
Because that's what families do.

280
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,375
They support each other!

281
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,541
And once the college
entrance exams are over...

282
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,333
[EMA] ...that will open the door
to a whole new adventure.

283
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,291
[EMA]
The test is over and done with.

284
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,125
But I can't relax until
the results come in.

285
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,541
[sighs]

286
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,625
[KANAME] What an adorable sigh
you have, Little Sister.

287
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,583
[EMA gasps]
Don't scare me like that!

288
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,291
I didn't know you'd gone out.

289
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,625
[KANAME]
Yeah.

290
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,541
I've got a thing or two
on my mind at the moment.

291
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,833
[EMA]
Hm?

292
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,375
But tell me.

293
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,416
I'd like to know why you were
sighing like that just now.

294
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,833
[EMA] It's no big deal.
It's just that,

295
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,166
every time I think about
my test results,

296
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,708
I get so nervous.

297
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,125
[KANAME]
About failing?

298
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,750
It could really go either way,
as far as I could tell.

299
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,000
[KANAME]
Gotcha.

300
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,625
Allow me to offer you
a tiny bit of advice.

301
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,375
Though it has been
quite a while.

302
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,875
Almost a decade since my exam.

303
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,833
But anyhow, if things
don't work out.

304
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,333
You can always come to
my place. How's that sound?

305
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,083
Oh, don't you worry!
I'll be fine.

306
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,750
I'm pretty sure the
flower Iori gave me

307
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,875
will bring me more than
enough luck to pass.

308
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:40,958
Iori, huh?

309
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,666
[EMA]
Yeah. He gave me an iris.

310
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,875
Apparently in the language
of flowers it means:

311
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,833
"Faith in good things to come."

312
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,708
[KANAME]
I see.

313
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,041
Is there something the matter?

314
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,416
[KANAME] Nothing. Right.
I'm heading inside.

00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,791
Subaru...

475
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:14,250
[water splashes]

476
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,625
Man, I can't relax!

477
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:21,458
Just announce
the results already!

478
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,375
You're fine. You did
everything you could.

479
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,416
You'll get accepted,
then tell her.

480
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,833
You love her!

481
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,541
[HIKARU]
I can't hold back any longer!

482
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,625
When I see her,

483
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,625
my heart starts
pounding in my chest!

484
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,916
[YUSUKE]
Hikaru, bro.

485
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,791
Don't tell me you've got
feelings for her, too!

486
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,500
[HIKARU] It's time I worked up
my nerve, and asked her.

487
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,583
"Can I borrow your
school uniform?"

488
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:46,958
[YUSUKE]
That's what you want?
