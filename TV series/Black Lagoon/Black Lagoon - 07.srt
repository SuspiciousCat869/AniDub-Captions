1
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,208
[ROCK] Okay,
I've got one for ya.

2
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,208
Let me see if
I can remember it...

3
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:53,125
Okay, how many Polacks does it
take to change a lightbulb?

4
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,708
I'm guessing one to
hold the lightbulb

5
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:01,666
and 99 to turn the house.
Isn't that it?

6
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,416
[ROCK] Let's see...

7
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,416
So, the Pope says to
this guy who's dressed

8
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,791
like he's homeless--

9
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,875
"I thought I told ya to
get out of here yesterday."

10
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,125
Yeah, good one.

11
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:16,375
Do me a favor--just shut
up and drive, will ya?

12
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:26,125
Ah! This sucks!
This really fucking sucks!

13
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,750
Why am I stuck playing
fuckin' errand boy with you?

14
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,250
That's what I
really wanna know.

15
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,375
That lousy prick, Dutch.
I hope he dies.

16
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,541
What? Why me?

17
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,583
I have to work on
the boat all day.

18
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,208
And Benny's gonna be busy
with the electronics.

19
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,250
Oh, right. Revy's just
laying around in here room.

20
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,666
You can take her with you.

21
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,708
Hmm. Take Revy...?

22
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,791
That a problem?

23
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,833
No...

24
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,666
But I can tell you she's
not gonna wanna do it.

25
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,083
[DUTCH] Sounds like something
that you two need to deal with.

26
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,500
And it's got nothing
to do with me or the job.

27
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,041
Start in this neighborhood.

28
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,291
First, head to Rowan
"Jackpot" Pigeon's place

29
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,166
on Rachiada Street.

30
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,166
Welcome, my sweet Rebecca.

31
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,375
And here I thought
you'd given up on me.

32
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,875
So, you finally decided to
shake that fine ass of yours

33
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,333
in an S&amp;M show. I'd knew
you'd come around, baby.

34
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,958
Fuck off, will ya, Rowan?

35
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,875
The only reason I'm here
is 'cause of my job.

36
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,291
So, don't start with that.

37
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,791
I'm not into being tied up
or tying other people up.

38
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,083
You haven't changed.

39
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,250
You look so good,
you'd be great for either.

40
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,500
I'm telling you, girl.
It's a real shame.

41
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:52,083
So, what brings you here today?

42
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,166
Right. Regarding the goods
you ordered from--

43
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,541
You ordered booze
for this place, right?

44
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,083
We've got 1,500 bottles for ya.

45
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,833
They're in Warehouse Five
at the harbor.

46
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,375
Now <i>this</i> is what
I'm talkin' about.

47
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,541
What?! Tax sure has
gone up on these!

48
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,541
It's killing me! How's a brother
supposed to make a dime? Shit.

49
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,541
Oh, yeah--what's
up with your friend

50
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,666
who looks like he ain't never
seen a pair of titties before?

51
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,583
[REVY] Oh, him.
He's the rookie at our place.

52
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,250
He's got nowhere else to go,

53
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,333
so we had no choice
but to take care of him.

54
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,583
Hmm. Looks like you're in
for a rough ride, brother.

55
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,208
You ever need anything,
don't be shy.

56
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,208
Later, Rowan. And don't forget
about the money, alright?

57
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,208
So, the shipment's
going to be late, is it?

58
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,833
You could've told me
that over the phone,

59
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,916
but instead, you came
all the way here?

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,375
[REVY] Hey, I hear ya.
Tell that to Dutch.

61
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,666
Makes no difference. I've gotta
finish fifteen of these today,

62
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,541
so I won't be getting out
anytime soon. No.

63
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,041
Yep, I should've gotten
a part-timer to do it.

64
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,458
I'm seriously losing my mind.

65
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,625
I have a meeting tonight, too.

66
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,208
Some more idiots selling drugs
without permission again.

67
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,583
What a pain in the balls.

68
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,500
Hold on a sec. Is she
taking it up the ass?!

69
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,291
Sure is.

70
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,416
Oh, if you guys hear
anything about that,

71
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,458
I'd appreciate it
if you let me know.

72
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,500
I'll thank you properly.

73
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,416
Yeah, if we hear anything.

74
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,958
I'm sure we'll be
back pretty soon.

75
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,375
Good luck with the rest.

76
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,333
Somebody shoot me.

77
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:37,625
Ah! This sucks!
This really fucking sucks!

78
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,125
Why am I stuck playing
fuckin' errand boy with you?

79
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,000
That's what I
really wanna know.

80
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,333
Well, only one more stop
and we'll be done.

81
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,666
Let's see...

82
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,125
Receive firearms on order
from Sister PW Deegan

83
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,041
of the Ripoff Church.

84
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,125
[PARROT] Hello.

85
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,958
[REVY] Hey, you old bitch!

86
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,708
It's Rebecca from
the Lagoon Company!

87
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,708
Open this fucking door,
you old skank! Hello?

88
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,166
[PARROT] Hello. Hello.
Open the door, you old skank.

89
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,041
--Hello. Hello.
--[REVY] Hey!

90
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,583
Open the door, you old skank.

91
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,166
[EDA] You've always
been too damn loud.

92
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,208
Just put those in the
shed for now, you got it?

93
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,375
But these are cleaned items. 

94
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,083
Are you sure that's
where you want them?

95
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,083
[EDA] It's okay. It's what
the sister wanted.

96
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:40,250
Hey, Two Hands,
that's the chapel.

97
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,958
I can't let your kind
walk through there.

98
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,416
Over here. Follow me.

99
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,500
[SISTER YOLANDA] Oh my.

100
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,208
This certainly is a surprise.

101
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,750
I never thought I'd see the day

102
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,208
when Dutchy-boy would
send you on an errand.

103
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,750
That's none of your business.

104
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,500
Now why don't you tell us if
you got the goods we ordered,

105
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,791
Sister?

106
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,791
Right. New items
from Eastern Europe,

107
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,875
arriving by way of Cambodia.

108
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,833
All but one item.

109
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,500
Unfortunately, we're
still waiting to receive

110
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,375
the Arwin 37 grenade
launcher you ordered.

111
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,708
Now don't kid around, Sister.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,125
The reason we ordered
everything through you

113
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:27,250
is because we need all of
those items for the next job.

114
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,791
[SISTER YOLANDA] Well, quite
frankly, we do have the item.

115
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,250
It's just that a different
customer is saying

116
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,166
they need it immediately.

117
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,458
I'm sure you can see
my dilemma here.

118
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:43,791
However... Lagoon is a good
customer, so I wouldn't mind

119
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,833
handing it over to you,
despite the inconvenience.

120
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,291
But, I'd like a
better deal for us

121
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,250
or a discount on your services.

122
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,541
[REVY] Don't fuck
with us, Sister.

123
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,208
Why don't you do the smart thing
and play this one by the book,

124
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,416
so everyone will be happy?

125
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
You wouldn't wanna count your
money with your feet, would ya?

126
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:07,125
I wouldn't make idle threats
if I were you, Rebecca.

127
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:11,208
If you insist, then why don't
you bring Dutchy-boy around?

128
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,125
That's all I have to say.

129
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,625
There's nothing before,
nothing after.

130
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,500
Step off, Eda, you
limp-wristed bitch.

131
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:32,750
Let's see how much you talk
with a hole in your head.

132
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,250
[ROCK slurping]

133
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,166
This is very good tea, Sister.

134
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,916
Sister... Um...

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's Sister Yolanda, young man.

136
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,166
It's been a very long
time since I've had tea

137
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,250
that wasn't from a teabag.

138
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,791
Is this W&amp;M? Or perhaps
this is Fortnum and Mason?

139
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:02,125
My. You're very
knowledgeable, aren't you?

140
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,708
You're right. This is W&amp;M.

141
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,041
There's nothing nicer
than a good cup of tea.

142
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes. It takes a company
with that kind of history

143
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,041
and dedication to deliver
such flavor without fail.

144
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,208
Rock, will you shut the fuck up?

145
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,208
That's true for any company,
even if their products differ.

146
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,125
Am I right in saying that?

147
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,416
I don't quite see it.

148
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,791
What exactly are you
getting at, young man?

149
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,041
What is your point?

150
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,375
Are you trying to imply

151
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,208
that it's also true
for illegal firearms?

152
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,666
I'm afraid we won't have much of
a negation if you get too hasty.

153
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,166
I'm talking about the drugs.

154
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,833
That's what I'm
getting at, Sister.

155
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,500
Lately, drugs are
being distributed

156
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:51,083
outside the agreed upon routes.
Did you know that, Sister?

157
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,250
Hotel Moscow and other
mafia in the city

158
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,583
have made every effort
to find the source.

159
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,416
They've looked everywhere
they could think of.

160
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,541
But the culprits still
haven't been found.

161
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,583
And that's because
there's a blind spot.

162
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,791
Somewhere they
shouldn't have to look.

163
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,833
For instance, those who
can freely cross borders

164
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,333
under the auspices
of the church.

165
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,875
Or NGO members
who don't even know

166
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,083
they're being used as mules.

167
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,541
It strikes me that these
people are being overlooked.

168
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,833
Sister Eda,

169
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,291
why did you have those men leave
the clean linens in the shed?

170
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:28,000
Aren't cleaned items normally
taken to the living quarters?

171
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,166
[SISTER YOLANDA] Young man,
you can't make statements

172
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,083
based on mere conjecture.
You make it sound like

173
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,708
the stuff's coming
out of this place.

174
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,125
It's just a hypothesis.

175
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:44,458
Also, we could talk
about weapon shipments.

176
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,291
The amount of weapons entering
and leaving this place...

177
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,333
They don't seem to add up,
if you know what I mean.

178
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,208
That's easy to figure out
with a little research.

179
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:57,458
It was dangerously
easy to see, actually.

180
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:01,041
One last thing. The Lagoon
Company is, of course,

181
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,750
on friendly terms
with Hotel Moscow.

182
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,583
But I wouldn't say
we necessarily

183
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,541
work together, either.

184
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:15,708
I see your point. If you
improve your timing a bit,

185
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,000
then you'll really take shape.

186
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,583
--Eda.
--Yes, Sister?

187
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,958
[SISTER YOLANDA] He's a bit
rough, but he passes.

188
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,791
Add the Arwin to the list.

189
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,541
[EDA] Okay.

190
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,458
Dutch-boy has a good eye.

191
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,625
I can't imagine
where he found you.

192
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,875
It's almost time for mass.

193
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,416
I apologize, but you'll
have to be on your way.

194
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,916
Young man, come visit
us again sometime soon.

195
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,708
[REVY] You got lucky this time.

196
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,416
Go to hell, bitch.

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
My dear. You could
learn a thing or two

198
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,083
from that young man, you know?

199
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,000
In the end, waving your
gun around doesn't work.

200
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,666
You'll never do good
business like that.

201
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,958
Go fuck yourself.

202
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,291
[ROCK] Oh man.

203
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,958
We should've timed this a
little better. It's crowded.

204
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,416
Let's eat before it gets cold.

205
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,833
I don't wanna eat.

206
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,166
Try it. A good meal
will make you feel better.

207
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,041
Why don't you give me the keys?
I'll go home on my own.

208
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,208
If you do that,
I can't get back.

209
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,125
Why don't you walk?

210
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,125
[ROCK] That's not gonna happen.

211
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,666
Know what?

212
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,000
You should go back to Japan.

213
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,958
You're just not
cut out for this.

214
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,250
Well, you're the
one who invited me.

215
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,083
[REVY] Yup. Really
fucked up there.

216
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,125
[ROCK] I wonder... Maybe you
can tell me who kept the church

217
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,291
from becoming
a bloodbath today.

218
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,166
It's just like
the old lady said--

219
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,541
you can't solve
everything with a gun.

220
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,583
I'm warning you.

221
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,958
You better watch
what you say, Rock.

222
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,041
[ROCK] You've been like this
ever since the submarine.

223
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,458
--Was it our talk?
--[REVY] Who cares?!

224
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,583
I told you never to
talk about that again.

225
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,458
Revy...

226
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:24,208
I'm not gonna apologize anymore.

227
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I must have misheard you.
You better hope I did.

228
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,166
Otherwise, you're
a fucking dead man.

229
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,416
[ROCK] Is that so?

230
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,166
In that case,
I'll say it again--

231
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,250
I didn't make any mistake!

232
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:47,500
I've nothing to apologize for!
That's what I'm saying.

233
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,833
That's a shame.

234
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,041
You just stepped
on a non-negotiable,

235
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,000
big-ass fucking landmine.

236
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,458
Like I said... a real shame.

237
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,583
There's just one last
thing I need to ask you--

238
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,458
what do you want on your
tombstone, cocksucker?

239
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:17,875
Why don't you write, "There's
no cure for a fool with a gun."

240
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,500
Well, Rock, goodbye.

241
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,000
See ya.

242
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,041
See that?

243
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,458
There are some problems
you can't solve with a gun.

244
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,833
You bastard!

245
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,583
Who are you calling
"bastard"? My name is Rock!

246
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,875
You got that?!

247
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,291
Fuck! I've had more
than my fill of this shit!

248
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,708
I've had enough!

249
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,458
I thought I was done with
kissing ass for a living,

250
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,208
but here I am at
the ends of the earth,

251
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,125
now I'm supposed to
be kissing your ass?

252
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,958
What kind of sick joke is this?!

253
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,125
You fucking spoiled,
arrogant son of a--

254
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,166
It's Rock! And "arrogant"?
Who the hell are you kidding?!

255
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,458
Why don't you try taking
a good look at yourself?

256
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,916
Aren't you supposed to be some
kind of outlaw? A wild pirate?

257
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,458
But as soon as you
open your mouth,

258
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,083
all I ever hear you talking
about is "money, money, money."

259
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,625
You think you'd be some hard-ass
villain after the big prize,

260
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,250
but you end up scavenging
off corpses instead.

261
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,125
Is there any fucking limit
to how greedy you can be?

262
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,541
Are you really that pathetic?

263
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,500
Don't you have any
pride left in you?!

264
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,208
You really think you can
judge me, mister white-collar?

265
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,125
What do you know
about my life, huh?

266
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,958
What the hell do
you know about me?!

267
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,625
Go on, why don't you tell me?

268
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,083
A guy like you who spent his
life in a safe little bubble

269
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,208
has no idea what
I've been through!

270
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,500
[ROCK] You're right. There's
no way I could know that.

271
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,375
I'm not you, after all.

272
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,958
But still, let me ask you this--

273
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,000
other than the fact
that I'm white-collar,

274
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,708
what do you know about me?

275
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,666
It doesn't matter who
you are or how you live.

276
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,625
We all have to suffer, right?

277
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,000
You have no intention
of understanding that.

278
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,333
Instead of owning up to things,

279
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,625
you'd rather play the part
of the tragic heroine.

280
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,166
That's the most cowardly
thing about you, Revy.

281
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,666
Shut up! It's convenient
for you to see it like that!

282
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,583
Goddamn it! This isn't
one of those cheap,

283
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,291
picaresque Hollywood films
you love to talk about!

284
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,666
There are no heroes
in this life!

285
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,416
And what's all this about
pride? Fuck your pride!

286
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,416
Look around you. It's shit
as far as the eye can see.

287
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,500
I hate to break it to you, but
there is no fuckin' Robin Hood.

288
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,833
[ROCK] If there's
no Robin Hood,

289
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,541
then why don't you
become Robin Hood?

290
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,500
It's gotta be better than
feeling sorry for yourself.

291
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,083
Crying about your hard life.

292
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,291
Shut up! Shut the
fuck up, damn it!

293
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,625
I'm serious... I'll kill you.

294
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,166
Then do it.

295
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,791
Keep chasing your tail like
a dog if that's what you want.

296
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,958
If you kill me here, then you'll
just end up proving me right.

297
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,458
That's all I know how to do!

298
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,375
[ROCK] Did you forget, Revy?

299
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,416
The reason I ended up here...

300
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,291
My bosses calmly
cut my life away.

301
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,458
I was an afterthought.
And all for what?

302
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,500
To protect their dirty money,
their expense accounts,

303
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,791
their place at
the boardroom table.

304
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,375
When you first invited me in,

305
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,833
it was like waking up
from a long sleep.

306
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,916
My life had become
the rush-hour commute,

307
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,791
the fake laughing,
lowering my head,

308
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,833
risking my life
to score points.

309
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,083
And all of that was fine,

310
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,166
as long as I had a place
to drink after work

311
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,208
and a batting cage nearby.

312
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:03,000
And then, just like that,
none of it mattered anymore.

313
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,625
The one person who
shook me awake...

314
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,750
...the one who invited me in...

315
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,875
It was you, Revy.

316
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,875
What concerns me now is that
the one woman who showed me

317
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:20,000
all of this is acting just like
the people who betrayed me.

318
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,166
I'm not gonna stand by
and let that happen.

319
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:33,000
[REVY] I don't know what you're
talking about, goddamn it.

320
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,583
Ah, fuck it. You're a real
pain in the ass, you know that?

321
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,958
An idiot like you
won't live long.

322
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,000
We're both idiots and we've both
suffered. Just leave it at that.

323
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,458
I'm pretty sure you're the
biggest idiot here, dumbass.

324
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,083
--Gettin' mad!
--[REVY] Ooh, sounds scary.

325
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,125
What are you gonna do?
Write a memo or something?

326
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,375
[WATSAP]
Hey, you two!

327
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,000
Why don't you mind your
own fuckin' business?!

328
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,500
[WATSAP] Surprise, surprise.

329
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,583
I hear someone's making
a ruckus at the market

330
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,875
and it turns out
to be you again.

331
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,875
Revy, this town isn't your
private shooting gallery.

332
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,791
Discharging your weapon without
any concern for who's watching

333
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,916
and I'm the poor slob
who's gotta put out the fire.

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,750
[REVY] Isn't that why we give
you all those fat envelopes?

335
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,375
Do I complain to you
about my job, Chief?

336
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,833
[WATSAP] I'm not
saying don't do it,

337
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,458
I'm just saying do it
where no one's gonna see ya.

338
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,000
As long as you do that,
I don't care if you kill people

339
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,166
or play hide the apple,
for that matter.

340
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,583
Out of sight,
out of mind means that

341
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,416
I don't have to
cancel my golf dates

342
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,208
and I can work on my
short game in peace.

343
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,791
Anyway, I'm bringing you in.

344
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,333
There's paperwork to be
taken care of on our side.

345
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,875
Fine by me.

346
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,791
Damn engine is
giving me trouble.

347
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,333
Drown your sorrows?

348
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,875
[DUTCH] Thanks.

349
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,000
Hey Chief, don't go
stealing our car.

350
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,666
[WATSAP] I don't want that piece
of shit. Come get it later.

351
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,541
[REVY] Hey, Rock.

352
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,375
Just one thing.

353
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,250
Let me ask you this and there
won't be any more trouble...

354
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:23,250
So, um, I just wanna know
which side you wanna be on.

355
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,791
[ROCK] Me?

356
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,416
I'm right here where
I'm sitting, Revy.

357
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,625
I'm not anywhere else.

358
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,125
Rock, give me a light.

359
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,083
[ROCK] Light?
The cop's got the lighter.

360
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,541
What are you talking about?
You got one in your mouth.

361
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,458
What a fucked up day that was.

362
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,000
No shit.

363
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,625
[REVY] Damn.

364
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:15,166
I'm so tired. I wanna
go home and sleep.

365
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,708
[ROCK] Yeah.

366
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,583
[GARCIA] They're planning
to sell me off somewhere,

367
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:51,625
aren't they?

368
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,041
[REVY] Even if there
is no justice,

369
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,958
the world's gonna
keep on turning.
