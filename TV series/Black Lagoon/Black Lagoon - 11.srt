Roanapur.

2
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,416
In this city, gangs from around
the world jostle for territory.

3
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,875
It's a strange and
deadly game they play.

4
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,208
[TV REPORTER] This is
an unmitigated tragedy.

5
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,291
Sources at the scene tell us

6
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,208
that not much remains
of the embassy.

7
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,833
What we know so far is
that 37 embassy employees

8
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,416
have been killed and
another 150 are wounded.

9
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,416
The DRC military is
currently continuing

10
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,000
with its rescue efforts.
Directly following the bombing,

11
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,750
a terrorist organization
calling themselves

12
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,666
the Protectors of
the Islamic Front

13
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,583
have claimed responsibility
for the bombing.

14
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,625
[ROCK]
This room is filthy.

15
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,833
Revy, are you gonna
sleep all day?

16
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:37,833
We have a job.

17
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,958
Dutch says it's an emergency.

18
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,583
Revy!

19
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,500
[REVY] Is that you, Rock?

20
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:48,208
Yeah, it's me. I guess
it's a last minute request.

21
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,500
His exact words were,
"Wake her the hell up."

22
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,875
So, I ran down from the office.

23
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,500
Goddamn it.

24
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,416
This job... Who's it from?

25
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,083
Mr. Chang.
Y'know, from the Triad.

26
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,500
[CHANG] I've been waiting
for quite a while now.

27
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:13,291
What do I have to do to get
a cup of coffee around here?

28
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,208
Honestly, Dutch, is this
what you call service?

29
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,875
[DUTCH] It's my mistake for not
knowing we were running a café.

30
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,125
You do know why I
own that torpedo boat,

31
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,291
don't you, Mr. Chang?

32
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,833
Dutch. Now that's just cold.

33
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,458
Our place just burned down
and we came straight here.

34
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,500
I'd say the very least you could
do is offer us a cup of coffee.

35
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,708
That's some bad luck, Mr. Chang.

36
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,541
I hear you lost
half the building.

37
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,750
[CHANG] Yeah. I gotta say,
they hit us hard.

38
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,166
Was it the Russians?

39
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,125
No, that's impossible.
We've always been very friendly

40
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,375
with Miss Balalaika
and company.

41
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,125
Hey. Glad you could join us.

42
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,625
Someone wanna fill me in?
Did I miss much?

43
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,125
[CHANG] No, we're just
getting started.

44
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,083
This briefcase is the
cause of everything.

45
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,041
But that just proves
how valuable it is.

46
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,041
I took this off an
incredibly stupid Bulgarian

47
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,500
who was trying to make a
quick buck in my territory.

48
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,708
Here's the thing--I don't
recall giving permission

49
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,458
to sell weapons to anyone,

50
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:13,000
other than good old Yolanda
from the Ripoff Church.

51
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,500
But for some reason,

52
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,916
this guy thought he'd
give it a try anyway.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,833
He was casually selling
guns on the street

54
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,666
like he was running a
hotdog stand or something.

55
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,083
What's worse, he mistook
all of my warnings

56
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,333
for some kind of crazy joke.

57
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,958
Although, eventually he did
understand and made a deal...

58
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,125
...right around the
time we told him

59
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:35,000
we were gonna crush
his balls like nuts.

60
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,875
Unbelievable. I mean,
the guy was a real idiot,

61
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,166
but it turns out he had
a very interesting job.

62
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,416
Yeah?

63
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,750
[CHANG] He worked for
Bulgarian Intelligence.

64
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,083
This city is a
comfortable place

65
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,166
for folks like that
too, you know.

66
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,500
Normally, a guy like that would
be very useful to us, but...

67
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,583
You can only play
with fire for so long

68
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,375
before it gets out of control.

69
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,708
And what do you
suppose he offered us

70
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,208
in exchange for his balls?

71
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, Dutch?

72
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,000
--Documents.
--Really?

73
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,500
[CHANG] The hiking routes of
a friendly little organization

74
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,958
we all know of.

75
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,208
I'm sure you've heard of them.
If I'm not mistaken,

76
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,041
the little job they
did before hitting us

77
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,291
has been on TV all morning.

78
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,583
The US Embassy!

79
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,541
Sounds dangerous to me.

80
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,000
[CHANG] Turns out that
ball boy's real job

81
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,375
was actually with them.

82
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,166
Apparently, the world's
full of people

83
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,833
who want Uncle Sam
to disappear.

84
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,291
They're just the
latest ones to try.

85
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,625
Anyway, I decided to get
in touch with one such group

86
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,333
and I told them that they'd
dropped something important.

87
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,000
But as soon as I quoted these
guys what it would cost them,

88
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,416
they told me to get
the hell out of there

89
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,791
before they burned
my ass alive.

90
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,250
Not very nice...
So, this is how I answered--

91
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:48,166
"Fine. Have it your way.
I'll go elsewhere then."

92
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,083
Thanks to that...

93
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,875
...my office was blasted
all the way to Jordan today.

94
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,916
And as predicted, my ass
did nearly become a roast

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,625
before I got here,
so it wasn't just talk.

96
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,291
These guys really don't
have a sense of humor.

97
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,666
So, Dutch. Here's the deal--

98
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,625
I want you to deliver this.

99
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,250
Five teams will leave
Roanapur at the same time,

100
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,500
but here's the thing--

101
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,666
each of them will have
a different destination.

102
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,083
There are five cases,
but only one jackpot.

103
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,416
So, it's a feint.

104
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,666
Yup. As insurance, of course.

105
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,833
Your destination is the military
base on Basilan Island.

106
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,000
You have two days.

107
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,750
After that, my company contacts
will have left Basilan.

108
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,625
[DUTCH] Chang, my man. Two days
does not give us enough time.

109
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,875
There's never enough time,
is there, Dutch?

110
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,291
Last night's embassy
bombing is just the first

111
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,000
in a series of events.

112
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,375
Two days from now, the next
schedule is set to begin.

113
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,666
Let's put it this way--when
they're done hiking this time,

114
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,833
there's gonna be
a new president.

115
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,166
Uncle Sam came to me
because their embassy

116
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,833
went up like the Challenger.

117
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,166
If they knew how
to deal with this,

118
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,208
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

119
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,375
We'll provide you with a
getaway driver and a guard

120
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,500
once you get to the island.

121
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,875
I'm counting on you, Dutch.

122
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,541
[DUTCH] Did you bring
our pay here with you?

123
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,916
Expenses are on top
of that, as usual.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,125
[CHANG] That's fine by me.
We'll do our usual...

125
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,958
[REVY] R! P! G!

126
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,916
[CHANG] Well, they don't
waste any time.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,166
They're already here.

128
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,250
Dai-low! You alright?

129
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,333
Your information's leaked,
Mr. Chang.

130
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,958
We're gonna have
to cancel this one.

131
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,458
[CHANG] Are you gonna quit?

132
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,583
I'd hate to see you stuck
with the repair bill for this.

133
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:39,250
Anyhow, the least I can do
is escort you to your boat.

134
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,458
But first...

135
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,708
I have to admit,

136
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,916
it's been a while since
I've been in the field.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,250
--Emergency exit?
--I'll show ya.

138
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,041
Follow me.

139
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,666
A little guided
tour, huh? Great.

140
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,250
--Shit!
--Don't panic, Two-Hands.

141
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,041
In this situation...

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,333
...if you hesitate, you lose.

143
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,500
Chang's cleared the way
for us. Now let's go!

144
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,416
Yeah, I'm on it.

145
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,875
Careful, boss man.

146
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,833
[CHANG] Don't get cocky,
Two-Hands.

147
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,583
No one can say you
don't have the skills,

148
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,541
but you fail to see
the bigger picture.

149
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,375
True. I can admit I'm
not at your level yet.

150
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,125
I just hope I'll
get there someday.

151
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,541
Now that's a good answer.

152
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,375
I'm sending a car.
It'll get you to the harbor.

153
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,958
[DUTCH] Fuckin' great.

154
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,208
One of these days, I'd like a
job where I don't get shot at.

155
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,416
[CHANG] Quit your
bitching, Dutch.

156
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,166
We're doing all the
dirty work here, anyway.

157
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,416
Hurry!

158
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,833
[DUTCH] I'll leave the
rest to you, Mr. Chang!

159
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,125
[BENNY] This is a
major pain in the ass.

160
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,333
When you get there, don't
forget the password, okay?

161
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,000
The password is...

162
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,291
[IBRAHA] Right, I understand.

163
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,458
Our comrades have spotted the
delivery boys on the main road.

164
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,833
We should be able to take care
of them near Ban Kantang.

165
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,125
[TAKENAKA] I wonder about
that. This job should've been

166
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,833
over with after the bombing
of the Triad office.

167
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,375
That would've taken
care of things.

168
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,416
I'm in no mood to judge
the failures of our comrades.

169
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,166
[TAKENAKA] You mocked
these people as being

170
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,125
nothing more than
simple gangsters,

171
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,083
but Chang turned out to
be a much smarter gangster

172
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,208
than you thought.
Isn't that right?

173
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,416
"Strategically, we should
despise all our enemies,

174
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,541
but tactically, we should
take them all seriously."

175
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,583
Those are the words
of Mao Tse-tung.

176
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,125
You could learn
from that, Ibraha.

177
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,125
Moral discourse from
a man with no god?

178
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,875
It's worthless.

179
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,250
He was right, though.

180
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,958
Besides, I don't
believe in God either.

181
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,375
Never have and never will.

182
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,291
You're still my
comrade, Takenaka.

183
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,166
Well, more importantly,

184
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,916
perhaps we should move faster
with the plan in America.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,416
Don't be ridiculous.

186
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
The FBI has been watching us.

187
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:40,125
If we move now before the
feint, the plan will be wasted.

188
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,916
If I had to guess which of
the five routes they'll use,

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,625
I think it's safe to say that we
can rule out anything overland

190
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,916
and flying is far too visible.

191
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,458
That just leaves the sea route.
Do you have any proof?

192
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,833
Don't need proof
when you got intuition.

193
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,625
I'll ask one of our comrades in
the Philippines for assistance.

194
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,291
And as for the sea route,

195
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,666
I guess I'll hafta
take care of that.

196
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,125
This is the final step in
changing the world, Takenaka.

197
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,541
[TAKENAKA] Yeah.

198
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,791

[REVY] Did you hear
the password he gave us?

203
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,916
"May the force be with you"?
That is so lame.

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,500
I mean, the guy
can handle a gun

205
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,125
and he has great style,

206
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,833
but Chang couldn't even
make a fuckin' retard laugh.

207
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,083
Well, if there's one
thing I've learned,

208
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,958
it's that nobody's
perfect at everything.

209
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,875
[TAKENAKA] You found them?
A torpedo boat? Ooh.

210
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,791
Chang's sure got some
interesting friends, doesn't he?

211
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,791
And you've determined
their heading, too?

212
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,208
That's just perfect.

213
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,291
It's exactly what we predicted.

214
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,000
Looks like I won't hafta
change flights, after all.

215
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:51,583
Yeah, that's correct. Uh-huh,
I'm on the next flight there.

216
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,625
Stick to the plan. Just don't
do anything until I arrive.

217
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,416
We need to confirm a few
things before we move.

218
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,083
See ya soon.

219
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,958
E-Excuse me.

220
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,041
Hm?

221
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,875
Can you please
lend me your lighter?

222
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,791
I'm guessing you're from Japan.

223
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,958
Thanks.

224
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,041
Yes. How did you know that?

225
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,000
It's obvious. It's the way
you held your hand.

226
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,583
I see.

227
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:23,541
We're going to Cebu Island this
year for the family vacation.

228
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,416
You must be a brave man
to be traveling that far

229
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,958
from Manila with a family.

230
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,208
Right.

231
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,791
Hmm. Do I...?

232
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,958
Could it be possible that
we've met each other before?

233
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,791
I have this strange feeling that
I must know you from somewhere.

234
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,583
[TAKENAKA] Yes, I'm sure you do.

235
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,041
You know, Mr. Ken. For as
long as I can remember,

236
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,125
people've been saying
I look like him.

237
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,083
I guess I should
probably get going.

238
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,250
I've never been
great at small talk.

239
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,166
Nice meeting you.

240
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,541
[TAKENAKA] Well,
aren't you a sly one.

241
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,708
If you think you've seen
me before, my friend,

242
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,708
it was probably at your
local police station.

243
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,958
[REVY] I got a visual, Dutch.

244
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,666
It's a noisy little fly.

245
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,541
[DUTCH] Okay.

246
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,125
Rock, bring me the Remington

247
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,500
and the Hydra API ammo
while you're at it.

248
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,041
Sure.

249
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,083
We've taken out
the enemy's eyes,

250
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,125
but they may not
be the only one.

251
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,791
Rock. Benny and I
will be the bait

252
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,750
and head straight
towards Basilan.

253
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,500
I want you and Revy
to get off at Zamboanga

254
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,416
and use the Zodiac
to rendezvous with us.

255
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,958
I got it.

256
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,958
[TAKENAKA] Ibraha!
I can't hear you!

257
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,125
Hurry and get down here!

258
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,208
[IBRAHA] Takenaka!
Where are you?

259
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,666
You're in Basilan?

260
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,833
Wait a second! 

261
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,916
That's where our
diversion team is located!

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,375
[TAKENAKA] Don't panic. Yeah,
I'm at their camp right now.

263
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,000
It's always darkest at
the base of the lighthouse.

264
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,375
We're waiting here
for the local guerrillas

265
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,583
to strike the first blow, but

266
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,583
that also makes this the
ideal place for them to come.

267
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,000
It makes perfect sense
if you think about it.

268
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,541
The only place an
American imperialist

269
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,833
can come and go
freely around here

270
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,583
is the anti-guerrilla
special operations camp.

271
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,333
And it's right over the hill.

272
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:22,250
I can already see Chang's next
move. This is gonna be fun.

273
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,791
Takenaka, this isn't a game!
Our entire plan hinges on this!

274
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:30,083
All this is nothing more than
one big chess game, brother.

275
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,375
Hell, I challenge you to find
me anything in this world

276
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,750
that isn't. Either way,

277
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,208
we're the ones poised
to make the next move.

278
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,916
That one's as stubborn
as they come.

279
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,375
What's the point if you
can't have a little fun?

280
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,666
[REVY] So, once we
deliver the documents,

281
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,375
we'll meet you at the base.

282
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,791
Yeah. I'll come and get you when
I lose these guys tailing us.

283
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,916
What a pain in the ass.

284
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,250
Tell me about it.

285
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,375
What is it with these guys
who fight for a cause?

286
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,375
They just don't
know when to quit.

287
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,041
Oh, right. One more thing--

288
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,625
I have an additional message
for you from Mr. Chang.

289
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,458
Remember to tell Rock when
he gets back from the can.

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,791
[ROCK] Sorry to
keep you waiting.

291
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,625
[COMMANDO] The target
is traveling due north

292
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,250
towards Zamboanga.

293
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,833
[TAKENAKA] So, they've
passed Basilan, have they?

294
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,458
[COMMANDO] Basilan
is already behind us.

295
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,666
Looks like they'll be heading
north towards Negros.

296
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,375
We will continue our pursuit.

297
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,166
Alright. Good work.

298
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,666
It's not what it seems, boys. 

299
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,500
My gut tells me they're
already on their way here.

300
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,166
Yup. They're coming to Basilan.

301
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:41,791
[seagulls]

302
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,625
Here we are in the fuckin'
capital of dullsville.

303
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,791
What time is it?

304
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,833
[ROCK] It's almost six. It was
more trouble than we expected

305
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,791
finding a place to come ashore.

306
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,458
I'm pretty sure the
village is this way.

307
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,250
It sure is quiet here.

308
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,208
[REVY] Yeah, it's a ghost town.
No one in sight.

309
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,375
They've had martial law
here for two years,

310
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,166
but it hasn't made
any difference.

311
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,375
The army and the guerrillas

312
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,625
are shooting at each
other day and night.

313
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,125
It's a real fuckin' circus.

314
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,708
The people here must've gotten
sick of dating their cousins

315
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,583
and moved to real cities.

316
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,958
Keep you waiting? You're
from Lagoon Company, right?

317
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,250
I heard that there were
four of you, or am I wrong?

318
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,250
And why the hell should
I answer that question?

319
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,333
[TAKENAKA] There's
no reason you should.

320
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,833
[REVY] It's just me, him,
and a briefcase. That's it.

321
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,333
By the way, I don't see
your partner anywhere.

322
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,458
Where's your guard?

323
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,083
That jackass.

324
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,500
He's running around right
now looking for a restroom.

325
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,000
Turns out he doesn't
know the difference

326
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,000
between beer and Volvic.

327
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,166
[REVY] Okay. Enough
with the bullshit.

328
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,708
May the force...

329
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,958
Now how did that one go again?

330
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,125
Hey, old man, this isn't
the time for jokes.

331
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,125
Make this quick, or I'll
hafta shoot you in the face.

332
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,583
Now, now. No need
to get so hot.

333
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,708
I was just trying to break
the ice with a little humor,

334
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,208
that's all. So,
"May the force...

335
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,708
...be with you," right?

336
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,583
You gotta admit, his sense
of humor is a little off.

337
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,916
You think so too, huh?

338
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,708
[TAKENAKA] Yeah.
I mean, I suspected,

339
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:33,375
but I think he's outdone
himself with this one.

340
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,083
Exactly, you stupid asshole.

341
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,833
In fact, I have a message
from the boss for you.

342
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:43,166
"I am Tai san fu kwan."
Has a nice ring to it, huh?

343
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,166
It means the god of
death and punishment

344
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,750
shall hereby bring down
judgment upon you

345
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,458
and I've gotta say,
it's not lookin' good.

346
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,166
I have no fucking idea
where you got that password,

347
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,000
but Boss Chang isn't
the idiot you think he is.

348
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,250
He prepared a brand
new password,

349
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,166
made special for
shitheads like you.

350
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,958
You hopped into this
parade with your ass

351
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,125
hanging out of your pants
and now you're fucked.

352
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,291
What? Don't think it's funny?

353
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,916
This is the part where you're
supposed to laugh. So, go ahead.

354
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,208
Well, you got me. I guess
I got a little carried away.

355
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,666
What the hell was I thinking?

356
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,375
Plus, to get handled
like this by a little girl,

357
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,291
it's just plain embarrassing.

358
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,125
Rock, get back!

359
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,458
That fuckin' idiot!

360
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,875
Damn you, Rock! You really
screwed up this time!

361
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,583
[SHEN HUA] The gunfire
has starting.

362
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,125
[LEIGHARCH] Huh?
I don't wanna do this.

363
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,416
Leigharch!

364
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,791
[LEIGHARCH] I can feel
me brain melting.

365
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,333
[SHEN HUA] I tell you not
relax too much before working.

366
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,500
I make very clear for you.

367
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,416
[LEIGHARCH] I just had
the greatest idea...

368
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,791
We'll stay here until
they stop shooting.

369
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,791
So sorry. If they die,
we not getting paid.

370
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,041
[LEIGHARCH] I'll
take a rain check.

371
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,416
[SHEN HUA] No,
work very important.

372
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,333
Damn! They just keep coming!

373
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,458
Stupid shit-for-brains Rock!
Damn him!

374
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,041
Sister! You duck now please.

375
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,916
Are you the getaway driver?!

376
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,250
No, I'm a fuckin' lawyer.
What do you think?

377
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,916
That was uncalled for.

378
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,750
Do not pursue! The military
has just left their camp!

379
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,458
Fall back on the double!

380
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,083
Mr. Chang told me that there
were supposed to be four of you.

381
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,250
So, what the hell happened
to the other three?

382
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,333
Plans changed and
it became two of us.

383
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,916
Then he fucked up
and got captured.

384
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,041
Oh! He sound like real idiot!

385
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,708
Well, we're gonna go
straight to the fuckin' base.

386
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,208
I wanna finish this
job and go home!

387
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,750
So, where's their hideout?

388
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,791
Is north of village
for six mile.

389
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,333
You find there in jungle.

390
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,250
We're not going to
the military base.

391
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,791
We're taking care
of these guys first.

392
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,083
I suggest you wipe your
own damn ass, sweetheart.

393
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,375
Wait, I've got a better one!

394
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,291
You can go tell that to
the cavalry, Mary Read.

395
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,125
We take you to base only,
then getting the money.

396
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,208
We not interesting in work more.

397
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,250
My partner has the
fuckin' documents.

398
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,000
Do you follow?
Understand you yes?

399
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,958
You got that, Chinglish?

400
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:41,666
Not my new interior.
If you must, do it outside.

401
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,833
[SHEN HUA] My English
not very good

402
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,833
because I am pure Taiwanese.

403
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,541
Maybe you like for me
to skin your ass, bitch?

404
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,458
You don't get it, do ya?

405
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,000
The boss sure as hell
didn't hire you

406
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,458
just to transport
my tight little ass.

407
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,375
The documents. Without 'em,

408
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,333
it'll be us three
idiots in this car

409
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,208
explaining to the
boss why we decided

410
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,458
to come back to the
base empty-handed.

411
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,041
We're gonna look really
fuckin' brilliant then.

412
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,458
Hey, you're here.

413
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,000
We've formed an
alliance with them.

414
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,375
As of right now, this camp
is under our command.

415
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,083
I'm glad to hear that. 

416
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:22,333
Now, my friend, welcome
to our demilitarized zone.

417
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,958
We took the liberty of looking
through your briefcase.

418
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,625
It was completely empty.

419
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,250
I know nothing about it. 

420
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,416
Even if I did, you know I
couldn't answer your questions.

421
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,166
A straightforward
answer. Too bad.

422
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,791
At a time like this, I think
the least you could do

423
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,833
is crack a joke. But we've
got nothing but time.

424
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,708
I'll just ask you slowly.

425
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,416
Alright, son.

426
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,541
You do want this to
be painless, don't ya?

427
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,291
If you're gonna get
involved in this stuff,

428
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,000
you should really
be a bit more careful.

429
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,458
You're Japanese,
if I'm not mistaken.

430
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,625
So, how long you been
doing this kinda work?

431
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,125
C'mon, just ease up, kid.

432
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't wanna talk?

433
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,625
You know, young man,
it probably wouldn't hurt

434
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:12,916
for us Japanese to be friendly
to each other, now would it?

435
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,583
This is gonna be a problem.

436
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,291
[CIA AGENT 1]
Whatcha got for me?!

437
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,250
Has the launderer's
delivery boy arrived yet?!

438
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,208
[REVY] Well, well.
You're late again, Langley!
