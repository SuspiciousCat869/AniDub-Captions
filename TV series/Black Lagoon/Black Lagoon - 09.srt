1
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,458
It's so different.

2
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:45,125
This place is crazy
compared to my hometown.

3
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,666
[ROCK] I'm sorry. A kid your
age shouldn't be exposed

4
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,541
to a city like this.
Roanapur at night...

5
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,250
I'll be fine.

6
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,666
You have a lot of faith.

7
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,541
You believe in your
family, don't you?

8
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,791
Of course.
I believe in Roberta.

9
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,083
I know that she's
gonna come here

10
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,416
to take me home to my father.

11
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,333
Well, you're fortunate. 

12
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:12,375
To be able to know in your heart
that things will work out.

13
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,083
You're confident that
this maid of yours

14
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,875
is gonna risk her
life to save you.

15
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,958
And I really don't know if
that's gonna happen or not.

16
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,916
But one thing I'm
pretty sure of--

17
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,916
you must have one solid family
to have such faith in them.

18
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,041
It's just...

19
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,916
...sometimes I wonder how my
family actually feels about me.

20
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,958
[GARCIA] You mean they...

21
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,208
Uh, never mind.
It's not important.

22
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,166
Aw, Rocky misses Mommy.

23
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,375
You think so?

24
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,125
If I did, I'm thinking
I probably would've

25
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,916
said goodbye to this
place a long time ago.

26
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,541
Rock. That's
fucking pathetic.

27
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,291
Only some tit-sucking
momma's boy would come up with

28
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,916
that bullshit conversation
you're enjoying.

29
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,041
We're just talking
about ideals.

30
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,833
Y'know, something you hold on
to because you believe in it.

31
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,041
So, if I was ever kidnapped,
would you try to save me?

32
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,416
Would you come charging in with
Cutlass in hand to save me?

33
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,333
I wouldn't forgive you
for being stupid enough

34
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,416
to get kidnapped
in the first place!

35
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,958
If that ever happens,
forget you know us,

36
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,541
and then beg forgiveness
for being such a fuck-up

37
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,916
before you kill yourself.

38
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,583
See? These are the
people I hang out with.

39
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:23,208
But just the same,
they're worth hanging on to.

40
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,750
Hey, kid. This maid
you've been talking about...

41
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,500
Sure hope she's not just some
bullshit fantasy you made up.

42
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,666
I'd love to meet her. 

43
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,333
'Cause my Cutlass
feels too cold.

44
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,541
Who knows? Your maid
could help fix that.

45
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,583
I'm just kidding.

46
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,500
Well, I guess there's no
point in getting my hopes up.

47
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:53,083
Not when I'm dealing with some
maid-obsessed brat like you.

48
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,208
Ha, ha, Did you hear that?
"Be rude," she says.

49
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,958
What a crazy bitch!

50
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,333
[laughing]

51
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,208
Huh? Is this a fight?

52
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,375
[ROBERTA] I am very sorry, but I
will not be able to hold back.

53
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,916
Please excuse me.

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,958
And... I hope you
enjoy yourselves.

55
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,791
Shit, didn't this
place just reopen?

56
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,541
Dutch, I know what
I want for Christmas.

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,541
Wha... Why you!

58
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,416
You fucking bitch!

59
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,833
Alright, boys!

60
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,666
We'll finish this now!
I want her dead!

61
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,333
If you think it will help,

62
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,000
then please do what you must.

63
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,666
Fuck you!

64
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,291
Roberta!

65
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,958
[chuckling]

66
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,625
You'll pay, bitch!

67
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,708
I-It's not working, Bro!

68
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,750
Why won't she fall?
Is it made out of Kevlar?!

69
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,916
Goddamn it! You better
pay for all of this!

70
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,500
Somehow, we managed to walk

71
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,041
right into the middle
of a brutal shootout.

72
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,916
But maybe we can take
advantage of the fact

73
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,791
that they're busy
killing each other.

74
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,041
So, anyone else
feel like leaving?

75
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,791
Of course. But where?

76
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,500
We can go fishing
at Phuket Beach

77
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,666
until this cools
down a little bit.

78
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,500
I don't feel like catching
bullets in the back

79
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:14,416
while I drink.
I'm no Giuliano Gemma.

80
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,166
Hey, will you
hurry up and tell me

81
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,000
if I'm gonna get
to shoot or not?

82
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,083
Good call.
I vote not to shoot.

83
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,666
We'll leave the kid here.

84
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,125
I sure as hell don't wanna go
for a walk carrying a claymore.

85
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,458
[REVY] But he's worth
something, Dutch.

86
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,083
Shit, we were busy talking

87
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,291
and now the front door's
a goddamn war zone.

88
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,583
Anyway, this kid
isn't worth it anymore.

89
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,625
He can't come with us.
You got it?

90
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,000
But if we do that,
we'd just be--

91
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,583
[REVY] We've got no choice.

92
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,583
Oh, fuckin' fuck.

93
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,666
[DUTCH] Alright, then.

94
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,791
Uh, Garcia. Listen to me.

95
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,666
Don't move from this spot
until they stop shooting.

96
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,541
When this thing is all over,

97
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,291
find your maid and
go home to Venezuela.

98
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,291
I... I didn't think
she could just...

99
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,458
That Roberta could be so...

100
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,500
She's not the kind of
person who kills people.

101
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,208
But...

102
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,625
Why?

103
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,166
Garcia...

104
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,833
Rock! What's takin' you?!

105
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,833
Ten fucking grand
to replace my booze,

106
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,458
tack on another fifteen
for the furniture,

107
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,958
plus at least twenty grand
for the building itself.

108
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:41,083
Now to figure out who
I'm sending the invoice to.

109
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,625
Revy!

110
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,333
You bitch!

111
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,375
Revy! Is this your fault?!

112
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,333
How many times are your
friends gonna tear up my bar?!

113
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,625
They're not my friends!

114
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:57,083
Don't try to pin this
shit on me, you dumbass!

115
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,500
Fuck.

116
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,541
It's almost like they were
waiting for me to open my mouth.

117
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,708
[ABREGO] Lagoon Company?

118
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,000
What the fuck are you
guys doing here?!

119
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,166
What happened to that package

120
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,166
you were supposed
to deliver to us?!

121
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,666
[DUTCH] Okay, hold on!

122
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,416
Don't jump to
conclusions, Abrego!

123
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,625
Then why the fuck
is the package here?!

124
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,041
You better not have
ignored our contract!

125
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,166
I said don't jump
to conclusions!

126
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,083
We'll talk about payment
later! This ain't the time!

127
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,791
[ROBERTA] Young Master.

128
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,791
[GARCIA] Roberta.

129
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,916
I certainly didn't expect to
see you here, Master Garcia.

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,500
Your father has been
extremely worried about you.

131
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,291
Please, come.

132
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,541
It's only natural that
you feel afraid right now.

133
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,875
But if you let me,
I will explain myself.

134
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,416
I promise you will understand.

135
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,833
Who are these people?

136
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,250
Not good. Their eyes met.

137
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,958
No! Roberta, don't!

138
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,625
Stay back, housemaid.

139
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,833
I don't think any
of us wants to die.

140
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:18,875
Especially not your sweet little
Garcia. Wouldn't you agree?

141
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,833
[ROCK] Are you crazy?
You're gonna make it worse!

142
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,458
[REVY] Shut up!

143
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:25,041
As long as you're not stupid
enough to start shooting at us,

144
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,041
you'll get the kid
home in one piece.

145
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,041
With his brains
still in his head.

147
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,541
I need a moment to think.

148
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:37,375
We're not done with you yet,
you fucking bitch!

149
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,750
I have finished thinking now.

That's Spanish. A blessing
for the living.

153
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,291
A branch of flowers
for the dead.

The Lovelace family creed.

160
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,375
I cannot agree to your request,

161
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,166
though I do intend to have the
young master home in one piece.

162
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,291
However, I must work in
accordance with this creed.

163
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,083
In the name of Santa Maria...

164
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,166
Huh? Those words...

165
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,375
The hammer of righteousness
to all injustice!

166
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,916
That bitch!

167
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,208
[DUTCH] Now! Let's go!

168
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,291
Hey! Fuck off! Get away!

169
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,583
[explosion]

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,458
Revy!

171
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,291
Will you just fucking
die already?!

172
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,000
I know you,
Bloodhound of Florencia!

173
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,583
[DUTCH] That is one crazy bitch.

174
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,041
This makes the
Battle of Khe Sanh

175
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,833
look like a walk in the park!

176
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,416
Hey! Is Revy alright?!

177
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,833
[BENNY] Her injuries are minor,
but she does have a concussion.

178
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,208
[DUTCH] Revy! Wake up,
will ya? Hey!

179
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,625
[GARCIA] Please stop...

180
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,250
You have to stop this, Roberta! 

181
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,250
Just stop it!

182
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,541
Garcia...

183
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,541
[DUTCH] Rock!

184
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't just stand there!
We're leaving!

185
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,541
Run!

186
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,833
Take me with you.

187
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,375
Master Garcia.

188
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:26,291
I can't... I can't deal with
this. I don't know who she is.

189
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:49,750
Stay right there! Now...
it all makes sense to me.

190
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,500
Those words you
were saying earlier.

191
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,375
<i>Tu eres el perro des</i>
<i>cassa de Florencia</i> .

192
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,458
That's right, you're the
Bloodhound of Florencia.

193
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,916
I can't fucking believe
that you're still alive.

194
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,833
Not even Jesus Christ
could've guessed that one.

195
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,125
These four years since you left

196
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,083
the Colombian
Revolutionary Army,

197
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,916
everyone from goddamn drug
cartels to fucking Interpol

198
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,250
has been after you, woman.

199
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,916
The cartels put a four hundred
thousand dollar bounty

200
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,958
on your head, dead or alive.
[chuckling]

201
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:34,250
Looks like luck is
finally on my side!

202
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,625
If I bring your head
back on a platter,

203
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,708
I'll be made a lieutenant
in the cartel! [laughing]

204
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,541
I no longer have a reason
to keep you alive.

205
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,333
If you will excuse me now,
I must be on my way.

206
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,875
However, please accept
this parting gift.

207
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,875
To all of you gentlemen,

208
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,208
I bid farewell.

209
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,333
Ahh!

210
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,458
Damn! When it comes to killing,
she doesn't mess around.

211
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,208
Rock, you dumb fuck.

212
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,458
I told you to leave
that kid behind.

213
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,875
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.

214
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,208
I couldn't leave
him there to die.

215
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,708
Do you think... that
might've killed her?

216
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:29,958
[DUTCH] Get in the car!

217
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,000
[ROCK] I shouldn't be
able to hear anything,

218
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,958
but I can feel it.

219
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,958
Her footsteps getting
closer and closer.

220
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,916
And I could swear
that any minute now,

221
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,541
her black maid's outfit will
appear from that fiery exit.

222
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,958
[DUTCH] So, hurry up
and get in the car!

223
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,500
[tires screeching]

224
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:12,916
[car alarm]

225
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,500
[BENNY] Where should we go?

226
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,083
[DUTCH] Where can we go?

227
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,583
[BENNY] Aw, we're fucked.

228
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,958
Now I know. That maid is a
killer robot from the future!

229
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,750
The only difference is that we
don't have Schwarzenegger here.

230
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,500
That's really not funny.
I'm not laughing.

231
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,916
We've got her precious
little master with us.

232
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,625
Just head for the port.
We've gotta get to the Lagoon!

233
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,750
Bad news isn't hard to find. 

234
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,125
And from my experience,
bad news likes company.

235
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,333
Yes, this one is
quite infamous indeed.

236
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,208
Her code name is Bloodhound.

237
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,000
She got it because once
she's locked on to her prey,

238
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,875
she always makes the kill.

239
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,291
This is going to be a pain.
[cell phone ringing]

240
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,833
They're calling, Sergeant.

241
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,916
It's probably the
worst possible news.

242
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,000
She's coming.

243
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,500
[DUTCH] Rock! Wake Revy up!

244
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,791
This isn't the time for her
to catch up on her sleep!

245
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,666
[ROCK] Revy! Revy!

246
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,750
For fuck's sake!

247
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,208
Shit!

248
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,625
Corporal Menisov,
what's the situation?

249
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,500
Ma'am! Yellow Flag's destroyed

250
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,833
and the Bloodhound
and Lagoon are gone!

251
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,875
However, a Plymouth
was seen heading towards

252
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,250
the city on the main street
about ten minutes ago!

253
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,958
[BALALAIKA] Maintain
your position, Corporal.

254
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,958
Continue gathering information.

255
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:00,208
[MENISOV] Roger. What should
I tell the bar owner?

256
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,000
[BALALAIKA] Tell him not to
worry about the insurance.

257
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,541
I'm heading to the
city with a squad.

258
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,291
So, <i>Kapitän</i> ...

259
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,541
Going to war after so long?

260
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,833
Playing mafia dulls the
instincts and makes one soft.

261
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,291
We'll see.

262
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,666
But it never hurts to be
prepared, now does it?

263
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,625
We owe Lagoon. Or rather,
we owe Dutch for all he's done.

264
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,625
We simply cannot leave
things the way they are.

265
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,250
Let us go, comrades.

266
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,916
Cock your hammers!

267
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,041
Fuck! Will you just die?!

268
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:52,083
Let go of me, you bitch!

269
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,750
Damn it!

270
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,666
Now's our chance!
Hang on, Dutch!

271
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,208
Oh, shit!

272
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,791
[BENNY] We'll head to port
using these back alleys.

273
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,666
Once we're out at sea,
I don't care who she is,

274
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,083
there's no way
she'll be able to...

275
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,958
--Damn it.
--[DUTCH] Not good, Benny.

276
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,125
We're losing valuable time
if we go this way.

277
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,250
Yeah, but her radiator's
totally shot.

278
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,625
The car's toast.

279
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,666
I never said I was
worried about the car.

280
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,083
Maybe you should've
paid better attention

281
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,708
to Rock's joke
earlier on, Benny-boy.

282
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:46,791
You need to start
thinking of her

283
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,583
as an invincible killer robot!

284
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,833
[BENNY] Okay, we'll push it!

285
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,500
[DUTCH] Rock, do what
it takes to wake her up!

286
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,125
If this turns into
some big shootout,

287
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,250
we're gonna need
her gun, alright?

288
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,500
Revy! C'mon! Wake up!
Please wake up!

289
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,833
Take the next left!

290
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,333
Get on that main road
and then floor it.

291
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,875
Alright!

292
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,083
Are you alright,
Benny? Wake up!

293
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,208
[BENNY] Shit.
The engine won't start.

294
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,666
Benny, hurry!

295
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,083
Get down!

296
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,416
Master Garcia.

297
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,625
Roberta.

298
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,708
[BENNY] Those are no doubt
the three most

299
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,541
terrifying women in the world.

300
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,416
[DUTCH] This feels way
too much like Ground Zero.
