1
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,416
[FUJIWARA] I imagine it's
probably daybreak there soon.

2
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,500
The sea at daybreak.
Spare me the sentiment.

3
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,875
Only worthless students and
the permanently unemployed

4
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,583
find that sort of
thing appealing.

5
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,541
[FUJIWARA] Uh...

6
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:36,875
However, I agree these
winter skies are depressing.

7
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:41,000
At this point, we know that
Okajima is in the Sea of Heaven.

8
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,125
I'm going to need you to
book us a flight down there

9
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,541
--right away.
--Uh, sure.

10
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,583
A business trip, Sir?

11
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,666
Why don't we go down there,
as well? To the Sea of Heaven.

12
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:57,333
[birds chirping]

13
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:26,250
Damn it. Will someone tell me
why I have to suffer like this?!

14
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,916
Rock! What the hell
are you thinking?

15
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,208
Do you have any idea how much
one of those things costs?

16
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,916
This is it. They came
here to kill me.

17
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,958
Why should I have to
suffer for all this crap

18
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,208
my boss got us involved in?

19
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,458
I think you're missing
the point here.

20
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,833
What they really want is to
destroy that disc, right?

21
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:56,916
Your life is just--

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,125
My life is just an
accessory to that.

23
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,750
--Damn it. Damn it! Damn it!
--Uh...

24
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,125
You know there's
a torpedo in there.

25
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,750
[ROCK] Shut up. Shut up!

26
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,375
Hey, Benny, doesn't this
seem kind of weird to you?

27
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,541
[BENNY] Yeah,
something's not right.

28
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,916
They've stopped
firing completely.

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,125
They could have easily made
us into Swiss cheese by now.

30
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,541
No doubt. Something's
wrong here.

31
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,666
Dutch, what the hell's goin' on?

32
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,750
--Where'd those guys go?
--Benny-boy?

33
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,125
[BENNY] Yeah.

34
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,958
It looks like they've fallen
back about 5,000 meters

35
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,041
and they're still tailing
us from that distance.

36
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,625
What do these guys want, anyway?

37
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,125
Yeah, what is it?

38
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,791
[DUTCH] Damn it. The channel.

39
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,500
[BENNY] That's it! The channel.

40
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,000
The path ahead of us to
Belawan is filled with rocks

41
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,916
and mangroves and they
must have figured that out.

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,291
The further we go, the
tighter it's gonna get.

43
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,500
In the end, we won't be able
to take evasive maneuvers.

44
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,041
Let's turn this boat around
and get out of here.

45
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,583
Yeah.

46
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,791
[helicopter]

47
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:38,041
You better not say
I suck at this.

48
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,041
But I guess I can't
redeem myself now, right?

49
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,208
I wouldn't say that.

50
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,458
[DUTCH] I didn't have
any other options.

51
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,750
I had to evade to the right.

52
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,458
Yeah, I know that.

53
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,166
Did we just enter
the mouth of a river?

54
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,916
This is a river, right?

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,166
If we continue like this,

56
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,958
we're going to run out
of options to escape.

57
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,916
[REVY] Yeah, we already
figured that one out.

58
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,833
These guys have us
completely trapped.

59
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,250
The enemy's behind us again.
He's looking down on us

60
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,125
from about 5,000 meters
back right now.

61
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,458
[REVY] Check that out.
A sunken ship.

62
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,000
What a bad omen.

63
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,541
[EO CAPTAIN] This is fine.
We'll wait right here.

64
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,166
Go on. Off you go.

65
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,666
You want to show me your
little assets, fine with me.

66
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,333
But we both know that you'll be
coming back to me real soon.

67
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:38,041
And when you do, we're
going to go head-to-head.

68
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,333
Hurry back. I'll be waiting.

69
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,625
Then we can put an end to this.

70
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,875
Dutch, they just stopped
by that sunken ship

71
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,375
and they're hovering there.
They're not chasing us anymore.

72
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:53,041
Huh. It's not worth the
energy for them to follow us.

73
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,625
That's exactly what this means.

74
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,166
Damn.

75
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,500
It's a dead end.

76
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,541
Sure is.

77
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,083
Damn it!

78
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,041
[EO CAPTAIN] Hey, Mayer.

79
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,625
[MAYER] Sir?

80
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,125
[EO CAPTAIN] I'm gettin' real
hard right now just imagining

81
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,041
how they're going to react
to a situation like this.

82
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,041
[MAYER] I'd say they have
zero chance of beating us.

83
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,708
Given our superior weaponry,

84
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,375
I'm sure we'll honeycomb
that boat of theirs.

85
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,833
That's exactly why I can't wait
to see how they're gonna react.

86
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,958
If they make this boring for
us and don't even fight back,

87
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,208
then we'll be sure to
kill them nice and slow.

88
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,500
There's no road ahead of us.

89
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,875
The only option we have
now is to turn around.

90
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:03,291
And when we do that,
they'll be waiting for us.

91
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:07,083
My gut tells me he
put us here on purpose.

92
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,291
They want to finish
us off face-to-face.

93
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,125
So, who wants to ring the gong?

94
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,458
Humph.

95
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,500
It ain't something
that happens every day,

96
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,666
but once in a while,
you find them around.

97
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,875
Wannabe vets who like to
pretend they're cowboys.

98
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,208
Wait a second. You're saying
our only choice is to die?

99
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,333
[DUTCH] Alright, why don't
you calm down, Rock?

100
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,500
[ROCK] I know, let's call
the local police.

101
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,416
I mean, that's got
to be better than--

102
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,375
[grunting]

103
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,333
You're not helping. Now
like I said, just calm down.

104
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,250
Panicking isn't going
to solve anything.

105
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,208
If you want to survive, you
need to start using your head.

106
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,833
Dutch, how 'bout waiting
for them to run out of fuel?

107
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,291
Yeah, but these
bastards are from EO.

108
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,791
They'll come finish the
job before that happens.

109
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,833
[ROCK] Damn it.

110
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,750
Why did things have
to end up like this?

111
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,833
Not this one. I'd like
a business paper.

112
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,833
I have to check on my stocks.

113
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,291
Certainly. Right away,
Mr. Kageyama.

114
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,833
How bad's the ship?

115
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,916
[DUTCH] So far,
she's not looking too bad,

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,750
but I'm more worried
about those things.

117
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,125
If even a single bullet
hits a torpedo,

118
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,083
we'll all be
flying to the moon.

119
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,666
That's what you get for
keeping them, dumbass.

120
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,125
[DUTCH] Hmm.

121
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,250
I always figured I'd end up
using them for something.

122
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,458
I know it's a waste, but maybe
we should throw those overboard.

123
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,291
[DUTCH] Guess we have no choice.

124
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,916
[REVY] What a waste.

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,416
[ROCK] Wait. Dutch,
listen to me.

126
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,333
[DUTCH] You go back to sleep.

127
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,708
I've figured something out,
now that I've had time to think.

128
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:49,791
Just hear me out.

129
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,541
If you break my
concentration again,

130
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,625
then I'll let Revy
hit you next time.

131
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,750
And it ain't gonna be pretty.

132
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,541
I say we go face-to-face
with these guys.

133
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,875
[DUTCH] Are you retarded?

134
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,666
How can we have a shootout?

135
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,750
All we have on board
is an anti-tank rifle.

136
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,833
They've got missiles
on their side.

137
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,458
I noticed that chopper had
infrared homing missiles on it,

138
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,958
actually.

139
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,000
[DUTCH] We don't
even come close.

140
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,708
You think so? We do have
something we can use.

141
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,083
[DUTCH] Revy, what have you
been giving him to drink?

142
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,458
[REVY] Don't blame me for this.

143
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,625
If you think about it,

144
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,208
this is just a big
game of chicken, right?

145
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:31,333
This boat's armaments and speed,
that sunken ship we passed...

146
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm pretty sure we have
everything we need.

147
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:39,166
What the hell do you
have in mind, anyway?

148
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,125
[ROCK] Exactly what you guys
were just talking about.

149
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:49,250
Why don't we fly them
to the moon instead?

150
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,666
Impossible. There's no way
we can pull that off.

151
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,916
If you think about it,

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,666
in theory, this ship is
designed to hydroplane.

153
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,416
At full speed, we're only
in the water this much.

154
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,125
Well, Dutch, it's not like
we've got any better options.

155
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,125
I say we do it.

156
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,291
You do realize that
the plan's not gonna work

157
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,250
unless they're
right in front of us.

158
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,500
Do you really think
that's gonna happen, Rock?

159
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:22,333
It seems like they're having
a lot of fun chasing us around,

160
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,791
even though it's obvious
they have the advantage.

161
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:26,958
What reason would they have

162
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,125
to start the whole
fight over again?

163
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,833
You said it earlier, yourself--
this is the type of guy

164
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,833
who thinks of himself
as a real cowboy.

165
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,083
If we lure him into
a game of chicken,

166
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,208
he won't be able to resist.

167
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,083
I don't have any guarantees.

168
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,125
At this point, it's your
decision to make as Captain.

169
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,208
[DUTCH] We sure managed
to pick ourselves up

170
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,083
one crazy son of a bitch.

171
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,708
You've got to be
completely insane...

172
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,083
...but the idea's exciting.

173
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,083
And what's the point of life
if you can't get excited?

174
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,958
Right. Let's do this thing!

175
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,750
[MAYER] The radar's picked up
something, Captain.

176
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,416
Our target's on the move.

177
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,916
I accept your challenge.

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,791
[DUTCH] Rock, you know what
you've got to do, right?

179
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,000
If they fire a missile,

180
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,250
I shoot the signal flare
away from the boat.

181
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,541
You got it.

182
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,708
I see the jackass. Revy!
It's a game of chicken.

183
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,458
Send 'em an invitation.

184
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,916
[MAYER] They're firing at us!

185
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,166
[EO CAPTAIN]
Of course they are.

186
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,000
About time, too, so let's play.

187
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,708
Rock, they're coming.
Shoot that flare!

188
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,208
[beeping]

189
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,375
[ROCK] It worked.

190
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,791
[BENNY] We're on
the alpine course now.

191
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,750
Both of you get
back in the cabin.

192
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,916
[EO CAPTAIN] They want to use
that old wreck as a shield?

193
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,291
It won't do much good.
Hey, Mayer!

194
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,750
--Yes, Sir.
--Once they're clear,

195
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,708
we'll nail 'em
with a single shot.

196
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,291
We're gonna put an end to
this duel once and for all.

197
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,708
You're about to
get fucked, baby.

198
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,083
[BENNY] Three hundred
feet to go.

199
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,625
One fifty.

200
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,500
One hundred!

201
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,375
Fire number one!
Fire number two!

202
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,458
[ROCK] Yeah! You got fucked!

203
00:13:55,291 --> 00:14:00,333
[birds chirping]

204
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,666
Well, feels like my
head's still attached.

205
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,875
My sunglasses aren't broken.

206
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,333
Amen, hallelujah,
and peanut butter.

207
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,166
Fucking hell.
We made it this time,

208
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,208
but I will never do this again.

209
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,583
[DUTCH] Benny, you okay?

210
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,875
[BENNY] Yeah,
I'm alive... somehow,

211
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,416
but all my instruments
are fucked.

212
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,708
We're gonna have to
fix all this up or--

213
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,208
--Wait a minute. Hold up.
--[BENNY] Oh, man...

214
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,625
What about Rock?

215
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,916
He's passed out over there.

216
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,875
He was yelling like a maniac
right before we hit 'em.

217
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,625
Just like William Holden
in <i>The Wild Bunch.</i>

218
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,625
[DUTCH] Just look at him.

219
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,458
He looks so comfortable
sprawled out like that.

220
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,750
Yeah, no kidding.

221
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:56,375
[ROCK] And just like that,
the moment passed.

222
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,208
All the excitement I'd
felt from the adrenaline

223
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,208
just disappeared somewhere.

224
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:08,125
And my boiling blood
had returned to normal.

225
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,875
Where am I? And what
am I doing here?

226
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,375
[BALALAIKA] Excellent work.

227
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,750
You know, I really admire
smart work, Dutch.

228
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,291
But I've got to tell you,

229
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,250
you guys are all
looking a little rough.

230
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,958
Well, it's not like we're
going to some dinner party.

231
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,833
It's just our style.

232
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,083
Now, Mr. Kageyama,

233
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,958
we from Hotel Moscow
have a code of honor.

234
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,500
Oh? I thought you
were a representative

235
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,000
of the Bougainvillea
Trade Company.

236
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,250
[BALALAIKA] As you can see,

237
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,666
we followed through on
our end of the bargain.

238
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:52,291
So, there shouldn't
be any hard feelings.

239
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,833
Of course not.

240
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,916
The world is full of things
that cannot be helped.

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,125
[BALALAIKA] Now it's your turn

242
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,333
to follow through on
your end of the bargain.

243
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,250
We'll go over the
details at the hotel.

244
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,000
[KAGEYAMA] Very well then.

245
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,208
Thanks for your good
work on this, Okajima.

246
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,875
Now come along. Let's go.

247
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:17,125
Well, Okajima, what are you
waiting for? Come on.

248
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,416
[ROCK] Hey, Boss.
Don't you remember?

249
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,083
Well, you should.

250
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,625
I'm already dead.
You said it, remember?

251
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,166
And by the way,
my name is Rock now.

252
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:40,541
That so? Very well.
Do as you wish.

253
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,250
Let's get going, Fujiwara.

254
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,791
[FUJIWARA] Y-Yes, Sir.

255
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,541
Well, Rock,

256
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,500
I owe you an apology for making
you talk to those idiots.

257
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:02,125
And yet, it would have been a
waste for a tough guy like you

258
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,500
to remain as a Japonski.

259
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:08,666
I want you to come to us if
there's anything you ever need.

260
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,208
Goodbye.

261
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,333
Okajima...

262
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,833
Okajima's no longer
an employee of ours.

263
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,625
The look in his eyes
is all the proof I need.

264
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,916
Yes, but what could have
changed in such a short time?

265
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,166
None of it matters anymore.

266
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:34,041
[DUTCH] So, tell me, Rock--
what will you do now?

267
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:38,625
Guess I'm not a hostage anymore
and I've got nowhere to go.

268
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,750
Hey, there's this
crew I've heard of

269
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,541
that might be looking for
a good sailor. You think you

270
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,083
could be interested
in something like that?

271
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,666
They're a delivery company.

272
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,916
Who sometimes break the rules
to put food on the table.

273
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,458
Isn't that right?

274
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:10,166
[horn sounding]

275
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,833
What's wrong?

276
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,166
There appears to
be a small vessel

277
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,750
blocking our way, Captain.

278
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,833
We've been sounding the horn
for a while, but it won't budge.

279
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,333
What is that thing?

280
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,166
Well, it was inevitable

281
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,708
that some information
would be leaked,

282
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,583
and I think we were all
prepared for that to happen.

283
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,041
It was a job well done,
Kageyama.

284
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,791
Thank you very much,
Sir. I am honored.

[ROCK] Uhh... Testing,
testing. Um...

287
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,291
Good morning to everybody who's
presently aboard the St. Joan.

288
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,958
[REVY] Why won't you
wear that Hawaiian shirt

289
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,000
I got for you at the
market? It's a good fit.

290
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,583
Because we happen to be at work.

291
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,291
That's right, I consider
this to be my job now.

292
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,208
Um...To everybody
aboard the St. Joan--

293
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,125
I apologize for
the sudden request,

294
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,291
but I'm going to
have to ask you

295
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,583
to please stop your
ship right away.

296
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,416
[horn sounding]

297
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,333
My own personal opinion
is that at this point--

298
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,208
[metal clanking]

299
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,833
Complying with this request
as quickly as possible

300
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:46,000
would definitely be, uh,
the best course of action.

301
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,541
[BENNY] Dutch,
the St. Joan has opened up

302
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:51,291
communications with us.
We finally made contact.

303
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,833
And what did they say?

304
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,500
"Move aside immediately
or we'll have no choice

305
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,458
but to force our way through."

306
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,791
Well, I guess it can't
be helped. Okay, Benny.

307
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,125
--Revy.
--Good.

308
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,458
I was sick of waiting.

[DUTCH] Looks like playtime
is officially over.

310
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,875
Okay.

00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,125
Everyone, please take cover.

312
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,333
It's times like this that
bring out the savage in me.

313
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,375
Jesus!

314
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,166
My god! They must have a rocket
launcher on board, Captain.

315
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,250
Hand that over!

316
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,333
[ROCK] Wait.

317
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,583
Listen very carefully,
you dipshits--

318
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,333
my rockets are much faster

319
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,583
than any of your
lame distress signals.

320
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,375
Unless you want to end up
as a corpse-filled shipwreck,

321
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,416
then I suggest you
stop moving. You got it?!

322
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,875
[classical music]

323
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,083
Okay, Benny-boy, give notice
to Lyun E. Pan's guys

324
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,833
that we've taken the St. Joan.

325
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,541
And you tell them that they'd
better come pick her up

326
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,958
before anyone starts
a ruckus out here.

327
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,750
Roger that.

328
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,291
[KAGEYAMA] I'm home.

329
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,291
Hey, John. There's a good boy.

330
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,250
[toilet flushing]

331
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,500
[KAGEYAMA]
Takanori, how are things?

332
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,750
Huh?

333
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,625
[KAGEYAMA] Your studies
for the entrance exams?

334
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,166
Not so good.

335
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,458
Oh, what a surprise.
You're home today.

336
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,500
Mm-hmm.

337
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,125
We need to talk
about your daughter.

338
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,625
She's been getting home
later and later these days.

339
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,041
She's still only an
18-year-old girl, you know.

340
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,958
Could you say something to her?

341
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,541
[KAGEYAMA] I thought that
was your responsibility.

342
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,041
Hmm... the stocks.

343
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:36,250
Hey, Daddy, what color was the
sea in that really warm country

344
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,541
where you just went to?
That one for your business trip?

345
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,458
[KAGEYAMA] Color of the sea?
I don't really know.

346
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,291
Daddy was busy working
the whole time down there.

347
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,458
[ROCK] There's probably no one
who'd believe me, but...

348
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,541
...I've become a pirate
of the South Seas.

349
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,208
That huge ship
was today's catch.

350
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,708
[REVY] Okay, we need to get
back to port before lunch.

351
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:05,291
The china bowl at Kao Han...

352
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,625
...always sells out quickly.

353
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,333
[ROCK] We're actually
being targeted by pirates?

354
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,625
Dutch! What's the
background on our client?
