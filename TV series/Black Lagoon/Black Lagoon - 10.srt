Get down! Both of you!

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,916
[ROCK] Get outta the way!

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,416
[GARCIA] No! Please
don't shoot Roberta!

5
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
If this could kill her,

6
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,708
we wouldn't be in
this fuckin' mess.

Oh, shit!

00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,375
Damn it!

00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,333
Dutch! We're off the main road!

12
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,416
We're headed right
for the ocean.

13
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,375
There's nowhere to go.
It's a dead end.

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,250
Shit, we're screwed!

15
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,708
No!

It pays to be a

All survivors, speak up.

19
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,583
Somehow, we're both alive.

20
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,125
[DUTCH] What about Revy?

21
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,458
[ROCK] She never even woke up.
Still knocked out.

22
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,416
You okay, Benny?

23
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,625
[BENNY] You've
gotta be kidding!

24
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,416
What the hell's
this woman made of?

25
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,000
[REVY] Damn it.

26
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,541
Revy.

27
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,625
Fucking hell. Hey, what
happened to that stupid bitch?

28
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,958
She dead yet? Well?

29
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,916
You're in luck.
She's alive and well.

30
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,125
[REVY] Well, that's the
best news I've heard all day.

31
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,875
I've got an errand to run.

32
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,458
Wait! Revy!

33
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,208
[REVY] Listen closely, Rock.

34
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,708
I'm about to light up
like a goddamn firecracker

35
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,416
and there's nothing
anyone can do about it.

36
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,041
When that happens,
it's pretty much over.

37
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,416
I'm not even gonna warn you

38
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,416
before I give you
a second asshole.

39
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,916
When she decided to
use that shell on me,

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,250
she made a big fuckin' mistake.

41
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,166
I'm gonna make that bitch
wish she was still home,

cleaning shitty toilets.

43
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,708
It's time to go teach
this fucking cunt

44
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,875
the meaning of pain.

You fuckin' should be.

48
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,708
[ROBERTA] I have no
need for filthy language

00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,208
and idle threats.
You will not find me

so easily intimidated.

51
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,375
Knowing you could not
defeat me with skill alone,

52
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,083
you chose to hide behind
the young master instead.

53
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,083
You are a coward.

[DUTCH] Rock, watch out
for stray bullets.

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,250
I can't see them.

Oww... Damn it.

Somehow, she managed to put
a bullet in the great Revy.

Who the fuck is this woman?

I'm no shrink, but you must've
had one fucked up childhood.

I get it now.

I thought I knew that smell
lingering around you.

69
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,875
I'd recognize that
scent anywhere.

70
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,583
It's the smell of gutter mud
still clinging to your feet.

It's perfect, really.

to get outta this car.

against the Manisarela
Cartel for some time,

111
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,666
so imagine my surprise.

112
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,458
Taking care of this one was
actually supposed to be my job,

113
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,791
but you came along and
saved me the trouble.

114
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,333
As we speak, their
headquarters in Venezuela

115
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,041
should be in ruins.

116

Therefore, all of our problems
have now been solved.

117

Garcia's kidnapping has also
been dealt with and he may go.

So, you have no
reason to fight, do you?

Those are no doubt the

This feels way too
much like Ground Zero.

122
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,416
It doesn't matter.

123
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,708
Indeed.

Don't misunderstand me, ladies.

That's not just some
friendly suggestion.

and where did they come from?

just ordinary Russian mafia.

Are they military?

You don't have
to worry, Roberta!

I don't wanna see you
with a gun anymore.

137
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,083
I don't want you to kill.

138
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,750
I agree, kid. You're right.

139
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,375
But...

...what does the Bloodhound
think about that?

141
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,041
Bloodhound?

142
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,333
Oh... so no one ever
bothered to tell you?

143
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,500
--Well...
--You shut up!

144
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:44,000
[BALALAIKA] I suggest
you keep quiet, bitch.

145
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,541
Let me tell you...

146
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,208
I'm not sure what you think,
but this isn't just some servant

147
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,875
who looks good walking the dog.

148
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,625
She's the Bloodhound
of Florencia.

149
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,708
Rosarita Cisneros.

150
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,708
Trained as an assassin in Cuba,

151
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:02,083
she's a former
FARC guerilla.

152
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,791
She's wanted internationally

153
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,666
for multiple
kidnappings and murders.

154
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,000
And she's a suspect in the
bombing of the US embassy

155
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,708
in Tegucigalpa.

156
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,166
She's a real hardcore terrorist.

157
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,416
[GARCIA] Roberta...

158
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,458
Is it true?

159
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,000
[ROBERTA] I swear
that I never intended

160
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:29,750
to deceive you, Master Garcia.
However, there are things...

161
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,041
There are some things
in this world

162
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,166
that it's better not to know.

163
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,541
They bring only sadness.

164
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,541
Everything she said
is the truth.

165
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,083
I... I believed in it
with all my heart.

166
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,666
I believed in the
dawn of a revolution

167
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,750
that would bring justice
to this world at last.

168
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,708
For that reason and
that reason alone...

169
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,416
...I became a soldier.

170
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,875
In the blind pursuit
of this ideal,

171
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,041
I killed in every
place imaginable.

172
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:16,166
Politicians, businessmen,
counter-revolutionaries,

173
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,583
election officials.

174
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,458
I even killed women
and children.

175
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,083
So many of my nights
stained with blood...

176
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,750
Countless mornings spent
feeling cold and empty,

177
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,125
and what I realized in the end

178
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,875
was that I was
no revolutionary.

179
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,250
I was nothing more
than a guard dog

180
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:45,791
working for the mafia, helping
to protect their coca fields.

181
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,625
Isn't it ironic?

182
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,125
The revolutionaries

183
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,291
working side by side
with the cartels.

184
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:58,666
They said revolution would not
be possible with ideals alone.

185
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,208
And in saying that,

186
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,458
they'd already sold their
souls and I knew it was over.

187
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,333
My only option was
to leave the military.

188
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,541
And there was just one
man I could think of

189
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,541
who would agree
to take me in.

190
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,416
A close friend of
my deceased father.

191
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,625
The man who saved me was
none other than your father,

192
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,750
Master Diego Lovelace.

193
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,916
Master Garcia,

194
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,458
allowing your
kidnapping to happen

195
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,958
was negligence on
my part. I failed you.

196
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,166
And then I knew of no other
way to save you except to

197
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,708
awaken a side of myself that
had long been hidden away.

198
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,083
A side of me that I
had abandoned long ago.

199
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,125
Bloodhound. Guard dog.

200
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,500
I've lived my
entire life as a dog.

201
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,791
And this is the only
way that I know

202
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,125
how to prove my
devotion to you.

203
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,000
I wanted to repay
you with my life.

204
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,875
No! How could you call
yourself a dog, Roberta?!

205
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,708
Don't believe in those lies!

206
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,750
We're a family,
aren't we, Roberta?!

207
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,791
So, how could you
ever say you're a dog?!

208
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,875
You're nothing like that!

209
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,583
It's just not true!

210
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,583
And I don't know
any Bloodhound!

211
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,625
She died a long time ago!

212
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,875
There's no more
Rosarita, either!

213
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,125
I bet she moved
somewhere far away

214
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,333
to try and hide from her sins!

215
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,666
Don't you see?!

216
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,500
That woman has got nothing
to do with you anymore!

217
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,125
The only one I see
here is my Roberta!

218
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,500
Young Master.

219
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,166
[GARCIA] So...

220
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,500
Let's go.

221
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:33,041
I... I just wanna
go back home now.

222
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,583
It's okay, Young Master.
Let me dry your eyes.

223
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,041
Boys should not cry so easily.

224
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,750
I'm glad that's settled.

225
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,375
We could've had a
big mess on our hands.

226
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,541
[REVY] Give me a fuckin' break.

227
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,458
I'm sure everybody
is just delighted

228
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,875
with this teary-eyed
happy ending.

229
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,208
Well, fuck that!

230
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,958
I'm not gonna pretend
to be happy about it.

231
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,291
What about this fuckin'
tunnel in my shoulder? Huh?

232
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,208
Couldn't you just let that go?

233
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,791
Come on now, Sis. We both
know that's not cool.

234
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,375
Even criminals have a code of
honor. We have to settle this.

235
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,541
You know that perfectly
well, Sis, so come on.

236
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,541
Hmm... Yes, you
do have a point.

237
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,708
Well, seems obvious to me.

238
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,250
A little bare-knuckle boxing
until they're satisfied.

239
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,375
Anyway, I doubt
that anyone will die.

240
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,958
Fine by me!

241
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,083
Young Master?

242
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,500
Don't you lose to
that woman, okay?

243
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,625
You're stronger
than her, Roberta!

244
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,666
Well, then I guess it's decided.

245
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,916
Go for as long as you want.

246
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,375
Fine.

247
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,625
I'm gonna make
you uglier, bitch.

248
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,208
But before we start,

249
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,500
your shoelace is untied.

250
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,791
She got one in!

251
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,708
Must be nice to be so young.

252
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,375
[REVY] Damn it!

253
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,791
Come on, Roberta!

254
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,458
Don't lose to her!

255
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,916
Who are you betting on?

256
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,125
I'm going with two on Revy.

257
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,500
Alright, then I'll hafta
go with three on Roberta.

258
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,333
You, Rock?

259
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,875
W-Wait a minute!
We should stop this, right?!

260
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,041
We can't let this go on!

261
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,583
Hm? Why not?!

262
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,958
[ROCK] Well...well,
it's completely barbaric!

263
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,500
Am I the only one
who sees this?

264
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:31,250
It's totally insane to have
two girls going at it like that!

265
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,541
Then why don't you
go and stop them?

266
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,541
You said you don't like this.

267
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,916
I did, but--

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,958
[BALALAIKA] Then get out
there and put a stop to it.

269
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:43,125
Really, don't worry
about it, we don't mind.

270
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,833
[ROCK] Umm...
Excuse me. Ladies?

271
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,125
Haven't you had enough
of this fighting?

272
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,541
Why not try this--sit down
and talk things through.

273
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,750
I'm sure you have more
in common than you thought.

274
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,333
--Stay the fuck out of this!
--Stay the fuck out of this!

275
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,791
Or I could do that. Great idea.

276
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,750
[DUTCH] What did you expect?

277
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:15,208
[BALALAIKA] They just won't
give up. This is getting boring.

278
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,708
Why won't you die?

279
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:25,125
Die already, fuckin' four-eyes!

280
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,375
Same to you. W-Why the hell
won't you just go down?

281
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,916
Damn you! Take this, bitch!

282
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,833
There! It's a draw.

283
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,500
[GARCIA] Roberta!

284
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,291
Young Master...

285
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,208
I'm so sorry.
I should've beaten her.

286
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,041
[GARCIA] No, don't talk.

287
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,791
In the end, you were
the last one standing.

288
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,083
So... it's alright.

289
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:01,958
[chuckling]

290
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,041
[DUTCH] That's a terrible sight.

291
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,708
[ROCK] She's out cold.

292
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,875
Can you stand? Hang on to me.

293
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,250
[ROBERTA] I'm sorry.

294
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,291
Don't you say that, Roberta.

295
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,791
You want a hand
with her, Garcia?

296
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,791
[GARCIA] Leave us alone.

297
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,208
I don't need anyone's
help looking after her.

298
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,666
Roberta is a maid at my house. 

299
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,250
So, it's my job to get her home.

300
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,916
Spoken like the
future patriarch.

301
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,833
--Comrade Sergeant.
--Ma'am.

302
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,666
Treat her wounds, then
take them to the airport.

303
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,458
If any remaining cartel
members attempt an attack,

304
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,875
dispose of them immediately.

305
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,416
Understood.

306
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:42,125
I have a favor
to ask, please....

307
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,625
What?

308
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,416
It's my glasses... Could you
go and pick them up for me?

309
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,541
Why?

310
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,708
I mean, they're just
fake, aren't they?

311
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,083
Yes.

312
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,958
However, I need them.

313
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,541
Those glasses help
me believe I'm her.

314
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,250
I just want to be your Roberta.

315
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,625
[ROCK] Hey! It's morning,
Revy! Wake up!

316
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,041
That barely registered.

317
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:25,500
I do not wanna be around when
she wakes up. Won't be pretty.

318
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,833
But...

319
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,500
...who were those
guys back there?

320
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:33,416
You know, all those guys
from the Russian mafia.

321
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,875
They were, like, military.

322
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,208
Actually, they're
ex-miliatry. You're close.

323
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,500
They were either paratroopers
or in the Special Forces.

324
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,458
Her immediate subordinates
have enough training

325
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,958
to fight and win World War III
if they wanted to.

326
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,625
They're pretty much
all Afghan vets

327
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,833
with an insane amount
of experience and skill.

328
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,666
She was the brains
of the operation

329
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,916
and these men became
unstoppable killing machines.

330
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,541
Eventually, these same guys
returned from that hell

331
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,041
of hot sand and carnage.

332
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,958
[ROCK] Everyone's
feet are covered

333
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,125
with mud from the gutter.

334
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,083
[CHANG] Five teams will leave
Roanapur at the same time

335
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,541
and each will have a completely
different destination.

336
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,500
There are five cases.
