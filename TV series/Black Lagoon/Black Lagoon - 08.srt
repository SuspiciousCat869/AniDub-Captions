[whistle blowing]

2
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,250
[ROCK] Not so long ago,
I was a businessman in Tokyo.

3
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,916
Now I work for a shipping
company in the South China Sea.

4
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,166
That's it. All the crates
are accounted for.

5
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,833
Now could I please get
you to sign this for me?

6
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,500
Um, excuse me, could
somebody please sign this?

7
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,333
There's nothing
particularly special

8
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,250
about this little shipping
company. Though, at times,

9
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,500
we do brush up against
the law to get the job done.

10
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,041
Huh?

11
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,083
Everything under control, Rock?

12
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,875
[ROCK] We're good. And I even
got them to sign for it.

13
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,375
[DUTCH] We're also transporting
additional cargo for them.

14
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,708
Did you get it?

15
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,250
[ROCK] About that. I... um... 

16
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,750
Well, yeah, I did receive
that shipment from them.

17
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,958
[DUTCH] Is there a problem?

18
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,166
If not, then have them
use a crane again

19
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,250
to get you and
the goods down here.

20
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,916
--[ROCK] Got it.
--[REVY] So, the troublemaker's

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,333
making use of himself, huh?

22
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,666
On second thought, I don't think
anything's really changed,

23
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,708
has it? The only thing
that's useful about him

24
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,916
is his white-collar look. It
makes him perfect for this job.

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,666
So far, anyway.

26
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,125
Wait, let me guess... Is he
worried about that little cargo

27
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,208
we're taking back with us?

28
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,208
[DUTCH] Looks that way. 

29
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,750
Pathetic.

30
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:54,125
After all, it's just a cartel's
little errand we're running,

31
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,250
so what's the big deal?

32
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,541
[ROCK] I counted those
crates we delivered

33
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,500
like you wanted me to.

34
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:07,500
And I brought that shipment
we're taking back with us, too.

35
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:11,625
But are you sure... he's it?

36
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,041
[DUTCH] Once we
arrive in Hat Yai,

37
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,458
we're handing him
over to some buyer

38
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,708
designated by the
Colombian Mafia.

39
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,666
Revy, put him in
a cabin for now.

40
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,791
Fine.

41
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,625
Alright, let's go, kid.

42
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,333
Hey! You don't
wanna piss me off.

43
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,916
Over here. Come on.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,291
Move your little ass!

45
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,916
[horn sounding]

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,541
He actually looked like he
was gonna puke or something.

47
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,083
You can tell he's
still an amateur.

48
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,916
[seagulls]

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,458
[DUTCH] Rock.

50
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,916
We're nothing more
than delivery boys.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,541
All we do is take shipments to
their designated destinations.

52
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,083
That's where our
responsibilities end.

53
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,500
--Understand?
--I got it.

54
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,208
You don't have to
worry about me.

55
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,458
I won't get too
attached to the boy.

56
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,583
That's good to hear.

57
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,583
[REVY] Now you've asked
for it, you little shit!

58
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,750
[DUTCH]
Rock.

59
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:21,583
[REVY] How about I
show you what you had

60
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,625
for breakfast this morning?!

61
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,958
Sorry, but would you
mind taking over

62
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,833
babysitting duties for now?

63
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,458
As you can see, not a lot
of maternal instinct there.

64
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,500
We can't exactly deliver
the shipment with holes in it.

65
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,375
[REVY] Take advantage
of my kindness, will ya?!

66
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,375
--Revy!
--That's right!

67
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,958
What the fuck are
you looking at?!

68
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,458
That's enough!

69
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,625
[REVY] He doesn't deserve
something as nice as a cabin.

70
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,375
We should be chaining him up
and throwing him in the hold.

71
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,958
Little shit.

72
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,208
We're in the middle of the sea
right now. He can't escape.

73
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,916
What the hell do we
need chains for?

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,458
Shut up!

75
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,708
Uh, listen. It's just
for a bit longer,

76
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,708
but we are gonna be
traveling together.

77
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,208
Maybe it's too much to ask,

78
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,583
but could you stop
throwing food at me?

79
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,166
You can't fool me.

80
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,625
Santa Maria sees right through
your friendly talk. You liar.

81
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,750
Well, I can see how my words
wouldn't mean much to you,

82
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,166
since I'm helping
with this kidnapping.

83
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,000
You're not...anything like
that mean tattooed lady

84
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,708
or that big black guy, are you?

85
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,500
You actually seem
like a normal person.

86
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,250
I guess. But the truth is I'm
really just a crook in training.

87
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,416
The men who put me on the boat
didn't tell me where I'm going

88
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,625
or what's gonna happen to me.

89
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,583
They're planning to sell me
off somewhere, aren't they?

90
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,458
You worried?

91
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,750
I'll be fine. My father would
never let anything happen to me.

92
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,625
Father? But aren't you
supposed to be an orphan?

93
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,458
Who told you that?
It was probably the cartel.

94
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,541
They're a bunch of big liars.

95
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,208
My father's the head of one
of the great thirteen families

96
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,541
of South America.

97
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,833
The eleventh patriarch
of the Lovelace household.

98
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,625
He is Diego José
San Fernando Lovelace.

99
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,750
And I'm Garcia, his only
son. When I'm old enough,

100
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,125
I'll become the next
head of the Lovelace family.

101
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,916
[ROCK] If you're looking for
pity, you won't find it here.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,375
If you're gonna tell lies,

103
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,500
you could at least come up
with a better one than that.

104
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,791
I don't want pity!
Don't be stupid.

105
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,083
What good would it do
me to lie to you now?

106
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,333
You know, you're a
pretty unlikable kid.

107
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,375
So, where'd you hear
the name Lovelace, anyway?

108
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,333
For your information,
it's the least noble house

109
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,125
of the thirteen families.

110
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,000
Although, that does make it
a little more believable.

111
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,833
So what if things haven't been
going too well for us lately?

112
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,500
We're still managing to get by,
just like we always do.

113
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,291
My father is a man
of good character.

114
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,750
He never got involved
in anything illegal.

115
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,291
[birds chirping]

116
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,666
Business wasn't going well,
but the plantations were stable.

117
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,125
Until the mafia came, that is.

118
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,208
[ROCK] And you're
trying to tell me

119
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,833
that you were kidnapped
by that mafia?

120
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:02,291
You have a gift for making
up stories, kid. Not bad.

121
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,291
They came one day and
tried to force my father

122
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,791
to sell our land.

123
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,083
A geological survey showed
that we had lanthanides there.

124
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,583
When my father refused to sell,

125
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,375
we saw what they
were really like.

126
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,666
They came to our farms
and harassed us.

127
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,916
But my father refused
to be intimidated by them.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,041
And that's how I ended up here.

129
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,416
Lanthanides?

130
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,416
It's also called rare earth.

131
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,791
Don't you know your
periodic table?

132
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,875
Well... Where did you
learn a word like that, kid?

133
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:35,041
You still think I'm lying,
don't you? Well, that's okay.

134
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,666
It's just that
it's not that easy.

135
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,041
What can I do to
make you believe me?

136
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,166
Why don't you tell me what else
you know about rare earth?

137
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,708
You know, lanthanides?

138
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,916
Lutetium, atomic number 71.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,750
That's what was
found on our land.

140
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,458
It's used as a fixing
agent for ceramics.

141
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,125
How's that?

142
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,291
Not enough?

143
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,208
I have another
question for you.

144
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,125
It's well-known that the
Lovelace household has a dog.

145
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,375
About that dog...
Tell me what you know.

146
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,958
That's an easy question.

147
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,458
That dog became a member
of our family six years ago.

148
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:16,541
His name is Lazlo and he's
a white Volpino Italiano.

149
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,041
Revy. Rock's taking too long.

150
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,750
Huh. I bet he's in there
right now rocking him to sleep.

151
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,000
He's gonna get all emotional.

152
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,416
He's probably gonna come up
here and give us a sob story

153
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,583
and ask us to let him go.

154
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,375
What'd I say?
Look at those eyes.

155
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,333
Not cool. I don't
like how this feels.

156
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,416
We need more information.

157
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,750
After we dock, I think
we should wait

158
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,208
before handing him
over to the mafia.

159
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,541
It's obvious the
cartel lied to us.

160
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,750
If they were lying about him,

161
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,541
it can only mean
there's gonna be trouble.

162
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,875
[REVY] Rock.

163
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,708
Don't take pity on our cargo.

164
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,958
You'll feel like total shit
if you start imagining

165
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,708
all the places that
kid could end up.

166
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,166
But... as long as our
company sees a profit,

167
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,250
then there's really
no problem. Understand?

168
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,625
His life has nothing
to do with us after that.

169
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,500
Even if there is no justice,

170
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,250
the world's gonna
keep on turning.

171
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:25,166
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't pity him.

172
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,375
But I'm also concerned
that our client lied to us.

173
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,083
I worked in the resource
procurement department.

174
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,791
So, I know a lot about
rare earth and rare metals.

175
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,791
And everything he says about
the Lovelace family checks out.

176
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,333
I remember seeing
a number of reports

177
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,375
from our South
American division--

178
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,500
details about their
family structure.

179
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,375
Very impressive. That is
so interesting, Rock.

180
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,916
Aren't you just the
brilliant businessman?

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,291
Seriously, I think we should
put your picture on a fucking

182
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:55,208
employee-of-the-month plaque
and hang it up right here.

183
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,458
Either way, it's
still up to Dutch.

184
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,833
He gets the final say on this.

185
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,208
I just don't get it.
The minute they got the kid,

186
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,375
they could've demanded
a ransom right then.

187
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,916
And they would've
got what they wanted.

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,958
Is there any reason for
them to keep it a secret

189
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,208
and sell him off?

190
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,833
[REVY] I dunno why
they'd keep it a secret.

191
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,791
But I can think of a good reason
why they'd wanna sell the kid.

192
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,333
If you ask me, they probably did
it cuz they were pissed off.

193
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,666
If there's one thing
all mafias have in common,

194
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,416
it's that they hate having
shit rubbed in their faces.

195
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,208
They're not gonna let something
like that go unpunished.

196
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,750
Know what I mean?

197
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,916
[DUTCH] Hmm... Revy,
if their pride's at stake,

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,083
then this is gonna
be a real hassle.

199
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,166
And we definitely don't
want any part of that.

200
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,333
I think I'm gonna put
a little extra insurance

201
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:55,375
on our shipment
before we deliver it.

202
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:59,208
I'll ask Balalaika to
do some background checks.

203
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,791
[BALALAIKA] My, my.

204
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,833
It's quite rare to have
you asking a favor, Dutch.

205
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,083
[DUTCH] I need a
little background

206
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,875
on the Manisarera Cartel
and the Lovelace family.

207
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,875
Can you dig that up for us?

208
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,708
[BALALAIKA] Huh?

209
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,166
We actually just
picked up a job

210
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,875
involving the
Manisarera Cartel.

211
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,416
Your timing is
impeccable, Dutch.

212
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,333
[DUTCH] Thanks. I owe you one.

213
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,125
But since we're
still in the process

214
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,291
of setting up our insurance,
don't stir things up too much.

215
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,208
[BALALAIKA] Well,
that's impossible.

216
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,750
What?

217
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,833
You know the way
this business works.

218
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,083
When things get stirred up,

219
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,291
they're stirred up
like a typhoon.

220
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,708
[DUTCH] Just do your best.
Keep it cool.

221
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,916
[BALALAIKA] Very well. Shall I
get back to you at your office?

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,291
[DUTCH] No. We'll be having
a drink at the Yellow Flag.

223
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,750
You can find us there.

224
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,041
Hmm...

225
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,375
Alright then, Rock.

226
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,833
There's one more thing
we need to check out

227
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,833
before this thing
goes any further.

228
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,125
I'm talking about
daddy Lovelace.

229
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,916
Is he the type who's capable
of sending out private troops

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,083
to rescue his son, or was
the kid just bluffing us?

231
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,541
I don't think so.
Financially speaking,

232
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,416
they can't afford more
than one personal servant

233
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,791
for the entire household
at this point.

234
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,291
A servant? What kind?

235
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,750
[ROCK] An ordinary housemaid.

236
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,458
So, do you think the
maid's gonna rush in

237
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,000
to try and save the
little prince or what?

238
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,833
That would be fun.

239
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:59,541
[horn sounding]

240
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:10,375
[seagulls]

241
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,916
Huh?

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,583
[MAN 1] What did you just say?

243
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,541
I said I'm just a lonely
soul who's come here

244
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,791
from South America and I
require your assistance.

245
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,375
If you could direct me,

246
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,208
I'm in search of a place where
I can find my fellow countrymen.

247
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,250
Might you know of
such a place nearby?

248
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,541
So, by "fellow countrymen,"
you mean from your country?

249
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,750
[ROBERTA] Why yes, of course.

250
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,458
Um, this little lady's
countrymen, huh?

251
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,041
[MAN 2] Hey, she could mean...

252
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,666
But there are no other
"countrymen" of hers

253
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,500
in this area, right?

254
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,166
Listen, lady, I'm afraid
we can't give you

255
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,958
that sorta info ourselves.

256
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,291
Perhaps you might direct me
to someone who could tell me...

257
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,000
[MAN 2] Well, miss,
there is a place where

258
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,750
you might be able
to find out...

259
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:23,750
But it's like one big viper pit,
if you catch my drift...

260
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,833
I do not mind.
I'll go to this place

261
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,666
if I can find out about
my fellow countrymen.

262
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,916
[MAN 3] I really wouldn't
recommend it, sweetheart.

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,875
[ROBERTA] Please do not worry.

264
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,416
[REVY] We're here. On dry land.

265
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,125
Huh? Would you get
moving already?!

266
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,875
C'mon. What are you,
a schoolyard bully?

267
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,750
Don't forget, you used to
be a brat once upon a time.

268
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,916
[REVY] Yeah? I don't remember
getting paid to babysit.

269
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,583
This is a fucking joke.

270
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,458
Revy.

271
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,291
[REVY] Move your ass!

272
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,166
Alright, isn't that enough?

273
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,250
Oh, what? You too now?

274
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,791
Wait, let me guess--

275
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,833
you're gonna treat him nice
and get a job at his house?

276
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,250
Guess that makes sense.
Just look at you.

277
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,166
You'd definitely be better
off as some stuck-up butler

278
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,500
than as a sailor.
That's for damn sure.

279
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,125
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever you say, Revy.

280
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,375
[REVY] You'll be asking him,

281
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,875
"Master, how would you
like your Mint Julep?

282
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,625
I sure hopes you like it."

283
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,083
Hell, you can be just
like Old Black Joe...

284
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,625
Must be nice to be surrounded
by dozens of servants all day.

285
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,541
Ha!

286
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,958
[GARCIA]
Like I told you before,

287
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,875
my family only has
the one servant.

288
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,666
She's a maid and
her name's Roberta.

289
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,458
But she's not very good at
cleaning or doing chores.

290
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,041
We don't serve milk here.

291
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,916
[ROBERTA] Then may I
have a glass of water?

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,875
I only arrived here today
and I don't know my way around.

293
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,125
I'm in search of a
Colombian friend of mine.

294
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,166
Do you know where
I might find...

295
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,541
Order a real drink.

296
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,000
This is a bar, you dumb bitch.

297
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,041
I only arrived here today
and I don't know my way around.

298
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,208
I am in search of a
Colombian friend of mine.

299
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,375
Do you know where I might find

300
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,291
my fellow Colombians
in this town?

301
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,250
Or could you help me
find the authorities?

302
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,958
It would be a great help.

303
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,541
Lady, does this place look like

304
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,625
a fucking tourist center to you?
Do you see me handing out maps?

305
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,166
[ROBERTA] No.

306
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,750
She's always been very clumsy.

307
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,166
And it's true, she can't
clean or do chores.

308
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,041
But still, Roberta's a
lot stronger than you are

309
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,916
and she's gonna save me!

310
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,500
That's gotta be the funniest
thing I've heard all day!

311
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,541
She's not gonna throw a fucking
teacup at me, is she? Oooh!

312
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,000
If this turns out to be true,

313
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,833
then I'll believe
anything you say, kid.

314
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:15,458
Even if you said Jesus rode
a chopper across Route 66!

315
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,000
And have you seen her
when she was being strong?

316
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,625
I haven't. But I do remember
there was this one time...

317
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:27,375
[dog barking]

318
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,083
[GARCIA] We lived together
at my father's house.

319
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:36,166
It was just the three of us--
my father, Roberta, and me.

320
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,375
It was a peaceful life.

321
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,166
[ROBERTA yells]

322
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,041
[GARCIA] I didn't have many
friends to play with there,

323
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,666
so Roberta would
always play with me.

324
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,166
I especially loved to
arm wrestle with her.

325
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,791
Probably because I could
beat Roberta every time.

326
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,166
And even though she never won,

327
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,041
she was always a
good sport about it.

328
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,333
The two of us were
out in the garden

329
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,625
arm wrestling on that day, too.

330
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,250
And then...

331
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,208
...they came.

332
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,208
To threaten my father.

333
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,041
[birds chirping]

334
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,958
[GARCIA] Somehow,
she knew what was going on

335
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,875
long before I ever did.

336
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,041
The moment she sensed that
they were coming to our house,

337
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,583
her arm suddenly stiffened.

338
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:30,375
I used every ounce of strength
I had in me to try and beat her,

339
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,583
but...

340
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,208
[knocking]

341
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:38,916
Her arm wouldn't move.
It was like steel.

342
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,541
All those times, she'd been
losing to me on purpose.

343
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,791
And that's when I realized
there was a good reason

344
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,750
why Roberta played the part
of the weak and timid maid.

345
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,541
I found out then.

346
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,666
[chattering in background]

347
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,041
Hmm?

348
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:03,083
[footsteps]

349
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,583
Huh?

350
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,750
[footsteps]

351
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,791
[gasps]

352
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,208
[BORIS] Fallen nobility.
The wife died four years ago.

353
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,083
Pictured here are the father,
Diego, his only son, Garcia,

354
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,250
and their one servant.
She's a housemaid

355
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,208
and a caretaker for the boy.

356
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,916
[BALALAIKA] I don't like this.
This isn't good.

357
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,500
[BORIS] Ma'am?

358
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,666
Comrade Sergeant,
take a look at her eyes.

359
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,166
Don't you notice anything?

360
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,833
[BORIS] The eyes of a soldier.

361
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,958
[BALALAIKA] That is correct,
Sergeant. And that's not all.

362
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,541
She's one hell of a rabid dog.

363
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,333
Woman, I've got
business with you.

364
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,375
I hear some crazy bitch
dressed up like a maid

365
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,458
is asking all over town
where she can find

366
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,583
the Colombian mafia.

367
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,875
Wearing this crazy outfit
you'd only see in a movie.

368
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:18,291
Any <i>pendejo</i> would remember
someone in an outfit like that.

369
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,750
Well, now that you've
called us here,

370
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,916
what the fuck do you want?
Who the hell are you, huh?!

371
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,083
I'm glad you came, as it was
my intention that you find me.

372
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,250
You are from the Manisarera
Cartel, is that not correct?

373
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,833
I am a servant of
the Lovelace family

374
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,875
and I have come a
long way to be here.

375
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,833
I have a few questions
I'd like to ask.

376
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,333
Please excuse me,

377
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,833
but I'm afraid I may have no
other choice but to be rude.

378
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,541
[ABREGO] Ha, ha.
Did you hear that?

379
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,083
"Be rude," she says.
What a crazy bitch!

380
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,500
[CARTEL MAN 1] What?
With your umbrella?

381
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,000
[ROBERTA] I'm very sorry, but
I will not be able to hold back.

382
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,791
Please excuse me.

383
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,708
And... I hope you
enjoy yourselves.

384
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,958
Roberta!

385
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,666
[ROCK] I see it now.

386
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,500
That maid is a killer
robot from the future!
