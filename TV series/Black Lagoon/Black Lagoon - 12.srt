1
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,166
[TAKENAKA] Let me see here...

2
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,791
Where to start? Well,
my name is Takenaka.

3
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,500
Masahiro Takenaka.

4
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,791
Now perhaps you can
tell me your name?

5
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,916
What's the point? Why do you
need to know my name?

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,333
It just doesn't seem right
for you to remain nameless.

7
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,333
That's all.
But have it your way.

8
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:01,958
No big deal. It really
doesn't bother me.

9
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,958
I'll just call you
"brother" instead.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,041
[LEIGHARCH] Hey, baby! I didn't
know you wanted to die so badly!

11
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,333
Volunteering for
suicide, are you?!

12
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,041
Are you from... Tokyo?

13
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,250
[ROCK] Uh... Yeah.

14
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,708
I'm actually from
Adachi, myself.

15
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,333
Do you go to Shinjuku a lot?

16
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,958
Ah, is the Etoire still there?
I love that place.

17
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,958
And how 'bout the
Nichigeki Theate?

18
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,291
Well, I...

19
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,541
I remember after a demonstration
we had at the JNR,

20
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,541
I went there to see <i>Yakuza Cop</i> .

21
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,458
You ever hear of it?
It's a classic!

22
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,250
That was right after
we went head-to-head

23
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,375
with the riot police.
Waltzed right in there

24
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,583
with my helmet on
and my club at my side.

25
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,958
I tell ya, it sure
was good to be young.

26
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,500
Do you miss it?

27
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,416
Do you miss living in Japan?

28
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,583
Let me ask you
something instead.

29
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,708
Why would a guy like you wanna
cross this dangerous bridge?

30
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,416
Well? I doubt it's
for the money.

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,666
Not a lot of folks
would choose this life.

32
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,875
These days, Japan's full to
the brim with petite bourgeois.

33
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,958
If you ask me, bro,

34
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,750
the truth is you and I are both
outsiders from that country.

35
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,708
Neither of us really
fit in there anymore.

36
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,541
You know...

37
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,458
...I think I get
where you're coming from

38
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,583
and I guess I'm curious.
I'd like to know why you decided

39
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,750
to take the road less
traveled, if you will.

40
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,416
I'm...

41
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,666
I'm different than you.

42
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,666
I don't wanna be grouped
with people like you.

43
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,375
[TAKENAKA] Oh?
How are we different?

44
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,541
For one, I wasn't chased
out of the country.

45
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,708
But it goes beyond that.

46
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,250
You were forced into a corner
and had to escape.

47
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,083
I'm young, but I know
what you've done.

48
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,041
I've heard all about your
"achievements" in our country.

49
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,458
Bro, you don't know
the half of it.

50
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,916
When I left Japan, it was 'cause
I'd gambled everything I had.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,916
On activism and the concept of
permanent, worldwide revolution.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,125
When you have a will
and a mission,

53
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,958
you concede battles,
but never the fight.

54
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,208
You don't know what
that's like, do ya?

55
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:10,375
If there's a difference
between us, that's what it is.

56
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,458
I've felt that. I have.

57
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:17,708
[TAKENAKA] I wonder. A mission
requires tenacity, doesn't it?

58
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,416
And what about you?

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,625
You don't have a mission
anymore, do you?

60
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:27,375
Or even if you do,
you no longer believe in it.

61
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,458
[TAKENAKA] Hey now, brother...

62
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,083
[IBRAHA] Cut it out, Takenaka!

63
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,833
I don't give a shit
about what tactics

64
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,416
you're trying on this guy.

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,875
This conversation has nothing
to do with the interrogation!

66
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,125
Alright. Listen up,
you tight-lipped bastard.

67
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,458
I'm not as kind and
understanding as he is.

68
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,958
We don't have time for this.
Where are the documents?!

69
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,875
[REVY] We're gonna
hafta walk from here.

70
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,458
We don't keep driving in car?

71
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,333
I don't wanna charge in
with this piece of shit,

72
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,916
especially with a
crackhead at the wheel.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,208
Fuck you! I'll have you know

74
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,083
this is the world's
greatest off-road vehicle,

75
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,250
you heartless bitch!

76
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,208
This piss-tank's
getting on my last nerve.

77
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,416
Listen up,
you fuckin' leprechaun--

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,791
you're gonna wait here
until you get our signal.

79
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,666
If you run away, I'll hunt
you down and castrate you.

80
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,208
--Tch!
--My! She say good things!

81
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,500
I agree very much.

82
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,000
Fuckin' bollocks!

83
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,833
[REVY] Anyway, just go easy
on the weed, okay?

84
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,791
I don't need you all fucked up
when we hafta make a run for it.

85
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,458
You don't worry for this
guy when it come to that.

86
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:25,791
Even when his brain off to Mars,
he never mess up driving.

87
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,500
Let's go, little miss Chinglish.

88
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,875
You like for me to
split your ass in four?

89
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,750
It is not nice to make fun.

90
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,250
You one rotten bitch!

91
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,666
There's a story.
I heard it a long time ago.

92
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,500
It's about a man
who came to a city.

93
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,625
He went to a street corner.

94
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,750
And all alone,
he began speaking.

95
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,916
[crowd yelling]

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,333
Hoping to make the
world a better place,

97
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:57,041
this man continued to preach to
whoever'd listen, day after day.

98
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,500
At first,

99
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,375
many showed great interest
in what the man had to say.

100
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,416
Some even promised
to fight alongside him.

101
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,958
But then in time,
they all lost interest.

102
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,125
As long as their lives
were comfortable,

103
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,125
it didn't matter to them
what happened to the world.

104
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,208
Still, the man wouldn't stop.
Even as he aged,

105
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,916
with not a single soul
left listening to him,

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
he continued all the same.

107
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,708
Then one day, a child
who was walking by

108
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,958
stopped and asked
him a question--

109
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,041
"Why do you continue preaching
when there's nobody here?"

110
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,458
And this is how
the man answered--

111
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,958
"In the beginning, I thought
I could change everyone.

112
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,208
Then I realized that
it was a hopeless dream.

113
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,416
But the reason I won't
stop preaching..."

114
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,333
And brother, the reason
I won't stop fighting is...

115
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,833
...back then when I started out,

116
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,708
I gambled my entire
life on this.

117
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,625
If I stop now, all of it
is just one big lie.

118
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,250
Well, well.

119
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,916
Seems that you and I really
are different, after all.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,083
It's a shame.

121
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,250
Takenaka,

122
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,416
how badly d'ya think
we should hurt him?

123
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,625
It won't be necessary. He's not
a soldier, just a delivery boy.

124
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,708
He has no reason to be loyal.
Leave him alone and he'll talk.

125
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,916
And if he still hasn't
talked to us by morning,

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,125
well, we are soldiers,
after all.

127
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,458
We'll hold a military tribunal

128
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,000
and send him to
the firing squad.

129
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,250
Tomorrow?!

130
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,375
Every single minute that
passes is hurting us!

131
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,625
We're on the brink
of determining

132
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,250
whether or not
the plan goes ahead.

133
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,166
Why the hell can't
you see that?!

134
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,416
[TAKENAKA] C'mon,
no need to be so uptight.

135
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,916
If we don't get it from him,

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,666
then we'll just go after the
girl we left at the village.

137
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,166
Who knows? If we're lucky,

138
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,041
she might just come waltzing
in here to save him, right?

139
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,875
[REVY] Three at the west gate.

140
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,708
Six more at the east gate.

141
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,333
Only a fifty caliber
up front. Any mines?

142
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,125
No mines. Their camp
is very often moving.

143
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,166
Mines are too much trouble.

144
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,000
We hurry now. If idiot partner
talk, this all for nothing.

145
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,958
There's no need to worry.
Rock's a tight-lipped guy.

146
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:20,958
He wouldn't talk even if they

147
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,750
put him in front
of a firing squad.

148
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,791
Let's move in at sunset.

149
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,375
You ready, Chinglish?

150
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,125
[SHEN HUA] Yes,
twinkie, I ready.

151
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,916
You don't forget,
when we finish job,

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,333
I carve some meat off
your ass, stupid whore.

153
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,791
[ROCK] Damn it!

154
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,000
Takenaka!

155
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,125
Oh, you're here.

156
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,791
Sorry, but something's
bothering me.

157
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,166
I received word from
our teams in Thailand!

158
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,291
The other three
cases were decoys!

159
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,958
Which means that your Japanese
friend has the documents!

160
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,958
Your actions are
interfering with the plan

161
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,166
and that is unacceptable!

162
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,333
You...

163
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,958
You know why this
is so important to me

164
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,416
and why we cannot fail.

165
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,125
Tell me...

166
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,708
What ever happened with the
team we sent into the city?

167
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,125
Have we heard from them?

168
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,458
What? Don't change the subject!
What does it matter?!

169
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,458
I'm not changing the subject.

170
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,250
Now how long has it been
since the search party left?

171
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,833
They haven't reported back.

172
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,750
--That's because they--
--And the surveillance team

173
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,875
at the government camp.

174
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,333
That woman hasn't
been found anywhere.

175
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,750
Makes you wonder...
Where is she?

176
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,666
[REVY] What's the problem?
Let me guess--

177
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,291
it feels so good,
you can't pull the trigger?

178
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,916
[SHEN HUA] Men know
much about stabbing,

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but no get stab much
themselves. I do for them!

180
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,708
My turn now!

181
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,333
Revy?

182
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,291
Is that you, Revy?
I'm right in here! Revy!

183
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,416
[REVY] Rocky-baby.
You been a good boy?

184
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,125
If you promise to behave
yourself a little bit longer,

185
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,791
sweetie-pie, I'll even
buy you some cotton candy.

186
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,375
So, we're leaving now.

187
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,750
Oh? Is he dumbass
you talking about?

188
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,416
[ROCK] Who the hell is she?

189
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,333
Well isn't this
a pleasant surprise.

190
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,333
Rock! Hurry the fuck up!

191
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,333
Rock, we need a strategy now!

192
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,500
[ROCK] What are you
talking about? Just run!

193
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,166
[REVY] Fuckin' eh!
Works for me! Now let's go!

194
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,833
Whaaat?

195
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm actually feeling pretty
good about being right here.

196
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,458
Too fucking bad! It's your
job to drive, asshole!

197
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,916
Now get this shit-heap rolling!

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,541
Oh, yeah! I almost forgot!

199
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,666
I've gotta get to Liverpool!

200
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,083
It no use. He very,
very relax now.

201
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,791
[LEIGHARCH] Jimi Hendrix
is calling me back!

202
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,000
He got my message!

203
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,666
He wants me to defeat
the Klingons ASAP!

204
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,125
C-C-Captain Picard!

205
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,791
[REVY] Hey! Whaddya doing?!
You're going the wrong way!

206
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,750
You jackass!

207
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,666
We're right in the middle
of their fuckin' camp!

208
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,625
Goddamn it! Guess
there's no choice now

209
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,500
but to start shooting!

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,416
Look at these crazy bastards.

211
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,208
All units! After them!

212
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,541
Pursue that vehicle!

213
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,166
Corner them and make
the kill! Let's move out!

214
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,625
This is reckless, Ibraha.

215
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,333
You can shut your mouth.

216
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,791
[REVY] Seeing as Rock hasn't
snapped under the pressure,

217
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,541
I take it this enemy isn't
all that bad, after all.

218
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,000
[ROCK] No.

219
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:02,083
[REVY] Look at that. These
fools are coming in droves.

220
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,791
Oh, that is very good.

221
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,708
[IBRAHA] Damn it!

222
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,375
I understand how
you feel, but...

223
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,500
I've been trying to accomplish
this mission for years!

224
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,458
I will not stand aside and let
that gangster ruin it all!

225
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,833
[ROCK] Damn... Damn!

226
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,541
What's with you?

227
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,916
Alright. It's on.

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,500
Revy. I talked to that
Japanese guy for a long time

229
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,000
and I realized...

230
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,166
--...that I...
--Rock, paper, scissors!

231
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,625
--[SHEN HUA] Scissor!
--Damn it!

232
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,916
I get fuckin' leftovers.

233
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,250
[SHEN HUA] I see you later.

234
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,958
Hey! You can take out two
of them, then we switch!

235
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,666
Did you say something?

236
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,958
[ROCK] No. Never mind.

237
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,541
I coming for you!

238
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,083
Get ready!

239
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:48,875
What do you think you're doing?!

240
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,416
Look!

241
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,958
Stupid bitch, didn't I tell
you not to kill them all?!

242
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,750
Move! I'm taking the left side,
you take the right!

243
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,708
No room, get out my face!

244
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,916
[IBRAHA] Let's fan out!

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,208
And keep an eye out
for our own! After them!

246
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,541
[LEIGHARCH] Holy shit!

247
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,791
What?

248
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,458
Whoa! Raquel Welch and
Jane Fonda are racing!

249
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,125
How can you not love that?

250
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,375
--Oh. Great.
--[SHEN HUA] You stay down!

251
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,416
--You in my way!
--Get your fuckin' hands off me!

252
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
[LEIGHARCH] I don't understand!

253
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,333
Where are you
ladies taking me?!

254
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,708
Could it be? Could it?!

255
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,208
The legendary nude beach?!

256
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,875
[CHANG] Dutch, only thirty
minutes left until the deadline.

257
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,333
Think you'll be able to
sit tight for that long?

258
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,916
Oh, I see.

259
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,083
No, not really. You're free
to use any means necessary.

260
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,916
That's fine with me.

261
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,875
Guess who, Mr. CIA.

262
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,958
Yeah, right on schedule.
Don't worry about it.

263
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,041
Cut it out with the lousy jokes.

264
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,708
And the money?

265
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,250
'Cause I don't take
American Express, you know.

266
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,500
Fine. You let me know
when you get it. Later.

267
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,000
What did Hong Kong say?

268
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,166
Well, sir, they said, "We
permit the bringing of justice,

269
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,750
but the situation
cannot become messy."

270
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,333
Well, I should've known.

271
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:21,833
So, in other words, they want us
to avoid fighting them head-on.

272
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,541
That's a mighty tall order.

273
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:28,625
Well, all we can do now is
wish the delivery boys luck.

274
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,958
Okay, we start over then!

275
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,250
Rock, paper, scissor
one more time?

276
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,083
[REVY] We don't have time
for that! They're coming!

277
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,958
[LEIGHARCH] Barbarella's holding
up an anti-war sign in the nude!

278
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,416
[REVY] We've gotta
kill them all!

279
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,208
With this much distance,
your weapons won't work!

280
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,333
My turn!

281
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,500
Have no choice.

282
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,083
Now we see if you any good.

283
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,000
Fuckin' smartass.

284
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,208
This'll make you go cross-eyed.

285
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,708
Damn it!

286
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,625
[REVY] Suck this!

287
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:18,083
Oh, now I see she not only
good for talking. Impressive.

288
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,000
[REVY] If we had an M-72
or a mini-gun,

289
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,208
it would've been easier
to finish the job.

290
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,416
[SHEN HUA] Stupid. Cannon and
gun, they always needing ammo.

291
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,083
Body and blade last forever.

292
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,458
They always be the best
weapon in the world.

293
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,833
That's the dumbest thing I
ever heard. A knife can chip.

294
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,541
Guns over swords
and nukes over guns.

295
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,125
Now if we had one of those,

296
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,500
it would be the greatest thing
ever. But it's rigged so that

297
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,000
only politicians can
get their hands on 'em.

298
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,458
Fuck!

299
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,416
[SHEN HUA] Your head not right.
It not for you to buy.

300
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,291
Criminal only use such
weapon for making big crime.

301
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,583
[LEIGHARCH] What?!
My application

302
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,041
for the Black Panthers
was denied again?!

303
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,750
[REVY] Gimme a break.

304
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,458
Hey, Rock. You should
have some of this.

305
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,500
It'll calm you down.

306
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,041
Why not?

307
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,583
[IBRAHA] All the base's
vehicles are to pursue them!

308
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,916
It doesn't matter if
you cross the DMZ border!

309
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,041
Drive right through! Find that
jeep and get those documents!

310
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,916
Enough! That's a death sentence!

311
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,250
Give that back!

312
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,041
Ibraha! Don't forget we
have a job to do! Right?!

313
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,083
Ibraha!

314
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,375
Shut up!

315
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,333
No matter what you do
or how hard you fight,

316
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,291
your son is never coming back.

317
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:28,375
[child crying]

318
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,958
[SHEN HUA] DMZ, yes?! Very soon,
we be seeing the camp.

319
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:37,416
How ya doin'? You having
fun yet or what, Rock?

320
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,833
Well, how should I put it?
Running away like this

321
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,958
always seems to make
things worse, you know.

322
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,875
Truth is when I
look back at my life,

323
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,875
it feels like I've been
running away from things

324
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,708
since I was in kindergarten.
It's over.

325
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,041
[SHEN HUA] Oh,
it affect him wrong way.

326
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,791
I've never seen him like this.

327
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,416
He's such a positive guy so I
figured he'd just get over it.

328
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,375
No good. Mood important
at time like these.

329
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,958
When I talked to that old guy,
I acted all high and mighty,

330
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,291
but now that I think
about it, that's all I do.

331
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,708
I talk and talk and
then I talk myself

332
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,125
right outta the situation.

333
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,375
Hey! Look at that!

334
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,000
Great. Here we go again!
What is it this time?

335
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,250
[LEIGHARCH] Playmates!

336
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,333
There are exactly one
hundred Playmates, man!

337
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,916
From the '90s! It's an attack
of the Playmate Army!

338
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
[SOLDIER] Commander! An unknown
has entered the DMZ!

339
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,416
Permission to fire?!

340
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,166
[COMMAND] Bunker Number Three!
Hold your fire!

341
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,666
To all personnel on duty,
that is not the enemy!

342
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,125
What you and I do, it isn't
just some profession!

343
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,083
It's a way of life
for us, is it not?!

344
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,250
There are times when
we simply cannot give in!

345
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,333
Ibraha.

346
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,083
Those monsters in Jerusalem

347
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,500
and all those who've
helped to protect them...

348
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,875
All of them are finally
within our reach!

349
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,375
And so help me, Takenaka,

350
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,208
I'll show them what the
Red Cross camp in Beirut

351
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:57,000
was like in '87! That's the
only reason I've come this far!

352
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,500
[SOLDIER] Commander,
your orders?!

353
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,833
Continue with your pursuit!
Find that vehicle!

354
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,250
I don't care if you hafta

355
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,333
--go into the government camp!
--Stop! We must retreat!

356
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,333
Don't be blinded by our ideals!

357
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,750
"Be blinded"? What the fuck
are you talking about?

358
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,250
Isn't that the whole reason
we've been fighting?!

359
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,833
Aren't those ideals the reason

360
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,333
you came to the Beqaa Valley
in the first place?!

361
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,041
Answer me, Takenaka!

362
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,416
[TAKENAKA] To all units--
retreat immediately.

363
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,250
Do not return to camp.

364
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,500
Proceed to the secondary
gathering point.

365
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,041
[SOLDIER] Roger that!

366
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,291
That was our problem. You and I
could only look to the past.

367
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,958
If we keep doing that, nothing
will ever change, will it?

368
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,500
Still...

369
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,000
I suppose none of this
matters anymore,

370
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,791
but you were a good comrade
to me all the same.

371
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,208
What a goddamn waste.

372
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,833
Whatcha got for me?!

373
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,833
Has the launderer's
delivery boy arrived yet?

374
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,500
Well, well. You're
late again, Langley!

375
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,958
[CIA AGENT 1] That's
because Langley's busy!

376
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,583
There's too many bastards
shitting on freedom

377
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,291
and justice these days!

378
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,166
Alright, that's enough
chit-chat for me.

379
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,541
Where's this thing that's
supposed to get us all excited?

380
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,083
Oh, shit! The briefcase!

381
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,083
--Wha...?!
--I don't have the briefcase!

382
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,583
Revy! We're in big trouble!

383
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,916
Don't panic, Rock. If we're
lucky, Aladdin will show up

384
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,125
and rub his magic dick
for us and bam!

385
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,791
Here! Just like that!

386
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,166
What in hell?!

387
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,041
Then why you take us on
long ride to save dumbass?!

388
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,083
[REVY] You guys
wouldn't have come

389
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,000
if I didn't give
you a better reason.

390
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,958
Shit! This thing
is covered in sweat.

391
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,041
Alright, people. Thanks a lot.

392
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,416
Next time, try to keep your
deliveries in better shape,

393
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,000
or the boss'll be pissed!

394
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,541
Oh, yeah, and one
more thing, Rebecca--

395
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,541
if the chief at Buffalo Hill
and your pals

396
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,791
over at the 27th Precinct
happened to hear about you now,

397
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,291
they'd be pissin' their pants!

398
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,958
Damn it.

399
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,166
Now don't get me wrong.

400
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,958
Personally, I couldn't
give a shit.

401
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,125
Our job's to destroy the enemies
of the United States!

402
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,000
They're sure as hell
not paying us enough

403
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,750
to chase criminals, too!

404
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,166
Just a little something
for you to think about

405
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,416
when we call you
for the next job!

406
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,875
[ROCK] Hey, Revy.

407
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,083
I haven't had the chance
to thank you yet.

408
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,541
So, uh... Thanks.

409
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,625
Cut it out. We're buddies.

410
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,916
So, there's no need for this
formal "thank you" bullshit.

411
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,541
By the way, Rock...

412
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,583
Aiyah.

413
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,125
What the fuck
were you thinking?!

414
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,125
Guess what! That's the last
favor you're gonna get from me,

415
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,416
you fuckin' pea brain!

416
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,291
One more thing--
all the rescue expenses

417
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,708
are coming outta your pay!

418
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:47,958
Next time you wanna be saved,

419
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,458
you better start
asking God for favors!

420
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,250
Gimme a fuckin' break.

421
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,708
[JAPANESE MAN] Oh, hello.
"Mr. Ken." What a coincidence.

422
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,000
Ah! How's life
for the family man?

423
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,166
Was the vacation
worth the travel?

424
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,500
Oh, we really had a
great time. How about you?

425
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,208
Things did not go smoothly.
The trade fell through

426
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,041
and then I ended up
hurting my hip.

427
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,208
On top of that, I left
after having a big fight

428
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,791
with a close friend of mine.

429
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,500
I even tried unsuccessfully to
pass what I couldn't accomplish

430
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,708
on to the next generation.

431
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,541
One unpleasant situation
after another.

432
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,041
I think I must be getting old.

433
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,625
There will always
be a next time.

434
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,166
[TAKENAKA] Of course.

435
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,291
Always a next time.

436
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,541
Till I die, there will
always be a next time.

437
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,791
Oh, before you go, what is it
you do for a living?

438
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,541
My job? Let's see...

439
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,500
Yeah, it's clear to me now.

440
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,916
My job is to be an
enemy of the state.

441
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,458
[ROCK] Vampires?

442
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:31,208
Those words... They have
something to do with vampires.
