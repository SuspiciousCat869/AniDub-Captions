1
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,958
Well, are we out of
their missile range?

2
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,333
I think so.

3
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,541
We're safe if we
maintain this distance.

4
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,916
Assholes. We'll have to keep
an eye on them from here.

5
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,125
[explosion]

6
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,000
[REVY] Let's move.

7
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,833
What the hell are you
doing over there?

8
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,125
Hey, you alright?

9
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,458
You didn't warn me
about an explosion.

10
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,708
What if you accidentally
flooded the place?

11
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,375
You shouldn't be so reckless.

12
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,750
Listen, we can't afford to
be screwing around right now.

13
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,000
The more you whine,
the less time we have.

14
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,250
I understand all that,

15
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,416
but you could have said
something ahead of time.

16
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,958
[REVY] And how did you expect
me to talk underwater?

17
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,916
Why don't you try paying closer
attention to what I'm doing?

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,208
But still, at least give me a
signal when you do something...

19
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,666
Bones? Bones!

20
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,083
Well, yeah, there
are gonna be bones.

21
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,375
Look around you.
They're all over the place.

22
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,625
Listen, Rock,
this is a gravesite

23
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:36,125
that all of us living on
the surface have forgotten.

24
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,208
This is where death
came for all of them.

25
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,500
It was their time,
whether they wanted it or not.

26
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,708
No flowers or candles here.

27
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,416
No one comes to visit
and no one remembers.

28
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,250
A rotting catacomb...
minus all the fucking saints.

29
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,166
I've never liked
these kinds of places.

30
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,166
Not at all.

31
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,291
Smells like something's been
rotting down here for ages.

32
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,250
If we stay too long,
it'll mess with our lungs.

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,916
Hey, Revy.

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,416
How do you think they felt...

35
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,125
...when they realized
they were stuck here?

36
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,458
What went through their minds

37
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,958
as the lights faded
and it got dark

38
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,208
and all they could do
was struggle to breathe?

39
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,791
[REVY] Now that's
just depressing.

40
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,958
Anyway, how the hell
should I know?

41
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,916
Dying 'cause you can't breathe 

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,875
can only feel like dying cause
you can't breathe and that's it.

43
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,208
How other people die
is just how other people die.

44
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,583
What does it matter? 

45
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,666
Thinking about it isn't
gonna do a damn thing, Rock.

46
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,250
Just try to think
happy thoughts.

47
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,166
Hey, look at these guys.

48
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,041
Seems like they staged
their own version

49
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,625
of Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

50
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,458
[gunshot]

51
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,791
Captain?

52
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,916
Captain!

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,708
You bastard!

54
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,583
[CREWMAN 2] How dare you!

55
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,875
Revy. This must be
the captain here.

56
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,458
[REVY] That Ahbe guy, right? 

57
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,833
Is his Iron Cross lying
around here somewhere?

58
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,750
It'll be worth something.

59
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,250
Hmm... Come over here.

60
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,166
This guy's uniform is
different. He's that SS.

61
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,250
And the painting?

62
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,833
I don't know where it is.

63
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,291
If it's not here,
it's in a safe.

64
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,166
I don't get it.
Why'd these guys bother

65
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,833
getting into a major shootout?

66
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,416
Desperation made them panic?

67
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,250
[REVY] Now that's
a laughable theory.

68
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,333
Despair is like the
last stages of cancer--

69
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,083
you've got nothing
left to lose.

70
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,250
Well, I don't know the details,

71
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,750
but I'd say this Gestapo
was the one that shot first.

72
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,291
After that, the sailors came in
here to avenge their captain.

73
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,833
And it all ended with
the Last Stand at the Alamo.

74
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,041
A ship's crew is like family. 

75
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,000
They wouldn't kill each other if
they knew they were gonna die.

76
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,375
The only one who'd
bother starting shit

77
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,083
would be the outsider.

78
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,875
[ROCK] Is that how it works?

79
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,416
[REVY] Yeah.

80
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,208
What'd ya find?

81
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,875
Got the goods?

82
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,958
This is it. It's an exact match.

83
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,541
Yeah! This has to be it!

84
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,500
You start putting it away
and I'll take care of the rest.

85
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,625
The rest? But we got
what we came for.

86
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,958
[REVY] We're not kids
running some errand, Rock.

87
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,291
If we don't grab everything
that's worth something,

88
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,166
then this trip's been
a waste of time.

89
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,875
I noticed the captain had
an Iron Cross with a sword.

90
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,333
It's a valuable item.

91
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,000
And it's a little too valuable
to leave behind as fish food,

92
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,416
--alright?
--But you--

93
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,958
Hold on!

94
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,166
[REVY] I'll be back when I've
got everything worth taking.

95
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,291
You can keep those guys company.

96
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,125
What are you looking at?

97
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:58,333
Quit staring. I'm not exactly
thrilled about it, either.

98
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,375
[DUTCH] What's our
distance, Benny-boy?

99
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,583
The last time I checked,
it was about 5,200 yards.

100
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,458
That puts us out
of their range.

101
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:12,041
Those guys are a dangerous
bunch, alright. Fucking crazy.

102
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,583
[DUTCH] And the fact
that they just launched

103
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:17,333
three of those things at once
means they're well-equipped.

104
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,208
[BENNY] They're parked
directly above that U-boat.

105

[DUTCH] And we can't
do a damn thing.

creation of a brave new world!

In one glorious stroke,

we will reclaim that
which was lost to us

114
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,708
as the result of meddling by the
Zionists and communists alike.

True patriots are counting
on you, brave soldiers!

This is the utmost
act of courage!

In the name of strict
order and patriotism,

a little concert.

And you, what do you think
as a white man, Benny-boy?

147

That kinda machismo
doesn't agree with me.

By the way,

Nope. It looks like both of them
are still in the submarine.

00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,125
If we had the time
to retrieve it,

159
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,375
I'd take the whole thing
back to the port.

160
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,666
That way, I could've shown
that fancy dress parade

161
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,875
on that shit-heap boat what
their Führer went through.

162
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,875
Take a little bit of
the romance out of it.

163
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,125
I hear ya.

164
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,958
Hey, this isn't good.
Those guys are up to something.

165
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,000
Huh?

166
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,666
[BENNY] They're lowering
some kind of pod.

167
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,041
At this rate, there's gonna
be a showdown in the sub.

168
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,375
What now?

169
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,250
[DUTCH] There's nothing
we can do, Benny.

170
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,333
They still have TOWs. 

171
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,000
Just having to say
this pisses me off,

172
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,916
but we'll have to wait
till they give us a chance.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,833
So, for now, you'll have
to pray while you shit.

174
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,500
I'm afraid that's
about all we can do.

175
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,375
Phew! Not bad.

176
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,208
Aside from all those
Iron Crosses,

177
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,083
I found stuff the collectors
would drool over.

178
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,833
This place is a
grave robber's wet dream.

179
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,375
Revy.

180
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,916
I was thinking that maybe... 

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,458
[REVY] Hmm?

182
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,750
...we should leave
all that here.

183
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,250
[REVY] Okay, Rock,
you can spare me the rest.

184
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,000
Wait, I know,
"Thou shalt not steal"?

185
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:48,208
So, should I be calling
you "Father Rock" now?

186
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,041
That's not it.

187
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:54,000
These medals are proof
of what these people did.

188
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,041
We don't have the right
to take that away from them.

189
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:03,375
If anyone has the right
to these medals, it's them.

190
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,666
It's these people right here.

191
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,458
Don't you think?

192
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,083
I found it right
next to his body.

193
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:15,250
The captain had this photo
with him up until the very end.

194
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,125
The man had a family
waiting for him.

195
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,375
To us, these medals
are just antiques.

196
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,625
But to the people
who were left behind,

197
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,708
they're irreplaceable.

198
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,166
[REVY] Hmm.

199
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,833
So, that's how
you look at it, huh?

200
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,000
I see. Well, since we're here...

201
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:47,125
I've got a story that's perfect
for this sorta atmosphere.

202
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm gonna do you a favor

203
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,291
and let you in on a
little secret, Rock.

204
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,833
Okay?

205
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,583
Let me ask you something...

206
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,833
See this? And this?

207
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,500
What would you say
these two things are?

208
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:07,500
The first one's an old skull
and that's some sorta medal.

209
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:12,333
That's where you're wrong.
Both of these are just things. 

210
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,666
As soon as you strip
away their meanings,

211
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,166
then that's all
they really are.

212
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,291
Just things and nothing more.

213
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,458
And if you're gonna give these
things any kinda meaning again,

214
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,083
they won't get
any of their value

215
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,583
because they're
someone's precious memory.

216
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,208
Their value will be determined

217
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,625
by the one thing
everybody agrees on....

218
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,083
...and that's money.

219
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:38,083
The rest of it is just a bunch
of sentimental bullshit.

220
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,541
Is money... your god?

221
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,500
It's power. Something a lot
more useful than God.

222
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,625
And Rock, if you think
about it, other than this,

223
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,625
what do we really
value in life?

224
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,208
God? Love? Don't make me laugh.

225
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,666
Back when I was just a brat,

226
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,500
crawling around
that shit-hole city,

227
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,583
it seemed like God and
love were always sold out

228
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,666
when I went looking.

229
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,125
Before I knew better,

230
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,833
I clung to God and prayed
to him every single night.

231
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,750
Yeah, I believed in God
right up until that night

232
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,458
the cops beat the hell
outta me for no reason at all.

233
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,958
All they saw when
they looked at me

234
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:25,291
was another little ghetto rat
with no power and no god.

235
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:29,791
What's left for a poor little
Chinese bitch to rely on?

236
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,916
It's money, of course.
And guns. Fuckin' eh.

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,250
With these two things,
the world's a great place.

238
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,208
I wish I hadn't
heard that. I'm sorry.

239
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,750
[REVY] Fuck you.

240
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,333
If I was looking for pity,

241
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,875
I would have told you
something a lot more colorful.

242
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,250
The moral of the story is
when you're living on the edge,

243
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,666
that's all that matters to you

244
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,000
'cause that's all
you've really got.

245
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,208
Not everyone can get off
on being normal, Rock.

246
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,541
And one more thing...

247
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:06,000
All those rich, fat bastards
living under palm trees

248

that life's only about

249
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,708
putting on makeup...

250
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,333
I don't wanna hear you
speaking your mind

251
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,708
from the same perspective
as those hypocrites.

252
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,916
Nothing's worse than being
treated like some whore

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,875
by your companions.

254
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,791
I'll say this once--

255
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,208
the next time you decide you're
gonna tell me what's proper, 

256
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,666
you'll no longer be one of us.

257
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,500
When that happens...

258
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,833
...I'm gonna kill you.

259
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,916

The only ones who'd be
knocking on that door

266
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,541
are either ghosts or crooks.

267
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,833
And since the ghosts
are already down here,

268
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,875
well, we must have
some troublemakers here.

269

But we left our gear
on the other side

[DUTCH] We'll stay put.
It's too soon.

315
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,750
[BENNY] But Dutch...

316
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,000
[DUTCH] You wanna
show some bravado,

317
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,041
charge in and all
go to hell together?

318
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,166
It may paint a great picture,

319
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,458
but it won't be much
of an ending, boy.

320
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,375
For now, you should just pray

321
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,958
that it's not
Revy's time to go yet.

322
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,625
The enemy is coming up.

323
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,791
The grave robber's
are coming up!

324
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,000
Stand by on the machine gun!

325
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,541
Fire!

326
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,083
[DUTCH] They started.

327
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,666
You think they're alright?

328
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,583
[DUTCH] If they're
still shooting,

329
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,833
it means they're not dead yet.

330
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,416
They've stopped.

331
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,583
[BENNY] Looks that way.

332
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,958
Yeah! We got those bastards!

333
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,041
You idiots.
It was your misfortune

334
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,000
to have touched our
glorious inheritance

335
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,791
with your unworthy hands.

336
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,375
Regret it at the
bottom of the sea.

337
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,958
Retrieve the pod.
We're leaving this area.

338
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,750
[BENNY] The beacons
are still active.

339
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,791
They're drifting southeast
away from the ship.

340
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,833
But I've got no way of knowing
if they're dead or alive.

341
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,708
Can you hear me up there, Dutch?

342
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,583
[DUTCH] Yeah. Their ship
is starting to move.

343
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,208
[BENNY] Shall we go
and pick up some bones?

344
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,708
[DUTCH] That's a bit
too much, Benny-boy.

345
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,291
I guess my nerves
aren't as tough as yours.

346
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,916
[DUTCH] Yeah, I know.

347
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,500
[ROCK] Revy, look.
There's our boat.

348
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,291
So, they got away
with the goods.

349
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,041
Who the hell are they, anyway?
Those bald cocksuckers!

350
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,083
They're neo-Nazis.

351
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,625
A sorry bunch of leftovers from
the Dark Ages, if you ask me.

352
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,875
But I don't know
where they're from.

353
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,666
To hell with this bullshit!

354
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,916
You're telling me
fucking skinheads

355
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,958
got one over on us?

356
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,750
[DUTCH] This is far
from over, Revy.

357
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,416
We took a job and
it's not done yet.

358
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,041
Let's do this, Dutch!

359
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,708
Let's turn that Nazi boat
into a floating morgue!

360
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,916
[DUTCH] Agreed.

361
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,875
Putting all politics aside,

362
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,958
it's not good for business
to leave it at this.

363
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,125
The only cure for these
idiots playing heroes

364
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,833
is some bitter medicine.

365
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,875
So, let's give it to 'em.

366
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,958
[REVY] Listen, Dutch,
I just can't.

367
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,208
I can't partner...
with that guy.
