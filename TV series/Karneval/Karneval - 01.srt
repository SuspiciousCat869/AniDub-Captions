[KAROKU] Hey, Nai. C'mere.

3
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,708
[NAI] Yeah?

00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,875
[KAROKU] You'll be
all right. I promise.

[NAI] No, wait.

00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,458
Tell me where you're going.

7
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,041
 Cat got your tongue, love?

8
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,416
You're on my tummy.

9
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,791
Please--it hurts.
I can't breathe.

10

I hope you are not
implying I'm overweight!

11

Please, ma'am. It's not mine.

12
00:01:55,791 --> 00:02:01,958
Fantastic; a Circus ID.
Damn it. Am I busted?

13
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,958
[GAREKI] Crap.

If you want out...
Give me the bracelet.

27
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,583
Sure thing! It's not mine
to give away, though.

28
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,916
We'll have to get Karoku's
permission first.

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,750
You got a deal.

30
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:59,041
Ugh. This is the
last thing I need.

31
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,750
Are you with Circus?

32
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,416
No. Stupid question.

33
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,333
You're too disheveled.

34
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,708
Fledgling cat burglar,
I presume?

35
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,625
Looks can be deceiving.

36
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,333
Oh, indeed.
Yes, they can.

37
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,166
What?

38
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,416
How about a nice game of tag?

39
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:31,541
Let's see... how far you can
make it before I devour you!

40
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,083

[HIRATO] Forgive me, Tsukumo.

43
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,833
I had my tea without you.

44
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,375
[TSUKUMO] Sir, please!
We're out in the open!

45
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:19,958
Yes, darling, I noticed.
Camouflage is second nature.

46
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,958
You remained unseen though?

47
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,166
Of course.

48
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,791
Excellent. And your report?
Concerning Miné?

49
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,375
It's as we suspected.

50
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,458
Then we'd best make haste.

51
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,583
Damn! Give it up, punk!

52
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:46,875
[MINÉ] Clip, clop, plip, plop,
your knees give way.

53

Chip, chop, slip, slop,

Everything's under control;
the intruder has been cornered!

56
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,166
[MINÉ] No need for watercress;
no need for brie.

57

Uh, Lady Miné.

clock strikes three.

That's better. Always play...
with just enough

61

in your belly to give the
ol' legs a kick start, eh?

62

[GAREKI] What the hell is she?

63
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,708
We're not sure yet, sir.

64
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,666
[MINÉ] Come, don't be dull;
this is tag, not hide-and-seek.

65
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:50,708
The whole point,
darlings... is to run.

66
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,583
[NAI] Um, 'scuse me.

67
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:28,333
That woman...
Where did she go?

68
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:36,083
[GAREKI] Life always boils it
down to one of three choices.

69
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:42,333
Enemy. Obstacle.
Or easy mark.

70
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,208
Mostly.

71
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,958
The name's Gareki.
What do I call you?

72

Oh, Nai!

How do ya like
steerage, Palnedo?

74
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,500
Not exactly first class,
but we do our best.

75
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,541
There's no open bar.
But hey, it is cozy.

76
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,708
What do you intend
to do with us?

77
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:30,833
That's gonna leave a mark.
Damn teenagers.

78
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,125
Oh, my.

79
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:42,166
Hellooo!
Fancy meeting you here!

80
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,541
Just look at me!
No makeup, house in shambles.

81
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,416
[WHISPERY VOICE] If you had
simply done things more quietly,

82

[TSUKUMO] Not good.

00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:18,333
This is grand. We have
been beaten to the punch.

86

Another lead;
another blind alley.

At least we know
she was involved, but...

88
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,708
that only makes the whole
scenario more... regrettable.

89
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:40,208
Talk to me. Yes, but someone
else had the same idea.

90
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,333
A hijacking?

91
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,666
Right under their noses?
Don't worry. We're on it.

92

any time, huh?

Thank you for getting
me out of there.

00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:57,166
So what, you were like her
prisoner or something?

109
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,083
Maybe. I was looking for Karoku.

110
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:05,083
Oh yeah? Suppose you tell me a
lil' something about this guy.

111
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:10,833
He'd been around as long as
I can remember. But then...

112
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:17,375
He went away, and didn't
come back. I got lonely.

113
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,958
He left this weird kind
of trail in the sand.

114
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,833
Little red splashes in a row,
all the way to the ocean.

115
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,250
I followed them and found this.

00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,458
What's with you?
Just say puddles of blood.

117

Look, I hate to tell you this.

118
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,625
But the dude's probably
not comin' back.

119
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,708
Sounds like he got in a scuffle.

120
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,458
His attackers got
the drop on him

121
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,208
and dragged his body out to sea;

122

up their mess.

123

Lady Miné recognized
the bracelet, right?

124
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,125
Said it was from Circus.

125
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,416
Not to say this guy's pal
was with them or anything,

126
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,791
but still... Might
be a connection.

127
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,291
That trinket's gotta be worth
something, even if it's bunk.

128

Either way, I'm in the market

It's in front.

161
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,541
Hey. Damn it!

162
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,916
Don't move! You so much
as twitch an eyelash,

163
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,625
and I'll kill 'em both.

164
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,250
Why not just subdue them, sir?

165
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,833
Note their mannerisms.

166
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,000
We are dealing with
ordinary citizens.

167
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,625
They're outside
of our jurisdiction.

168
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,333
Damn you, old man.
This is your doing!

169
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,833
You've driven us to this!

170
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,541
[PALNEDO]
Basic economics, son.

171
00:15:56,625 --> 00:16:00,166
For the company to stay afloat,
massive layoffs were inevitable.

172
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,833
Call that heartless if you must,

173
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,375
but I will point out that in
your boundless compassion,

174
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,208
you are holding my
granddaughter hostage.

175
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,708
Congratulations.

176
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,041
You shut your friggin' mouth!

177
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,583
This way!

178
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,166
[HIJACKER A] Son of a bitch.

179
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,125
[HIJACKER B]
Who the hell is this?

180
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,666
Hit the deck!

181
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,958
[HIJACKER A] Come out,
you little bastards!

182
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,500
[HIRATO] That's quite
enough. Stop this.

183
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,708
You wish only to
satisfy your anger.

184
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,000
Vain grasping, in the end.

185
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,750
Put that down!

186
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,416
[HIJACKER A] Screw you.

187
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:01,625
There are bombs in every car.
Set to detonate back to front.

188
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:05,666
Unless you hit the brakes,
In which case...

189
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,041
they'll all go off at once.

190
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,958
You're kidding me.

191
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,666
[HIJACKER A] We knew Palnedo
couldn't be reasoned with.

192
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,708
We just want him to burn.

193
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:19,041
So what if we burn, too?
It's poetic justice.

194
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,875
[HIRATO] Tsukumo,
see to their safety.

195
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,208
I'll handle the explosives.

196
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,333
Yes, sir.

197
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,333
Pardon me.
Who are you people?

198
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,000
We're employed by Circus.

199
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:36,833
I am Hirato. Captain of
Airship Two. A pleasure.

200
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,958
Tsukumo. Special combat
personnel. Nice to meet you.

201
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,333
Circus has girls our
age working for them?

202
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,125
I had no idea.
That's awesome.

203
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,750
Yes.

204
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,750
Whoa, what--?

205
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,041
[GAREKI] Wait, is he
actually hearing

206
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,458
the radio signal setting
these things off?

207
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,625
'Nother one.

208
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,166
The noise?

209
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,833
Too much radio interference.

210
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,333
Tsukumo. It appears
as though our best option

211
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:11,000
is to evacuate and
derail the train...

212
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,791
[GAREKI] Is he on something?
What, we're supposed to jump?

213
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,083
No. No, we've got
a better option.

214
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,583
[HIRATO] ...from slowing
down until we've dismounted.

215
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,875
[GAREKI] Hey! Four-eyes!

216
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,583
Beg your pardon?

217
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:29,708
We don't have to jump.
I've got this. You in?

218
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,000
[GAREKI] 'K, Nai. Where's
the sound coming from?

219
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,666
Down there.

220
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,333
Step back, please.

221
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,791
[GAREKI] Jackpot!

222
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,500
Heads up. This puppy's
a signal device.

223
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,166
Check out the circuit board.

224
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,500
Your top-of-the-line ST Corp
radio wave controller.

225
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,708
I'd know one of these
babies anywhere.

226
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,583
No mad bomber would
leave home without one.

227
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,666
Alrighty. This here's
the sensor. Good.

228
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,375
And this is the transmitter.

229
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,416
Son of a bitch.

230
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,000
There's no indication of what
kind of signal range there is.

231
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,291
We're gonna have to
disconnect the rear car.

232
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,125
Pray we get enough distance
before the next signal.

233
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:26,208
[HIRATO] That can be arranged.
Step aside, if you would.

234
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,666
In vacuo.

235
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,333
[NAI] So, where
are we going now?

236
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,916
[GAREKI] Don' know yet.
Somewhere the cops can't get us.

237
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,041
[NAI] Gareki?

238
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,583
[GAREKI] Yeah?

239
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,500
[NAI] Thank you.

240
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,916
[GAREKI] What?

241
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,375
This makes twice
you've saved me.

242
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,500
But, sir...
You're sure about this?

243
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,416
You saw his bracelet.

244
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,041
Naturally.

245
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,833
For now, let it go.

246
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,458
[HIRATO] Mr. Palnedo.

247
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,166
Pardon me. Might I have
a moment of your time?

248
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,875
You must forgive me, good sir.

249
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't mean to appear
uncooperative.

250
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,333
But I'm experiencing
mild chest pains.

251
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,708
Nothing serious, I'm sure.

252
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,125
Oh, dear.

253
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:02,041
One has to watch the ol'
ticker at my age. I'll be fine.

254
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,250
Luckily my personal
physician is on hand.

255
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,125
Now if you'll excuse me.

256
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,916
[HIRATO] Let us know if
there's anything you need, sir.

257
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,041
[URO] The Karasuna issue
has been put to bed.

258
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,250
You haven't been
getting enough rest.

259
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,750
Imagine a hostage not
being able to sleep.

260
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,375
Even if he did arrange
his own capture.

261
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:32,250
Worth it, though:
to see Circus in action.

262
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,083
Everything in moderation, yes?
Time is on our side.

263
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,208
We're at leisure to strike
whenever necessary.

264
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,875
[PALNEDO] Incidentally,
a certain young man

265
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,208
has caught my eye.

266
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,291
An independent concern,
so to speak.

267
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,541
He reminds me of you-know-who.

268
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,833
And I'm not the only
one who thinks so;

269
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:53,333
Circus appears to have taken
an interest in the lad as well.

270
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,791
I'd like him brought in.

271
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,083
Finished!

272
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,708
[HIRATO] Tsukumo.

273
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,125
[TSUKUMO] Are those baked goods?

274
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,708
[HIRATO] Fresh from a
cafe in Karasuna, in fact.

275
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,958
[TSUKUMO] Muffins, scones,
shortbread cookies.

276
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,625
I don't know where to start.

277
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,041
[HIRATO]
These are for Yogi.

278
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,791
[TSUKUMO]
Of course they are.
