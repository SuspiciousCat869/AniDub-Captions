1
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,333
[AZANA] Well, first off, a thank
you's in order for putting up

2
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:48,333
with such a long flight.
Secondly, I'm sad to say

3
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:51,333
the place we're looking
for is a bit of a hike--

4
00:01:53,666 --> 00:02:00,125
[YOGI] But.. We...
Damn you, Captain Hirato!

5
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,666
[HIRATO] Let's talk about
the last show for a moment.

6
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,375
From what I understand, you
rather had your hands full.

7
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,666
[HIRATO "The play's ending
didn't make much sense."

8
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,541
"Nyanperowna was
not very friendly."

9
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,125
These are direct quotes
from a public survey.

10
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,875
[HIRATO] I have
literally dozens.

11
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,500
Don't look so grim.

12
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,958
You kept the show going and
no one was gravely injured.

13
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,250
Far as I'm concerned, that's
a gold star for you both.

14
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,000
[HIRATO] Next up is
Rinole. City of Ice.

15
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,791
I know it sounds bleak.
But it's not a mission.

16
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,541
It's a vacation.

17
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,166
[YOGI] What kind of
cynical, sadistic overlord

18
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,958
calls this a vacation?

19
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,666
[AZANA] Your attention
please, everyone.

20
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,291
I have something for you,
care of Captain Hirato.

21
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,541
[YOGI] Great.
Is it a severed head?

22
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,916
[YOGI] Whatever.

23
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,708
[YOGI] Hang on.
What the...?

24
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,500
[YOGI] Is that a snowman?

25
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,375
[NAI] Snow man?

26
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,041
[TSUKUMO] The Research
Tower engineering team

27
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:28,666
put him together. He's designed
to keep us warm. Called Yukkin.

28
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,208
[YOGI] Yukkin?

29
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,833
[NAI] Yukkin!

30
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,083
[YUKKIN] Yukkin.

31
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:40,958
[YOGI] H... He's adorable.

32
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,416
[YOGI] And toasty!

33
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,708
I take it back, capt'n.
You're not sadistic.

34
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:54,375
An overlord, yes,
but not sadistic.

35
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,916
One day I'll wrap my
head around you!

36
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,500
[GAREKI] Yeah, whatever.

37
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,541
Why do I get the feeling we're
being used as bait again?

38
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,750
[GAREKI] I'm good for more than
dangling on a hook, dammit.

39
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,375
Put me in the game.

40
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,708
I'm the one with the legitimate
vendetta here; I need closure.

41
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,958
You sons of bitches owe me.

42
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,541
[YOGI] Where are my manners?

43
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,958
[YOGI] I'm hogging
all the warmth.

44
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,250
[NAI] He is cold.
He's been blowing his hands.

45
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,500
[GAREKI] Gimme a
break, dude; I'm not five.

46
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,208
Besides, chicks
and kids first.

47
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,833
[TSUKUMO] I'm a year
older than you Gareki,

48
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,416
not some pathetic child.
Please help yourself.

49
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,833
[GAREKI] Look, just give
the damn thing to Nai!

50
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,833
[YOGI] Gareki!

51
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,375
[YOGI] That's not how he's
s'posed to be used...

52
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,416
Alrighty. So. If you need me,
I'll be staying at the inn.

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,458
[NAI] Um, Gareki.

54
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,416
[MAKUNOBE] I am in firm
disagreement as to your letting

55
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,041
this potentially dangerous
creature roam free.

56
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,041
[AKARI] I urge you to keep in
mind that Niji, the species

57
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,125
from which Nai was fashioned,
are unimaginably rare.

58
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,416
Their natural habitat is
complex; too complex to recreate

59
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,916
under lab conditions. None
have survived captivity long.

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,250
[AKARI] They appear to thrive
on the abundant aural stimuli

61
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,541
of their native eco-system.
The absence of these sounds,

62
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,583
along with the stress of
prolonged confinement,

63
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,500
overwhelms their immune
systems. I hypothesize

64
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:29,000
the best course is to
classify Nai as "free-range."

65
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,541
[MAKUNOBE] Kafka nearly
abducted him once;

66
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,458
why make their job easier?

67
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,458
[HIRATO] With all due respect,
the Research Tower

68
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,333
and Circus have very
different plans for Nai.

69
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,708
To them, he is an
irresistible puzzle box

70
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,750
from which technological
riches are to be pried.

71
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,625
To us, though,
he is simply a lure.

72
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,250
A tool for bringing varugas
out of the woodwork.

73
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,541
Unfortunate, but factual.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,625
[HIRATO] What I hope all of
you can understand is that

75
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:59,291
the risk of capture is a basic
function of this important role.

76
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,375
I appreciate your
concern lest the enemy

77
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,833
get their hooks into him,
but should that occur...

78
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,333
I will kill Nai personally.

79
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,541
[AKARI] You cold son of a bitch!

80
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,375
You're not wide of the mark.
I may view Nai only

81
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,416
as a specimen. But unlike
you, who he depends on

82
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,000
to protect him, I don't presume
the right to take his life!

83
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,458
[HIRATO] How noble of you.

84
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,083
[AKARI] Excuse me?

85
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,791
[HIRATO] You stand as a beacon
to life as its own virtue.

86
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,041
And I as the dark inverse
of that sentiment.

87
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,625
We are the mirror
image of one another.

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,375
[AKARI] Insolent bastard!

89
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,666
That smirk is just
begging for a fist!

90
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,875
[TSUKITACHI] Please. C'mon,
girls, you're both pretty.

91
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,291
[AKARI] Nobody asked
you for your two cents!

92
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,250
At least Hirato
tries to be polite!

93
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,250
You're just a
self-satisfied punk!

94
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,583
[TSUKITACHI] Pull in your claws
there, doc, it was a joke.

95
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:03,041
[HIRATO] If you'll
excuse me, Mister Akari.

96
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,416
[TSUKITACHI] Despite
appearances, there's more

97
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,458
humanitarian in him
than you think.

98
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,166
He doesn't want
to take Nai out.

99
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,083
Least not if he
can help it--really.

100
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,500
Think about it.
Read between the lines.

101
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,208
He was just trying to get
the brass off your back

102
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,291
about letting
Nai run around.

103
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,500
You persuaded them
dissecting the little guy

104
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,208
was a bad idea, right?
He's with you:

105
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,458
He wants him alive as much
as you do, if not moreso.

106
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,041
Believe me, he knows how
to deal with these people.

107
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,583
It's a gift.

108
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,583
Hey. You're birds of a feather.
You gotta love how long

109
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,041
it's taking to decrypt that
notebook. Not to mention

110
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,041
how often a certain someone--
you--lays into 'em.

111
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,166
If it comes to it, we've got a
tracking device in his bracelet.

112
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,250
You can rest easy, doc:
Nai's in good hands.

113
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,500
[GAREKI] Let's go.

114
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,208
[YOGI] Yukkin!
Come here, boy!

115
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,666
[YUKKIN] Yuuu!
Yu-kkin! Yu-kkin! Yuuu!

116
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,375
[YOGI] So awesome!

117
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,125
[GAREKI] So ridiculous.

118
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:18,041
[YOGI] Is it just me, or is
the air creepy thick in here?

119
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:25,041
[YOGI] All better. I think.
Team One's already been here.

120
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:29,333
Used to be the country estate
of some Kafka mucky muck.

121
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,166
[GAREKI] What do
they expect us to find?

122
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,791
[TSUKUMO] We're
conducting a finer sweep.

123
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,208
Making sure nothing was
missed the first time around.

124
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,416
Standard procedure.
Keep an eye out

125
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,083
for any documentation
that ties back to Kafka.

126
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,583
[YOGI] Hey, Nai.
You warmed up yet?

127
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,958
[YOGI] Oh, of course you have.
Make you a deal, my friend.

128
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,833
When the blizzard
dies down a little,

129
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:55,875
you can go play in the snow.
How's that sound?

130
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,458
[NAI] Okay!
Snow is fun!

131
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,583
It's all powdery and
squeaks under your feet!

132
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,416
[YOGI] Cool.

133
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
[GAREKI] Yeah, uh, I gotta
admit, it was really...

134
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,583
Really kinda neat, I guess.

135
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,208
[YOGI] It never
occurred to me...

136
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,125
Was this Gareki's first
time seeing snow too?

137
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:20,416
Must've really liked it to let
that comment slip. Adorbs.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,583
[YOGI] Okey-doke!
No stone unturned!

139
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,166
Then our last day here,
we'll play like we mean it!

140
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,416
[NAI] Hooray!

141
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,458
[GAREKI] Well, that was a
complete and utter waste

142
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,750
of company time.

143
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,458
[YOGI] Not really.
We did our job.

144
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,458
If nothing's there,
nothing's there.

145
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,458
[NAI] Where'd Yukkin go?

146
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,166
[YOGI] Huh?

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,625
[YUKKIN] Yukkin.
Yukkin. Yukkin. Yu?

148
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,625
[KIHARU] See, what'd I
tell ya? Ace in the hole.

149
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,333
[KAGIRI] Yeah, but...
what is it, exactly?

150
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:10,250
[YUKKIN]
Yu. Yu. Yukkin.

151
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,916
[YOGI] 'Kay, look. I'll go
back and retrace our steps.

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,375
You all get to the inn.

153
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,208
[GAREKI] Nai. See if you can
pick up the thing's voice.

154
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,083
All this damn snow's
gonna make it hard for us.

155
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,541
It basically muffles everything.

156
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,458
[NAI] Right. Listening!

157
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,708
[TSUKUMO] Come on,
time's running short.

158
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,041
[YOGI] 'Kay.
Right behind you.

159
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,291
[KIHARU] Bro! Check it out!
He's super warm!

160
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,791
I could seriously play
with you for hours!

161
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,583
...yu, yu, yu, yu!
Yu? Yu!

162
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,791
[KAGIRI] Dude. This thing's
from Circus Airship Two.

163
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,708
First I've ever seen one,
so it's gotta be rare.

164
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,333
[KIHARU] Aha.
So they are here.

165
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,125
Woo hoo! Talk about
timing, right?

166
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,875
Another hour and the jig
would've been up!

167
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,875
[KAGIRI] You realize if
we leave anything behind,

168
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,583
Mr. Uro will redecorate that
creepy old mansion's foyer

169
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,041
with our insides.

170
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,916
[KIHARU] What? Then let's
earn those bonuses

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,833
and take Circus out ourselves!

172
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:20,000
[KAGIRI] Lay off the caffeine.
You're a pain in the ass.

173
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,625
But y'know, if it means
I can line my pockets

174
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:27,125
with a few more Circus
artifacts, maybe we should.

175
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,666
Worth a shot.

176
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,666
[NAI] What's that?

177
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,708
[YOGI] Hope the poor
guy didn't fall in.

178
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,291
I should go take a look.

179
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,500
[NAI] Then let me go
down there with you!

180
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,000
[YOGI] Sure, why not?
I can use those ears of yours.

181
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,166
[TSUKUMO] Just be careful.

182
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,083
[YOGI] Granted,
it's dark, but I swear

183
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,083
this place looks manmade.

184
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,083
[YOGI] Yukkin! Hello?

185
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,833
[NAI] I hear
something that way.

186
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,541
[TSUKUMO] Gareki, what--?

187
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,208
[clang]

188
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,625
[Yogi moans]

189
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,041
[YOGI] Sorry. My bad.

190
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,541
Hey, Tsukumo?

191
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,958
You mind keeping watch up there
in case something happens?

192
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,541
[GAREKI] Totally manmade.
Last I checked,

193
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,208
lanterns don't
form by themselves.

194
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,833
[YOGI] Hello.

195
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,125
[GAREKI] I'd say there's
a pretty good chance

196
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,750
we're under the
mansion right now.

197
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,291
[YOGI] Of course.

198
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,041
[YOGI] I think it's
best if you stay here.

199
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,083
No tellin'
what's behind this.

200
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,625
[YOGI] It's a ghost!
Run for your lives!

201
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,625
[GAREKI] Damn it, what
the hell is your problem?

202
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,875
Calm down!
It's a friggin' doll!

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,541
[YOGI] Nai! What are
you doing? Get back!

204
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,291
Nooo!

205
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:52,583
[YOGI] Um, okay.
A nervous box.

206
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,000
[YUKKIN] Yukkin.

207
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,000
[TSUKUMO] Yukkin!

208
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,750
Oh, thank heavens!

209
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:13,125
Where'd you run off to?
You had us worried sick.

210
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,041
[KAGIRI] What I tell ya?
She's Circus to the core.

211
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,250
[KIHARU] Duh. Why else would
she be standin' over the hole?

212
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,083
Or be all lovey
with the snowman?

213
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,458
You don't gotta spell
it out. I'm not an idiot.

214
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,083
[KAGIRI] I beg to differ.

215
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,375
She could've been a civilian,
in which case we'd have broken

216
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,541
Mr. Uro's cardinal rule
about keeping a low profile.

217
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,291
[KIHARU] Dude.
Hold up a sec.

218
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,416
Are we sure that doesn't
apply either way?

219
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,458
[KAGIRI] If we left witnesses.
Which we won't.

220
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,708
[KAGIRI] Dead men tell no tales.
Neither do dead girls.

221
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,875
But they can earn
us brownie points.

222
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,750
[TSUKUMO] How did
he sneak up on me?

223
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,583
That should be
impossible. Unless...

224
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:57,458
[YOGI] Heads up, Tsukumo!
We're coming out!

225
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,875
[KAGIRI] Kiharu!

226
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,041
[KIHARU] Damn,
she wasn't alone!

227
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,333
Yogi!

228
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,708
[YOGI] Everyone okay?
All in one piece?

229
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,583
[GAREKI] We're good.

230
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,416
[NAI] Yeah.

231
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,458
[YOGI] Something's
going on up there.

232
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,541
Tsukumo could be in danger!

233
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,083
[GAREKI] Hold on.

234
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,916
[GAREKI] Hey, there's no
sense in bein' unprepared.

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,708
[YOGI] Wh-Where on Earth
did you get that thing?

236
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,083
[GAREKI] Found it
in the library.

237
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,250
[YOGI] That's, uh, kind of
intense for a souvenir, huh?

238
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,875
[GAREKI] We're going
back to the doll room.

239
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,916
♪

240
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,416

we're here!

241
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,875
[TSUKUMO]
Yogi! How did...?

242
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,083
[YOGI] Sorry, hon; didn't mean
to startle you. We sort of...

243
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,833
Well, Gareki found a few
odds and ends lying around.

244
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,916
Threw together a
makeshift grenade.

245
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,833
[KIHARU] Hey, come on!

246
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,083
[BOTH] Did'ja forget about us?

247
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,166
[GAREKI] Varugas!

00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,375
[NAI] Look out!

249
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,041
[TSUKUMO] Oh, god--Nai!

250
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,208
[KIHARU] Ah! Jackass,
that really hurts!

251
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,958
[GAREKI] Yeah, I know.
Kinda the point.

252
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,625
[KAGIRI] Dude, check
out the primo duds

253
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,250
that emo kid's rockin'!

254
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,000
That's limited edition
Research Tower winter gear!

255
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,250
[YOGI] Tsukumo, quick!
Get Nai out of harm's way!

256
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,500
[KAGIRI] It's one of the only
pieces not in my collection!

257
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,000
[KAGIRI] I must have...!

258
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,708
[YOGI] It's okay, I've
got this. Just be safe.

259
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,291
[YOGI] Nai-bait worked again.

260
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,000
[YOGI] Stay as close to me as
you can. You got that, cowboy?

261
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,041
[GAREKI] Excuse me? Case
you forgot, I have a gun.

262
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,416
And don't call me that!

[YOGI] Ah, damn it, Gareki!
I'm trying to do my job!

That's protecting you!

Which one of us is Circus
and which one of us is not?

266

[YOGI] Case you
forgot, I'm me.

267
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,375
I've got powers?
Besides, even if it wasn't

268
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,500
an issue of work ethics,
you're my friend!

269
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,250
[GAREKI] What? Seriously?
Since when, dude?

270
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,375
[YOGI] You're killin' me here.

271
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,125
[YOGI] Uh... well, like...

272
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:44,625
[YOGI] Smooth move, Yogi.
Way to make things awkward.

273
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,083
Maybe he doesn't reciprocate.

274
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,208
Can't even think of the
last time he used my name.

275
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,875
Oh, god. He despises
me. I knew it.

276
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,750
[GAREKI] Fine.
So you're a badass.

277
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,375
Believe it or not, I can
see that. It's just...

278
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,833
I'm no slouch either.

279
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,375
[YOGI] I...
Sure. My bad.

280
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,750
[GAREKI] You give 'em the biz.
I'll watch your back.

281
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,333
[YOGI] Perfect!

282
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:16,458
Shing! Ba-zing! Behold the epic
manliness of your opponent!

283
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,708
I am Circus operative Yogi!

284
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:24,875
On behalf of Airship Two.
En garde! Do your worst!

285
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,000
[TSUKUMO] Forgive me.
This is all my fault.

286
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,458
[NAI] No, it's not.

287
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:35,750
You put yourself in harm's
way for me. So I owe you one.

288
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:39,750
But from here on out,
we can't risk you getting hurt.

289
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,500
What would we do if
something happened to you?

290
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,750
You scared me back there, Nai.

291
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:51,416
[NAI] I just... I wanna be
strong like Circus. Like you.

292
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,875
[TSUKUMO]
Don't be silly.

293
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,416
Emotionally, you're as
strong as they come.

294
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,375
Look at what you've
been through, Nai.

295
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,166
You never let it get to you.

296
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,125
You're like an oak tree in a
thunderstorm. It's astonishing.

297
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,583
[TSUKUMO] You inspire me.
And I'm not the only one.

298
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:11,125
Think about your
friend, Karoku.

299
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,875
For us. Promise
you'll stay safe.

00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,500
For the record, it sucks that
I can't scratch his damn coat.

301
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,375
I can't get into my groove!

302
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,166
Can't we just leave these guys
and focus on the runaways?

303
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,083
[KAGIRI] Forget Miss Priss
and the kewpie doll!

304
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,541
We got way bigger
fish to fillet!

305
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:38,208
These two are the jackpot!
Focus on them!

306
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,750
[YOGI] Wait a second.
So they're not after Nai?

307
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,958
[GAREKI] Hey. The guy you
answer to. What's he like?

308
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,416
[BOTH] Eh?

309
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,458
[GAREKI] I want details on
who's pullin' your strings.

310
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:54,250
[YOGI] I'm an idiot.
Of course he hates me.

311
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,458
Who wouldn't in his shoes?

312
00:19:56,541 --> 00:20:00,208
I mean, I just stood by and
let his friend get killed.

313
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,166
[KIHARU] I'm guessing he
probably means Mr. Uro.

314
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,916
Speaking of which, he's gonna
kick our asses over this one.

315
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I've got it!
Let's go berserk!

316
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,791
[KAGIRI] Eh, fine. It's a
royal pain, but whatever.

317
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,625
[KAGIRI] No more
holdin' back, huh?

318
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,458
[KIHARU] We'll show
'em how it's done!

319
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,041
[KAGIRI] Final Dungeon.
Boss Fight!

320
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,958
[KAGIRI] Here's the haps: a
signal on a special frequency

321
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,083
just played havoc on
your optic nerves.

322
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,250
In laymen's terms, you've
been blinded by the light.

323
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,833
[KIHARU] Hidey-ho,
pretty boy!

324
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,583
[YOGI] Ugh. Gareki!
Lemme hear your voice!

325
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,625
[GAREKI] Where...?

326
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,458
[KAGIRI] Sorry!
That's cheating!

327
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,166
[YOGI] Gareki!
Where are...?

328
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,916
[KIHARU] Really? Dude, I was
so expecting more from you.

329
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,208
[YOGI]
Ga... re... ki.

330
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,291
[GAREKI] C'mon, focus!

331
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,041
[KIHARU] Uh...

332
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:40,458
[Yogi laughs]

333
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:45,041
Let's spice things up a bit,
huh? Have some real fun.

334
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,666
[YOGI] Laughter may
be the best medicine.

335
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,166
But screaming's a close second.

336
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,416
[Yogi screams]

337
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,708
[GAREKI] Yogi!

338
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,958
[KIICHI] Oh, darling,
I can't believe

339
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,000
they've packed you
off to Rinole!

340
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,416
[TSUKUMO] It's
perfectly routine.

341
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,750
[KIICHI] Promise not to
forget me while you're away!

342
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,625
[TSUKUMO] I won't be gone
for long. You'll be fine.

343
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,291
[KIICHI] Fine?
I'm absolutely distraught!

344
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,500
[TSUKUMO]
Yeah. You'll live.
