1
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,041
[NAI] Jiki.

2
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,666
[NAI] Over there.
The rainbow.

3
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,750
That's where we should be.

4
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,333
[NAI] It's him! Please!

5
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,041
[JIKI] Is that right?

6
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:44,291
[JIKI] We'd be fools not
to assume it's a trap.

7
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,875
[JIKI] What the hell?

8
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,125
[JIKI] Ah, the cavalry.

9
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,708
At least now I know
we're on to something.

10
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,000
[YOGI] Gareki!

11
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,416
[YOGI] Dorn Kiste!

12
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,958
[YOGI] This is
too much for you.

13
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,250
[YOGI] The sooner I get you
back to the ship, the better.

14
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,750
[GAREKI] Level with me.
You going in?

15
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,166
[YOGI] Yeah.
The rainbow's our--

16
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,500
[GAREKI] Look, I know
I'm out of my depth.

17
00:01:55,583 --> 00:02:00,250
I mean, you people.
Your skills are...

18
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:07,166
It's like... It's like I'm...
Like I'm nothin'.

19
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:18,333
[GAREKI] Still.
I wanna help. Just to...

20
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,958
[YOGI] What?

21
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,208
Hey--wait!
You're telling me--?

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,583
Oh, dear.

23
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:35,583
Look at you.
I would be honored.

24
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,750
Hey, we need all the
help we can get, right?

25
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,541
Come on, buckaroo!
Let's kick some tail!

26
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,500
[AKARI] Damn you,
Azana! Snap out of it!

27
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,583
Listen to yourself; you're
rambling like a madman!

28
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,375
[AZANA] Oh, it makes perfect
sense. Look at Murano:

29
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,875
His whole life was about
protecting lesser creatures.

30
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,625
And even he had to make
a deal with the devil.

31
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,208
[AKARI] It was you, wasn't it?

32
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,541
The one who's been using my good
name to peddle the varuga drug.

33
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,875
[AZANA] It was the best
way to operate, doc.

34
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,541
Your name's got a lot
of weight behind it.

35
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,250
Please understand,
I don't want to hurt you.

36
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,916
Just come with me and
everything'll work out.

37
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,750
[AKARI] Hirato?

38
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,500
[AZANA] Dammit.
You'll never know, Doc.

39
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,583
How much I've looked up
to you and respected you.

40
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:39,375
Always so good. So honest.
So... So everything I'm not!

41
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,083
I hate crawling in
your stupid shadow!

42
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,500
I could never measure up;
never even approach

43
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,250
how perfect you are!
I hate you!

44
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,708
[HIRATO] Treason is
very serious, young man.

45
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:55,000
The position you're in is dire.
More than I think you know.

46
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,791
By law, I'm authorized to
execute you on the spot.

47
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,583
[AKARI]
No, Hirato! Don't!

48
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,083
[AKARI] Azana! Wait!

49
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:15,791
[HIRATO] We've known about him
for some time. My apologies.

50
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,833
[HIRATO] Now that
he's exposed himself,

51
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,875
he'll have Ikami to deal with.

52
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,375
[AKARI] That poor kid.

53
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:04,208
[KAGIRI] Hey, hey!
Final Dungeon. Boss Fight!

54
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,708
[KIICHI] Come on! I was holding
my own, sir. Thanks a lot!

55
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,666
[TSUKITACHI] Nicely done,
sweetheart. I'm proud of you.

56
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,250
[Uro laughs]

57
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,000
[URO] Ill-advised.

58
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,250
[URO] Keeping the powers of your
banshees in check in an attempt

59
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,291
to preserve your target opens
a window of opportunity.

60
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,000
They're holding back.
Which is fortunate;

61
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,166
their full strength wouldn't
leave sufficient room

62
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,750
for a loop hole.
Not by a long shot.

63
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,125
But because of the restraint--
the delicate balance

64
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,166
they have to maintain
not to kill me--

65
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,125
luck was on my side, you see.

66
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:10,375
I had just enough space
to call up an old friend.

67
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,333
[IVA] Bear down!

68
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,208
[URO] Too late!

69
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,625
[URO] The balance
has now shifted!

70
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,291
You really ought to have known
better than to come at me

71
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,166
with these pale imps. Either
your captain is an imbecile,

72
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,291
or you're being used
as sacrificial pawns.

73
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,750
"Somewhere over the
rainbow," eh, ladies?

74
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:44,416
Circus is drawn to it
like moths to a flame.

75
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,708
Fathoms easier than
divide and conquer.

76
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,625
Nice chatting with you.

77
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,666
[IVA] Don't count
your chickens yet.

78
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,416
[JIKI] Stupid things!

79
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:13,250
[JIKI] Yogi. What the
hell was that about?

80
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,583
[YOGI] Didn't you just hear
that? That snap? Oh, man.

81
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,166
[NAI] Yes!
You're both alive!

82
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,583
[GAREKI] Sup.

83
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,291
[YOGI] Aw, little buddy.

84
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,958
I bet you were scared
out of your mind.

85
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:27,041
[JIKI] Reunion's over guys.
Stay on your guard.

86
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,416
Rainbow. Dead ahead.

87
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,541
[NAI] It's Karoku.

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,625
You look tired, darlings.
Let mother sing you a lullaby.

89
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,416
The light behind the
door's not for your kind.

90
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,875
Oh, no; you, my tragic
poppets, are for the dark.

91
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,791
[JIKI] We're running
out of time.

92
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,041
[YOGI] No! Wait!

93
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,125
[JIKI] Go, I'll stay
and hold her off!

94
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,666
[YOGI] Yeah, good plan!

95
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,625
[YOGI] Almost there.

96
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,125
[NAI] Yogi!

97
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,375
[YOGI] Dorn Kiste!

98
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,833
[YOGI] Iva!

99
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,541
[NAI] Tsukumo!

100
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,625
[GAREKI] Stop draggin'
your feet, dumbass!

101
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,375
[GAREKI] We can make it.
We can make it!

102
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,833
[KAROKU] Follow the sound
of the gently whispering air.

103
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:34,958
Find the source. The center
of the maze is waiting.

104
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:40,583
Like a seashell, from whence the
breath of the ocean sings.

105
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:46,625
Find the empty heart. Embrace
it. Be ready for miracles.

106
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,541
[YOGI] Give me the key!

107
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:57,916
This is no joke! Do it now!
Or I'll lop your damn head off!

108
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,208
[URO] Oh, the
naivety of youth.

109
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:10,583
As if all the answers lay in
wait behind a single door.

110
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:14,958
It's not so simple.
The door's a mystery to us all.

111
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,583
You're stalling!

112
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,375
[KAROKU] Welcome.

113
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,916
[NAI] Ka... Karoku.

114
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,916
[NAI] Karoku!

115
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,791
[KAROKU] Hey.

116
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:10,000
[NAI] You're... You're alive!
Oh, no. You're hurt.

117
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,791
[GAREKI] Huh.
So that's him.

118
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,166
[GAREKI]
Wait. Where are we?

119
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,000
[GAREKI] Nai, wake up.
The hell's that by your feet?

120
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,833
Stop ignoring it!

121
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,416
[GAREKI] I'm frozen
to the spot!

122
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,666
[NAI] So. Question. Can
Gareki have your bracelet?

123
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:39,708
[GAREKI] Can't speak.
Gotta try. Come on!

124
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:45,166
[GAREKI] Nai! Snap out of it!
Look at the ground!

125
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,708
[NAI] Wha--?

126
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,500
[NAI] Karoku? Karoku!

127
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,041
[GAREKI]
What? But how?

128
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,291
[NAI] He's...
He's covered with red.

129
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,166
[KAROKU] I was trying to let
the poor guy have one last look

130
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,416
at you. I'm afraid it's
me you've been hearing

131
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,291
in your head these past few
weeks. I was using his voice.

132
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:12,500
He was overjoyed to know you
were coming. Believe me.

133
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,708
Thing is, he was
actually meant to end up

134
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:19,458
somewhere a lot emptier--
a lot less warm--than here.

135
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,666
He spoke of his little Nai
all the time. I can't tell you

136
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,500
how glad I am to put a
face with all the stories.

137
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,791
I know. It's difficult to
accept me as anyone but him.

138
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,000
He is a part of
me now, though.

139
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,625
In a way, I'm more
him than he is.

140
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,791
We get rid of clothes
we've outgrown, right?

141
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:44,041
No big deal. It's much
the same principle.

142
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,500
Don't be scared, Nai.

143
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,541
Take my hand. Please.

144
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,125
I'm so proud of you
for making it here.

145
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,833
It's important you understand:
This side is where you belong.

146
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,833
[GAREKI] Damn it!
Move your hand!

147
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:02,041
[KAROKU] Time to say
goodbye to Gareki.

148
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,458
It's a shame we can't keep
them forever, isn't it?

149
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,333
[NAI] Uh-uh. It's wrong.

150
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,750
[KAROKU] Come on.
Don't be so stubborn.

151
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,958
If it'll help you let go,
I can always shatter him.

152
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,166
[NAI] No, don't!

153
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,791
[GAREKI] Hey, psycho!

154
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,125
[GAREKI] His pulse is weak.

155
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,833
[KAROKU] You leave
me no choice.

156
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,916
If you're not quite done
having fun, I can always wait.

157
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,291
Patience is one of my
virtues. Be seeing you.

158
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:00,291
[KAROKU] Play as long as
you like, Nai. I'll be here.

159
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,833
[MAKUNOBE] You launched a
raid without authorization?

160
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,166
Do you realize how much
trouble you've caused?

161
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,166
This infantile stunt has set us
back months--possibly years!

162
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,250
[HIRATO] I understand, sir.
And I take full responsibility.

163
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,541
My humblest apologies.

164
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,708
[TSUKITACHI]
Don't buy his baloney;

165
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,041
he couldn't have
pulled this off alone

166
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,250
if he'd wanted to. I share
as much of the blame.

167
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,208
Before you dish out punishment,
though, look at what we've done.

168
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,500
[MAKUNOBE] You stand there
with a straight face and argue

169
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,625
the ends justify the means?
The primary target

170
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,666
eluded you completely!
Not only is Palnedo free,

171
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,416
he's now claiming that Uro
acted without his knowledge!

172
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,791
So in the court of public
opinion, the old man's

173
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,125
the victim! Somehow Uro
slipped through your fingers!

174
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,458
And if that weren't bad enough,

175
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,333
Azana, the mole,
is also now at large!

176
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,833
[ISHLAR] And what
of the rescue?

177
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,791
Has this Karoku fellow shed
any light on the situation?

178
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,958
[HIRATO] He is
receiving treatment,

179
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,916
but is still unconscious.

180
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,583
Dr. Akari can offer no prognosis
as yet. He suspects, however,

181
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,541
that it will be some time
before the boy can speak.

182
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,375
[NAI] Karoku.

183
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,625
[TSUKUMO] C'mon, Nai.

184
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,666
We should be getting back
to the ship. He'll understand.

185
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,875
[GAREKI] Son of a...!

186
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,250
Look, I know there's a test,
that you gotta come

187
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,416
from good stock.
Not what I'm askin'.

188
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,875
There has to be some
kind of exception!

189
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,250
[HIRATO] Well,
there is the academy.

190
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,416
Bear in mind, we're
talking years of study.

191
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:42,958
[GAREKI] Listen. I despise
varugas. An' Kafka can suck it.

192
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,291
If it weren't for them, my
friends would still be alive.

193
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,000
I'd have something
resembling a family.

194
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,833
I won't sit back and let that
happen to someone else.

195
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:55,000
It eats away at me; it burns.

196
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:05,333
[GAREKI] Ah, whatever. I guess
I just got used to being here.

197
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,625
Being a part of something
bigger than myself.

198
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,833
Course, I say that,
but the truth is I've felt

199
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:15,916
like a third wheel
from day one. I hate it.

200
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,208
I just... I just wanted to
earn my stripes with you guys.

201
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,625
It's the least I
could do, right?

202
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:28,000
I mean, I dunno. You guys...
You guys are like...

203
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,458
Oh, to hell with it! Find a way
for me to join Circus, please!

204
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,750
That's what I thought. I've
been listening very intently.

205
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,708
I've been through all the books
'n crap. But there's nothin'

206
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:42,291
in there 'bout how to join if
you're not on the register.

207
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,458
[HIRATO] It's all right.

208
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:49,625
Sneaking your name on there
is easy enough. I'd be happy to.

209
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,750
I'm the one who got you
into this; it's only fair

210
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:56,041
I take it one step further.
That's as far as I'll go.

211
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,916
Beyond that, it's on you.
Best of luck.

212
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,958
[HIRATO] I'll be
waiting eagerly to see

213
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:07,458
if you conquer the Academy
in season to rejoin us.

214
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,500
[GAREKI] No worries.
I got this!

215
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,291
[GAREKI] The hell'd he go?

216
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,458
[YOGI] He had a heart-to-heart
with the captain.

217
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,375
That night, before the big raid.

218
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,666
[YUKKIN] Yukkin.

219
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,625
[NAI] Not gonna lie.
I don't like this one bit.

220
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,375
I want things to
stay as they are.

221
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,916
[TSUKUMO] Oh, Nai. Yogi?

222
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,583
[YOGI] I know he chose
this path for himself,

223
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:48,791
so I should support him,
but... It's just...

224
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,208
The whole idea of him being
a child of Airship Two...

225
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,958
I dunno. Bothers me.

226
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,541
We don't exist. I mean,
we do technically,

227
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,583
but as far as the rest of
the world's concerned.

228
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,708
You join Circus and that's it.

229
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,875
They edit your records so it's
like you never drew breath.

230
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,291
In theory, it's to
protect your family--

231
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,583
keep them from being something
the enemy can use against you.

232
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,958
An Airship's the only home
we ever know after that.

233
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,666
Sure, we meet
tons of nice people

234
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:25,708
when we're doing shows
and all. But it's so brief.

235
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,583
When you and Gareki came to
stay with us, I was so happy.

236
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,791
For once it felt like we
actually got to make friends.

237
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,166
It was awesome.

238
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,291
Like a breath of fresh air;
like a mountain sunrise.

239
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,541
It was just so...

240
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,958
I dunno. I'm just conflicted.

241
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,583
There's so much for
Gareki on the outside.

242
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:50,125
All sorts of people for him
to meet and make friends with.

243
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,666
Tons.

244
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,041
[NAI &amp; YOGI] Gareki!

245
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,041
[GAREKI] Oh, hey.

246
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,166
[YOGI] We're just
here... uh... to say.

247
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,583
[NAI] Gareki.

248
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:39,125
[TSUKUMO] Come on, guys.
He needs you both to be strong.

249
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,791
[YOGI] Gareki.
Promise you'll cry

250
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,125
on Nyanperowna's shoulder
whenever you get lonely!

251
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,333
[GAREKI] When are you gonna get
that I'm not five years old?

252
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,875
[TSUKUMO] I'd like
to say something.

253
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,416
[GAREKI] Yeah?

254
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,958
[TSUKUMO] Forgive me. I'm rather
bad at this kind of thing.

255
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,833
And I'm not much better
as a seamstress.

256
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,166
But Nai and I wanted you
to have this. We made it.

257
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,875
[GAREKI] Jeez.
This is a train wreck.

258
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,583
[GAREKI] Cool, thanks.

259
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,791
[NAI] Here. This, too.

260
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,541
[GAREKI] So, your guy's still
sleeping or whatever, right?

261
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,583
[NAI] Mm hmm.

262
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,875
[GAREKI] Best wait, then.

263
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,541
Not really yours to
give till he says.

264
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,666
Ask him when he comes out of it.

265
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,708
[NAI] Yeah. All right. I'll keep
trying to get through to him.

266
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,375
[NAI &amp; YOGI] Gareki!

267
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,375
[YOGI] This sucks!
I don't wanna say goodbye!

268
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,166
What if this is the last
time we see each other?

269
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,750
[TSUKUMO] Both of you; stop!

270
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,833
[YOGI] I can't help it! We've
been through so much together!

271
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,375
[GAREKI] Hey.
Gimme some credit.

272
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,875
You act like I'm gonna
flunk out of the Academy.

273
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:55,875
Where do you think I'm putting
in for once I ace it? Dumbasses.

274
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,125
Or do you not want
me coming back?

275
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:03,250
[YOGI] Wait... You think
we think... I'm lost.

276
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,625
[GAREKI] Does Four Eyes not
tell you people anything?

277
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:10,291
[TSUKUMO] Hirato.
He knew all along.

278
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,625
[NAI &amp; YOGI] What?

279
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:16,458
You do know what a manipulative
fink you are, right?

280
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,625
[Hirato laughs]

281
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,833
[JIKI] It's because he survived
that shipwreck, isn't it?

282
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,166
That's what this whole
thing has been about.

283
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,958
[KIICHI] What do you mean?

284
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,416
[JIKI] Kafka's
experimental freighter.

285
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,875
[KIICHI] Oh, yeah.

286
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,666
[HIRATO] Everything happens
for a reason, my friends.

287
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,416
The shipwreck.

288
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,416
Nai and Gareki's paths crossing
and intersecting with our own.

289
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,666
[TSUKITACHI] Does seem
rather miraculous. I guess.

290
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,041
[HIRATO] Ha. Lives dovetail
in mysterious ways.

291
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,041
[HIRATO] Take Nai,
for example.

292
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:54,250
Who'd believe he's the glue that
holds all of this together?

293
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,958
[GAREKI] See ya.

294
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,583
[GAREKI] Now what?

295
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,208
[NAI] You're warm.
I just had to check.

296
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,750
[GAREKI] What?

297
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,500
[GAREKI] Knock. It. Off!!
