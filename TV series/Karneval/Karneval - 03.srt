1
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,500
[TSUKUMO] Gareki.

2
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,500
Gareki.

3
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,875
You can go in and check
on him, if you like.

4
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,250
[YOGI] Tell me straight, doc!
Nai is gonna be ok, right?

5
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,541
Right? I mean,
there's gotta be...

6
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,916
Incoming. Duck.

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,875
[HEALER] Stop blabbering!

8
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,791
Ahhh! Owwww.

9
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,625
My patient needs
a little rest, by god!

10
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,041
[HEALER] Physically, he's
ship-shape.

11
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,833
His brain wave
patterns, however,

12
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,750
show several irregularities
before he went under.

13
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,500
He ought to be sent
to the Research Tower

14
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,625
for more in-depth analysis.

15
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:35,625
I see. Well, then.
There's not a moment to waste.

16
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,666
Please excuse us.

17
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,000
Do me a favor and take the clown
in the hall with you, please.

18
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,541
[HIRATO] You don't wish
to use him for testing?

19
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:48,000
Healer. Any idea when
he might wake up?

20
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,416
I failed to protect him.
I was responsible.

21
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,041
He'll be fine, my dear. Try not
to worry too much about it.

22
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:04,083
That said, he isn't the
only one who needs rest.

23
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,500
You shoulder more than your
fair share of the burden.

24
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,041
It's not healthy.

25
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,541
I'm going back. Please.
Look after Nai for me.

26
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,333
[HEALER] Hmm?

27
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,875
So even after all his pain,
you didn't find a thing.

28
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,166
What're you?
Some incompetent quack?

29
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,500
Least I'm not
an insolent prick.

30
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,166
Your friend is in good hands.

31
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,541
I was just helping
the dumb brat out.

32
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,541
I don't have time for friends.

33
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,291
You know, a wiser man
than me once said...

34
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,291
"You can pick your friends
and you can pick your nose,

35
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,416
but you can't pick
your friend's nose."

36
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,750
[GAREKI] Where you
goin', beardy?

37
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,000
[HEALER] I need a
late-night snack-a-roo.

38
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,208
Keep an eye on
our patient for me.

39
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,000
[GAREKI] Wait! What?

40
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:01,666
[KAROKU] Nai. Try to
focus on my voice.

41
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,708
Something's distracting
you. I can tell.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,791
[NAI] Karoku?
Where are you?

43
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,583
[KAROKU] There's someone new.

44
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,291
[NAI] Well, yeah.

45
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,666
[KAROKU] How 'bout that?
You've made a friend.

46
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,208
Good on you for
being resourceful.

47
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,708
But... It's time to
part ways with him.

48
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,833
But we... just met.

49
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,750
[KAROKU] Think of the storm
cloud on your tail, son.

50
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:42,333
Best to send the new guy
packin'. You know this.

51
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,750
Yeah, but... he saved me.

52
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:50,916
Trouble is drawn to you, Nai.
Be a true friend.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,125
Save him from yourself.

54
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,500
Unless you want him to break.

55
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,750
[NAI] Ga--

56
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,708
That was weird.

57
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,375
Knock it off.
I'm here. You're safe.

58
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:17,000
If you need something,
just ask. Within reason...

59
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,166
I...

60
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,291
[KAROKU] Unless you
want him to break.

61
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,125
[NAI] Go away, Gareki.

62
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,125
What?

63
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,458
You have to.

64
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,791
So... That's it, then.

65
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,583
I'm afraid... that you'll...

66
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:42,166
I'll what?
Save you a third time?

67
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,583
[NAI] Wait.

68
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,791
Gareki!

69
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,875
Oh, c'mon. Seriously?

70
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:59,041
You give me the bracelet
and I buzz off?

71
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,916
Oh, I see. Don't need me
if Circus has your back.

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,875
Pretending to be helpless
to get what you want?

73
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,916
Pretty damn low, man.

74
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,875
Yeah. I forgot
he's a lot stronger

75
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,000
than your average
wrinkly old grumpy Gus.

76
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,833
Hey! Gareki!

77
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,125
Do me a solid.

78
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,166
Go tell the bearded freak
his patient's awake.

79
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,541
No problemo.
Just, uh... Calm down.

80
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,583
We cool?

81
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,291
Where you goin'?
Something I said?

82
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:09,875
Aw, c'mon. Don't cry.
I'm not sure how to handle this.

83
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,708
Tsukomo, help?

84
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,875
[SHEEP] Out of bounds!
Out of bounds! Out of bounds!...

85
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:18,000
[TSUKUMO] Yogi?
What's wrong? Hello? Yogi?

86
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,000
[HIRATO] Understood. I shall
leave it in your capable hands.

87
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,666
Sorry. Won't find any
"late-night snack-a-roos" here.

88
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,916
[HEALER] It's about
that child's body.

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,958
You mean our mysterious ward?
Is he not on the mend?

90
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,416
Well, now. It's rather
difficult to explain.

91
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,541
For one, the boy's not human.
He's an animal.

92
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,833
Uh, doubtless
you're concerned...

93
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,125
[Hirato laughs]

94
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,458
[HIRATO] Pretty tasteless
joke. Even for you.

95
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,916
I can hear you!

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,666
Now pay attention; I don't
like repeating myself.

97
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,916
This is the child's true form!

98
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:06,875
What?

99
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,416
No way.

100
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,166
I analyzed his cellular
tissue thoroughly before

101
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,125
making my conclusion.
Our friend's a Niji.

102
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,166
Indigenous to the
Rainbow Forest.

103
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,000
A uniquely beautiful
and secluded ecosystem.

104
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,875
Home to a variety
of rare species.

105
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,125
How odd.

106
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,583
Wait a second. This...
is making my brain hurt.

107
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,583
Does not compute.

108
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,666
[GAREKI] So the wrinkled
windbag thinks Nai's

109
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,416
an endangered species?
That's a bit hard to swallow.

110
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,791
The hell's he on?

111
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,083
I know there are
monsters in human form.

112
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,958
Spent enough time around
Circus to learn that.

113
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:49,250
And sure, Nai's behavior's
always been... odd.

114
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,583
But seriously. A furball?

115
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,458
The name's Gareki.
What do I call you?

116
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,000
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] Nai!

117
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,500
[NAI] Thank you.

118
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,916
[GAREKI] What?

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,083
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] This makes
twice you've saved me!

120
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,875
Go away, Gareki!

121
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,458
[GAREKI] Now I come off
looking like a total ass-clown!

122
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,833
[HIRATO] I've informed the
Research Tower of the situation.

123
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,166
You'll be their escort tomorrow.

124
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,666
That means seeing Doctor Akari.

125
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,875
So. What's the deal
with Nai's bracelet?

126
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,708
Are you letting him keep it?

127
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,291
I was waiting to see
if it reacted to him.

128
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,708
Eh? But our bracelets
are isometric.

129
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,875
Nai's doesn't even
really belong to him.

130
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,458
Said it was some
guy's... Karoku.

131
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,625
[HIRATO] He might
well have been lying.

132
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,500
I don't think so.

133
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,666
[HIRATO] There is
the possibility

134
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,333
he's an agent of Kafka.

135
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:51,041
Well. Honestly, I was shocked
by the Healer's findings.

136
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,250
But I know a good kid
when I see one!

137
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,000
Wha... You're teasing
me, aren't you?

138
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:01,500
Hardly. You're still
his escort tomorrow.

139
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,875
You don't really
respect me much, huh?

140
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,291
Don't be sensitive.

141
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,458
I'm suspicious, yes.
But that's my job.

142
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,291
[GAREKI] Have a seat.

143
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,416
[GAREKI] Stay cool. You're
just dealing with some brat.

144
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,250
No. He's an animal.

145
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,750
He may look human.
But he's not.

146
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,541
He's a modified furball that
made me look like a jackass.

147
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,291
It's not even worth
getting angry about.

148
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,791
I mean, I save
your worthless ass,

149
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,583
then you tell me to get lost?

150
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,333
Do I scare you?

151
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,333
Not you!

152
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,625
Huh?

153
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm scared of what Karoku
told me. That you'll break.

154
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:56,125
Karoku? Fine, I'm
all ears. Go ahead.

155
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,541
[NAI] Karoku said
you'd get caught up

156
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,875
in the trouble that
happens around me.

157
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:04,125
That if I didn't make you
leave... You would break.

158
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,083
You'd be safer if I told
you I didn't need you.

159
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,375
Weird, considering he's MIA.

160
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,875
How the hell'd he
tell you all this?

161
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,375
He speaks. When I sleep.

162
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,583
[GAREKI] Great. So he
dreamt their conversation.

163
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,791
What a nut-job.

164
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:25,041
[NAI] That if I didn't make
you leave... You would break.

165
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,833
You'd be safer if I told
you I didn't need you.

166
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,625
[GAREKI] I don't
believe this kid.

167
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:34,833
I save him time after time,
and he's worried about me?

168
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,916
Lemme ask you again.
Who is this Karoku to you?

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,625
He's been around as
long as I could remem--

170
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,291
[GAREKI]
Yeah, I got that.

171
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,625
Move on. How long
are we talkin' about?

172
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,041
[NAI] Forever.

173
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,125
I need more than that.

174
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,041
[GAREKI] Does he not know?

175
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,375
Okay, so...
You tell him about me?

176
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,541
He know who I am?

177
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,708
I told him you saved me.

178
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,125
[GAREKI] Is that it?
Then why would Karoku

179
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,750
try to send me away?
He's his friend, right?

180
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,541
Is he being malicious,
or is it jealousy?

181
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,250
Besides, if they
can chat like this,

182
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:18,000
how'd Nai end up on his own?
And how exactly do they speak?

183
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,125
If that's in his bag of tricks,
this Karoku guy

184
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,791
seems like a pretty
twisted S.O.B.

185
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,416
Yeah. It's official.
My image of this dude

186
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,375
is now completely changed.
He's an enigma.

187
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,916
Though I'm curious why he's
trying to pick a fight with me.

188
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,250
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,583
I'm sorry too.
Don't sweat it.

190
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,000
Just a misunderstanding.

191
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,708
I don't think you're
"low," or anything.

192
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,916
Uh... Besides--where's the
fun in playing safe, right?

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,333
I don't break all
that easy, you know.

194
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,541
[HIRATO] We'll conduct a
more thorough examination

195
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,500
once we arrive at the RT.

196
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,750
Guess it isn't exactly
human experimentation.

197
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,875
Still, you better
handle him nice.

198
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,916
The Healer will be present.

199
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,500
If you become concerned,
ask him for assistance.

200
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,750
[YOGI] Yeah, that's
s'posed to be a comfort?

201
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,125
Yogi.
Be vigilant out there.

202
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,541
I will. But...

203
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,458
What are you and
Tsukumo doing, sir?

204
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:40,250
[KIICHI] Summoned to
the Round Table of Z?

205
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,041
Wouldn't it have been
easier to take him

206
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,541
to the Research Tower
in the first place?

207
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,750
[JIKI] They're wise to
play it conservatively.

208
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,041
Until they learn more
about the bracelet's owner.

209
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,708
[KIICHI] Ugh. That is so boring.

210
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,083
[Tsukitachi yawns]

211
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,000
[TSUKITACHI] Five more minutes.

212
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:00,083
And away we go!

213
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,875
[YOGI] Yahoo!

214
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:11,458
Oh. Tsukumo, dear!
It has been far too long.

215
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,083
You haven't put
on weight, have you?

216
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,375
Now, now.

217
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,916
[TSUKITACHI] Yeah, sorry.
We still haven't found

218
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,875
any hard evidence on
corporations suspected

219
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,791
of working as fronts for Kafka.

220
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,750
Although, there has
been a sizable increase

221
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,333
in varuga activity
as of late.

222
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,625
[BYZANTE] By hook or by
crook, Kafka's gotten hold

223
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,166
of our banned
evolutionary research.

224
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,458
This, despite it
being classified.

225
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,000
[TOKITATSU] The mistakes
of our former brethren

226
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,375
have endangered countless
innocent lives.

227
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,541
Now, Captain.
Regarding this boy, Nai.

228
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,000
The Healer's report has
piqued our interest.

229
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,666
[HEALER]
The lab results indicate

230
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,333
no physical abnormalities
to speak of.

231
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,833
Other than your personality,
all is well.

232
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,583
Ha, ha. I'm taking
this crap off.

233
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,208
[HEALER] I appreciate
you putting up with

234
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,291
all this poking and prodding.
Now if we can find Yogi,

235
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,916
I think it's best for you
to have a little lie-down.

236
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,750
[GAREKI] Huh. I haven't seen
him since we landed, actually.

237
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,458
Please tell me it's
just the three of them.

238
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,625
Really no point running into--

239
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,625
Lose something?

240
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,666
Yah! Hey there, Dr. Akari.

241
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,750
[AKARI] I hope for your
sake you're putting on

242
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,208
a fresh patch every morning.

243
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,458
Allergies are nothing
to sneeze at.

244
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,750
Sure...

245
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,083
[AKARI] If you're neglectful
of this treatment,

246
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,000
we may have to resort
to a more painful remedy.

247
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:36,333
I, um... I'll go
change it right now!

248
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,333
This kind of reminds me of home.

249
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,708
That a fact?

250
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,250
Look.

251
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,958
Was it this green
where you came from?

252
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:04,125
It was a sinkhole.
Nothing green about it.

253
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:12,333
Living there was hard.
Always scraping to get by.

254
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,166
I left there,
but it followed me.

255
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:20,833
What was done to her.
I can't forget.

256
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,541
Y'know, since meeting you,

257
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,375
I've seen a lot that's
knocked me on my ass.

258
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,916
And honestly, I can't
take much more.

259
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,208
I don't wanna start
thinkin' life is...

260
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:34,833
Well, that it has a point.
I don't deserve to believe that.

261
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:41,458
What if... What if deep down
I never really wanted to leave?

262
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,333
What if Nai's just
a distraction?

263
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,750
A relief from the guilt?
From the memory of her...

264
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,000
[NAI] Gareki.

265
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,333
If it has a point,
that makes it beautiful.

266
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,583
If you can see it, that
means you're beautiful!

267
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,208
Was it something I said?

268
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,625
[GAREKI] Beautiful?
Are you kidding me?

269
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,750
I've got
thousand-yard-stare eyes.

270
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,916
They don't see a damn thing!

271
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,291
[TSUBAME] Gareki. Help me.

272
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,083
[AKARI] His genetic
sequence closely resembles

273
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,458
the formative pattern
of the varugas.

274
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,791
But that's not
the interesting part.

275
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,541
There's far more to it.

276
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,875
Nai is essentially
a new species.

277
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,458
Whoever's responsible
for creating him

278
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,833
can be described
in one word. Genius.

279
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,708
[MAKUNOBE] We must
know all the details.

280
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,500
Dissect him immediately!

281
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,500
[HIRATO]
Tsukumo. Sit down.

282
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,083
[AKARI] I cannot, in good
conscience, follow your orders.

283
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,625
[MAKUNOBE] What?

284
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,375
If he dies, a vast amount of
knowledge will be lost to us.

285
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,375
In the name of science,
I will not let any harm

286
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,708
come to such a
challenging specimen.

287
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,791
[YOGI] The Healer gave
us snacks for the trip!

288
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,750
[NAI] Yay!

289
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,875
Have some self-respect, man.

290
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,666
Come on. Least make 'em
give you the good stuff.

291
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,666
It's not like that!
Nai told me himself

292
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,708
he's making this journey
of his own free will, so...

293
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,500
Rainbow Forest?

294
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,875
[HEALER] It's the place we
believe you used to live.

295
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,208
[YOGI] If we go there,
we think we could learn a lot.

296
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,208
About you, of course.
And Karoku too.

297
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,250
But if you decide to strike
out on your own, Nai,

298
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,375
I'll be sound asleep tonight.

299
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:41,166
Okay. Let's do it!
If I join you, it might

300
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,125
help me better understand
what Karoku was saying.

301
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,208
See, if I can
figure all that out,

302
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,416
maybe life will be beautiful.

303
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,125
[YOGI] Have I mentioned
how proud I am of you, Nai?

304
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,958
Ugh, give me a break.

305
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,083
Can we just get
this thing in the air?

306
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,250
Okay. Plotting a course for
rainbows! Buckle up, kids!

307
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,166
Yes, yes. Just go.

308
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:08,708
Uhh... Yes, sir.
We are go for launch.

309
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,166
[AKARI] Rainbow Forest is a
unique ecosystem, and creates

310
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,375
electromagnetic interference.
This impacts visible light,

311
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,500
producing atypical
rainbows and mirages.

312
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,125
However, there's a catch.

313
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,833
Those E.M. waves
disturb our comm gear.

314
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,916
So the best way to
conduct a search, I'm told,

315
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,333
is through the use of sonics.

316
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,916
[GAREKI] If Nai did come
from here, it would explain

317
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,500
his sensitivity
to sound, I guess.

318
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,583
[AKARI]
Approximately an hour.

319
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,208
And though he
walks with purpose,

320
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,125
we've still found
nothing of note.

321
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,250
Strike that.

322
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,791
Let's go.

323
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,500
Only the house burned.

324
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,875
Go take a look around.
Spread out.

325
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,416
--Right!
--Right!

326
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,458
[AKARI]
This didn't show up

327
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,750
during our aerial
reconnaissance.

328
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:40,375
Without Nai guiding us,
we'd never have found it.

329
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:45,666
Someone destroyed the evidence.
But how'd they get here?

330
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,500
Hey, Nai.
You doin' all right?

331
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,166
This actually isn't
the only place.

332
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,166
Huh?

333
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,708
Take us there.

334
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,875
[NAI] Right here.

335
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,458
[GAREKI] A cave?

336
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,708
Watch out!

337
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,541
Damn! Possessors!

338
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:16,708
Hello, uglies. You vultures
planning to take little Nai?

339
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,916
When everything's on the line,
there's no margin of error,

340
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,375
which of course
takes all the fun out.

341
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,125
But it seems you've
left me no choice.

342
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,833
[critter yelps]

343
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,208
No!

344
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,750
Nai!

345
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,125
[YOGI] Oh, no!

346
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,875
Gareki!

347
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,416
[NAI] Huh?

348
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,208
[GAREKI] Hey, what's this talk
about you being an animal?

349
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,333
[NAI] Uhhh...

350
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,041
[GAREKI] You totally
look like a human.

351
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,791
So you can
transform and stuff?

352
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,791
[NAI] What?

353
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,416
[GAREKI] Go for it!
Transform!

354
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
[NAI] What does
that even mean?
