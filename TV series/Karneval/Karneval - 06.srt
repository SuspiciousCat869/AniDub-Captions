[KIICHI] Something tells me this
is going to be a very hard sell.

151
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,500
[TSUKITACHI] No harm
in trying, I suppose.

152
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,625
[HIRATO] Interested in
atoning for your sins?

153
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,708
Give us something
we can use. Legally.

154
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,666
Details about your connection
with Kafka, for example.

155
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,041
Do they provide you
with drugs, or vice versa?

156
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,916
Don't you sons of bitches
know who you're talking to?

157
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,333
[TSUKITACHI]
Hm. Guess not.

158
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,750
[MEIGA] You think I'd
sell out my own kind?

159
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,541
[HIRATO] What is your
relationship to Palnedo?

160
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,083
Last chance.

161
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,666
[YOGI] Captain Hirato's
performing a burial.

162
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,625
[YOGI] It's over.

163
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,375
[GAREKI] He's dead.

164
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,000
[GAREKI] The man who
destroyed the lives

165
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,208
of the people I
cared about most.

166
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,875
[GAREKI] So why don't I
feel any better about this?

167
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,083
What's wrong with me?

168
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:04,000
[NAI] Gareki's feeling the same
sting in his heart that I am.

169
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,833
The same ache.

170
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,916
[GAREKI] It's like
nothing's changed.

171
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,083
I should've gotten
to kill him myself.

172
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,958
[URO] Meiga's been terminated.

173
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,833
[PALNEDO] Who is that?

174
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,208
[PALNEDO] First I've
heard the name.

175
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,250
[TSUKITACHI]
So, yeah. That kid.

176
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,625
[HIRATO] You mean Nai?

177
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,875
[TSUKITACHI] No, the
one with the attitude.

178
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,000
If memory serves,
he was on that ship.

179
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,250
[TSUKITACHI] The one that we
took it upon ourselves to sink?

180
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,416
[TSUKITACHI] You think
it means anything,

181
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,791
or is it simply
another coincidence?

182
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,416
[HIRATO] Excellent question.

183
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,166
[YOGI] Captain, I...

184
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,041
[HIRATO] It can wait, Yogi.

185
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,958
[HIRATO] You understand
we had no choice

186
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,625
but to use you as bait?
Such is the fog of war.

187
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,750
The possessors inexplicably
left you unharmed.

188
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,875
We had to utilize that.

189
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,791
[HIRATO] Why do you
think I authorized

190
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,416
your stop-off in Karasuna?
We've suspected for some time

191
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,333
that Kafka had sunk its
talons into this place.

192
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,333
When I realized you would
visit come hell or high water,

193
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,541
my path was clear: draw the
enemy--both their operations

194
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,708
here and their intentions
with you--into the open.

195
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,375
[YOGI] I'm sorry,
Gareki. I really am.

196
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,708
[GAREKI] It's all right.

197
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,291
I knew what I was signing
up for with you guys.

198
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,958
[GAREKI] Damn it.

199
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,333
[TSUKITACHI] Let's not
stand on ceremony.

200
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,208
If you'd come with
us please, young lady.

201
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,333
[GAREKI] No way!

202
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,958
To hell with tha--!

203
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,625
What are you doing?

204
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,666
[GAREKI] It doesn't
have to be this way.

205
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,125
You're not as alone as
you think. There's gramps.

206
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,791
And us--and people you
haven't even met yet!

207
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:35,916
[TSUBAME] You left.

208
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,458
[GAREKI] What?

209
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,958
That was no one's
choice but yours.

210
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:48,333
[TSUBAME] And this.
This is my choice.

211
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:56,958
We tried. We wanted you to
feel like part of the family.

212
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,625
[TSUBAME] You don't
have the first clue what

213
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:05,333
your skipping out on us
really did. We deserved better.

214
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,541
[TSUKITACHI] Take all the
time you need. I'll wait.

215
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,708
If you need anything,
just let me know.

216
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:32,208
Thank you. I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

217
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,625
[NURSE C] He has to be Circus;
look at that sexy hat!

218
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,416
[NURSE A] Who d'ya
think he's here for?

219
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:51,250
[TSUBAME]
Hey, Grampa. It's me.

220
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,250
[TSUBAME] I've done
a lot of thinking,

221
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,458
and I've decided it's best
if I leave the village.

222
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:00,250
That means this may be the last
time I can come see you.

223
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,041
But don't worry.

224
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,458
[TSUBAME] I've made
some new friends,

225
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,416
and they're going to make
sure you're taken care of.

226
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,833
They said you'll
want for nothing.

227
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:12,000
[TSUBAME] So see?
Everything'll be fine.

228
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,708
[NURSE A] They came here
for an old man? Circus?

229
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,666
[NURSE B] He's the one that
boy's been paying for, right?

230
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,166
[NURSE C]
Wait. What boy?

231
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,375
[NURSE B] You know...
he was here yesterday.

232
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:30,416
Still in his teens. Kinda
lanky. Black hair. Attitude.

233
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,041
[NURSE C] Ohh.
Yeah, right, him.

234
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,416
[TSUBAME] S'cuse me!

235
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,041
What's the name of the
boy you're talking about?

236
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,666
[TSUBAME] Please!
It's important!

237
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,916
[NURSE B]
Hmm. Lemme think.

238
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,291
On one of your
grandpa's good days,

239
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:48,125
he had a conversation
with him. Gareki, or...?

240
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:53,250
♪

241
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,583
[TSUBAME] Hey.
Where's Gareki?

242
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,583
[YOTAKA] Sorry, there's
no easy way to say this:

243
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,125
I think he's fallen in
with a bad crowd.

244
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:11,125
He's gone. Just put
him out of your mind.

245
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,166
[TSUBAME] Gareki!

246
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,541
[HIRATO] Ready to
move on, I presume?

247
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:33,166
We could've renewed the land
title. Why do it by yourself?

248
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,666
Hiding a family
secret, perhaps?

249
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,166
[GAREKI] I told you:
I don't have a family.

250
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,958
[HIRATO] You've done
a very noble thing.

251
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,291
Do not think it's lost on me.

252
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,750
[HIRATO] Heh. Such a softie.

253
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,916
[GAREKI] Up yours.

254
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,750
[TSUBAME] Everyone was
looking out for me.

255
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,833
[TSUBAME] I wasn't
alone after all.

256
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,625
[TSUKITACHI]
Well, come along then.

257
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,166
I need one more favor.

258
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,791
[TSUBAME] Not a
bad way to go out.

259
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,166
[TSUBAME] I don't
care if it hurts,

260
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,583
or if I'm dissected or whatever.
Just learn from me.

261
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,250
Use me to bring Kafka down!

262
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,916
[TSUBAME] I owe a
lot of good people.

263
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,958
[TSUBAME]
Bring them to justice!

264
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,000
Oh, we will.

265
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,375
[TSUBAME] Let my last
breath mean something.

266
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,416
You're very brave.
My respect.

267
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,583
[TSUBAME] I've got this, Yotaka.

268
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,666
Let me show you what
real wings can do.

269
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,708
[HIRATO] Your profession
being what it is,

270
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,708
I assume you know a foul
mood is counter-productive.

271
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,666
[AKARI] All the more
reason for you to go.

272
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,625
[HIRATO] You cut me to
the quick, my good man!

273
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,750
Am I not always a
balm for what ails you?

274
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,916
[AKARI] Get. Out. Now.
