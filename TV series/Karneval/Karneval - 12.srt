1
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,833
[AKARI] Are you
out of your minds?

2
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,500
[AKARI] Excuse us.
We need privacy, please.

3
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,583
[YOGI] What a relief, huh?
That it wasn't serious.

4
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,916
[NAI] So I can
be where he is?

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,625
[TSUKUMO] Captain Hirato's
making arrangements

6
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,541
as we speak.
Just a little longer.

7
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,166
[NAI] Oh. Thank you.

8
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,000
[YOGI] The thing to
do now is rest, okay?

9
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,416
[GAREKI] Yogi.

10
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,791
[GAREKI] So, being a "Child of
Airship Two" means... what?

11
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,291
[YOGI] Huh?

12
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,583
[GAREKI] Cap'n Four-eyes.
He asked if I wanted to be one.

13
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,916
Didn't feel the
need to elaborate.

14
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,000
[YOGI] A child of
Airship Two. Oh, man.

15
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,625
[YOGI] Well, uh...
You know... I'm not real sure.

16
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,375
[NAI] Karoku. I'm coming.

17
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,208
[HIRATO] I concur.
This is very likely a trap.

18
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,375
[TSUKITACHI]
Well, assuming it is,

19
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,958
they've overplayed
their hand.

20
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,791
We have a golden
opportunity here, guys.

21
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,250
If we allow ourselves
to get ambushed,

22
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,916
we'd make some real headway.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
[HIRATO] The mansion where our
man from the Lindain Group

24
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,166
disappeared is
clearly the key.

25
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,625
It's... where Tsukumo
was held captive as well.

26
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,833
She ran into Eleska there.
Palnedo's granddaughter.

27
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,500
That in and of itself
is rather telling.

28
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,625
What's more, she and Karoku
are somehow connected.

29
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,458
That intel came from Yanari,
the Lindain man's son.

30
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,500
The other major tell
Is that Karoku told Nai

31
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,208
to come to the
"Misty Mansion."

32
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,500
[AKARI] So report it
to the Command Tower.

33
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,916
The hell's this
have to do with me?

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,458
If we wait on the bureaucrats,
the lead'll go tits up.

35
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,541
We don't have the luxury of
waiting for a green light.

36
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,500
[HIRATO] If the distress
signal was genuine,

37
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,250
then it came from
one of our own.

38
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,166
We cannot abandon him
to Kafka's evil whim.

39
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,416
He holds the key
to Nai's creation.

40
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,208
Not to mention a
certain notebook.

41
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,875
Think of all
your hard work.

42
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,583
Aren't you tired of running
down blind alleys?

43
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,916
Yeah, right. You've
got just as much

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,541
of a stake in
this as we do.

45
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,333
[HIRATO] At dawn,
we launch a sneak attack.

46
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,125
[AKARI] I'm in.

47
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,833
[TSUKITACHI]
Ha! Badass!

48
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:29,708
[AKARI] On one condition.
I get to come along.

49
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,000
[HIRATO] Who else is qualified
to collect the potentially

50
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,625
time-sensitive data
likely to be on site?

51
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,125
Not us. That's for certain.

52
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,375
[HIRATO] You wanted
to talk; go right ahead.

53
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,291
[GAREKI] I'm gonna be
part of your little raid.

54
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,708
And you can't stop me.

55
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,958
[HIRATO] It's classified
and you're a civilian.

56
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,041
Not a very happy combination.

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,833
[HIRATO] Is that all?

58
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:08,000
[GAREKI] Whatever. I'd probably
be less than useless anyway.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,541
[GAREKI] Fine, then.
How much longer I got?

60
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,083
You're getting what
you need from Nai;

61
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,166
he's kosher with you guys.

62
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,916
I'm feelin' kinda like a third
wheel here, you know?

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,875
[HIRATO] I see. Someone's eager
to take their leave of Circus.

64
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,708
[GAREKI] So what the hell
am I supposed to do?

65
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,750
Stand around with my
thumb up my butt?

66
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,500
Fade into the background?
There's no point

67
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,500
in me bein' here if I'm
just a part of the scenery.

68
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,250
[GAREKI] Yeah, that's right.

69
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,375
[HIRATO]
Ah. Understood.

70
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,041
I'll see what can be done
about cutting you loose.

71
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,083
[GAREKI] Good.

72
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,916
[HIRATO] Unless... you
meant it about the raid.

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
[GAREKI] Wait. Really?
Damn straight!

74
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,750
[HIRATO] Time to start
earning your keep.

75
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,166
[YOGI]
Reassignment? But...

76
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,000
[HIRATO] Our target
is the Misty Manion,

77
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,500
estate of Mister Palnedo,
CEO of the Gald Company.

78
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,500
Our objective is to retrieve
Karoku, and if possible,

79
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,000
uncover evidence
linking Palnedo to Kafka.

80
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,875
Anything else is a bonus.
All personnel, standby.

81
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,875
Review the mission briefing
and be ready to move out.

82
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,625
[AKARI] Get a hold
of yourself, man.

83
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,291
For crying out loud, I've known
toddlers less afraid of needles.

84
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,500
[YOGI] It's not the
needle that scares me;

85
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,708
it's being this close to you.

86
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,041
[YOGI] So, uh...
Why exactly'd you go

87
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,458
to the trouble of
being here today--

88
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,958
[AKARI] Well, if you
must know, I insisted on

89
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,791
being part of the
Misty Mansion raid.

90
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,833
[YOGI] But you're a doctor.

91
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,208
[AKARI] And you're a
soldier on a deadly mission.

92
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,125
My job supports yours.

93
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:03,250
Bear in mind, though: field
surgery gets fairly primitive.

94
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,291
May have to saw off
a limb without anesthetic.

95
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,875
[IKAMI] As suspected,
an encrypted transmission

96
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,583
was sent from Airship Two
to an unknown recipient.

97
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,875
[HIRATO] Did you jam it?

98
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,833
[IKAMI] Absolutely, sir...
Nothing got outside.

99
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,208
[HIRATO] Everyone,
activate your bracelets.

100
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,458
Secure the lock. Skyward!

101
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,250
Commence test.

102
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,458
[HIRATO] Be aware of
your comrades' movements

103
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:44,541
at all times. Give your
instincts the reins out there.

104
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,458
[NAI] Karoku.

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,458
[KAROKU] Nai.

106
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,166
[GAREKI] Look, I know
he's here, so ditch the act.

107
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,583
I'm like his best friend;
he called me and told me

108
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,833
he was being held
here against his will.

109
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,625
[UNDERLING C] What?

110
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,916
[YOGI] Uh, let me explain.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,791
This young man
came to you in tears.

112
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,625
He's confused, surely, but
perhaps, if you'd be so kind,

113
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,166
it would be possible to
lay his fears to rest?

114
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,083
Wait, how rude of me!

115
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:24,208
Ahem! National Defense Agency.
Circus Airship Two. Yogi.

116
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,958
[UNDERLING C] Your little
friend ain't here.

117
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,208
[UNDERLING B] Maybe you
just had a bad dream?

118
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,833
[GAREKI] Uh-huh.
He said you'd say that.

119
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,458
Screw it! I'm goin' in!

120
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,458
[UNDERLING C] Damn it, kid!

121
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,791
[YOGI] Wait!
Come back!

122
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,541
Just stay there! I'll have
him back in two shakes!

123
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,125
[UNDERLING B]
Ring the guardhouse!

124
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,416
[IVA] I gotta admit:
at first blush,

125
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,250
the plan sounded
phenomenally dunderheaded.

126
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,416
[HIRATO] I'm aware.
The trick of course,

127
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,250
is using their pristine
public façade against them.

128
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,250
They'd be loath to shed
blood at the front gate.

129
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,666
So that, naturally,
was our in.

130
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,708
[PALNEDO] What is going on?

131
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,833
[UNDERLING C] Sir, we, uh...
Well, they said Karoku

132
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,416
reached out to them
for help and then they...

133
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,125
[PALNEDO] I'm sure it's
nothing. Keep it together.

134
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:11,458
Just ferret them out.
With force. Understood?

135
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,041
[URO] Circus.
Interesting they choose

136
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,708
now of all times
to grow a pair.

137
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,625
One almost feels pity for them.

138
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,416
The proverbial Pandora's Box

139
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,291
won't be opened by
their kind, I'm afraid.

140
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:32,291
Let your imaginations
run wild, as humans do.

141
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:36,916
Leave the revolution
to us. It's what we do.

142
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,750
[YOGI] Wait up!
Time to fly!

143
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,291
[YOGI] Hey! Where'd you
get that thing from?

144
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,041
[GAREKI] Front gate. One of
the goons had it on him.

145
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,791
[YOGI] Wow. Artful dodger!

146
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,291
[GAREKI] Yeah, whatevs.

147
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,625
Figured they had to have a map
of the grounds, you know?

148
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,833
[ELESKA] Karoku!

149
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,000
We have to go back!

150
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,791
Uro was saying you need
to be in your room!

151
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,875
[KAROKU] Sounds like
something's up.

152
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,375
[ELESKA] I have no idea.
But whatever's happening,

153
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,083
I'm with you.
That's how it should be.

154
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,833
[KAROKU] Do you feel that?

155
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:23,875
The sky. The wind.
They're dancing.

156
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,625
[KAROKU] It's going to rain
soon. We should get inside.

157
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,750
That, and I have a visitor.

158
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,875
[ELESKA]
Wha? But... Who?

159
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,083
[KAROKU] Someone
very special to me.

160
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,416
[GAREKI] Easy! They call
themselves security?

161
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,875
I've cut off their lines
of communication.

162
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,583
[YOGI] You're really good
at this. I'm surprised.

163
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,250
I'd love to have a
look at the library

164
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,541
you absorbed all this
knowledge from.

165
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:07,500
I mean, with your smarts, you,
uh, really ought to consider...

166
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:12,916
I dunno. I mean... If you were
interested, you could, uh...

167
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,916
[GAREKI] Sorry. Say
again. What library?

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Heard you call me a genius,
then I tuned out.

169
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,166
Anyway, dude, I'm in.

170
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,208
They're connected to
Airship Two. You're up!

171
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,000
[YOGI] Yeah, right.
Which button do I press?

172
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,541
[GAREKI] The one
in front of you!

173
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,375
Then to the right of that.
Then bottom left.

174
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,583
Then the toggle switch
next to that. C'mon!

175
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,708
[UNDERLING C]
Huh? Oh, crap.

176
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,166
[UNDERLING B]
The hell just happened?

177
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,458
[YOGI] Network override
is complete, sir.

178
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,416
[HIRATO] Move in.

179
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:02,041
[TSUKITACHI] Good morning,
gentlemen. Circus business!

180
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,666
If you have two brain
cells to rub together,

181
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,666
you'll stand down and
do exactly as you're told.

182
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,458
[JIKI] Right. On with
the treasure hunt, huh?

183
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,916
Lend me your ears, Nai.

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,333
Give me an idea of
what we're looking for.

185
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,750
[JIKI] If we don't uncover
something, you and Gareki...

186
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,833
Ah, better not
to think about it.

187
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,375
[PALNEDO] Why are these clowns
such a problem for you people?

188
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,833
[UNDERLING C] They've
hacked our network, sir!

189
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:30,000
All our data is being
downloaded by their damn ship!

190
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,458
[YOGI] Time to go! C'mon!

191
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,833
[URO] Heh. How lovely.

192
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,625
Our friends presume to
lead this dance, do they?

193
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,208
I must congratulate
them on their new moves.

194
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,750
But they still have a thing
or two to learn about rhythm.

195
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,041
[NAI] I hear
something really bad!

196
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:10,083
[the sound of sirens]

197
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,916
[HIRATO] The enemy
knows it's been hacked.

198
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,583
All units. Be ready.
They're about to get ugly.

199
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,541
[YOGI] Take cover!

200
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,333
[GAREKI] Son of a bitch.

201
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,250
[TSUKITACHI] Never underestimate
their desperation!

202
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,916
[KIICHI] Pick up the pace!

203
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,250
[TSUKITACHI] Oh, good.
Target practice.

204
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,583
[KIICHI] I've got this, sir!

205
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,916
[KAGIRI] What? Come on!
We're worth two of you!

206
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,875
[KIICHI] You're about to find
out you got it backwards!

207
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,791
[KIHARU] Where does
Circus recruit from, man?

208
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,500
They're all so freakin' cute!

209
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,666
[KIICHI] Then lemme put this
"cute" scythe up your ass!

[ELESKA] Karoku! Open the
door! You're scaring me!

I don't think he's in there.

212
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,416
[ELESKA] Yes, he is! And I'm
not leaving without him!

213
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
[UNDERLING P]
There's no time!

214
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,833
This place is
crawling with Circus!

215
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,250
[ELESKA] Wait, Circus?

216
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,083
[KAROKU] That, and I
have a visitor.

217
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,500
Someone very special to me.

218

It can't be. That girl...
She's come for Karoku.

Shoulda known...
The two of them...

No! I'm not letting this happen!

come to take him away from me!

You were just so...

No offense, but you were
acting like an animal.

Your eyes. Try listening
with them closed.

focus on the sounds, 'kay?

of a challenge to kill her.
You go. I'll handle it.

[URO] Greetings, ladies.
To what do we owe the pleasure?

Thanks for letting
us drop in like this.

240

isn't much here for you now.

May I ask what you
were hoping to find?

[IVA] Oh, I don't know.
Everything seems to be

243
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,291
in order, I think.
If this were one of our

[IVA] My, how brave.
Didn't even dodge.

I should tell you, though, the
act isn't really fooling anyone.

are you doing?

don't know anymore. I mean,

I'd like to be optimistic, sure.
It's just so difficult.

00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:05,250
[NAI] If Karoku dies, there
won't be another one. Ever.

302
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:10,833
That's why I have to find him.
Because everyone... Everyone...

303
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:30,416
[NAI] I talked to the sky about
how it was going to rain.

304
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,791
I talked to the little
creatures in the wood.

305
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,250
They said the
flowers were happy.

306
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:45,875
[NAI] They hear me. That's
right. My voice can carry, too.

307
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,416
[IVA] Krone Saphir!

308
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,708
[URO] You're holding up
admirably well.

309
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:40,625
My respect to you both...
Our skills are a world apart.

310
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:45,125
Your own have you at a
distinct disadvantage.

311
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:48,333
[URO] Where's your captain?
Sitting comfortably?

312
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,458
He must have a great deal
of faith in you, young miss.

313
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:54,125
Disheartening he
doesn't join the fray...

314
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:59,416
What? No! That door
should be sealed!

315
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,708
[URO] Banshees?

316
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,083
[TSUKUMO] This was
all a diversion.

317
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,708
Our captain wanted
you captured alive.

318
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,791
[IVA] Ha! You have no
idea how difficult it is

319
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,666
to pull my punches.

320
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,250
[GAREKI] The hell--?

321
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,333
[Gareki sighs]

322
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,250
[YOGI] Oh, god. Oh god
oh god oh god! What's wrong?

323
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,125
A sigh like that never
means anything good.

324
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,000
Talk to me, buddy!
Don't give up hope!

325
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,291
Don't turn your back
on the world--on life!

326
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,541
We're here for you!

327
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,416
[GAREKI] Knock it off,
will ya? I'm just tired.

328
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,083
[YOGI] Oh, my bad.
