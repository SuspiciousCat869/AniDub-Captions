1
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,708
[MAN] I'll have
to admit, I'm surprised.

2
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,541
I'd never expected the
much vaunted Circus

3
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:53,625
to be staffed with
such young agents.

4
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,583
[HIRATO] Not quite the attitude
I'd expect from the man

5
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,416
who became CEO of the
Lindain Group by age 42.

6
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,541
Seems rather counter-intuitive
in my opinion.

7
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,875
[MAN] Ha!
You're a smart one, aren't you?

8
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,833
[HIRATO] Indeed. Now what is the
business you wish to discuss?

9
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:17,250
Yes, well. It seems the
Gald Company has a secret.

10
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,000
They're making things
that go bump in the night.

11
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:26,208
[YOGI] Behold, the Floating
Iron Castle. Vantnum!

12
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,958
We almost never
get a day off.

13
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,208
So let's make this
one count, huh?

14
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,458
[YOGI] Hey, Nai!
You pick the first stop.

15
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,083
[NAI] Oh, umm... Hmm...

16
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,250
[JIKI] So, you guys...

17
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,875
[YOGI] Did you have
a suggestion, Jiki?

18
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,000
[JIKI] Actually,
I'm going off on my own.

19
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,666
[YOGI] What?
But, "Boys' Day Out."

20
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,916
[JIKI] I'm hitting up a few
hobby shops. Gonna be a while.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,458
[YOGI] Jiki!

22
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:01,500
[YOGI] Prepare yourselves
for the piece de resistance!

23
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,541
[YOGI] The promised land!

24
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,750
[GAREKI] No way in hell.

25
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,791
[YOGI] Wha? Huh?
Nai's having a great time!

26
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,791
[GAREKI] Quit it.

27
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,166
[YOGI] Take a page
from his book!

28
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,458
[GAREKI] Dude, I'm serious!
Would you just shut up?

29
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,458
[YOGI] I-I can't breathe!

30
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,458
[GAREKI] Get
off'a me. Damn it!

31
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:22,458
Screw you! And Nyanperona! You
need to grow up and recognize

32
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:26,375
that this "cat" chump is just
a grown man in a fur suit!

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,458
[YOGI] Quiet. None o' that!
You lying liar from Liartown!

34
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,041
Nyanperowna is a
real living creature!

35
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,291
And not just some
guy in a fur suit!

36
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,916
[YOGI] Well, that
was a nightmare!

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,458
[YANARI] Hey.

38
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,541
[YOGI] Oh, hi there young one!

39
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:55,166
We were just discussing how
Nyanperowna is totally real.

40
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,166
[YOGI] Uh...?

41
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,833
[YANARI] You left behind
your credit card receipt. ZZA.

42
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,833
These digits are
exclusively used

43
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,166
by the National Defense Agency.

44
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,416
And after hearing your
outburst in the store,

45
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,416
I have deduced that you, sir,
are the one inside Nyanperowna!

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,541
[YOGI] Ah! From the
mouths of babes..

47
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,666
[GAREKI] So what's
your angle? Snotty brat.

48
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,791
[YANARI] Takes one to
know one. I'm Yanari.

49
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,458
[NAI] Yanari? Hi.

50
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,250
[YANARI] I'm trying
to find a pasta place.

51
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,291
Blue roof, black gate?

52
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,291
If you want Nyanperona's
"secret identity"

53
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,875
to remain a secret, you'll
help me find that place.

54
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:40,166
[JIKI] To the untrained eye,
there are no subtleties in soil.

55
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,166
But I know otherwise. There is
more than enough to admire here.

56
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,625
And I'm not just
talking about dirt!

57
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,916
[AZANA] Pardon me, Doctor.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,333
[AKARI] Azana.
It seems like you have

59
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,458
more injuries
every time we meet.

60
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,875
[AZANA] Maybe, I've got
some good news though.

61
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,708
Things in Vint are
nice and quiet again.

62
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,791
[AKARI] Good. And I hear the
poachers have been apprehended.

63
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,291
[AZANA] That's...
That's really great! So...

64
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,666
Did you hear anything
from Hirato?

65
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,750
[AKARI] What about Hirato?

66
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:20,916
[AZANA] Uh... I forgot. He gets
on your nerves. So... yeah.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,125
I was just wondering if he
mentioned finding some leads?

68
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,000
[AKARI] I understand
your suspicions, I do.

69
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,750
But there are no traitors
in the Research Tower!

70
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,208
[HIRATO] The Vint situation
proved otherwise.

71
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,250
We've not yet determined
the identity of the man

72
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,083
who claimed to work
for you, Doctor.

73
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:46,458
However... Someone is
leaking intel, without a doubt.

74
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,375
[AKARI] Not yet. He hasn't
found a single thing.

75
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,166
[MAN] Admittedly,
I have no proof.

76
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,583
But they have an uncommonly
high employee turnover rate.

77
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,833
There's more. When
those employees leave,

78
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,791
they tend to die from odd
accidents. Illnesses.

79
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,416
Or they just disappear entirely.

80
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,250
And this part doesn't leave
the room, understand?

81
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,125
They're bad news.
Just the other day,

82
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,375
Palnedo hosted a party at
a Gald Company facility.

83
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,041
A friend of mine was
invited to the event,

84
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,250
and now he's gone missing.

85
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,791
[HIRATO] I understand.

86
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,541
And shall see to it.

87
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,916
We'll make sure each and every
rat goes down with the ship.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,083
[YOGI] Shing! Behold the
epic manliness! Ba-zing!

89
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,916
You've rubbed this
kitty the wrong way!

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,916
[YOGI] National
Defense Agency, Circus.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,541
Airship Two,
Combat Personnel, Yo--

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,875
Nyanperowna!

93
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,208
[YOGI] Mee-yow!

94
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,625
[YANARI] Yeah, no.

95
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,458
It's only half as cool without
the Nyanperowna outfit.

96
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,875
But I did it special
just for you.

97
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,583
[NAI] There's somebody
looking at us.

98
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,708
[GAREKI] All right.
You got a problem, chief?

99
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,833
Now take your head off
so we can see you.

100
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,750
[RISSUN] Uh, I, uh...

101
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,833
[YOGI] Gareki, stop!
How could you?

102
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,916
And in front of the children!
Their hopes! Their dreams!

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,083
[RISSUN] Hi! I'm Rissun!

104
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,666
[YOGI] You're the city of
Vantnum's adorable mascot!

105
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,375
[RISSUN] And official
guide to our lovely town!

106
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,833
[NAI] Hi there! Is there
a pasta shop that has

107
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:44,208
a blue roof and, uh, black gate?
My friend wants to find it!

108
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,541
[YOGI] We couldn't even
track it down online.

109
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:50,458
[RISSUN] Oh, that sounds like
the place over in District E-22!

110
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,000
[YANARI] Really?

111
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,458
[RISSUN] The city of Vantnum
thanks you for coming,

112
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,041
and hopes you have
a memorable stay!

113
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,083
[NAI] Thanks again,
Mr. Squirrel guy!

114
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:13,000
[YANARI] Nai. So, uh,
earlier with the rodent.

115
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,708
You referred to me
as your friend.

116
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:21,208
But, uh... What did we
do to become friends?

117
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,458
[NAI] I don't know.
Ice cream?

118
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,916
[YANARI] No!
Not ice cream!

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,625
How do you make a person
be your friend? Officially?

120
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,000
[NAI] I'm not so sure.

121
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,291
[YANARI] Really?

122
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:39,375
[NAI] Well, I mean,
it's like... Hmm.

123
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,958
There's warmth!
You can feel it!

124
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,083
Morons! Your one job
is to watch him!

125
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,500
What if they attempt
to take him again?

126
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,375
[HIRATO] Can we
be of assistance?

127
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:59,041
Oh, uh... My son has
apparently snuck away.

128
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,333
[HIRATO] We currently
have operatives in town.

129
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,791
I'll send them, just to be safe.

130
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:14,833
[JIKI] Emergency orders. Secure
and protect a 9-year-old boy.

131
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:20,791
Son of the CEO of the Lindain
Group. Indigo-black hair.

132
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,958
[YOGI] Wearing shorts and a
blazer. And his name is Yanari.

133
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,625
[YOGI] Wha--? Hang on.

134
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,208
[NAI] Hmm? It's Rissun!

135
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,666
[YANARI] Oh, wow!
So you came with us, huh?

136
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,541
[RISSUN?]
Huh? Uh, yeah.

137
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,000
[NAI] Hey. Your voice
changed. You're not...

138
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,750
[FAKE RISSUN] Nobody move!

139
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:58,875
[YOGI] How dare you, sir?
Sullying this fine suit.

140
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,958
[UNDERLING A] Don't move!

141
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,208
[UNDERLING B] Master Yanari,
we've been looking for you!

142
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,875
[UNDERLING A]
Are you all right?

143
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,541
[UNDERLING B]
Quick, come with us!

144
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:13,166
[YANARI] No! No way! I'm not
going! I've got to find it!

145
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,666
[NAI] Yanari wants
to find a pasta shop.

146
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,041
[HIRATO] Please
leave it to us.

147
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,583
We in Circus know how
to deal with such rabble.

148
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,708
[YOGI] Wait.
What'd he just say?

149
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,083
[GAREKI] Huh?

150
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,375
[HIRATO] It seems
the blonde is trying

151
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,000
to escape with
the child. Now go.

152
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,583
[YOGI] Oh... Oh!!

153
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:48,625
[YOGI] Hirato actually let us
get away! What a swell guy!

154
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,208
[NAI] This house
is a pasta shop?

155
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,458
[YANARI] No. But this
is the right place.

156
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,500
[YANARI] I'll see her soon.
See my mother.

157
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,833
[NAI] Mother?

158
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,375
[YANARI] Mother!

159
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,625
Mom!

160
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,166
[YANARI] Mom?

161
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,958
[GIRL B] Are you... Yanari?

162
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,041
[GIRL B] She was in an
accident. About a month ago.

163
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,416
I'm so sorry. We didn't have
any way to get a hold of you.

164
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
So we weren't able to tell
you about the funeral.

165
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,250
[YANARI] I see. I'm too
late. Now she's gone.

166
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,916
Thank you for your time.

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,416
[NAI] Yogi.
Yanari's drowning.

168
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,666
I can hear it. Hear
his heart breaking.

169
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,666
[NAI] My heart hurts too.

170
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,291
[YANARI]
Nai. What is it?

171
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,875
[NAI] Yanari.

172
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,166
[YANARI] Why're you
looking at me like that?

173
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,500
[GAREKI] What's the big idea,
leaving me tied up?

174
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,125
You carelessly
damaged the hopes

175
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,000
and dreams of the
town's children.

176
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,958
You have also exposed
my children to danger.

177
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,291
[GAREKI] No biggie.
Yogi's got this handled.

178
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,250
[HIRATO] Not just
Nai and the boy.

179
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,416
I was also referring to you.

180
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,166
[GAREKI] Wait. What?!

181
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,375
I'm not a kid, pal, and I
sure as hell ain't yours!

182
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,666
[GAREKI] What's so damn funny?

183
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,041
[HIRATO] You are.

184
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,541
Very well. Gareki...

185
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,333
Would you like to be
a child of Airship Two?

186
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,875
[GAREKI] Huh?

187
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,083
[YANARI] My father's work
drove my mother away.

188
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,541
One day she just
left the house.

189
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,333
I felt like she
was abandoning me.

190
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,125
It hurt; I missed
her so much.

191
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:35,333
But the last time
I saw her, I...

192
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,750
[YANARI] I... just ignored her.

193
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:47,250
What a terrible thing to do.
I'm the worst person alive!

194
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,000
[YOGI] No, Yanari.
You're wrong.

195
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,833
[YANARI] I'm not wrong!

196
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,250
That's why I never
have any friends either!

197
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,708
[YANARI] My father and the
terrible things he works on.

198
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,250
So many people hate him!

199
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,750
And the worst part is, I'll
grow up to be just like him!

200
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:12,208
[YANARI] Unless... I already am!
It's awful. I'm worthless!

201
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:16,083
Terrible! A coward!
Worthless, you hear?

202
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,833
[slapping sound]

203
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,250
[YOGI] You should never talk
about yourself that way.

204
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,250
Not with those words.

205
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,500
[YOGI] You hurt
your mother, yes.

206
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,000
But you can't keep taking
it out on yourself, Yanari.

207
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,500
You're not the same
person you once were.

208
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,125
[YANARI] Huh?

209
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,458
[YOGI] You don't have
to be like your father.

210
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,041
If you promise to stand strong,
on your own two feet,

211
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,458
you'll grow into
a fine young man.

212
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,916
[YOGI] And those times
when you feel like

213
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,125
you don't have any
friends.. you have us!

214
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,750
[NAI] Yeah!

215
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,041
[YOGI] And you have Gareki,
who's not here.

216
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:03,083
And Tsukumo, waiting outside.
We're all your friends!

217
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,625
[GIRL B] Um...

218
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:11,208
[YANARI] I... I made that.
Just for mom.

219
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:22,791
[YANARI'S MOM] Yanari. You're my
pride and joy. Happy Birthday!

220
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,750
[YANARI'S MOM]
I hope you're happy.

221
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:36,083
And growing tall and strong.
Oh, Yanari. I'm sorry.

222
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:42,083
[YANARI'S MOM] I want
you to know I love you, son.

223
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:59,416
[YOGI] Being Nyanperowna, I've
noticed something. It's crazy.

224
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,875
For the kids who need him
the most. He finds a way.

225
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,708
He makes their day brighter.
Like it's his destiny.

226
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,458
[NAI] Really?

227
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:13,250
[YOGI] Yanari needed friends.
Then destiny brought us to him.

228
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,000
[YANARI]
Nai! Thank you!

229
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,500
When you grabbed
my hand earlier, I...

230
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:25,541
stopped feeling alone for
the first time. I owe you.

231
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:30,250
[NAI] Nah, my pleasure. Gareki
and Yogi did the same for me.

232
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,708
And... And so did Karoku.

233
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,958
[YANARI] Karoku?

234
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,500
[NAI] Yeah.
That's who I'm looking for.

235
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,958
[YANARI] Hmm. I've heard
that name. But where?

236
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,833
[JIKI] Yanari!
We need to get in the air!

237
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,958
[YANARI] Yogi.
Nyanperowna is awesome

238
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,166
'cause you put your
heart into it!

239
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,500
[Yogi bawls]

240
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,208
[YANARI] Gareki.
You were really brave

241
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,916
when you took on that
fake squirrel guy for me!

242
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,375
[GAREKI] Anytime.

243
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,041
[YANARI] Nai!

244
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,416
I bought this for my mother.
But I want you to have it.

245
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,833
[NAI] But...

246
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:15,666
[YANARI] Thank you for
being my first friend!

247
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,208
[NAI] Sure!

248
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,000
[YANARI] Goodbye,
new friends.

249
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,625
Thank you for the
memorable adventure!

250
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,208
[HIRATO] Would you like to
be a child of Airship Two?

251
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:44,583
[GAREKI] What's that even
mean? Cryptic four-eyed jerk.

252
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,958
I've made it this
long on my own.

253
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,458
[YOGI] Nai!

254
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,458
[NAI] Huh?

255
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,333
[YOGI] Phone call!

256
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,000
Nai speaking!

257
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,791
[YANARI] Hello? Nai?

258
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,541
[NAI] Oh. Yanari!

259
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,333
[YANARI] Wasn't Karoku the guy
you've been searching for?

260
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,875
[NAI] Yeah?

261
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,333
[YANARI] There was a girl I
went to Selection School with

262
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:11,166
who mentioned him.
Her name was... Eleska.

263
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,875
[YOGI] Eleska?

264
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,916
[GAREKI] Does he mean
working on the Airship?

265
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,833
My plan was to make
some extra cash

266
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,083
sticking with an
easy mark like Nai.

267
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:26,000
Just planned to use him.
Never thought I'd end up here.

268
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,416
Staying here... It's just...

269
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,083
When did by-the-numbers
business become so complicated?

270
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,833
When did I start caring?

271
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,250
[GAREKI] Huh?

272
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:42,041
[NAI] Gareki. I brought
some juice for you.

273
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,833
[GAREKI] Oh, thank you.

274
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,416
[GAREKI] I can't stay.
Not with the way I am now.

275
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,000
Never measuring up.
Always the weak link.

276
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:02,125
[KAROKU] Time for a chat, Nai.
Come. Sink down with me.

277
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,875
[GAREKI] Nai!

278
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:12,708
[KAROKU] You sure are
taking your time, Nai.

279
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,875
[NAI] Karoku!
Where are you?

280
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,333
[KAROKU] Are you reluctant to
part ways with your friends?

281
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,875
Lucky them. I don't
even get to see you.

282
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,750
[NAI] But why did you go?

283
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:28,291
[KAROKU] I never chose to.
I was taken against my will.

284
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:32,791
[NAI] Karoku! Where did
they take you? Tell me!

285
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,541
I promise I'll come for you!

286
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,833
[KAROKU] Hurry.
Come right away.

287
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:45,333
[KAROKU] Or else.
They plan to kill me.

288
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,416
[KAROKU] You'll find me.

289
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,041
[TSUKUMO] Nai!
What's wrong?

290
00:19:55,125 --> 00:20:00,291
[NAI] He's there.
He's at the Misty Mansion.

291
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,416
[TSUKUMO] The Misty Mansion?

292
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,000
[NAI] Karoku's there.
Tsukumo! I've...

293
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:10,416
I've got to go
get him! Or else...

294
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,541
Or else they're
going to kill Karoku.

295
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:20,041
[HEALER] That'll be a rather
difficult place to infiltrate.

296
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,541
The Misty Mansion
is apparently

297
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,708
one of Kafka's top
research facilities.

298
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,500
Trouble is, we still have
insufficient evidence.

299
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,833
Which has proved to be quite a
hurdle to our investigation.

300
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,625
[JIKI] If we go after
them half-cocked.

301
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,291
everything we've
accomplished will be undone.

302
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,583
Unless we have
some concrete proof,

303
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,291
the Command Tower will
never allow our mission.

304
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,833
[TSUKUMO] But how's Palnedo's
granddaughter Eleska

305
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,291
connected to Nai's
friend Karoku?

306
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:50,916
With just Yanari's memory to
go on, the info's not reliable.

307
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,625
[NAI] Well, I'm going.
That's that.

308
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,958
[JIKI] And what do you plan
to do when you get there?

309
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:02,875
[NAI] Something! I dunno!
But I've got to try, for Karoku!

310
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,000
[YOGI] I'm sorry, Nai.

311
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,916
[NAI] But now he's...
He's running out of time.

312
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,833
So I'm going.
Alone, if I have to.

313
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,875
[GAREKI] Well, count me in.

314
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:21,666
I don't work for Circus.
I'm just a dumb cat burglar.

315
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,833
But if we find proof, you can
do something with it?

316
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,833
[YOGI] No way.
Not alone. I'm coming with.

317
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,833
I'll leave my Circus ID here!

318
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,375
[TSUKUMO] I'm going too!

319
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,666
[YOGI] Captain Hirato!

320
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,208
[NAI] I--I have to--

321
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,000
[HIRATO] No one leaves.

322
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,958
Without me.

323
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,875
[HIRATO] I'll take
responsibility.

324
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:00,666
We'll raid the Mansion under
the pretext of rescuing Karoku.

325
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,416
[HIRATO] Time for Circus
to save the day.

326
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,125
[RABBIT] Each of us is unique
like a snowflake, hop.

327
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,041
[JIKI] Long ears, same
eye color, same voice,

328
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,458
same traits and attire.
You're all identical!

329
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,708
[RABBIT] Look closer, hop.

330
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,791
Maybe then you'll see
the differences, hop.

331
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,500
[JIKI] Silly rabbit.
I'd put money

332
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,750
that everyone agrees
with me on this.
