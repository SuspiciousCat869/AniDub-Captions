1
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:18,833
[Yogi screams]

2
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,625
[KIHARU] Oh, hell!
What's with this guy?

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,583
[GAREKI] Yogi?

4
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:40,541
[Yogi laughs]

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,083
[KIHARU] Kagiri.
Eh? Dude. Bogus.

6
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,041
[YUKKIN] Yukkin!

7
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,625
[TSUKUMO] You've stopped.
What's wrong?

8
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,958
[NAI] Yogi.

9
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,041
[TSUKUMO] Nai!

10
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:36,125
[NAI] Yogi! Yogi! Yogi!

11
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,500
[TSUKUMO] The way he's acting...
I hope they're all right.

12
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,500
[TSUKUMO] Okay, Nai. Sit down.

13
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,833
Wait here and don't move.
Promise you'll stay put.

14
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,458
[TSUKUMO] I'll be
back in no time.

15
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,375
[NAI] Tsukumo, wait!

16
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,666
[KIHARU] Bro, we can't
tell anyone we lost

17
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,958
a fight against Circus.
If the boss found out,

18
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,458
he'd paint the walls
with our insides! Huh?

19
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,666
[KIHARU] Hey. Aren't you
that chick that took off?

20
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,583
[TSUKUMO] Varugas.

21
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,833
[TSUKUMO]
Where are my friends?

22
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,625
[KIHARU] I gotta say,
babe: I like the view

23
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,500
way better with the hood off!

24
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,125
[KIHARU] You're smokin' hot!

25
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,833
[TSUKUMO] Answer me!

26
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,166
[KIHARU] Hell, I dunno!
Blondie blew his top!

27
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,250
The damn guy went all cray-cray!

28
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:36,000
The black haired dude's
gotta be toast by now!

29
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:40,250
[TSUKUMO] He's lying. Has to be.
But after Nai's reaction...

30
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,791
Something terrible
must have happened!

31
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,875
[KIHARU] Caught ya nappin'!

32
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,708
[KIHARU] Nighty
night, hot stuff.

33
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,708
[TSUKUMO] Nai. Yogi.

34
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,750
[Kiharu laughs]

35
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,541
[NAI] Come back!

36
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,666
[NAI] Tsukumo, no!!

37
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,291
[GUARD A] Karoku, sir!

38
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,875
[GUARD B] What's
the matter, sir?

39
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:38,208
[URO] Master Karoku.
Feeling poorly?

40
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:42,291
[KAROKU] Uro. I have
a bit of a headache.

41
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,666
I might need to lie
down for a while.

42
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,958
[URO] The party won't officially
start for a few hours.

43
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll come fetch you after
you've had a good rest.

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,958
[KAROKU] Tsukumo, huh?

45
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:23,875
I can hear you.
Tell me more about... Nai.

46
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:58,458
[YOGI] Hi there. Who are you
and why did I protect you?

47
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,916
[GAREKI] Wait, does
he not recognize me?

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,958
What the hell is going
on with this freakshow?

49
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,916
[GAREKI] Yogi.

50
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,875
[YOGI] That's me. Play time?

51
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,916
[GAREKI] I got your
play time right here!

52
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,041
[YOGI] That's
so mean. Ga. Ga?

53
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,958
Ga. Re. Gare?

54
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,833
[YOGI] Gareki!
I'm so glad you're safe!

55
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,416
So, uh...
Was I unconscious?

56
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:40,125
I'm so sorry!
And grateful.

57
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:46,125
You're alive. And warm.
Just like you should be.

58
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,166
[GAREKI] Nai?

59
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,041
[NAI] Gareki?
It's Tsukumo.

60
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,333
[NAI] They took her!

61
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,375
[AZANA] I'm sorry to bother you
at such an ungodly hour, Doctor.

62
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,083
Sleep is not often a luxury
the Research Tower affords.

63
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,625
[AZANA] Of course. Right.

64
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,916
[AKARI] When their medical
exams are complete,

65
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,875
Nai and Gareki are to stand by.

66
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,083
[AZANA] Yessir. If there's
anything else I can do...

67
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,000
[AKARI] Your area of
expertise lies elsewhere.

68
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,041
[AZANA] But sir,
I'd mostly wanted to help

69
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,125
because there were
varugas involved.

70
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:40,166
Azana. I know why you feel the
need to do more than your share.

71
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,583
What varugas did to
your poor family.

72
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,916
Who wouldn't be
emotionally invested?

73
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,916
Now go get some rest.
Doctor's orders.

74
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,958
[TSUKUMO] Where am I?

75
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,000
[KIHARU] Still not
seein' Mr. Uro.

76
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,875
An extra pair of eyes would
really help here, bro.

77
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,916
Screw it. I'll just keep
yelling his name! Helluva plan!

78
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,750
We're here without permission,
my thickheaded colleague.

79
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,166
Think of what he'll do
if we make a scene.

80
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,916
[URO] You have me at a loss.

81
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,041
[ELESKA] You're
unbearable, Uro!

82
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,208
[URO] Dealing with such
a crowd in his condition.

83
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,666
Clearly young Master Karoku
over-extended himself.

84
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,625
[ELESKA] Not fair!
And no fun! Hmph.

85
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,625
[URO] Miss Eleska.
Are you going?

86
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,625
[ELESKA] To the restroom.
And I'm not to be followed!

87
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,291
[ELESKA] I'll just have
to go look for myself.

88
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,500
[TSUKUMO] A masked gathering.
What's going on here?

89
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,083
[TSUKUMO] It's not connecting.

90
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,791
Is the signal being blocked?
Should I take a look around?

91
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:51,291
[TSUKUMO] No way.
I have to escape right now.

92
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,958
[ELESKA] Oh, no. How did
you get those bruises?

93
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,666
[TSUKUMO] Eleska.

94
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,208
[ELESKA] We've met
before, haven't we?

95
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,500
[Eleska screams]

96
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,958
[GUARD C] Miss Eleska!

97
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,500
[GUARD D] What's
wrong, mistress?

98
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,625
[ELESKA] Someone was...

99
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,625
[GUARD C] After them!

100
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,166
[GUARD D] Yessir!

101
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,333
[ELESKA] Uro!

102
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,833
[URO] What's the matter,
Mistress?

103
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,583
[ELESKA] It was...
That Circus girl,

104
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:45,291
the same one from the train.
And she... she was bleeding!

105
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,583
[KAGIRI &amp; KIHARU] What?
The blondie got away?

106
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:55,000
[ELESKA] Uh... Who
are those guys? Huh?

107
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,083
[URO] Put them out
of your mind, child.

108
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,791
To you, to your life of
opulent splendor...

109
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:03,833
They are of absolutely
no consequence.

110
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,250
[URO] Please see
her to her room.

111
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,833
[GUARD C] Sir!

112
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,458
[KIHARU]
Yeah, so, uh, sir?

113
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,041
[KAGIRI] Mr. Uro.

114
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,583
[URO] What are you
two doing here?

115
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,000
What have you done?

116
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,625
[KAGIRI] Uh, um,
well, we...

117
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,166
[KIHARU] I-It's a really
funny story, actually.

118
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:31,416
[URO] Why must you two idiots
insist on disappointing me?

119
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,916
Is it that you long
for an early grave?

120
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,208
[URO] Find the young
girl from Circus.

121
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:46,000
Then bring her to me.
Dead or alive.

122
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,750
[IKAMI] Results look good! But
I think we should play it safe.

123
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,916
The two of you will spend the
night here, under observation.

124
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
[NAI] Is Tsukumo still gone?

125
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,208
Don't worry! Airship Two
will track down

126
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,666
your friend in no time, 'kay?

127
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,625
[NAI] And Yogi?

128
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,250
Give me a status report.

129
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,500
Everything's fine. Neither seem
to have any health issues.

130
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,750
[AKARI] Well done.
Thank you, Ikami.

131
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,166
Nai. Gareki. Follow me.

132
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,041
[AKARI] Tea.

133
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,416
Thank you.

134
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,791
[AKARI] Please take a seat.

135
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,958
[NAI] But Yogi--

136
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,625
[AKARI] He's what
we're here to discuss.

137
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,583
But I need to ask
you a few questions.

138
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,041
[GAREKI]
Questions? Sure thing.

139
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,208
Tell me how Yogi's
holding up first.

140
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,041
[AKARI] He has received
all necessary treatment

141
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,833
and is sleeping soundly.

142
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,000
Give me a detailed
description of the events

143
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,083
leading up to Yogi's change.
And what followed.

144
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,041
[NAI] Oh. The thing.
The thing on his face?

145
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,250
It was missing
when I saw him later.

146
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,583
[AKARI] His patch was missing?

147
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,291
[GAREKI] Yeah, it was,
now that I think about it.

148
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,125
But if he flips out like that
as soon as it comes off,

149
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,416
how the hell does he
put on a new one?

150
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,583
[NAI] Huh?

151
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,250
[GAREKI] Neither of you saw
what happened out there.

152
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:06,666
His hair changed.
Even his eyes.

153
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,916
[NAI] Gareki.

154
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,000
[AKARI] So when did
the patch come off?

155
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,125
[GAREKI] Huh?
So that was...

156
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,625
[AKARI] Yes.
They are connected.

157
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,166
Just know that I am a
professional. And I do not

158
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,625
make treatments that stop
having an effect upon removal.

159
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:30,083
[GAREKI] So then, Yogi's
sick. Or something worse.

160
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,750
[AKARI] Well, it's not
exactly cut and dry.

161
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,666
On rare occasion,
Circus agents

162
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,000
have been known to
develop an allergy.

163
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,708
[GAREKI] Wait.
He's stonewallin' me.

164
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:44,208
There's something
he's not saying.

165
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,541
[GAREKI] Give us a proper
explanation. After all,

166
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,791
we're knee deep in this mess.
We've got every right to know.

167
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:58,291
You're impossible. I thought I
was asking the questions here.

168
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,916
[AKARI] Anyway. The abruptness
of Yogi's transformation

169
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,958
is highly irregular.
Mere contact with varugas

170
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,250
doesn't explain
the reaction.

171
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,750
Did anything else
strange happen to Yogi?

172
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,791
[NAI] Oh!

173
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,833
We went into a room
with a lot of dolls.

174
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,166
Yogi cried because
he was scared!

175
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,875
[AKARI] Dolls, you say?

176
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,166
And you found them while
investigating the mansion?

177
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,958
[GAREKI] Well, specifically...

178
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,083
There was a hidden room
beneath the house.

179
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,625
[GAREKI] Tell me. What
exactly was in the box

180
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,416
Yogi brought
back with him?

181
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,208
[AKARI] Hmm? A box?

182
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,083
[GAREKI] Yeah, the one
in his coat pocket.

183
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,833
A tiny, rusty box.
Rattled a bit.

184
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:43,000
No. Never made it here.
Tell me. Every little detail.

185
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,500
[KIHARU] Um...
Mr. Uro? Here.

186
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,791
[KAGIRI] Uh, Kiharu came across
it during our battle, sir!

187
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,250
[KIHARU] At first glance,
I thought it was one

188
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,041
of Kagiri's weird little toys,
so I grabbed it and...

189
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,333
[URO] If Circus had
actually recovered this,

190
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:11,333
It would have been
evidence against us.

191
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:15,125
We nearly gave ourselves
to them on a silver platter.

192
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:21,666
[URO] Circus. Mere tools
of an effete government.

193
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,583
They hunt down
and capture people

194
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,333
aligned with
our organization.

195
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,708
What they don't know is these
fools are merely the tail

196
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:32,875
to our lizard. Effective for
a time, then replaceable.

197
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,375
[GUARD C] Sir, about
Mistress Eleska.

198
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,916
[URO] Later.

199
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,958
[URO] But these discarded tails
are inexplicably drawn to us.

200
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,541
They long for a place,
and to find it,

201
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,500
they'll gladly perform
however we desire.

202
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,833
They yearn to touch the
horizons we command.

203
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,291
The sacrifices of these
fools don't matter

204
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:58,458
when compared to the power
and hope they help to conceal.

205
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,625
[TSUKUMO] Possessors.

206
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,750
I could easily eliminate them
here and now, but that would

207
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,833
give away my position, and
more would surely show up.

208
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:18,291
I'm all alone. I have to
focus on getting out alive.

209
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:24,833
But... If I... If I
don't make it out...

210
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,208
[TSUKUMO] I'll have
to kill myself.

211
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:34,416
Before they catch me, cut me
up and experiment on me.

212
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,625
I cannot afford to leave
even a trace behind.

213
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,041
I wish... I wish I'd spent more
time just talking to them.

214
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,625
More time being
with them. More...

215
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,958
[HIRATO] I have the
utmost faith in you, dear.

216
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,416
[HIRATO] I trust
you, Tsukumo.

217
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,041
[TSUKUMO] Hirato.

218
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,000
[TSUKUMO] Why am I
being so negative?

219
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:08,125
After he trusted me.
Believed in me.

220
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:14,166
[TSUKUMO] I will not meet
my end today. I am Circus!

221
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,375
I will give my life to
no one but my friends!

222
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,041
[AKARI] Bear in mind, all of
this is just conjecture.

223
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,333
But I believe the
box you spoke of

224
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,166
contained part of a Varuga.

225
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,791
Or at the least, material
of a similar origin.

226
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,666
Left abandoned
for long enough,

227
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,458
there's a chance
the elements leaked.

228
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,666
Perhaps saturating
the air in its vicinity.

229
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,083
If that idiot Yogi forgot
to apply a new patch

230
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,791
prior to the mission,
it would be ineffective

231
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:45,458
at suppressing his--"allergy,"
rendering him susceptible.

232
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,458
Even factoring in
all these variables,

233
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,708
his odds of going
berserk were low.

234
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,250
[GAREKI] So what, then?

235
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,416
[AKARI] If he inhaled air
dense with varuga elements,

236
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,083
that might've shifted
the balance.

237
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,625
In theory, varuga elements
infecting his lungs

238
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:04,791
could have caused
unprecedented allergen levels.

239
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,291
[GAREKI] Yeah, "allergens"
my left foot.

240
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,791
[AKARI] His patch comes off,
and the balance tips between

241
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:14,333
the allergens and his body's
cells, causing a reaction.

242
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:24,250
Huh. Doesn't really
sound too stable.

243
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,750
[GAREKI] Y'know.
There's something

244
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,666
I've always wondered about.

245
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,916
Circus's powers, weapons,
and stuff. How's that all work?

246
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,958
[AKARI] You'd be better
served asking Hirato.

247
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,791
Actually... Ask Tsukitachi.

248
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,375
[GAREKI] Oh?

249
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,416
[AKARI] Yogi and Tsukumo are out
of action for the time being.

250
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,166
So for the
forseeable future...

251
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,125
The two of you are in the
custody of Airship One.

252
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,000
That said, it's getting
late. Off to bed with you.

253
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,041
[GAREKI] Nai.

254
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,583
[NAI] Yeah?

255
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,041
[GAREKI] Earlier, when
we were with the Doc...

256
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,833
Did you follow what
he was saying?

257
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,500
[NAI] I think I did, yeah.

258
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:17,208
[GAREKI] Heh.
'Kay, Mr. Pants On Fire.

259
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:27,708
[NAI] But I mean it, Gareki.
I do understand now.

260
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,333
Well, better than before.

261
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,125
I can tell when you're
thinking about Yotaka.

262
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,666
Thinking about all
that happened.

263
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,875
Sleeping here, in our room,
it all comes raining down.

264
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:48,333
[NAI] The heavy sadness. That
sharp feeling in your heart.

265
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,833
That darkness
grabbing onto you.

266
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,875
But every morning
when I see you,

267
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,000
you're the same old Gareki.

268
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,666
So I've never had
the nerve to ask.

269
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:03,291
[NAI] You see, it's so
peaceful and quiet at night.

270
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,791
I can hear every tiny voice.

271
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:09,916
[NAI] Maybe since I sleep
so close to the window,

272
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,916
I'll be able to hear Tsukumo
out there somewhere.

273
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:19,208
[NAI] Are they all in danger?
Is it because of me?

274
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,541
[NAI] Well? Karoku?

275
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,250
[something screeches]

276
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,333
[KIHARU] Dude?
This is bad.

277
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,708
[KAGIRI] We better
catch that chick

278
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,916
or it's game over
for both of us.

279
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,666
[KIHARU] Then let's
find her, man!

280
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,750
[something roars]

281
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,000
[TSUKUMO] Okay, here's how
this works. Keep quiet.

282
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,458
Or I snap your
neck like a twig.

283
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,708
Slowly. Raise your
hands above your head.

284
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:23,625
[TSUKUMO]
A hidden... needle?

285
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,666
[KAROKU] I'm sorry, Tsukumo.

286
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,250
You've shown Nai such
kindness. I thank you.

287
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,000
[KAROKU]
Sometimes life is a gas.

288
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,541
Sometimes you cry till it hurts.

289
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,333
Nai? Hear me.

290
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,875
[URO] Master Karoku. Miss
Eleska wishes to visit you.

291
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,458
[KAROKU] I'd like
a visit as well.

292
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,875
[URO] Of course. I shall
alert her ladyship at once-

293
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:47,500
[KAROKU] Nai.
Where are you right now?

294
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,875
[URO] Karoku. Sir?

295
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,416
[KAROKU] Nai?
