00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,291
[GAREKI] Yotaka.

2
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,458
[GAREKI] Holy crap.

3
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:06,166
[YOTAKA] I'm just
so... So hungry.

4
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,833
[YOGI] Get out of here. Just go.
Take Nai and run for it.

5
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:54,250
[GAREKI] Oh, yeah, right!
How 'bout you run?

6
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,625
[YOGI] He's beyond listening
to reason, I'm sorry.

7
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,791
[YOGI] If you don't
wanna die, clear out now.

8
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,250
[YOGI] He's on the move.

9
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,833
[YOGI] Meet'cha
back in Karasuna!

10
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,041
Don't worry,
I'm a professional!

11
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,041
[YOGI] I'll see
you there soon.

12
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,666
[GAREKI] Bastard!
He expect me to turn tail

13
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,791
and run from my
friends? Screw that!

14
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,083
[GAREKI] I owe them.

15
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,708
[TSUBAKI] We need
to give you a name.

16
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,666
How 'bout the characters
for "flower pebble"?

17
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,583
"Gareki." You like?

18
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,416
Work with me here.
We're family now.

19
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,583
Still sounds lame.
Fine, whatever.

20
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,291
[YOUNG YOTAKA] Here.

21
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,791
Why'd gramps make
me bag up the scraps

22
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,833
from the factory floor
to give to you?

23
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,541
What's up? Are you
like some kind of genius?

24
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,833
Come on. What's the
hold-up, Gareki?

25
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:09,041
We're waiting on you so
we can sit down and eat.

26
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,625
[YOUNG GAREKI] What?
Why not just eat without me?

27
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,500
[YOUNG TSUBAME]
Ah! There's Mr. Fix-it!

28
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,083
What? I'm busy.

29
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,875
Oh, um, well. We, uh...

30
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:36,083
Nothin' major, really.
Just kinda, sorta.

31
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,750
I dunno. We were...

32
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,083
Trying to track ya down.

33
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,458
Jeez, she wouldn't
shut up about it.

34
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,916
[YOTAKA] Gareki.

35
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,875
[GAREKI] Oh, great.
Why're you here?

36
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,166
[YOTAKA] Making sure my
sister didn't follow you.

37
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,166
Because I worry about her!

38
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,666
[YOTAKA] And I can
see I was right to.

39
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,041
Guns and crap. Why you think
you need that is beyond me.

40
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,250
Why'd you even
come back, anyway?

41
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,125
[GAREKI] Hey,
this ain't about me.

42
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,333
[YOTAKA] The hell
it's not, you son--

43
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,791
[GAREKI] Shut your trap.

44
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,583
You don't talk to
me like that. Ever.

45
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,875
You're not my brother
and you never will be.

46
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,333
Hell, you think I wanna live in
that sinkhole with you guys?

47
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,708
[GAREKI] You wanna
know why I'm here?

48
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,791
'Cause I'm knee deep
in the kind of crazy

49
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,208
that'd get hicks like you
and Tsubame eaten alive.

50
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:44,458
[GAREKI] Get out of here.
Now. This ain't for you.

51
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,166
[YOTAKA] You can go to hell!

52
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:59,416
[GAREKI] I'm not someone you get
close to. That's just how it is.

53
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,333
Life always boils it down to
one of three choices, right?

54
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:08,250
Enemy. Obstacle.
Or easy mark.

55
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,375
[GAREKI] She out
of her mind? Idiot.

56
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:25,208
[GAREKI] Nai. You can make it
to Karasuna by yourself, right?

57
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,208
[GAREKI] Just follow
the road we came in on.

58
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,625
Go straight and it's a day's
walk from here at most.

59
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,250
No problem.

60
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,583
Look, I'll even give you
my jacket. You'll be fine.

61
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,083
[NAI] No way!

62
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,708
[NAI] I don't wanna;
you can't make me!

63
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,291
[GAREKI] Whoa.
Ease up, hoss.

64
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,291
[NAI] That thing'll get me!

65
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,916
[GAREKI] Grow up already.
It's got a hood.

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,583
You can wear it
like a disguise.

67
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,000
[NAI] It's not just that.

68
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,083
I don't want to leave
you by yourself.

69
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,208
You'll break into a
million pieces if I do!

70
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,416
I'm not going!

71
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,916
Seriously, dude.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,583
C'mon. That's crazy talk.
Don't worry. Least not about me.

73
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,833
Where was this with Yogi?
He's the wuss.

74
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,083
[NAI] Nuh-uh.
He's strong.

75
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,875
[GAREKI] Wha-- Wait.

76
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,500
If you're trying
to say I'm weak,

77
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,916
I'll kick your ass from
here to tomorrow!

78
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,416
Think you can protect me,
huh, big shot?

79
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,166
[GAREKI] Damn it, Nai.
Just listen, okay?

80
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,208
You wanna see
Karoku again, right?

81
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,291
That's your thing.
Take it from a pro:

82
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,541
Don't let yourself
get blown off course.

83
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,708
Play the game; use Circus.

84
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:39,333
I hate to admit this,
'cause it's lame, but...

85
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,916
Thing is, I don't know
which way is up anymore.

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,208
Not since seein' poor Tsubame
with that look in her eyes.

87
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,041
Seein' Yotaka
worried about her.

88
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:56,666
Yogi's gonna try and kill them.
I know he is. He's gotta.

89
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,791
But I just can't
stand by and watch.

90
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,083
They're still my friends.

91
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,458
I left them, yeah.

92
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,666
But I wanted them to
be okay, you know? Safe.

we were in. Lay low there.

95
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,166
And don't lose any sleep
over me, all right?

96
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,708
[GAREKI] Snap out of it.

97
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,666
It's not about you,
it's about your promise.

destroyed your family

let myself get blown off course?

101
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,833
Like, by friends?

102
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:59,125
[NAI] So if things aren't
my problem, I should just...

103
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,291
[NAI] Yeah, no. If he
really believed that,

104
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,916
he wouldn't've gone back. He's
only trying to keep me safe.

00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:38,750
This is what we call efficiency.
Makes research a breeze.

154
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,500
[NAI] Yogi.

155
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,541
[MEIGA] You know
what this calls for?

156
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,875
I mean, we're all
friends here, aren't we?

157
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,625
Why not make it a party?

158
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:53,166
We've already got a
first-class spread. Chow down!

159
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,583
[GAREKI] Yotaka.

160
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,625
[YOTAKA] Gareki.

161
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,875
[GAREKI] What the
hell's gotten into you?

162
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,541
You look like a goth.

163
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,583
[YOTAKA] So suddenly
you care. Awesome.

164
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,250
[YOTAKA] We're not brothers.
Never will be.

165
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,541
[GAREKI] You selfish prick.
Think about what

166
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,708
you're putting your sister
through--and the old man.

167
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:50,166
[YOTAKA] Shut your trap!
You left! You ran out!

168
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,833
And now you're gonna die!

169
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,541
[Meiga laughs]

170
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:59,875
[MEIGA] That's the stuff. Gimme
teen angst at a boil any day.

171
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,000
[GAREKI 'Scuse me?
Who're you?

172
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,083
[MEIGA] Loaded
question there, champ.

173
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,375
Let's go with
"an interested party."

174
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,875
Suffice it to say I've got
an appetite for games.

175
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,083
[Meiga laughs]

176
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,375
[MEIGA] The more twists and
turns, the better my data.

177
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,708
[MEIGA] Your pal got
wise to my prescription,

178
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,250
started wolfing down
Tsubame's share.

179
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,416
His transformation
escalated, of course,

180
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,875
but what's fascinating is

181
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,041
the girl's change is
fully psychosomatic.

182
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,875
[MEIGA] Even once he knew
what was in store for him,

183
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,000
Yotaka stuck to the regimen to
keep his family in the black.

184
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,041
There's a lesson in
that for all of us.

185
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,875
[TSUBAME] Yotaka, no!

186
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:44,500
[GAREKI] You bastard.
It was you. Wasn't it?

187
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,916
[GAREKI] You're a murderer.

188
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,333
[MEIGA] Hm?
Ah, the older one

189
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,333
who tried to get
'em off the meds.

190
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,625
[MEIGA] Yeah, no,
see, when his powers

191
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:02,250
first got its hooks into 'im,
Yotaka lost control.

192
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,416
Big sis roared, thinkin'
she could rein him in.

193
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,375
Man, quite a sight.
What'd I tell ya?

194
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,833
The more twists
and turns, the better.

195
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,625
[MEIGA] Why would I kill a
fine piece of ass like that?

196
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,833
[GAREKI] You're a liar!
You did it!

197
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,541
I'm not gonna believe
a word of your crap!

198
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:32,083
[MEIGA] Yes, yes, I remember
you; the one who left.

199
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,458
[MEIGA] Too bad you
didn't stick around, eh?

200
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:38,666
But it's never too late to earn
your wings. Isn't that right?

201
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,375
[GAREKI] Varuga!

202
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,416
[MEIGA] There's always
room for one more.

203
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,375
[MEIGA] Son of a bitch;
thought you were dead.

204
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,166
Aw, kids today.

205
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,416
[MEIGA] Front and
center, Yotaka.

206
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,875
Kill 'em all.
That's an order.

207
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,000
[TSUBAME] Yotaka!
Don't listen to him! Please!

208
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:22,541
That's not who you are!
You're not a killer like him!

209
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,125
[YOTAKA] No, I'm not.

210
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,791
[MEIGA] Hm.

211
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,625
[YOTAKA] Sorry, sir.

212
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,541
[YOTAKA] Piss off.

213
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:43,958
[MEIGA] Hmph. Hey, what do
you know? Fascinating stuff.

214
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:48,041
Apparently love is
psychosomatic as well.

215
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,916
Of course.
I wondered why

216
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,833
you could never fully
shed your humanity.

217
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,750
Tsubame's influence
kept pulling you back

218
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:59,291
from your new state. As twins,
you share a unique bond.

219
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,875
One I should have taken
into consideration.

220
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,333
And here you've led
such a hard-scrabble life

221
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,250
up to this point.
What on earth is the appeal

222
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,500
in being human
when that's your lot?

223
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,833
[YOTAKA] You'll never know.
Few people ever really do.

224
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,250
[YOTAKA] When you're down
and out, you take meaning

225
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:26,416
where you can. In a smile, a
tear--whatever. It's beautiful.

226
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,875
[YOTAKA] You know,
I pity you.

227
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:36,791
[MEIGA] Is that right?
Well, I've lost interest.

228
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,125
[MEIGA] You'd do well to
bear this in mind, buck-o.

229
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,291
Like it or not, you're your
own thing from here on out.

230
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:47,166
Those warm fuzzies are just
an echo of your past life.

231
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,250
[Yotaka winces,
screams in pain]

232
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,791
[TSUBAME] No!
What's happening?

233
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,833
[MEIGA] Evolution, sweetheart.
There's no denying progress.

234
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,791
[MEIGA] Do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

235
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,958
But watch, 'cause this
is where it gets good!

236
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,583
[TSUBAME] Stop this!

237
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,166
[YOTAKA] Gareki.

238
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:25,666
Kill me now. I...
I can't... hold out.

239
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,750
[YOTAKA] I don't want
to do this anymore.

240
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,291
I'm tired of hurting
people. Please!

241
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,708
[YOTAKA] Don't think
about it! Make it stop!

242
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,583
Just kill me, damn you!

243
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,208
[YOTAKA] Now!

244
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,500
[YOTAKA] Tsubame.

245
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,708
[TSUBAME] Yotaka.

246
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,625
[YOTAKA] Fly away from here.

247
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:52,083
You're free. So go.

248
00:21:55,291 --> 00:22:00,041
Yotaka!!

249
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,125
[NAI] What smells so nice?

250
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,000
[KAROKU] We call it a flower.
They give off a fragrance.

251
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,291
[NAI] Can you eat it?

252
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,083
[KAROKU] No. Best to
just sit back and admire.

253
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,291
[NAI] Oh. Like your fragrance!

254
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,750
[KAROKU] What?

255
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,875
[NAI] You smell like sunshine!
