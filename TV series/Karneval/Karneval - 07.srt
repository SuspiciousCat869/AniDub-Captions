1
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:06,250
[YOGI] Poor Gareki. He's still
in a foul mood. More than usual.

2
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,958
[TSUKUMO] It doesn't surprise
me. It's only been a week

3
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,958
since he lost the only
family he'd ever known.

4
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,291
[YOGI] I've got it!
Circus is putting on a show.

5
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,666
You and Gareki
should join in!

6
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,208
[NAI] Huh?

7
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,500
[YOGI] See, it takes time to
work your way through the grief.

8
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,916
And what better distraction than
a production? Bye bye, sorrow!

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,708
[NAI] Yeah! I'm in!

10
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,208
[NAI] Wow!

11
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,416
[NAI] Gareki. You look
completely different!

12
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,291
[GAREKI] Huh? I guess so.
New suit and all.

13
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,416
[YOGI] What Nai is saying--

14
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,291
at least, what I
think he's saying--

15
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,625
is that you look royally cool!

16
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:57,875
[GAREKI] Pain in my ass.
Dressing up. Why bother?

17
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,875
No investigation
was conducted.

18
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,333
So why go through
all the trouble?

19
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,666
[YOGI] We're here to support
Team One this time.

20
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,500
Since we happened to be
in the same town anyway,

21
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,666
they asked us to help
out with the show!

22
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,625
[YOGI] Face painting
and sweet treats!

23
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,083
So much awesome!
Right? Back me up here!

24
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,375
[YOGI] By the way,
Tsukumo dear...

25
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,125
Why on Earth did you
agree to wearing that?

26
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,833
[TSUKUMO] I... don't
understand the question.

27
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:30,875
♪

28
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,333
[NAI] So, Gareki.
Y'having fun?

29
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,416
[GAREKI] Eh? Sure.

30
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,250
[NAI] Gareki is sad because he
lost the people most important

31
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:06,708
to him. I think you call
people like that... "family"?

32
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,250
I wonder how you become
important to someone else?

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
[GAREKI] Watch where
you're going, huh?

34
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,208
[GAREKI] Hmm?

35
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:38,333
[NAI] Somehow, Gareki feeling
sad makes me feel sad.

36
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,375
I guess that makes
Gareki important to me.

37
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,333
How do I become
important to him?

38
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:49,125
He saved me, which made
me happy--very happy.

39
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,250
And Tsubaki.
She rescued him as well,

40
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,333
and her kindness and
warmth made them family.

41
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,958
[NAI] So does the warmth
come from being kind?

42
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:06,625
I think it must. Have I been
nice to everyone, every time?

43
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:10,458
How do I make Gareki
feel warm when he's sad?

44
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:20,166
[NAI] I remember Karoku
was nice. Was warm. But...

45
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,541
[KAROKU] Best to send the new
guy packin'. You know this.

46
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:32,416
[NAI] Karoku's words scared me.
Why would he say that?

47
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,833
[NAI] I wonder where Karoku is.

48
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,625
And when I do find him...
What then?

49
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:40,791
[NAI] Hmm?

50
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,458
[BOY A] Circus is wicked sweet!

51
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,541
[BOY B] Oh man, that's cool!

52
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,875
--He has horns!
--Kid. Tone it down.

53
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,625
[BOY A] Hey, mister.
Do you have horns for real?

54
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,958
[BOY B] Let us touch them!

55
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,541
[BOY A] Yeah, let us touch!

56
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,041
[Yogi laughs]

57
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,166
[YOGI] You're a big hit with
the kids, Gareki! Well done!

58
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,375
[GAREKI] Whatever.
Just get 'em outta my way!

59
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:01,083
[YOGI] Hey, kids!
I've got candy bars!

60
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,041
Okay, everyone
get in line!

61
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,708
[KIICHI] We don't have the time!

62
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,333
[YOGI] Whoa! Uh...
Kiichi! What's up?

63
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,916
[KIICHI] One of our
high-performance rabbits

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,416
malfunctioned and
escaped into the crowd.

65
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,791
I shall allow you
to help search for it.

66
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,750
[YOGI] Sorry. Kinda busy.
And a candy bar for you...

67
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,958
[KIICHI] Listen to me!
This is an emergency!

68
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,791
Its defense protocols
are on the fritz.

69
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,541
It could misread children's
mischief and attack!

70
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,791
[YOGI] Look, now's
really not a good time.

71
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,375
[KIICHI] The security
force cannot keep pace

72
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,958
with the rabbit's capabilities.

73
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,375
And yours truly is the only
member of Team One available.

74
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,416
[TSUKUMO] I'll go.

75
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,166
[YOGI]
What? Uh...

76
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,875
But you're supposed to be
on stage in a little while.

77
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,958
Fine, then. I'll go.

78
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,500
[YOGI] Hey, big sis. I've got
to step away for a bit.

79
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,250
Could you keep an eye
on Nai and Gareki for me?

80
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,958
[IVA] O-lé!

81
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,333
[YOGI] I'm not sure
she was listening.

82
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:12,916
Uh, well then.
Bye bye, perona!

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,750

a'posed to mean?

84
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,666
[YOGI] Uh, bye bye, perona.

85
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,291
[BOY A] Y'can't leave until
you do that thing for us!

86
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,500
[GIRL A] Why're you leaving?

87
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,291
[BOY B] Do you hate us now?

88
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:28,875
[YOGI] Of course not! I've got
an important mission is all.

89
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,416
[children start crying]

90
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,625
[NAI] I'll help! I can
hand out the sugar!

91
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,458
[YOGI] Well, the thing is...
I appreciate you wanting

92
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,708
to help, but our difference
in size is rather... Huh?

93
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,791
Gareki, my pal!

94
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,791
[KIICHI] You're late!

95
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,416
[YOGI] Sorry, so sorry.

96
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,250
[KIICHI] What's with all
those marks on your face?

97
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,541
[YOGI] Yeah, that...
took some convincing.

98
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,750
[NAI] Gareki?
He's... gone.

99
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,916
[NAI] Oh. Yogi.
I can't find Gareki.

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,666
[NAI] Um. Yogi?
Is something wrong?

[BOY B] Nyanta!
Wait, are you shorter now?

103

are all saggy.

part of the show!

Gareki's missing!

[IVA] Don't you worry.
Gareki's nearby.

110
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,750
Handing out sweet dreams
to all the children in town.

111
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,416
It's one of our
most important jobs.

Let's take another crack

at the love
declaration scene.

passion. From the top!

Wait. Wait a second. Sorry.

[DIRECTOR] Ugh! What?

120
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,458
[TSUKUMO] It's unusual for
you to flub a scene, Jiki.

121
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:26,958
[JIKI] No. I... It's,
uh... Your costume is...

122
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,583
[TSUKUMO] I'll put on my proper
costume before the show.

123
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,166
[JIKI] Yeah. That'd be great.

to worry about. I think.

[KIICHI] Oh, come on. Where'd
you run off to? Dumb rabbit!

128
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,708
[YOGI] No sign anywhere.

129
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,625
[KIICHI] How hard is it
to find one stupid robot?

130
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,583
Are you even looking
with your eyes?

131
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,625
[YOGI] Yes, Kiichi,
I'm looking.

132
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,083
[KIICHI] You and I took the
same test to make our rank.

133
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,125
Yet you screw up
on a daily basis!

134
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,125
I'd say my doubts are valid.

135
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,291
[YOGI] You keep
bringing up our rank.

136
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,083
Maybe you just suck at
standardized testing.

137
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,791
It doesn't really matter now.

138
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,625
[KIICHI] Yes, it does!
It means that you,

139
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:18,750
who scored the same on the test
as me, will be seen as my equal!

[YOGI] Kiichi,
stop with the flailing!

141

[KIICHI] What's
with you, anyway?

142
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,916
Showing sympathy and
hesitating in the field?

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Mishandling your power--

144
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,291
[KIICHI] That's exactly the kind
of behavior I'm talking about!

145
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,458
You see one person in trouble
and you turn into a kitten!

146
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,708
And that blinds you to
the needs of the masses!

147
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:43,041
[YOGI] Yeah, maybe.
I do get sidetracked.

148
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,916
"The masses," huh?

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,708
Of course! The bunny-bot!

150
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,458

in total overdrive, right?

That means it'll
try to be on guard

152
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,291
at a place with a
bunch of people.

153
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,125
--The plaza theater!
--The plaza theater!

154
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,791
[TSUKUMO] I hope they've
tracked down the rabbit.

155
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,541
[TSUKUMO] Come in.

156
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,791
[JIKI] Showtime.
You about ready?

157
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,500
[JIKI] On behalf of Team One,
allow me to extend my thanks!

158
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,416
We'll stage the most romantic
play this town has seen!

159
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,333
[TSUKUMO] My analysis of
the text differs from yours.

160
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,708
Let me break it down.

161
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,375
A petulant, overcompensating
General finds his desire

162
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,541
for a beautiful young
Mermaid unreciprocated.

163
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,375
In a fit of inadequacy,
he bottles her up.

164
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,541
signifying his impotence.

165
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,208
[JIKI] Uhh! Wow.
I didn't think o'that!

166
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,416
Tough crowd...

167
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,541
[JIKI] We should go over the
workings of the contraption.

168
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,458
[JIKI] Now, when I
sit down on the bed,

169
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,375
the bottom of the jar
you're in will open.

170
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,666
Bubbles will surge up,
masking your flush to safety.

171
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,250
The mermaid's escape
knocks the socks

172
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,125
off the audience every time.

173
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,958
You'll do fine. So get out
there and break a fin.

174
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,250
What do you say?

175
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,791
[TSUKUMO] Sure.

176
00:11:55,916 --> 00:12:02,125
[KIDS] Shing! Ba-zing! Behold
the manliness! The epic-ness!

177
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:06,041
You've rubbed this
kitty the wrong way!

178
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,416
[JIKI] Soon, my dear, the
drug I secretly administered

179
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,333
will take effect,
turning you human.

180
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,541
[JIKI] I shant present
you to the king.

181
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,958
Soon enough you'll
be a proper woman.

182
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,291
And then I shall make you
mine on this very bed!

183
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,708
[MAN A] Man, what a lech!

184
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,208
[MAN B] Cold-blooded snake!

185
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,583
[WOMAN A] Poor Mermaid.
Hang in there!

186
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,833
[JIKI] Now seal her in!
Soon you will transform.

187
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,583
And you won't survive
submerged for long.

188
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,208
[JIKI] Do you hear me?

189
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,333
Joining me is the only
chance you have left.

190
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,375
[JIKI] I think I'll wait
for you on the bed.

191
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,416
[RABBIT] The bottom
is about to open, hop.

192
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,791
It's broken, hop?
Time to weld, hop-hop.

193
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,958
[IVA] You did great out there.

194
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,958
[GAREKI] Ah, that bastard!

195
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,750
[NAI] Wait. Gareki?
Not Yogi?

196
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,000
[GAREKI] I'm 'onna kill him.

197
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,958
Tsukumo's play should be drawing
to a close any minute now.

198
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,500
Why don'tcha kick back,
take a load off?

199
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,791
[NAI] I hear... Tsukumo?

200
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,333
[GAREKI] Huh?

201
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,458
[NAI] She's saying something.
But it's so faint.

202
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,000
[GAREKI] What is it?

203
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,583
Your super-hearing pick
something up again?

204
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:37,458
[NAI] "I can't breathe.
Trap door... won't open."

205
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,625
[TSUKUMO]
What should I do?

206
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,000
I can't just break
through the glass.

207
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,250
The people in the front
rows will be cut to ribbons.

208
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,916
[JIKI] Is she stuck?

209
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,166
[TSUKUMO] Jiki.

210
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,000
[JIKI] I grow tired
of all this waiting.

211
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,583
I'll drag you out
of there if I must!

212
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,458
[JIKI] What the...
A rabbit?

213
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:29,041
[RABBIT] Attempted vandalism,
hop. Neutralize target, hop.

214
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,458
[MAN A] What is that
rabbit doing here?

215
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,791
[MAN B] Must be a
friend of the Mermaid.

216
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,958
[JIKI] That is a Team One
rabbit. Must be the one

217
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,458
reported malfunctioning.
Stupid heap of junk!

218
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,166
[JIKI] This is bad.
Time is running out!

219
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,041
[KIICHI] Last place to check
is inside the theater!

220
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,583
[YOGI] Was that Iva?

221
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,583
[DIRECTOR] There's got to
be a way to open that thing!

222
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,958
[STAGEHAND] The trapdoor
is welded shut;

223
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,041
it'll take more time to cut
open than she has left!

224
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,000
[DIRECTOR] Miss Iva!

225
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,041
Poor Miss Tsukumo is trapped
inside of the Mermaid tank!

226
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,625
Master Jiki nobly tried
to break her out of it,

227
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,458
only to be stopped by
a Team One Rabbit!

228
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,166
[IVA] Very well, then.

229
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,250
[IVA] All of you: listen up.

230
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,666
You will play your parts
exactly as instructed.

231
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,250
[ALL] What?

232
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,875
But we haven't seen a script
or rehearsed or anything.

233
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,208
[YOGI]
That's gonna leave a mark.

234
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,875
[TSUKUMO] Everyone.

235
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,416
[IVA] It serves you right,
General Jiki!

236
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,125
Surprised? We joined forces
to punish you. I've partnered

237
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,708
with the rabbit and the
Mermaid's brothers three.

238
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,125
[JIKI] Iva?

239
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,666
[GAREKI] Tch.

240
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:57,375
[YOGI] Ah. Thank the waves,
you're safe! Oh darling sister.

241
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,000
[GAREKI] We became
human for you

242
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,875
and have come to,
uh, rescue you.

243
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,250
[NAI] Hail, little sister!

244
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:07,291
[YOGI] You accursed scoundrel!
Keep thine distance!

245
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,458
[RABBIT] Hop!

246
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,666
[GAREKI] Now,
return to the castle

247
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,000
with your caring brothers.

248
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,250
[NAI] Hail, little sister!

249
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,666
[RABBIT] Are they helping, hop?
Must be good guys, hop.

250
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,708
[RABBIT] Hop hop!
hop hop! Hop hop...

251
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,458
[KIICHI] And now
the time comes

252
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,666
to wake from your dreams
and thus journey home.

253
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,833
[JIKI] I'll admit, I was
worried there for a moment.

254
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,750
[IVA] But the curtain has
yet to fall, "General."

255
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,750
This is what you get
for abandoning me

256
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,708
to chase floozy Mermaid tail!

257
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,375
[JIKI] Wha? Ah...

258
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,833
[MAN A] That two-timer!

259
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,416
[WOMAN A] Enemy of women!

260
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,083
[IVA] Moron. What
were you thinking,

261
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,083
endangering
Tsukumo like that?

262
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,916
[JIKI] What? Iva, I...

263
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,291
[IVA] And now you'll pay!
Taste my boot, disgusting cur!

264
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,708
[JIKI] No. Iva, wai--!

265
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,291
[IVA] You address me
as "Your Majesty"!

266
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,416
[YOGI] Tsukumo?
Guys? Everyone ok?

267
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,791
[TSUKUMO] Yes, thank you.
I'll be fine.

268
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,666
[YOGI] Well, that's a relief,
huh? With enough time,

269
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,541
even things like this can
be fondly remembered--

270
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,416
[GAREKI] Sorry, Goldilocks.
Won't happen.

271
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,125
Now lemme smack you
around a little bit.

272
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,666
[YOGI] Huh?
Wait, why? Remember?

273
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,958
You already punched me earlier.
Right? Gareki? Ow!

274
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,583
[GAREKI] Whine like a bitch
and I slap you like a bitch.

275
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,458
Be glad I went so easy!

276
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,958
[YOGI] Yeah.
I actually am grateful.

277
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,708
[GAREKI] Huh?
Whaddaya mean?

278
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,625
[YOGI] Well, y'know. You've
been acting so down lately.

279
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,208
I'm glad you're feeling
energetic enough

280
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,166
to bonk my noggin again!

281
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,500
And also, I'm glad we
did the parade together!

282
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,166
[GAREKI] Idiot.
What are you talking about?

283
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,666
[YOGI] It was your first one
ever, right? How did it go?

284
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,125
Did you have fun?

285
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,000
[GAREKI] Are you kidding
me, dude? Never again!

286
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,250
And what the hell's that
"epic manliness" thing

287
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,333
they kept askin' me to do?

288
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,708
[YOGI] The night is still
young, cats and kitten.

289
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,166
I vote that we go out.
And party hearty!

290
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,833
[NURSE A] No fair!
We should be down there,

291
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,166
front and center,
having an awesome time.

292
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,750
[NURSE B] Yeah, and there's
only one doctor to blame for it.

293
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,458
Even though I dare
not speak his name!

294
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,291
[NURSE C] Shhh!
Girls, Formation Alpha!

295
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,458
[BUSINESSMAN A] Goodness,
you are very dedicated

296
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,625
to your work, Dr. Akari.

297
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,833
But there is a show
tonight, isn't there?

298
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,333
You must've received more
than a few invitations!

299
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,583
I would imagine
you're rather popular!

300
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,666
[AKARI] Ah, with the ladies?
When I find the time.

301
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,791
[BUSINESSMAN A] Yes, of course!

302
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,583
[AKARI] Please excuse me, sir.

303
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,125
[NURSE A] You're not popular
with this lady, buster.

304
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,875
Because of you, I missed
the whole production!

305
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,333
[NURSE B] Not all women
are swept off their feet

306
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,333
by money, looks and status,
Mr. Doctor-man!

307
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,916
[NURSE C] Someone oughtta
"find the time" for Dr. Akari,

308
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,958
then humiliate the jerk.
Make him suffer for once.

309
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,958
[AZANA] Ah, Dr. Akari.

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,791
[AKARI] Azana. What
happened to your face?

311
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,166
[AZANA] Oh, the patient.

312
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,916
It thinks my bedside manner
could stand to improve.

313
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,916
[AZANA] But the lil' guy seems
to be quite fond of you, Doctor.

314
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,666
[AKARI] That's strange.
I've never shown

315
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,375
the beast an
ounce of kindness.

316
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,458
[AZANA] Oh, right.
Here's the report, sir.

317
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,458
[AKARI] There are no
issues with its feed.

318
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,708
And the condition
of the air is nominal.

319
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,916
However, a greater
variety of fresh plants

320
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,791
will further simulate
its natural habitat.

321
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,958
[AZANA] Doctor?
The, uh, report?

322
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,708
[AKARI] How odd.

323
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,666
Mental note: Further study
may require vivisection.

324
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,708
[AKARI] What is
that horrid stench?

325
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,333
[TSUKITACHI] Smoked Tarunero.

326
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,875
[AKARI] Don't eat it here!

327
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,875
You're stinking up
the entire room!

328
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,166
Just so you're aware:
My tolerance threshold

329
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,750
for your antics can be
measured in microns!

330
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,250
[AKARI] Face-time with you
causes my cells to rupture

331
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,791
and die from stress!
Your existence alone

332
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,750
hinders my vital functions!

333
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:32,583
[AKARI] Is it too much to ask?
A little peace and quiet?

334
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:36,458
[AKARI] Go away! Or have I
been speaking too delicately?

335
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,000
[TSUKITACHI] You know,
Doctor, if you took a break

336
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,583
every once in a while, you
wouldn't be so unbearable.

337
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,750
[AKARI] What?

338
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,208
[HIRATO] Standing
can't be comfortable.

339
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,125
I'm sorry, please have a seat.

340
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,166
[AKARI] I'll sit when
I'm damn good and ready!

341
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,541
[TSUKITACHI] Right, right.
Let's just raise

342
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,958
our glasses
and say cheers!

343
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,791
[AKARI] I'm in no
mood for cheers!

344
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,541
[TSUKITACHI]
Down the hatch, then!

345
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,250
[TSUKITACHI] I didn't
mean to get him wasted.

346
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,375
[HIRATO] Yet you kept
filling his glass.

347
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,375
[TSUKITACHI] Yeah, but you
egged him on too, man.

348
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,750
[HIRATO] So?
How did it go then?

349
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,833
[TSUKITACHI] Well. We
managed to shut down

350
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,458
an entire supply route,
which by my count's not too bad.

351
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,375
But that was it. The trail
of clues disappeared.

352
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,833
So yeah. How'd Team Two
like to go to Rinole?

353
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,916
[TSUKITACHI] Come on.
Don't look at me like that.

354
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Just look at it as a chance
to play around in the snow.

355
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,291
It'll be an easy investigation;
just checking on some stuff.

356
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:36,083
I mean, it's kinda
cold there. But, uhhh...

357
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,208
[TSUKITACHI] Ah,
who am I kidding?

358
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,250
It's arctic,
ball-shriveling cold there.

359
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,875
[TSUKITACHI] But hey, for
the lucky bastards you send,

360
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,583
you could spin this as a
holiday destination experience!

361
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:55,208
[KIHARU] Whoa. It's freezing,
bro! Let's get this finished up

362
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,666
so we can make a beeline
for somewhere warm!

363
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,333
[KAGIRI] Wait.
Hold on a sec. Yes!

364
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,000
Triggered a ping in an
unexpected location!

365
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,041
[IVA] What's with
all of these photos

366
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,041
of Tsukumo in her
mermaid costume?

367
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,875
[JIKI] Those are
for, uh, publicity!

368
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,458
[IVA] It seems you still need
more lessons beaten into you.

369
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,958
[JIKI] The play is
already over, Iva.

370
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,083
[IVA] Excuse me?

371
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,416
[JIKI] I mean...
Your Majesty.
