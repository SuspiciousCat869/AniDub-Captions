1
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,750
[HIRATO]
A poison aping death.

2
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,125
[TSUKUMO] Captain...

3
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:18,250
[HIRATO] My sincerest apologies
for the unseasonable shock.

4
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:23,208
[HIRATO] She'll be fine.
I am Airship Two Captain Hirato.

5
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,833
National Defense Agency, Circus.

6
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,541
I shall return
shortly to tender

7
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,833
a more formal act
of contrition.

8
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,583
[OLD WOMAN A] Circus.

9
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,208
[YUKKIN] Yukkin?
Yukkin! Yukkin!

10
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,708
[YUKKIN] Yukkin,
yukkin, yukkin.

11
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,791
[KIICHI] Kindly let these
impossible creatures

12
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,666
log your voice print.
Whatever comes to mind.

13
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,791
[NAI] Oh. Um...
Hello there?

14
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,458
[GAREKI] Rabbit stew.

15
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,375
[GAREKI] So I can say
whatever I--? I hate you, Yogi.

16
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,041
[RABBIT] Voiceprint
registered, hop.

17
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:55,833
[JIKI] Okay, then. Allow me to
welcome you both to Airship One.

18
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,500
[KIICHI] First order
of business.

19
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:02,208
Making sense of this mess. Feel
free to dive in, mops-first.

20
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,458
[KIICHI] I want this place
looking ship-shape again

21
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,958
before the captain returns.

22
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,125
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you expect us

23
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,500
to dust off the good
china for you?

24
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,500
Blame the dolts with
Airship Two. They're hardly

25
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,291
a fair representation
of Circus hospitality.

26
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,333
[NAI] Okay?

27
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,750
[GAREKI] We'll have it
done before you can blink.

28
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,000
[KIICHI] I'll be
pleased to see it done

29
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,125
before I develop
crow's feet.

30
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,625
[JIKI] Where does
she get the energy?

31
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,916
There's no reason we
need to taunt them.

32
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,166
[JIKI] So, Nai I have my
head fairly wrapped around.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,500
[JIKI] Gareki, on the other
hand... No family records.

34
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,541
No paper trail leading
to his stint in Karasuna.

35
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,250
[JIKI] Wait, a human
trafficking ring?

36
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,041
Could... Could that be
the same freighter

37
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,875
Hirato and Tsukitachi
ran aground?

38
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,375
[GAREKI] Next time,
I'm keeping my mouth shut.

39
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:07,333
[RABBIT] Hop. Hop. Hop.
Hop. Hop. Hop. Hop. Hop.

40
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,875
[NAI] What's the matter?

41
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,333
[RABBIT] My fur is all matted
from working outdoors, hop.

42
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,208
[GAREKI] What? Thought
you were state-of-the-art.

43
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,458
They couldn't design ya to
keep from gettin' fuzzballs?

44
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,166
[NAI] I'll brush 'em out!

45
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:25,416
[RABBIT] Thank you so much, hop.
That feels wonderful, hop.

46
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,125
[GAREKI] Things you just
don't think you're gonna see

47
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,916
when you wake up
in the morning.

48
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,041
[GAREKI] Fine.
I give up.

49
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,125
We couldn't have this place
clean if we had a week.

50
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,833
[GAREKI] Yo. Who else
needs a brushing?

51
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:50,208
[RABBITS] Hop!
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop!

52
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,500
[KIICHI] What?

53
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,750
[NAI] Oh, Kiichi.
Look, we're almost finished.

54
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,583
[KIICHI] These creatures are
not your personal maid service!

55
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:00,041
[GAREKI] Maybe not. But no
harm lettin' 'em help, right?

56
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,625
[TSUKITACHI]
Hello, all. Miss me?

57
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,541
[NAI] I heard they
found Tsukumo!

58
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,375
[TSUKITACHI]
Yes, she's fine.

59
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,916
[NAI] Hurray!
Woo-hoo!

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,958
[TSUKITACHI] But Yogi's still
catching up on his rest,

61
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,125
so I think it's for the best
if you boys stay with us

62
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,875
a little longer. If you
like, though, I'm happy

63
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,208
to answer any questions
you might have.

64
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,291
[GAREKI] Yeah I got one for ya.
How's Tsubame doing?

65
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,666
She's hangin' in
there like a trouper.

66
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,083
Asks about you constantly too.

67
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,291
[GAREKI] Yeah, well.
That's good news.

68
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,583
'Course, under our protection,
she's not exactly free as air.

69
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,250
There's a whole slew of
restrictions. For her trouble,

70
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,166
though, Circus shoulders the
burden of her grandpa's bills.

71
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,541
[GAREKI] What?

72
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,583
[TSUKITACHI] Oh, she was
all about that detail.

73
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,083
Said in so many words it freed
his mysterious benefactor

74
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,458
from having to
shell out more cash.

75
00:06:55,041 --> 00:07:00,833
[GAREKI] Yeah. That's good.
Real good. For everyone.

76
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,625
[NAI] Are you...?

77
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,541
Moving on, then. Exactly how
tricked out is this ship?

78
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,625
[TSUKITACHI] Ooh, a
weapons enthusiast!

79
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,625
Hey, let me give you the grand
tour tomorrow and you'll see.

80
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:14,208
[JIKI] Uh, hello! Very
unqualified civilian, sir!

81
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,333
[TSUKITACHI] How else is he
going to get qualified?

82
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,208
The mission I have in mind
happens to play up the origin

83
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,083
of our bracelets, so these two
have a vested interest.

84
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,291
[JIKI] We don't even
have a clear idea

85
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,416
of our target yet, sir!
Worst case scenari--

86
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,916
[TSUKITACHI] If we can't protect
them, what the hell good are we?

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,500
Kiichi agrees.

88
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,625
[KIICHI] Well, naturally,
sir. If Airship Two

89
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,208
can keep them alive,
this'll be a walk in the park.

90
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,666
[TSUKITACHI] Dig in, boys!
Tomorrow's field trip

91
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,958
will be epic!

92
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,583
[JIKI] Okay, see, Captain?
If you call it that,

93
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,625
it sounds like we
don't have work to do!

94
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,833
[JIKI] This is
just a formality.

95
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,583
Since it's our first
mission together and all,

96
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,000
I need to see how
the two of you move.

97
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,541
[JIKI] Let's start
with running away

98
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,666
and I'll do my
best to catch you.

99
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,208
[GAREKI] No prob.

100
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,750
[GAREKI]
How hard can it be?

101
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,000
Guy got his ass handed
to him by a rabbit.

102
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,916
[JIKI] Great.
Ready when you are.

103
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,791
[JIKI] Let me explain
something to you, my friends.

104
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,208
[JIKI] So far the enemy's
been holding back.

105
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,833
At full bore, you won't
stand a chance.

106
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:23,250
Only naïve idiots rely
on luck. Understand?

107
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,833
[JIKI] Let's be real
about your function here.

108
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:30,000
You're a scapegoat--a pawn
in the game for Nai's fate.

109
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,708
[JIKI] If you care
about staying alive,

110
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,541
you might want to take stock.

111
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,458
Maybe go back home,
wherever that is.

112
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,750
[JIKI] If not...
Enjoy the field trip.

113
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,083
[JIKI] Enjoy the field trip.

114
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,458
[RABBIT] Where are
you going, hop?

115
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:06,583
[RABBITS]
Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!...

116
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,875
[TSUKITACHI] Why do you want
to talk to Jiki? What happened?

117
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,125
[NAI] I just, uh...

118
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:24,458
I... I don't want
Gareki to die!

119
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,333
[TSUKITACHI] Uh...
Slow down there, champ.

120
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,583
Back up to the beginning.

121
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:34,000
[NAI] Okay. It's just, this
seems like it's all about me.

122
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,250
And he...

123
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,625
[TSUKITACHI] You feel
guilty that everyone's

124
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,625
getting caught up in trying
to protect you, yeah?

125
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,000
Mm hmm.

126
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,583
[TSUKITACHI] It's the price
we pay for the benefits

127
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,250
you give, kiddo. Think how many
varugas you've reeled in for us.

128
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,208
That amounts to a
lot of lives saved.

129
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,958
[TSUKITACHI] So if you start
to feel bad about using us

130
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,625
to find Karoku, don't.
We do things for each other

131
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,291
and sometimes a little
ugliness goes down.

132
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,708
Doesn't mean it's your fault.

133
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:05,208
[NAI] Well, yeah. Except that I
actually asked Gareki about it.

134
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,541
He's only here because of me.

135
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:11,500
It feels like if something
happens to him, it is my fault.

136
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,333
[TSUKITACHI] Where would you
go right now, if you could?

137
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,583
Where do you think Gareki
would go, if he could?

138
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,958
[TSUKITACHI] It's a hard
world to make a home in.

139
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:27,041
Moreso after seeing the things
you've seen. But listen.

140
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,583
It doesn't mean you don't
deserve happiness.

141
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:33,541
Just that it'll be a
bit harder to come by.

142
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:39,041
[NAI] Would be nice
to be home. To be happy.

143
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,583
An admirable goal to have.
And maybe in some bizarre way,

144
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,458
this is how it has
to happen for you.

145
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,750
You feel guilty
because you care.

146
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:52,375
And if you care,
chances are, you need him.

147
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,458
[NURSE C] No, stop!
Please, sir! It isn't worth it!

148
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,708
[YOGI] Let go, I've got
somewhere to be!

149
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,333
Just make up an excuse
for me or somethi--!

150
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,416
[AKARI] Back in bed, damn you!

151
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
[NURSE C] Oh, thank goodness!

152
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,166
[YOGI] Come on! Gareki
and Nai have been taken in

153
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,875
by the crazies on Airship One.

154
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,291
You have any idea
how they'll be treated?

155
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,000
[AKARI] Airship One
deployed yesterday.

156
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,416
You won't be able to catch up.

157
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,291
[YOGI] Deployed where? Vint?

158
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,916
Your new friends have been
declared essential. I take that

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,416
as a sign that your colleagues
are warming up to them.

160
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,791
[YOGI] No!!

161
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,458
[JIKI] Vint is home to a high
concentration of rare

162
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,000
and endangered species. The
government cordoned it off

163
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,125
as a wildlife reserve. But in
spite of the sanctions, a lot

164
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,541
of critters are still
getting poached.

165
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,541
Trouble is, so are
the poachers.

166
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,416
[KIICHI] Their eyes are
glazing over, Jiki.

167
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,458
You lost them at "endangered."

168
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:50,750
Essentially, boys: looky, no
touchy; stay out of the way.

169
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,416
[GAREKI] Oh, hey.

170
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,083
[AZANA] Never introduced
myself back in Rinole.

171
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,291
Hi, my name is Azana.

172
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,541
[NAI] Your face.
What's wrong with it?

173
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,041
[AZANA] These?
Oh, they're nothing.

174
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,208
Our lab animals tend
to get a little frisky;

175
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,958
they think of me as
their scratching post.

176
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,041
[KIICHI] Stifle the
small talk, gentlemen.

177
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:22,375
I believe we still have an
investigation to get started.

178
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,291
[JIKI] I recommend we
split into two groups.

179
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:28,916
Each group takes one of you Room
of Life folks as its guide.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,708
[TSUKITACHI] Good.
Gareki, you're with me.

181
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,166
We can chat about
artillery and whatnot.

182
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,166
[GAREKI] Cool.

183
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,791
[NAI] Yeah!

184
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,000
[JIKI] Sorry, Nai.
You're mine.

185
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,666
[Nai yells]

186
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:46,166
[KIICHI] Jiki! You forgot
your guide, you moron!

187
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,666
[JIKI] I have no problem writing
someone off who isn't worth

188
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,291
my time, but I'll be damned
if they'll do that to me.

189
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,250
[TAMON] There's definitely a
correlation between the number

190
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:02,791
of poachers found murdered and
the decrease in animal deaths.

191
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:03,875
[AZANA] Hello there!

192
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,166
[TAMON] Cute, huh?
He got that wound

193
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,000
from someone trying
to take his pelt.

194
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,375
[TSUKITACHI] How'd he escape?

195
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,208
[AZANA] The poacher got killed.

196
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,750
[TSUKITACHI] Who found him?

197
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,250
[TAMON] Me. Well,
me and Murano did.

198
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:19,458
Interesting. It's good to see
the little fella's okay, though.

199
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,375
[TSUKITACHI]
What's the haps?

200
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,083
Get any sleep last night?

201
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,708
[GAREKI] Not really.

202
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,416
[TSUKITACHI] So.
About our bracelets.

203
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,041
They incorporate living cells
from the creatures indigenous

204
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,958
to this place. Vint has a most
unforgiving environment.

205
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,458
Short on food,
sunlight, fresh water.

206
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,041
The various animals that call
this little slice o' heaven home

207
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,958
had a rough job
adapting for survival.

208
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,375
Over time, they learned to
metabolize energy sources

209
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,875
in the most efficient
way imaginable.

210
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,750
They evolved a rate
of cellular regeneration

211
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,041
unknown anywhere else.

212
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,625
[TSUKITACHI] This produces
what we call Incuna.

213
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,583
A cell that's
nearly omnipotent.

214
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,000
Which Circus uses to
rather dazzling effect.

215
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,541
Observe.

216
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,500
[GAREKI] All that
from a single cell.

217
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,791
[TSUKITACHI] Yep. But its powers
don't come without a price.

218
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,416
[GAREKI] Huh?

219
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,250
[TSUKITACHI] An Incuna's power
is far from straightforward.

220
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,208
Handled inexpertly, it can,
among other things,

221
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,708
knock you on your ass.

222
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,791
See, Circus cherry-picks its
operatives from those in the

223
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,250
general populace genetically
inclined to wield such power.

224
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,250
Even then, years of
training are required.

225
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:43,000
[ISOSA] The poachers' remains
were found right around here.

226
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,333
[KIICHI] Judging from
the circumstances,

227
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,750
I think it's safe to say
these were varuga attacks.

228
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,958
[ISOSA] A frightening
possibility.

229
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,541
[KIICHI] Strange they
should target poachers

230
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,958
specifically, though. They're
not usually so discriminating.

231
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,291
[NAI] Jiki.
Something's nearby.

232
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,333
[JIKI] Aw.
It's only a moss lizard.

233
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,791
[NAI] That's not what I heard.

234
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,625
[ISOSA] Murano, don't!

235
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,458
[MURANO] Kiri, please! They're
not poachers! They're with me!

236
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,958
[NAI] Yeah, that would be it.

237
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,416
[ISOSA] It's very
skittish around people.

238
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,000
Poor thing was almost
killed by poachers.

239
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,666
[MURANO] Aw, son of a--!
Kiri! Calm down!

240
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,208
[ISOSA] Kiri!

241
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,875
[MURANO] Damn it, come on!

242
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,416
Why do you have to
be so predictable?

243
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
[KIICHI] Please.
Spare me the show.

244
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:11,000
You've known how this would
end for a long time now.

245
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,375
[KIICHI] And I'm sorry.

246
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,208
But it's in our job description
to be "predictable."

247
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,458
We're here for a reason and
that's all there is to it.

248
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,666
[MURANO]
Kiri! Run away!!

249
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,708
[TSUKITACHI] Huh. Guess
the gang's hit pay dirt.

250
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,875
[GAREKI] What does that mean?

251
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,875
Don't worry, son. Nai is being
very well taken care of.

252
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,583
[MURANO] Kiri!

253
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,166
[JIKI] Nai! Move!

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,666
[NAI] Yogi?

255
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,500
[YOGI] Einsam Zelle!

256
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,625
[MURANO] Kiri!

257
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,541
[YOGI] Close, huh?
You alright?

258
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,083
[NAI] Mm hmm.

259
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,625
[MURANO] What was
I supposed to do?

260
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:15,291
[MURANO] She was dying.
The drug was her only hope.

261
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,750
I had no choice.

262
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,166
[MURANO] Yes, the
price was high.

263
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,750
But I'm sworn to
protect these creatures.

264
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,083
[MURANO] Not just Kiri.
All of them.

265
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,833
I wanted the power
to save lives!

266
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,375
[JIKI] I want details as to
how you obtained the drug.

267
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,625
[MURANO] My contact was
anonymous. But he...

268
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,250
He supposedly worked under
Akari, so I trusted him.

269
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,208
[JIKI] How conveniently vague.
But that's all right.

270
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,000
Perhaps an interrogation
will bring things into focus.

271
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,958
[ISOSA] No, please! It's not
like he's a bad person!

272
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,833
He only wanted to help!

273
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,458
[YOGI] This sucks.

274
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,291
[NAI] Yogi?

275
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,208
[KIICHI] I shall be swift
in ending your misery.

276
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,833
[KIICHI] This sacrifice
will not be in vain.

277
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,041
The Scythe of Castigation
will vanquish

278
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,458
the evil which
plagues your soul.

279
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
[YOGI] Yeah. Sucks.

280
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,125
[GAREKI] Wha--Yogi?

281
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,458
[YOGI] Gareki!

282
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,958
That's, like, the very first
time you've ever used my name!

283
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,500
[GAREKI] Huh?

284
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,416
[YOGI] So you really do care?
Gah! I thought you hated me!

285
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,666
But it turns out
you've just been

286
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,916
playing it close
to the vest!

287
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,208
[GAREKI] Wait, wait, wait.

288
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,375
You're nuts; this wasn't
the first time.

289
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,333
What the hell are you on?

290
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,208
[YOGI] Uh huh! Was too!

291
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,208
[GAREKI] Knock it off! I've
used your name lots of times!

292
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:19,416
Like back in Rinole, when you
went all berserker on me--

293
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,958
[YOGI] I never properly
apologized for that, did I?

294
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,250
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.

295
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,791
[GAREKI] Look, whatever.

296
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,625
The important thing's you're
okay now. You are okay, right?

297
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,708
[YOGI] Never better!
Which means you guys

298
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,583
can come back home to
cozy ol' Airship Two!

299
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,625
[YOGI] Good to be back!

300
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,916
[SHEEP] Baa!
Welcome home.

301
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,208
[SHEEP] Baa.
Welcome home.

302
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,750
[NAI] Good to be back.

303
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,541
Come on, man. Say it.
The super secret password.

304
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,041
[GAREKI] Good to be back.

305
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,583
[SHEEP] Welcome home.

306
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,208
[NAI] Tsukumo!

307
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,291
[YOGI] Jiki, hey.
What're you--?

308
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,125
[JIKI] I've been
given orders to stay

309
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,291
with Nai and Gareki
for a while.

310
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,000
[JIKI] Good to be here.

311
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,458
[KAROKU] How do you suppose
he's getting on out there?

312
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:30,041
[SERVANT A]
Uh... Well, I'd say...

313
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,083
[KAROKU] That's good.
Thank you.

314
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,625
[SERVANT A] This sucks.
I can feel Lady Luck

315
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,583
giving me the stink eye
every time I'm near him.

316
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,791
[SERVANT B] His
condition's actually been

317
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,750
pretty stable lately,
hasn't it?

318
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,500
[SERVANT A] For now, yeah,
but it's only a matter of time.

319
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,833
Waste of resources
if you ask me.

320
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,750
[NAI] Can I ask you a question?
Like a... kind of personal one?

321
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:54,875
[GAREKI] What?

322
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,500
[NAI] Where would
you go if you could?

323
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,583
[NAI] Come on. Where?
Where? Where? I wanna know!

324
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,541
[GAREKI] Shut up! Damn!

325
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,791
[GAREKI] Okay. Weird.

326
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,625
For a second there, it was like
he could see right through me.

327
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:17,541
[GAREKI] Yeah, well, screw that!
I'm a useless piece of crap.

328
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,083
No point in broadcasting it.

329
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,625
A piece of crap that,
every now and then,

330
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,416
stupidly feels like he
can make a difference.

331
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,166
"Where would I go if I could?"
It's not about "could,"

332
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,291
it's about should, in which
case the answer is nowhere.

333
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,708
[YOGI] Come on,
man. Say it.

334
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,208
[GAREKI] "Home." What
does that even mean?

335
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,458
[NAI] Know where'd
I'd go, Gareki?

336
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,958
Somewhere we could
all live together.

337
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:51,416
And if we find Karoku,
he could come too! You'll see.

338
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,666
[NAI] I'm gonna make it happen.
It'll be awesome!

339
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,083
[GAREKI] Will you please stop
flappin' your gums?

340
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,625
[AKARI] Well, nurse.

341
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:06,000
It seems our patient is looking
a bit pale, wouldn't you say?

342
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,166
[TSUKITACHI] What do you care?
The room's clean, isn't it?

343
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,166
[KIICHI] The rabbits
were not theirs to use.

344
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,166
[TSUKITACHI] Yeah, yeah.
Here, have an éclair.

345
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,041
[KIICHI] You're amazing!

346
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,250
[TSUKITACHI]
Jiki! Snack time!

347
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,750
[KIICHI] Oh, these
are wasted on him.

348
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,166
I'll take his share,
thank you very much.
