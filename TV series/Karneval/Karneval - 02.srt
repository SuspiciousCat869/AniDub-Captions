1
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,708
[GAREKI] When's the last
time you ate something?

2
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,083
[NAI] I dunno.

3
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,125
[GAREKI] Fine; I'll go
scrounge up some food

4
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,083
'fore you starve to death.

5
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:59,000
You just... stare off
into space, or whatever.

6
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,708
Karoku.

7
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,625
[AOGIRI] It has been given
us to understand that

8
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:02,916
last night's mission went less
than smoothly, Captain Hirato.

9
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,416
[MAKUNOBE] Another example of
slipshod methodology, no doubt.

10
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,458
D'you gotta talk about
him in the third person?

11
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:10,916
He is right here.

12
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
[BYZANTE]
Captain Tsukitachi,

13
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,583
your interjections
are not welcome.

14
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,250
[HIRATO] If it please you,
I will reflect

15
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,541
upon last night's failure
at great length.

16
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,166
[ISHLAR] We suspect you shall.

17
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,208
[TSUKITACHI]
Royal pains, aren't they?

18
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,833
The older they get, the less
in tune with reality.

19
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,458
[HIRATO] Why did
you bother to come?

20
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,791
[TSUKITACHI] What--
you expect me to miss out

21
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,333
on seeing you get dressed
down by the big wigs?

22
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,291
One day, my friend.
I will end you.

23
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,875
Thanks for taking one for
the team, by the way.

24
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,333
The whole train-hijacking fiasco

25
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,000
was originally supposed to
be Airship One's headache.

26
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,833
[HIRATO] You can owe me.

27
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,166
[TSUKITACHI] Aww.
Virtue's not its own reward?

28
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,250
[KANA] Want some?

29
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,875
[KANA] See, the really neat
thing is, after they've brought

30
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,083
the bad guys to justice,
they put on a big show!

31
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,250
Kind of as a way to let everyone
know things are back to normal.

32
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,625
[NAI] A show?

33
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,750
[KANA] Yeah! Like a circus!

34
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,333
A circus.

35
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,625
Karoku.

36
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,000
Hey. D'you know if someone
named Karoku works for them?

37
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,041
[KANA] Um... Sorry, I don't.

38
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,875
[KANA'S MOM] Kana,
sweetie. Come along.

39
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,583
[KANA] Well, gotta go. Bye.

40
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,916
Thanks again.

41
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,583
[UNDERLING] I've got a
visual on the kid, sir.

42
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,333
Bring him in quietly. Unhurt.

43
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,833
I can't stress that
last point enough.

44
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,375
Roger.

45
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:24,041
You got to be kidding me!
Son of a bitch.

46
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,333
'Scuse me!

47
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,583
[WOMAN] Now, now.

48
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,833
Plenty for all.

49
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,791
Uh, actually...

50
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,916
[MAN'S VOICE]
Easy does it! No shoving.

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,666
One at time, please.
Thank you.

52
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,041
Hey there, sport.

53
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,833
Nai!

54
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,583
[NAI] Sorry, sorry!

55
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,583
He knocked over Nyanperowna.

56
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,833
--[GIRL] Poor kitty.
--[BOY] Are you okay?

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,458
[NAI] Gareki!

58
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,541
[GAREKI] Apparently,
I didn't make it clear enough.

59
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,708
I wanted you to stay put!

60
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,791
[GAREKI] That guy wasn't
a plainclothes cop;

61
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,041
that's not how they operate.

62
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:03,833
What'd he want with Nai?
I don't like this one damn bit.

63
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,500
Get a move on.

64
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,333
[HIRATO] Is anyone in the
vicinity of District Eleven?

65
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,916
[YOGI] Hey. It's Yogi.

66
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,083
[HIRATO] You sound
rather miffed.

67
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,416
[YOGI] Duh! Ya think?

68
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,458
Wait till you hear what
just happened to me!

69
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,250
I was working the parade
when this little kid

70
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,500
barreled over me
like a freight train!

71
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,291
We're talkin'
full-on face-plant!

72
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,291
And while I was down...

73
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,791
New development.

74
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,000
The young man from the train
is currently being pursued.

75
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,166
[TSUKUMO] Do you want me to
take him under our wing, sir?

76
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,166
[HIRATO] I'll send someone else.

77
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,750
[YOGI] Hello?

78
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,500
[HIRATO] You're in the middle of
your act right now, are you not?

79
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:13,125
[YOGI] Hello? Captain!
Are you even listening to me?

80
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,416
We have a situation here!

81
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,916
[NAI] Hey, Gareki.

82
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,208
[GAREKI] What?

83
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,416
[NAI] If we went to Circus,
you think Karoku might be...?

84
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,291
The hell should I know?

85
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,791
We got other things
to worry about.

86
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,083
Contact.
Taser jolt administered.

87
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,000
[NAI] Gareki!

88
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,458
Nope.

89
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,583
What have you done?

90
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,375
Hey. A little help here?

91
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,625
[UNDERLING B] What?

92
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,833
Then what the hell'm I
s'posed to do about him?

93
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,458
[GAREKI] Damn it.
Can't move.

94
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,416
Gareki!

95
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,958
[UNDERLING A] Plug him.

96
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,041
[GAREKI] Sorry, kid.

97
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,958
[NAI] Gareki!

98
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:03,208
[YOGI] Oh, no! Your mothers
taught you better than that!

99
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:07,708
Guns are not toys; especially
around young children!

100
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,250
I can see you need a lesson.

101
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,666
Oh, you cannot be serious!

102
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,375
[YOGI] Candy bars for everyone!

103
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,041
Now what on earth is the point
of all this rough-housing?

104
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,375
Whatever the reason,
Nyanperowna doesn't let

105
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,958
bad manners fly
on his watch!

106
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:33,583
Shing! Ba-zing!
Behold the manliness!

107
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:40,541
The epic-ness! You've rubbed
this kitty the wrong way! Hiss!

108
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:53,458
The name is Yogi. AKA
Nyanperowna of Circus! Me-ow!

109
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,416
Wait, Circus?

110
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,291
[GAREKI] Great, Circus.

111
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,916
Now. Whoever wants a go...
step right up!

112
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,041
But--

113
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,583
Silver lining, I guess;

114
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:21,583
I get so bent outta shape
when things get mano a mano.

115
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,875
Sorry to get your
fur dirty, Nyan.

116
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,833
So. Hi! You're still
in one piece, right?

117
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,083
Well, good. I have
to bring you guys in;

118
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,750
it'd be my ass
if you weren't.

119
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,833
You're not gonna make
a scene, are you?

120
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,375
Uh, actually, I have a really
important question!

121
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:44,500
Oh, yeah?
Give me a second.

122
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:51,833
It's Yogi. Yeppers.
Wait, you heard all that?

123
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,625
[GAREKI] Don't tell me
Circus has actually been

124
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:58,041
trying to track us down.
What the hell's going on?

125
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,291
All right. Let's fly.

126
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,000
Say hello to Airship Two!

127
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,541
I have returned!

128
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,000
[SHEEP] Baa! Welcome home!

129
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,958
Heads up, gents. You'll
wanna say "good to be back."

130
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,416
Good to be back!

131
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,125
[YOGI] Manners, please.

132
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,541
Good to be back.

133
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,000
[SHEEP] Baa!
Voiceprint registered.

134
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,291
[HIRATO] How delightful
that our paths

135
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,250
have crossed again,
wouldn't you agree?

136
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,000
As you may recall,
I am Captain Hirato

137
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,458
of the Supreme National
Defense Agency,

138
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,125
also known as Circus.

139
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:07,250
It is our sworn duty to strike
crime from the earthly register.

140
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,291
That said, we tend
to focus on crimes

141
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,458
of a very specific nature.

142
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,000
Incidents beyond the
means of our othe--

143
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,250
'Scuse me! Karoku.
He's here, right?

144
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,125
Uh, 'cause this
was his bracelet.

145
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:22,500
You see, there was this trail
of red. I mean... Blood.

146
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:26,041
And this is from you guys.
Gareki and that lady both said.

147
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,958
And they were correct.

148
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,250
Its pedigree is
undoubtedly ours. However...

149
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,083
No one by the name of Karoku is
affiliated with us at present.

150
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,250
The bracelet's make is obsolete.

151
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,625
In fact, it ought to have been
disposed of quite some time ago.

152
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,208
If you're intent on finding
this fellow, we are prepared

153
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,583
to cut a deal, provided you
are willing to cooperate.

154
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,416
[NAI] Yes! Whatever it takes!

155
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,208
Question, Gareki.

156
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,500
Are you acquainted
with a Lady Miné?

157
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,083
'Fraid not.

158
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,291
That's adorable. I love it

159
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,416
when callow upstarts
try out their poker face.

160
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,166
You've nothing to fear, son.

161
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,250
Who says I'm scared?

162
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,416
[HIRATO] So we're
to make nothing of

163
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,375
your splendid performance
on the train?

164
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,333
It's patently obvious
you know your way

165
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,750
around an incendiary device.

166
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,000
Do you target corrupt
profiteers on principle?

167
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,666
Or is it catch as catch can?

168
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,791
What would you have done
with her "ladyship's" fortune,

169
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,583
I can't help but wonder.

170
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,291
Please, forgive me.

171
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,833
I don't plan on filing
charges against you.

172
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,125
I only want details
of the confrontation.

173
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,708
Was there blood, for example?

174
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,958
What was she? Really?

175
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,916
[HIRATO] A varuga.

176
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:08,000
For now, suffice it to say that
to their outlawed creators,

177
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:12,500
they are the vanguard of
evolution. Circus disagrees.

178
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,375
Should you come into
contact with their blood...

179
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,041
In time... you'll
become one of them.

180
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:31,375
Naturally, we'll need
to examine you both.

181
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,958
And I'm afraid you have
no legal right to refuse.

182
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,291
Ugh! Come on! Enough!

183
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,916
You're gettin' off on playin' it
all dark and mysterious!

184
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,916
And you know it!

185
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,583
Hello, Yogi.
You startled me.

186
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,666
Oh, and Gareki?

187
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,916
Your conscience
ought to be clear.

188
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,250
She did not die by your hand.

189
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,333
I assume you detest violence.

190
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,541
Nobody wuvs Yogi.

191
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:07,291
[PALNEDO]
Let me guess: Circus.

192
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:13,416
Contact our people in Gavan.
They will no doubt be useful.

193
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:23,458
[MAN'S VOICE] Little blue seeds
make pretty blue blossoms.

194
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:29,333
But I'm on the hunt for special,
lovely little red seeds.

195
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:37,458
[PALENDO] Captain Hirato
of Circus Airship Two.

196
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,416
Impudent cur.

197
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:47,166
[HIRATO] We're currently en
route to Gavan, the Mud House.

198
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,125
I must attend to a burial,

199
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,416
so I leave the charge
of our guests to you.

200
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,291
Sure thing, boss.

201
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,750
Is this to keep us
out of trouble?

202
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,708
With all due respect,
we're being consigned

203
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,916
to the kiddie's table.

204
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,708
Quite the contrary, my dear.

205
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,541
This job is a
reflection of my trust.

206
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:09,000
Bear in mind they
escaped a varuga.

207
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,041
Reprisals are probable.

208
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,291
They need you, Tsukumo.

209
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,000
Thank you, sir.

210
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,875
Hey. What are all
those flying things?

211
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,166
Huh?

212
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,458
I dunno. But I think
we're landing.

213
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,166
Where you going?

214
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,500
Hey-hey! What's up,
Gareki my man?

215
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,000
Heads up. I need off.

216
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,125
What? Whoa! Yeah, no!

217
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,083
Nothing to see out there,
promise. Besides, it's bedtime!

218
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,583
[GAREKI] I need supplies.

219
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,583
[YOGI] Huh? Like what?

220
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,125
[GAREKI] Clothes, for one.

221
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,750
[YOGI] Clothes? We are stocked
to the rafters with clothes!

222
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,833
[GAREKI] For another,
I'm bored out of my damn mind.

223
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:59,541
[YOGI] Eh... we can play
hide-and-seek, then!

224
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,375
How old're you, exactly?

225
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,166
I am twenty-one and a half,
and there is nothing wrong

226
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,583
with bein' in touch
with your inner child!

227
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,291
[TSUKUMO] I'll be "it" first.

228
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,708
Be warned.
We play at a level

229
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,791
far beyond most
people's abilities.

230
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,000
It's understandable if
you'd prefer to bow out.

231
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,750
[YOGI] Right-o, I'm setting
the time limit at one hour.

232
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:30,208
[TSUKUMO] One. Two.
Three. Four. Five. Six.

233
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,708
[SHEEP] Baa. The area beyond
this point is out of bounds.

234
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,291
[SHEEP] Baa. Out of bounds.

235
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,083
[SEVERAL SHEEP]
Baa. Out of bounds.

236
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,958
--Baa. Out of bounds.
--Baa. Out of bounds.

237
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,666
[TSUKUMO] Really?

238
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,958
[GAREKI] Oh, gimme a break!
What the hell, man? Put me down!

239
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:13,208
Gotta hide.
Somewhere they won't look.

240
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:37,750
[MAN'S VOICE] Lookie here.
Nice, pretty red seeds for me!

241
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,958
Why bother coming
to me in first place

242
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,458
if you're just gonna run away?

243
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,458
[HIRATO] There's
evidence this homicide

244
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,791
was staged as a diversion.

245
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,791
Watch Nai and Gareki closely.

246
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,541
The enemy is using
"divide and conquer."

247
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,500
Yeah, I noticed!

248
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,875
Tsukumo, no!

249
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,125
Nai, look out!

250
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,500
Make a break for it!

251
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,458
[GAREKI] Do what
he says, dammit!

252
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,583
[TSUKUMO] Nai! Run!

253
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,083
What're you waiting for?

254
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,500
You're the one
they're after, dumbass!

255
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,625
But you...

256
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,166
[YOGI] Just go!

257
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:01,041
No. I won't.

258
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:06,875
Stupid monsters.
Leave us alone. Just go away!

259
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,333
We're not leaving here
without those pretty red seeds.

260
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,375
That's all there
is to it. Sorry.

261
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,708
[SHEEP] Baa. One hour
time limit is up. Nai wins.

262
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,875
What? I...?

263
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,791
[SHEEP] Baa. Game over.
Back to the ship.

264
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,333
[TSUKUMO] They were
single-mindedly intent

265
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,500
on abducting Nai,
it seems.

266
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,291
Abduct, yes.
Not neutralize.

267
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,541
Whew, I don't know
about you guys.

268
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,375
But I need a bath after that.

269
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,000
Yeah, me too!

270
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:24,625
Nai. Nai. You there?
Am I coming in loud and clear?

271
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,166
Nai.

272
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,250
[GIRL'S VOICE] Karoku.
What is that you're doing?

273
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,375
Just a kiss.

274
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:46,833
Sorry about your ordeal on
the train. Must've been scary.

275
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,833
Karoku!

276
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:00,125
I've missed you so much!
So very, very much!

277
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,416
[NAI] Karoku.

278
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:37,833
[YOGI] Ohh...

279
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,250
[SHEEP] What's the matter?

280
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,833
[YOGI] I'm worried I'm not
doing Nyanperowna justice.

281
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,083
[SHEEP] I've seen better.

282
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,583
Nyanperowna merch sales
plateaued a decade ago.

283
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,083
[YOGI] Ugh! Why'd you
tell me that?

284
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,916
Like I need that
kind of pressure!

285
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,458
[SHEEP] It's the truuuth.
