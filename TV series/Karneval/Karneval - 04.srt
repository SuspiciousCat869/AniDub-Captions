1
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,708
[YOGI] Gareki!

2
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,208
[YOGI] I'll be
right back! Watch Nai!

3
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,541
[NAI] Wha... I...

4
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:12,041
[YOGI] Please.
Don't be dead!

5
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,291
[YOGI] Ga...

6
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,750
[YOGI] Gareki, no...

7
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,083
[IVA] Krone Saphir.

8
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,166
[IVA] These stones
shine at my behest,

9
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,583
banishing evil to oblivion.

10
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,291
I am known as
Queen of the Crown.

11
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,750
National Defense
Agency Operative.

12
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,166
Iva: Circus Airship Two.

13
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,666
And those who turn
away from my love

14
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,000
rush to their own fall.

15
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,750
[YOGI] Thanks, big sis!

16
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,750
Uh--

17
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,291
[IVA] Nice going!

18
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:22,625
[IVA] Slowpoke!
Damn right "thanks, big sis!" 

19
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,708
[IVA] You cool to get up, kid?

20
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,458
[YOGI] No! Don't push
yourself! Take it slow.

21
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,708
Just tell me where
it hurts worst.

22
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,416
Feel wonky? Like you might
blow chunks or something?

23
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,625
Oh, man. Oh, man. You must've
been scared out of your mind!

24
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,833
It's all my fault; I should've
been on top of things!

25
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,083
Please find it in your
heart to forgive me!

26
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,500
[GAREKI] Will you get
the hell off me, please?

27
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,041
I'm trying to wrap my head
around what just happened!

28
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,125
And stop snotting on me!

29
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,791
[IVA] Give him some air, spaz.

30
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,750
[YOGI] What are you
even doing here, Iva?

31
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,750
[IVA] Meh. I was chasing
a varuga from Gaven, but...

32
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,583
He got away.
The slippery little bastard.

33
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,958
So. I thought "home,"
but whatevs.

34
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,125
The possesor showed up en
route and I couldn't resist.

35
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,916
I had a bit of extra
steam to blow off.

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,333
[GAREKI] The possessor?

37
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,416
[IVA] A varuga in beast form.

38
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,541
[GAREKI] I see.

39
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,583
[IVA] Ah. Men's faces wearing
that look do nothing for me.

40
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,750
I need to ogle
something adorable.

41
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,875
Tskumo's here with
you guys, right?

42
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:34,166
[AKARI] He'll be okay.
Just a minor contusion.

43
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,500
[NAI] Contu... what?

44
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,416
[AKARI] It's a bruise.
Nothing to worry about.

45
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,750
[NAI] I hope Gareki
and Yogi are all right.

46
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,916
I shouldn't have
wandered off on my own.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,166
[AKARI] Correct,
but this isn't your fault.

48
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,083
We were attacked, plainly.

49
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,416
This would've
happened either way.

50
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,791
[AKARI] Why did it target
Gareki and not Nai, I wonder.

51
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,875
Neither of them
have varuga blood

52
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,375
in their systems,
according to our tests.

53
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,458
[YOGI] Doctor Akari,
I presume?

54
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,833
[NAI] Oh, no! Gareki!

55
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,458
[IVA] Not what it looks like.
He was too slow on his feet.

56
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,541
So I helped.

57
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,125
[AKARI] Marvelous.
She's here.

58
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,208
[IVA] Start giving me lip,
doc, and I'll "help" you.

59
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,791
[YOGI] Tried to tell
her Gareki'd prefer

60
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,375
me giving him a
piggyback, but...

61
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,375
[GAREKI] Somebody,
please, kill me.

62
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,083
[AKARI] Well,
I don't see anything

63
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,208
that would make me
suspicious. But...

64
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,458
It's probably best we let Iva
take you back to the ship.

65
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,833
[NAI] Gareki.
I'm sorry...

66
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,833
[GAREKI]
Huh? Why's that?

67
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,333
[NAI] 'Cause I...

68
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,750
[GAREKI] S'alright.
You still in one piece?

69
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,291
[NAI] Uh-huh.

70
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,416
[AKARI] Let's get this
assignment back on track

71
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,541
and hope for no further
interruptions, shall we?

72
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,125
[AKARI] There must
be something here

73
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,250
to shed a little
light on Karoku.

74
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,541
[NAI] Ka...

75
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,125
Karoku?

76
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,833
[YOGI] Oh, wow.
I'm guessing this

77
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,208
is where the two of
you used to live?

78
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,666
[AKARI] Leave no
stone unturned. Yogi?

79
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,208
[YOGI] Right.

80
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,875
[KAROKU] Hey.
Look in my eyes.

81
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,416
We good?

82
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,875
[NAI] Good, yes!

83
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,166
[KAROKU] Atta boy.

84
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,708
[NAI] He's warm.
Like the sun.

85
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,625
[KAROKU] Look at you.

86
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,916
[UNDERLING A] Master Karoku,
sir, you're needed below.

87
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,625
[KAROKU] If I touch
this light...

88
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,666
Would its warmth help
me find my tears?

89
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,791
[KAROKU] Coming!

90
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,541
[ELESKA] Unacceptable!

91
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,750
[URO] A valid observation,
but please understand.

92
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,458
Circus is protecting him.

93
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,625
[ELESKA] My Karoku is all
about this little Nai nobody.

94
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,583
I wanted him brought
here as a surprise!

95
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,250
You don't understand what
it's like with him, Uro.

96
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,708
All he does is stare at
me with that blank look.

97
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,875
[URO] My lady, do not
doubt that he cares.

98
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,583
[URO] Look at you;
in the bloom of youth.

99
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:37,000
What man isn't all desire
for you? He's simply nervous.

100
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,041
[ELESKA] Sycophant! You say
what you're paid to say!

101
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,041
You have no idea!

102
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:47,500
I need him to yearn for me!
I want him to lose all control!

103
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,916
[ELESKA] Talk to me, please!
What makes a man tick?

104
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,375
[URO] Every man is different.
I can't really say.

105
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:01,000
[AKARI] Not a scrap
of anything useful.

106
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,291
[YOGI] According to Nai,
their living situation

107
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,625
was pretty
straightforward.

108
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,500
That fair to say?

109
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,500
[NAI] Hey. There's a bug.

110
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,083
[YOGI] Oh, yeah?

111
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,458
[YOGI] Is that important?

112
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,208
[AKARI] Perhaps.
Move this rock.

113
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,750
[YOGI] Okay...

114
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,166
Jeepers. Good call.

115
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,666
[IVA] Hooray!
Tsukumo!

116
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,333
[YOGI] Hooray!
Lunch!

117
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,125
[YOGI] Ho, ho! Are you
yankin' my chain with this?

118
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,541
Talk about a feast
fit for a king!

119
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,333
[IVA] This is just...
lovely, dear.

120
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,708
[YOGI] Tsukumo, you
have outdone yourself!

121
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,083
[AKARI] This isn't a picnic.
We need to move along.

122
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,791
Wolf it down, folks.

123
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,666
[IVA] Oh, c'mon!
It's somethin' we call

124
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,750
stopping to smell the roses!

125
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,333
This li'l vixen works hard
to tempt our palates!

126
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,208
Isn't that right, Tsuku-Tsuku?

127
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,791
[TSUKUMO] Iva.

128
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,500
[NAI] Gareki. Has the
pain gotten better?

129
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,291
[GAREKI] Less talking.
More eating.

130
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,583
[GAREKI] You guys
dig up anything?

131
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,250
[YOGI] Matter of fact,
we did: a notebook.

132
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,708
Couldn't really
make heads or tails

133
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,000
of what's inside it, though.
Looked like a bunch

134
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:18,041
of crazy-person math--you know,
just weird, squiggly symbols.

135
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:22,458
Then again, numbers
aren't really my thing.

136
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:26,416
[YOGI] But hey.
Dr. Akari seemed captivated.

137
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,125
[GAREKI] Great.

138
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,500
[GAREKI] Hey.
I need a favor.

139
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,208
[SHEEP A] Baa. Welcome home.

140
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,041
[SHEEP B] Baa. Welcome home.

141
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,125
[HIRATO] Good to be back.

142
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,583
[NAI] No way!
I'm coming, too!

143
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,625
[YOGI] Ah. Capitán.

144
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,625
[GAREKI] Like hell
you are, dude...

145
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,833
[YOGI] Thanks for
pickig' up.

146
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,375
[NAI] Don't go!

147
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,416
[YOGI] So, yeah. We're just
about to leave Rainbow Forest.

148
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,333
Thing is, we're
not all that far

149
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,541
from Karasuna,
where Gareki's from.

150
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,208
He's asking us to drop
by a place he knows.

151
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,708
[GAREKI] Damn it all.

152
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,041
[YOGI] So that's okay?

153
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,875
[IVA] He's not on the phone!
Stop faking me out!

154
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,208
You're cool with this?

155
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,458
[IVA] Hello? Possessor
attack? Like, minutes ago?

156
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,541
[HIRATO] Precisely
why Yogi's in tow.

157
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,000
[HIRATO] He stays with them,
you and Tsukumo escort

158
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,041
the research team back to
base. Akari's there, yes?

159
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,875
Put him on.

160
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,208
[YOGI] 'Scuse me, Doctor.
Captain Hirato wants a word.

161
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,083
He'd like to say thanks.

162
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:34,083
[AKARI] All part of the job.
He can save his breath.

163
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,458
[HIRATO] 
How extraordinarily mature.

164
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,041
[YOGI] Huh? I know
he's blunt;

165
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,041
I'm not gonna say
that to his face.

166
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,291
And no, sir, I'm not telling
him he's adorable either!

167
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't you pull the "direct
order" card on me, sir!

168
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,625
Oh, no! If you
want to pick a fight

169
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,541
between you and the doc,
I am not playing referee!

170
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,375
[HIRATO] So, that's that.

171
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,333
[TSUKITACHI] Well, this
sucks. I'm not a fan

172
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,916
of being in your debt.

173
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,791
[YOGI] Good news, Nai. The Boss
said you can come with us!

174
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,750
[GAREKI] He's just
gonna get under our feet!

175
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,041
[YOGI] He's got separation
anxiety; take it easy on him.

176
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,583
[GAREKI] Huh?

177
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,625
[GAREKI] Fine. Whatever.

178
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,666
[NAI] Yay!

179
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,416
[YOGI] And there
was much rejoicing!

180
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,541
[YOGI] This is awesome;
it's not every day

181
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,458
I get to be a tourist, you know.

182
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:45,208
[GAREKI] Man, don't announce it.
Unless you wanna get mugged.

183
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,875
[NAI] That looks fun!

184
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,333
[YOGI] Check it out!
Me and that leather bracelet

185
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,208
were made for each other!

186
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,666
I'm gonna play.

187
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,333
[GAREKI] Really?

188
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,416
[YOGI] What the--?

189
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,541
Come on!

190
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,333
Aw, seriously?

191
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,000
[GAREKI] Give it here.
Check it.

192
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,416
[YOGI] Whoa!
You are a god!

193
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,625
[sound of three
more shots fired]

194
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,958
[YOGI] Wha--?
So are we leavin' or...?

195
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,500
[NAI] Gareki?

196
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,750
[YOGI] Hey!
Where's the fire?

197
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,041
[WOMAN'S VOICE] Gareki!

198
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:59,291
[GAREKI] Tsu... Tsubame.

199
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,875
[TSUBAME] You're back.

200
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:06,375
After all this time.

201
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,166
[GAREKI] What's up?
Why the tears?

202
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,416
[TSUBAME] I...
think I... probably...

203
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
killed someone.

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,166
A lot of someones.

205
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,500
[TSUBAME] I didn't really
think you'd left. I couldn't.

206
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,541
Figured you were just
out and about, y'know?

207
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,791
[TSUBAME] You realize
it's been over two years

208
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,500
since we've seen you.

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,458
Why? I mean...

210
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,041
[YOGI] So. You guys
go back quite a ways.

211
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,583
What, were you,
like, classmates, or...?

212
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,041
'Cause you don't
really look alike.

213
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:11,375
Sort of, uh, you know, rules
out sister, so... Girlfriend?

214
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,958
[TSUBAME] Ew, grody, no!
I've been saving myself

215
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,250
for a doll-eyed,
chubby-cheeked man of steel!

216
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,000
[YOGI] Okay...
So. Not Gareki.

217
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,125
[GAREKI] How's Yotaka?

218
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:31,541
[TSUBAME] He, uh...
doesn't know about my thing.

219
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:36,000
Blackouts. He's not stupid.
He knows something's not right.

220
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,291
[GAREKI] Well.
You guys are twins.

221
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:42,041
Might as well have a direct
link into each other's cortex.

222
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,458
[NAI] Why do you
think you killed them?

223
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,083
[YOGI] Nai!

224
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,583
[TSUBAME] I don't know.
I've been having

225
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,916
these blackout episodes
more and more lately, but...

226
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,708
The more they happen,
the less any of it makes sense.

227
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,958
[TSUBAME] I wake up
in strange places.

228
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:07,291
Sometimes there's blood on
my clothes, or my hands.

229
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,833
I never remember
anything, though. Ever.

230
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,208
[TSUBAME] But yesterday
was different.

231
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,875
[YOTAKA] Party's over!

232
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,416
What the hell are you people
doing with my sister?

233
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,250
[TSUBAME] Yotaka, no!
Stop! It's Gareki!

234
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,000
[YOTAKA] You're kiddin' me.

235
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,250
[YOTAKA] Well, damn.
Glad you're still alive, man.

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,041
[YOGI] Not to be that guy,

237
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,416
but should we really
be sleeping here?

238
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,041
[GAREKI] She said the dude
who lived here took off.

239
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,500
He's not coming back.

240
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,000
[YOGI] Yeah, uh... That's
kind of what bothers me.

241
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,750
Think about it, Gareki.

242
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,291
This village is
practically deserted.

243
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,708
Can't have always
been that way.

244
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,041
[GAREKI] Yeah, well,
whaddya gonna do?

245
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,041
[YOGI] So no one actually
answered my question...

246
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,958
What's the story
with you three?

247
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,375
[YOGI] I'm just... curious.

248
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,416
[GAREKI] Lemme think.
I was about eight, I guess.

249
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,000
My folks sold me off.

250
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,333
[GAREKI] I got grouped
with some other kids.

251
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,958
We were all
auctioned off as a lot.

252
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,375
[GAREKI] There was this cargo
ship we all got stowed on.

253
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,583
I wasn't very popular.

254
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,833
Guess I instinctively rub
some people the wrong way.

255
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,500
I was the runt, you see;
so that more or less

256
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,666
singled me out for the bullies.

257
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,333
They used to tie me up,
make off with my rations,

258
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,583
pretty much every day.

259
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,666
Good thing, too.

260
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,458
Turns out there was something
mixed into the food.

261
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,166
Everyone started
acting like animals.

262
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,458
[GAREKI] I was weak,
but I was alive.

263
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,208
Then a woman named
Tsubaki saved me.

264
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,250
[GAREKI] She pitied me.
Took me in without a thought.

265
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:26,958
Tsubame and Yotaka were her
siblings. Younger, of course.

266
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,208
Long story short, she
loved the wrong person.

267
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:35,333
Wound up getting killed.
I never met the guy.

268
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,791
But trust me.
He's a dead man when I do.

269
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,666
[GAREKI] What?

270
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,958
[YOGI] You need a hug.

271
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,291
[GAREKI]
'Scuse me?

272
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,375
[YOGI] I'm all that
stands between

273
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,958
you and a heart of stone.

274
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,791
I need to show you there's
still a chance for love--

275
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,458
[GAREKI] And I need to
show you some boundaries!

276
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,416
[NAI] Stop fighting!
I don't like it when you fight!

277
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,583
[YOGI] Hug it out, bro!

278
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,541
[GAREKI] Both of you.
Shut the hell up!

279
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,291
[TSUBAKI]
You'll fit right in.

280
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,625
My brother and sister
are just about your age.

281
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,166
[TSUBAKI] You
remind me of them.

282
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,375
That's why I couldn't
leave you there.

283
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,916
[TSUBAKI] Don't worry,
it's from him.

284
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,541
Free medicine is
free medicine, right?

285
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,041
We needed this.

286
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,041
[GAREKI] Why do you
trust this guy?

287
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,750
You barely know him!

288
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,333
[TSUBAKI] He took me out of that
horrible sweatshop, remember?

289
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,750
And he's taking care of
grandpa's medical bills.

290
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,083
[TSUBAKI] Besides, it's just
a dietary supplement.

291
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,333
All he wants in exchange is
routine data on the twins.

292
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,500
[GAREKI] You don't
trust him, do you?

293
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,458
I can hear it in your voice.

294
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,166
Something's not right
about this and you know it.

295
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,750
[TSUBAKI] Look, I don't earn
enough to make ends meet, okay?

296
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,666
We have to eat
one way or another.

297
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,875
They're my responsibility.
You all are.

298
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,541
I'm trying my best,
Gareki. Please.

299
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:11,083
[GAREKI] Whatever.
Nobody asked you to try.

300
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,250
Stop acting like you're
in this by yourself.

301
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:18,083
I can earn, too! Just stop
seeing him! He's no good!

302
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,166
[GAREKI] I know a crooked son
of a bitch when I see one.

303
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:31,708
[YOGI] Shh. Outside.
It's Tsubame.

304
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,125
[GAREKI] So, what, you've been
keeping watch or something?

305
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,875
[YOGI] Um. Well.

306
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,416
[GAREKI] You've been on
high alert since she told us

307
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,625
about her blackouts,
haven't you?

308
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,333
[YOGI] Sorry. I...

309
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,833
[GAREKI] Don't. I get it.

310
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:03,250
[GAREKI] How the hell did this
happen to her? Why? When?

311
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:08,333
What am I talking about?
It's the medicine. Has to be.

312
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,625
[GAREKI] Which means the man who
killed Tsubaki is still around.

313
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,208
[GAREKI] Hey.

314
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,958
Is there a cure?

315
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,500
That's what I thought.

316
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,250
[NAI] He's been...
drawn on.

317
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,625
[GAREKI] No he hasn't,
he's been... Oh, crap.

318
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,250
These marks.
I know these marks.

319
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,708
They're exactly like the ones
we found on Tsubaki's body.

320
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,041
[GAREKI] I knew it.
The son of a bitch is back.

321
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,125
[GAREKI'S VOICE]
I never met the guy.

322
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:55,000
But trust me.
He's a dead man when I do.

323
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,333
A dead man when I do...
A dead man when I do...

324
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,208
[GAREKI] Yotaka!

325
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,416
[TSUKITACHI] Welcome back, doc.
Bring us any tacky souvenirs?

326
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,166
[AKARI] I was there
for work, not pleasure.

327
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,750
[TSUKITACHI] That a fact? What's
in your breast pocket, then?

328
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,166
[AKARI] It's called
a Flower Rabbit.

329
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,791
[TSUKITACHI]
Aw, c'mon! No fair!

330
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,500
[AKARI] Life isn't fair!
