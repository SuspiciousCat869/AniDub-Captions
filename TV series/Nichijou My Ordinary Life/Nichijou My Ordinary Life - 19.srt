1
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:11,463
Hellvetica Standard.

2
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:23,502
My glasses, my glasses, my glasses, my glasses.

3
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:28,791
My glasses, my glasses, my glasses.

4
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,354
My glasses, my glasses, my glasses!

5
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:38,278
My glasses!

6
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:43,694
My glasses, my glasses, my
glasses, my glasses, my glasses!

7
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,987
Glasses, glasses, glasses, glasses, glasses,

8
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,950
glasses, glasses, glasses, glasses!

9
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:37,529
I'm feeling crazy,

10
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:39,162
so watch closely as I do something

11
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:42,135
you've never seen me do and may never see me do again!

12
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:50,181
I am a victim of domestic violence!

13
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:58,405
Well? Did I blow your minds?

14
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:02,275
And what are we supposed to say to that?

15
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:06,571
Seems like something you'd do.

16
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:08,738
Yeah, I think you would've done that at some point.

17
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,670
Uh-huh, it was definitely a "you" thing.

18
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:14,907
Well, then the next thing I do will be
totally "un-me" and completely out of character!

19
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,487
I tripped and fell!

20
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:30,973
That is so something she would do.

21
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:34,253
Yup. Seems about right.

22
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:57,146
<i>Daifuku</i> !

23
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,103
Come and get your <i>daifuku</i> here!

24
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:01,310
Sorry, but...

25
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:04,469
...could you wear this instead? It's more appropriate.

26
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,450
Come one, come all!

27
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:08,784
And get some sweet, sweet <i>daifuku</i> !

28
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:10,091
Sorry again.

29
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:12,223
Could you try doing this without talking?

30
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:13,987
They said it was on sale,

31
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:16,014
but the price was higher than before!

32
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:23,412
Do you think you could maybe put on a shirt or something?

33
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,979
Are you sulking now?

34
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,651
You're not sulking?

35
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,563
Well, then what's the problem?

36
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:52,672
Um...

37
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,031
You can use your words to talk
to me if you really need to.

38
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:32,735
Here I come!

39
00:05:58,022 --> 00:05:58,363
Yes!

40
00:05:58,388 --> 00:05:59,823
I don't think so!

41
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:01,612
But I jumped on the mat without touching the bar, so...

42
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:03,029
Yeah, you made it past the bar.

43
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:04,228
By going under it!

44
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,144
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

45
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:07,654
You have to get over the bar!

46
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:08,362
Sorry.

47
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:10,399
I'll do it right this time, I swear.

48
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:13,100
Here, I'll lower it to make things easier.

49
00:06:13,618 --> 00:06:14,868
Take it nice and slow.

50
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:17,204
And remember the jumping form I taught you before.

51
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:18,017
Okay!

52
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:19,477
This is it.

53
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:23,097
I've gotta at least be able to make it
over the bar when it's that freakin' low.

54
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:28,604
If I can't even pull this off, everyone'll laugh at me!

55
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:36,591
Did I do it?

56
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,644
You ding-dong!

57
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:41,571
Why can't you do the "thing" like I taught you?

58
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:42,970
Do you just not get it?

59
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:47,066
Well, I can see me doing a proper Fosbury flop in my head.

60
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:49,885
Oh, you're flopping all right.

61
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:53,564
What you're doing is more like a Fosbury... torpedo!

62
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:57,737
A human... torpedo.

63
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:59,058
I wouldn't put it like that!

64
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,020
No, wait.

65
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:04,581
Actually... I think I just did.

66
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,247
I'm not that bad, come on!

67
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:08,346
Quit joking!

68
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:09,753
But you are that bad!

69
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:12,606
Sorry.

70
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:16,336
Hey, don't apologize. I'll be right
here to help you out until you get it.

71
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,785
You're the one who's always
helping me out with my homework.

72
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,625
And now it's my turn to help you!

73
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:25,467
I'm gonna stay by your side, no matter what!

74
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:28,945
Try not to psych yourself out!

75
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:31,859
Just relax a bit and take your time with it, okay?

76
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,843
You totally got this thing!

77
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:35,652
I believe in you, Mio!

78
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,950
I've always been bad at sports,

79
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,810
for as long as I can remember.

80
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:46,496
I hate to break it to you, Mio,

81
00:07:46,578 --> 00:07:48,569
but you're playing the wrong kind of football right now!

82
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:51,207
I can be just as athletic as anyone else.

83
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:53,876
But, whenever I have to follow any rules,

84
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:55,601
everything falls apart!

85
00:07:56,134 --> 00:07:56,998
Get ready!

86
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,212
And... fall!

87
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,870
You're supposed to fall backwards on your back!

88
00:08:02,134 --> 00:08:05,107
But... that doesn't mean I can't change.

89
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,540
I can be better!

90
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:08,743
I just have to try!

91
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:10,923
One, two...

92
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:14,033
There! Huh?

93
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,642
Mio, you are literally spinning out of control!

94
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,601
I don't care how long it takes.

95
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:20,940
I don't care if I keep failing!

96
00:08:32,202 --> 00:08:35,372
At least there's one thing I know I can do.

97
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:36,892
I'll never give up!

98
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:39,464
One, two, three!

99
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,907
Well, almost.

100
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:44,407
Let's try it one more time.

101
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:46,087
Yuuko believes in me.

102
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,330
I think I'm gonna take a quick breather, 'kay?

103
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:49,579
Sure, go ahead.

104
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:57,434
So, I can believe in me!

105
00:08:58,753 --> 00:09:00,420
I'll give it everything I've got!

106
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:01,896
I won't quit!

107
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:09,325
I can be better if I keep on trying!

108
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:13,376
Great effort can take you to even greater heights.

109
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:04,953
And thus, the "Torpedo Flop" was born.

110
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,090
The Life of White Tigers!

111
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:20,102
Check 'em out!

112
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,166
Like... All they do is sleep.

113
00:10:25,195 --> 00:10:28,059
And that one in the front is
giving us a good view of its butt.

114
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:29,019
Sure is.

115
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:32,096
They aren't really doing anything,
so there's not much else to look at.

116
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,950
And after all the effort we made to come out! Rude.

117
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:35,921
I'm just glad we got to see them.

118
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:37,094
Yeah.

119
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:39,318
Huh?

120
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,598
Wow!

121
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:27,279
It's raining!

122
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:29,043
I gotta go bring in the laundry!

123
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,002
Hey! That's the wrong way!

124
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:34,675
Huh?

125
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:48,303
There!

126
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:53,607
Yay!

127
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:56,579
Uh...

128
00:11:56,804 --> 00:11:58,062
Looks like it's wet already.

129
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,369
You should still bring it in!

130
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:05,536
Hakase, Sakamoto, I'm home!

131
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:07,904
It started pouring out of nowhere,

132
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,488
so I hope you were able to get the laundry

133
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,248
before it got too wet.

134
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,244
It's not my fault! Sakamoto told me to bring it in!

135
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,144
I'm tellin' ya!

136
00:12:20,215 --> 00:12:23,282
It was all the kitty's idea. He
was the one that made me do it!

137
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,530
So what you're saying is,

138
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:30,533
you knocked the laundry over while
Sakamoto was making you bring it in?

139
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:33,860
No, he specifically told me
to take the clothes and just...

140
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,237
throw them all on the ground.

141
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:36,252
I did not!

142
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:37,732
Way to blindside me.

143
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:39,696
Don't blame someone else for your messes, kid!

144
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:40,906
But you said to!

145
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:42,696
I never told you to throw things on the ground!

146
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,369
Did, too!

147
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:44,262
I did not!

148
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,009
Did, too!

149
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:45,874
I did not!

150
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:46,742
Did, too!

151
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,620
I did not!

152
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,315
Did, too!

153
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,208
I did not!

154
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:49,990
Did, too!

155
00:12:50,014 --> 00:12:50,736
I did not!

156
00:12:50,762 --> 00:12:52,176
I wish you weren't a liar!

157
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,170
I'm what?!

158
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,000
Nano.

159
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:57,965
Why don't we just blame this whole thing on Sakamoto?

160
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,005
That okay?

161
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,385
That is not okay, brat!

162
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:01,425
No big deal.

163
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:04,520
I just gotta wash that laundry
again and it'll be good as new.

164
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,265
Oh! Good point!

165
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,395
Guess that's true.

166
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,895
But, I'll never get the time I spend on it back.

167
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,564
As punishment, neither of you
will be getting dinner tonight.

168
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:16,777
Aww.

169
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:18,196
Dammit. I didn't do anything wrong!

170
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,168
But it was only Sakamoto's fault!

171
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:21,696
See? He said so himself!

172
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:24,138
He confessed! So you can blame him!

173
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:25,760
All right, then.

174
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,261
Since he owned up to his mistakes,

175
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,953
the only one that doesn't get dinner is you.

176
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:34,362
Wait! I wanna take some of the blame!

177
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,821
And I can own up to my mistakes, too!

178
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:37,196
Like how I was the one who tried to

179
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:38,705
bring in the laundry in the first place

180
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,755
and accidentally knocked it over and got it all wet...

181
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:45,376
Ta-da!

182
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:48,110
We'll be having special rice omelets for dinner!

183
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:49,430
Wow!

184
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,134
The eggs were on sale today!

185
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,617
Wait. I thought I wasn't allowed to have dinner.

186
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:55,257
Yeah, you're right!

187
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:57,544
I completely forgot about that!

188
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:02,111
Well, um... then...

189
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:05,321
I guess I can let you have the rice omelette for tonight!

190
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,762
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!

191
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:08,880
But tomorrow, you get nothing!

192
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:11,732
♪ Swim, swim! ♪

193
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:13,663
♪ Shark, shark, chomp! ♪

194
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:15,496
♪ Shark, shark, chomp! ♪

195
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,615
♪ That is what a shark does best! ♪

196
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:43,147
Mio! Mai! <i>Selamat pagi</i> !

197
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,012
Man, wasn't that clay self-portrait
assignment a huge pain in the butt?

198
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,344
Wait, that project was due today?

199
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:53,723
Look at that! The great, all-knowing Mio
finally forgot about her homework for once!

200
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,077
Ugh! I thought it was due tomorrow!

201
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:58,784
Mai, did you do your self-portrait?

202
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:02,378
Ah, dang it.

203
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,487
So, even Mai forgot about it!

204
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:07,116
You don't see that every day!

205
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,762
Can you not laugh at this disaster?

206
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:12,101
But I guess you can say that when it rains,

207
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:13,415
it pours.

208
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:21,492
It really...

209
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:23,749
...started pouring.

210
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,422
Why you little!

211
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,617
What the hell have you three done to my temple?

212
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:54,615
You must be thieves!

213
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:56,375
Well, not on my watch!

214
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,359
That was too close!

215
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,030
This must be a curse!

216
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:15,234
You brought evil spirits to this place!

217
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,394
Just get out of here.

218
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:24,557
Leave this temple now!

219
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,259
"We should probably go,"

220
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:35,512
is what the three girls thought,

221
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:38,667
while being pelted by the late autumn rain.

222
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:18,957
I'm beggin' you, Pres!

223
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,067
I'm about to have a match with Mr. Takasaki

224
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:23,347
and we need to find someone to be the referee!

225
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:25,487
Referee for a Go+Soccer match?

226
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:27,404
That's right. And if I can beat him,

227
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:30,207
Mr. Takasaki said that he would become the club's advisor.

228
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,627
I'll win. Trust me!

229
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:34,529
But how am I supposed to know what to do?

230
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:35,355
Don't worry.

231
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:37,960
Just read through that rulebook I let you borrow.

232
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:41,170
As long as you do that, then everything is gonna be fine!

233
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:45,430
I have no idea what's going on!

234
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,054
Well, I didn't even open the rulebook,
so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

235
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:49,937
But still!

236
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:51,096
What are they doing?

237
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,612
Is this Go+Soccer?

238
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,658
You wouldn't get it, even if you read the rulebook.

239
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:57,339
Ogi!

240
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:01,265
They're using forbidden techniques
most advanced players don't know!

241
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:03,657
They've reached a level that defies all theory!

242
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:06,410
Observe his stance with the outstretched arm,

243
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:08,853
and how it represents the left leg of a Go table.

244
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:11,837
In contrast, his opponent's stance is the stones.

245
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:13,761
While it seems simple at a glance,

246
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,445
notice the ball between his feet.

247
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,031
It's just a guess, but I think they're trying...

248
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,566
...to achieve the brilliance of the sun!

249
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,280
Where'd he get all that?

250
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:26,017
Now I'm even more confused!

251
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:28,215
It begins!

252
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:33,737
Oh, no!

253
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,583
And, Beloved!

254
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,376
Hey, Ogi?

255
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,487
What does that even mean?

256
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:42,301
Be quiet.

257
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:44,475
Can't you feel it?

258
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,820
The intensity between these two?

259
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,486
If they're not careful...

260
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:50,805
...someone could die.

261
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:53,138
Wait, what?

262
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:55,177
How would that even happen?

263
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:59,394
I haven't seen such high-level play in some time.

264
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:00,745
It's quite impressive.

265
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:04,004
No wonder the air feels so restless right now.

266
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:05,765
Is that...? This stance.

267
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:06,998
It can't be!

268
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:08,878
Unleashing that move in a friendly match?

269
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:10,335
He's completely insane!

270
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:12,166
I have no choice.

271
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,381
I can't just stand by and do nothing.

272
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:17,420
Father, the fated day has arrived.

273
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,637
In the name of all that is just,

274
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,452
shed thy light and become a star!

275
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,460
Ogi Forbidden Referee School! Secret Technique!

276
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:36,277
Ogi Star!

277
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:50,646
This is it!

278
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:53,347
A final love for all!

279
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:00,574
You're pretty good.

280
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,172
Hey, thanks. You, too.

281
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:09,882
What the heck?

282
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:12,984
I kinda just started this little club on a whim.

283
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:14,805
But now...

284
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,145
...it's gotten crazier than I could've imagined!

285
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:10,922
Huh?

286
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:16,815
Huh?

287
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:23,047
I break down when no one can see me.

288
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:29,154
Step on me all you'd like, but I'll never break!

289
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,838
That's right, it's me, Clay!

290
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:32,498
I can be molded into anything!

291
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:35,497
But today, I shall take the form
best suited to battle the children!

292
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:38,409
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 20!

293
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:40,609
All right, kids, bring it on!
