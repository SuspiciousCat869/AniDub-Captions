00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:04,309
All right! Everyone ready to play?

00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:05,325
Rock!

00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:06,396

Scissors!

5
00:00:07,452 --> 00:00:08,388
Aw, man!

6
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:09,496
Aw, yeah!

7
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:10,946
Looks like I'm going first.

9
00:00:17,287 --> 00:00:18,246

Scissors!

11
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,377
Sweet! Here I come!

12
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:25,308
Hey, hold up! Rules say only one step at a time!

13
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:26,876
Oh, I'm well aware.

14
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:30,299

Cheater!

17
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:36,342
What? But how?

18
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,218
You can't add stuff on at the end!

19
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:41,031
Why? I'm just using the company's full name.

20
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:43,496
Hey! That's fair, isn't it Mai?

21
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,235
Fifty-fifty.

22
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:51,024
Okay, fine. I'll let it slide.

23
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:56,247
But next time, I'm allowed to bend the rules to
work in my favor so we can even things out a little.

24
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:58,908
Now, rock, paper, scissors.

25
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,361
Look at that! Mai gets to go next!

26
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:07,678

Incantation of Revival.

30
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:11,475
It stopped working.

31
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:13,313
Aww, mom!

32
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:16,008
I thought I told you to wake me up at seven!

33
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:17,723
Where were you?!

34
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:18,567
Uh.

35
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:25,073
Seriously? Kick volleyball?

36
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:32,980
Just perfect!

37
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:35,127
I am gonna be so late!

38
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:40,282
Of all days, that alarm clock just had to
choose the most inconvenient time to crap out!

39
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:44,288
Even in death, I guess it found a way to
alarm me, but that's not the way it's supposed to!

40
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:45,913
Ugh, I hate irony!

41
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:56,403
All right, if I book it at my top speed,

42
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,014
I might be able to make it.

43
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:00,915
Wait. Hang on.

44
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:01,962
Rewind.

45
00:04:09,156 --> 00:04:11,281
There was something beary suspicious!

46
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:13,120
Please tell me it's gone.

47
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:15,104
Nope! Here it comes!

48
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:20,371
Whoa, what the what?!

49
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:22,204
Who is this pro sprinter?!

50
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,568
And what are they doing chasing little ol' me?

51
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:28,817
There it goes!

52
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:48,165
Bring it.

53
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:53,812
Um. Excuse me.

54
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:00,535
Did you happen to drop this wooden fish?

55
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:03,143
Uh!

56
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,029
Or perhaps, it was this golden one?

57
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:11,592
I'm so dead.

58
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:13,564
I have no choice.

59
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,670
There's only one way.

60
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:20,728
Please take this and go.

61
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,979
Sometimes, I can be a bear.

62
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,244
And other times, I can be...

63
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:30,691
...hard to bear.

64
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:34,202
However! My true identity is...!

65
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:53,254
Oh! That was priceless!

66
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:58,326
Tada!

67
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,097
It was actually your older sister this entire time!

68
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:04,538
Bet you didn't see that coming,
since I used your uniform as a disguise.

69
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,411
Man! That was a bla...

70
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,871
Hm... A rather commendable
corkscrew punch on this fine morning.

71
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,243
Indeed! It was quite beautiful to behold!

72
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,146
Hey, give me some credit.

73
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:19,833
Disabling your alarm clock to set this up wasn't easy.

74
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,505
So it's all your fault!

75
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,688
All right, just chill out. I'll make it up to you.

76
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:26,340
I know, we can go get some ramen, on me. 'Kay?

77
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:30,000
That's my money in the first place!

78
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:37,152
Chi... yo... ta...

79
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:40,138

81
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:47,051
ra-to-na-ri-ha-shi-te-to.

82
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,927
A shark. Wow!

83
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,649
I'm home!

84
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:06,393
Oh! What are you up to, Hakase?

85
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:08,604
Nano! Check it out!

86
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:10,122
That cloud's a shark!

87
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,126
Oooo! Let me sneak a peek.

88
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:18,956
Would you look at that!

89
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:21,014
Isn't it awesome?

90
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:23,420
It really is.

91
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:28,713
That's right! Almost forgot. Look what I bought for you!

92
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,824
Milk.

93
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:46,931
Is it 4.5%? That's the best!

94
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,439
Yup, it's the creamier kind.

95
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,354
But why this specific type?

96
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,753
And what made you want it so suddenly today?

97
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:57,094
Heh! Oh, you'll see.

98
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,446
It goes great with my swiss roll!

99
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:11,321
Wait!

100
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:14,511
Why would you install such a strange additional feature?

101
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,686
I needed you to hold my cake.

102
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,433
That doesn't make any sense!

103
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,515
Nano! Please pass me the milk!

104
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:23,246
This isn't the time for that!

105
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:27,429
I think I have the right to be informed
when a whole cake is being stored inside my arm!

106
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:32,076
Ah! So yummy and cold!

107
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:33,966
Please stop ignoring the issue.

108
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:37,883
Imagine if someone outside saw my arm open.

109
00:08:37,986 --> 00:08:42,658
Rolly, rolly, roll! Rolly, rolly, rolly!

110
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:54,766
Excuse me.

111
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:55,829
What's up?

112
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:59,656
I, uh. Could I have some cake too, please?

113
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:00,696
Yeah, sure.

114
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,011
Gimme one second.

115
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:07,348
Here ya go!

116
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:09,293
I really appreciate it.

117
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:21,273
Uh. You kind of forgot the cake part.

118
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:21,687
Huh?

119
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,160
I know! I have an extra sweet bun you can eat!

120
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,342
Help yourself!

121
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,023
It went back in!

122
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:39,538
Oops! That's my bad!

123
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:41,218
I accidently pushed the button.

124
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:45,396
Ahh! Why do you keep installing
so many bizarre functions in me?

125
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:49,967
Have you ever even considered how people would
react if they saw my head pop open in public?

126
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:51,276
What would happen?

127
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:52,752
Well, uh...

128
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:56,245
Didja hear their new album?

129
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,944
Yeah, it was great!

130
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:04,061
'Kay! I'll add a feature that lets you play music!

131
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,688
I think you missed the point!

132
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:08,619
I'd like you to stop adding functionalities for no reason!

133
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:13,442
You're not listening to me at all, are you?

134
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,532
Jeez...

135
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:46,852
Uh?

136
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:51,899
What is it?

137
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,591
A sweet bun.

138
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:55,304
No you don't!

139
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:58,268
Not after you already had an
entire swiss roll to yourself.

140
00:10:58,465 --> 00:10:59,752
What?!

141
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,071
Something wrong, what'd I do?

142
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:15,619
'Kay, Fine!

143
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:18,560

144
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:20,329
What?! Really?!

145
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:22,732
Not again! Where is it going to come out from this time?

146
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,700
My stomach? Or my leg? Or...

147
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:31,802
For real?

148
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:35,896
Wait, why didn't you just put all of the
food in the refrigerator from the beginning?

149
00:11:36,065 --> 00:11:36,712
Don't wanna!

150
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,336
Wha...?!

153
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:17,621
I'm pooped.

00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:19,157
Oh, Mio!

155
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:23,396
What's up? Your face looks weird.

156
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:24,996
Can I see your homework?

157
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,188
Don't tell me that you forgot to do yours again.

158
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:31,739
Well... I'm not exactly proud of it.

159
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:35,483
Girl, you know you're never
gonna learn if you keep doing this.

160
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,904
Oh, yeah, I get that.

161
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,038
Come on. Just this one time?

162
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:41,996
I promise I'll never do it again. Please?

163
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:43,028
Yuuko.

164
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,032
That's what you say every time this happens.

165
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:46,469
I swear on my life!

166
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:49,249
Yeah, and you say that every time, too.

167
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:50,831
Oh. Do I?

168
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:55,178
Fine. Twist my arm, why don'tcha.

169
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:58,052
This is for real the last one.

170
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,621
Like, for real, real.

171
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:01,134
I hear ya loud n' clear!

172
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,479
You're totally saving my butt with this, Mio!

173
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:05,121
Hey, Yuuko!

174
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,076
You have to come over here and see this.

175
00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:09,541
All right, I'll bring this back as soon as I'm done.

176
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:12,210
Coming! Lemme see what you got!

177
00:13:14,622 --> 00:13:15,358
Hang on.

178
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:18,035
I get the feeling I'm forgetting something important.

179
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:21,046
After finishing my homework last night...

180
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:23,247
I did a thing...

181
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,579
I won't...

182
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,559
I drew something.

183
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:28,227
...let you.

184
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,429
And that thing I drew...

185
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:33,954
I forgot to erase it!

186
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,300
I won't let you do this.

187
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:37,651
It's still in there!

188
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,331
Hey! Got a little problem here!

189
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:45,460
Yeah, I getcha!

190
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:46,523
I know!

191
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:47,780
Yuuko!

192
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:51,788
Hey, I just remembered that I
totally forgot to do my homework, too!

193
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:53,604
So, you don't need my notebook after all!

194
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,929
So, yeah, I'll be taking this thing back now.

195
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:57,155
Sorry 'bout it!

196
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,384
Yuuko?

197
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:04,929
Come on, you don't need it anymore...

198
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:08,995
I know you're just trying to pull a fast
one on me, but I'm not gonna fall for it!

199
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,180
I'll have it back in no time, I promise!

200
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:12,212
'Kay?

201
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:14,557
All right, now where were we?

202
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,408
This is bad.

203
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:18,228
Really, really bad.

204
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:23,146
If anyone sees that drawing, my
reputation is gonna go down the drain!

205
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:28,825
Why does my fate have to be in the hands of Yuuko
of all people?! If she starts spreading rumors...

206
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:37,057
It'll be catastrophic!

207
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:41,409
Yuuko!

208
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,493
So, turns out I gave you the wrong notebook.

209
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,059
This one here's for math.

210
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:48,313
Huh? But wait, look.

211
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:50,315
This says "math" right here on the front.

212
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:57,285
Never mind! I need it back, 'cause uh...

213
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,070
I have a bad stomach ache!

214
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,302
Uh-huh.

215
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:05,556
Gah!

216
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:08,559
I'll be done in a jiffy, so hold your horses, would ya?

217
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:11,776
It's all over. She's gonna see it, and then...

218
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:16,248
That's it. My short-lived high school life is done for!

219
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:19,472
Listen!

220
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:23,477
I'll buy it off you for a thousand yen!

221
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:33,738
Why are you running away?!

222
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:34,817
Come back!

223
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:37,740
Fine then! You want the truth?!

224
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,424
I'll tell you!

225
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:42,497
It's gonna explode!

226
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,038
There's no way.

227
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:52,763
She's too fast for me to catch up to her.

228
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:54,461
I'll miss you, life.

229
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,518
It was good while it lasted.

230
00:15:57,021 --> 00:16:00,144
Thank you, existence, for everything.

231
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,334
We had a lot of fun, didn't we?

232
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:05,873
Sure, it got a little weird sometimes, but overall,

233
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,407
I was pretty happy with how things were.

234
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:14,007
But this is the end! My life is truly over now!

235
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:17,496
And my banquet of boys...

236
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,829
I bid you adieu, as well.

237
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:20,758
Goodbye.

238
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:24,892
Wait! There's no way I'll let that happen!

239
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:32,432
The fire in my heart... must become an inferno!

240
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:24,315
In the end...

241
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,164
...I failed.

242
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,090
Wait, Yuuko!

243
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:32,877
Stop running!

244
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:36,763
You're in the hall!

245
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:48,613
Hey. Are you okay...

246
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:49,138
Uh!

247
00:17:59,294 --> 00:17:59,970
Here.

248
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:02,746
Pass your notebooks to the person in front of you.

249
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:06,251
And if you forgot your homework, please speak up now.

250
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,063
It was almost really bad there for a second.

251
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,059
But I guess all's well that ends well.

252
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:16,542
Now I can go back to living my ordinary... life.

253
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:19,542
Ahh!

254
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,174
Huh?

255
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,945
I never erased it!

256
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,200
Yo.

257
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,479
What seems to be the problem?

258
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:28,867
Teacher! I, uh...

259
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:31,160
Forgot my homework!

260
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,117
There we go.

261
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,466
Hakase, would you mind tidying up the
room and putting your stuff away, please?

262
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,443
Sorry, but I just don't think
I'm ready to do something like that.

263
00:18:57,326 --> 00:18:58,816
I'm gonna go play now.

264
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:02,956
Uh...

265
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,327
But then, I ended up telling him everything anyway!

266
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:10,188
Wow, are you serious? Come on, dude!

267
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:12,465
Um, excuse me!

268
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:15,143
Annaka! Could I have a moment?

269
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:15,873
Yes?

270
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:19,711
Well, you see. This is just a minor thing, but...

271
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,827
I think your hair ribbon might be too big. Don't you?

272
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:26,375
But look! Bunny ears!

273
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:37,803
Sweet buns are tasty.

274
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:39,216
You said it.

275
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,350
Welcome, miss!

276
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:12,681
Sasahara. You do realize that you're a
member of the cultural festival committee, right?

277
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:16,202
Can you at least try to be a bit more serious about this?

278
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,799
Oh, I'm being quite serious.

279
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:23,146
As the president of the drama club,
I'm always doing my part around here.

280
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:26,227
Or did you perhaps not notice that, Miss Tachibana?

281
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:27,917
Don't patronize me!

282
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:30,371
It's sweet.

283
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,250
Would you listen?!

284
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:34,562
We're supposed to decide on the
programming for the culture festival.

285
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:36,953
Your drama club has nothing to do with it!

286
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,852
Seems like they changed the brands.

287
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:49,308
Why on earth did I have to be
paired up with you of all people?

288
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:50,728
It tastes quite nice.

289
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,659
Here I am, wasting my time when the
kendo tournament is coming up. Ah, man.

290
00:20:57,788 --> 00:21:01,518
I never should have volunteered to be
a committee member in the first place.

291
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:09,534
Heh.

292
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,204
What are you doing?! We need to come up with an idea!

293
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:17,645
But you're too busy reading manga over here.

294
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:20,942
Sorry, but this volume was just released.

295
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,239
Don't you have at least one good thought?

296
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:27,675
Was my Wine Tasting Tournament idea not suitable for you?

297
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,246
Of course it wasn't!

298
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:30,660
I already turned it down!

299
00:21:30,685 --> 00:21:31,826
Think of something!

300
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:45,125
Hey, Sasahara.

301
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:52,085
So, what's your excuse for slacking this time?!

302
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,875
Well. I'm fresh out of ideas, for starters.

303
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:58,800
Huh. I'm not getting a signal here.

304
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:10,201
What?! And where do you think you're going?

305
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:13,187
I'm taking a visit to the restroom.

306
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:17,988
This freakin' guy.

307
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:22,150
Huh. It seems like she was in no mood today.

308
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:27,109
I thought my Wine Tasting Tournament was
a stellar idea, but she thought otherwise.

309
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:31,399
However, she has yet to suggest a single idea of her own.

310
00:22:31,802 --> 00:22:35,229
Honestly, I'd fear for my life if I mentioned that to her.

311
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:42,330
There's only one way out, I must be the
one to present an idea that she agrees with.

312
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,133
But that means...

313
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:47,527
I need to bring myself down to a commoner's level.

314
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:53,835
I suppose I have no other options at this point.

315
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,877
It's not like you're special to
me or anything like that, okay?

316
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,951
The purity of Asia.

317
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:58,813
I am a sweet bun.

318
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:01,396
Since I'm not very popular in the Kansai region,

319
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:04,246
people aren't exactly sure what to call me sometimes.

320
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,547
But now you know!

321
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,704
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 03.

322
00:25:08,771 --> 00:25:10,087
Look forward to it!
