1
00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:06,517
All righty! That's all the time we have.

2
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:09,300
And just a reminder that the
days are starting to get shorter,

3
00:00:09,346 --> 00:00:11,577
so be sure to get home before the sun sets.

4
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:13,736
Finally! Let's go, dude!

5
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:14,889
Behind you, bro!

6
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:18,764
A bunch of people seem to think plasma is the answer,

7
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:20,723
but I'm not entirely sure if they're correct.

8
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:21,848
I prefer gathering evidence...

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,595
Hey, Nano!

10
00:00:22,636 --> 00:00:23,571
Ah! Yes?

11
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:25,096
Wanna walk home together?

12
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:26,375
We can grab a bite, too!

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,334
Whaddaya say?

14
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:29,572
So? Wanna?

15
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:31,231
Uh. Well.

16
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,728
Hey! Mio, you should come, too.

17
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:37,458
Well, poop. It looks like she bailed already.

18
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:38,466
Anyway.

19
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,184
Weird.

20
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,566
He was like super gross.

21
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:47,297
I ran into him at the mall when I was getting my coffee...

22
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:48,884
I can't believe I just did that.

23
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:51,703
Leaving her alone there was so thoughtless and mean.

24
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:57,170
Maybe if I'd introduced myself like a normal
girl, it would've been easier to hide in plain sight.

25
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:59,736
Uh, hi. My name's Nano Shinonome!

26
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:05,853
And, um, you see, I, uh, I was
on my way to school and then I...

27
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:55,788
I heard the local coffee shop got remodeled
recently, so I went over to take a peek.

28
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,585
Uh, miss?

29
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,643
Are you ready to order?

30
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:13,059
Just the espresso. The "T" one.

31
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,016
Um, so, uh,

32
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:23,268
you would like one espresso in a tall, is that correct?

33
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:26,556
Wait, in a what? "Tall"?

34
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,414
That's what "T" stands for?

35
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:33,366
You know what, that T espresso
thing sounds pretty good in a tall.

36
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:36,151
So, yeah, uh.

37
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,076
Lemme get the T espresso... in a small size?

38
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:44,814
You wanna order the short espresso instead of the tall?

39
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:52,356
Uh-huh.

40
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,525
I'll take it in a small short!

41
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:56,511
That's the one I want!

42
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:00,569
Um. Sure. So with the espresso order... Uh!

43
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:05,433
It, uh... You can get it served either hot or cold.

44
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:06,831
Hot please!

45
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,601
Okay then.

46
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,085
I'll whip that up for you right away.

47
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:12,913
For size...

48
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:18,515
...it varies.

49
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,608
You can get a solo or doppio.

50
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:23,330
D-D-Doppi-what? Doppio?

51
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,804
What the heck is a doppio? Is that even a real word?

52
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:27,646
How am I supposed to know what that means?

53
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:30,792
Does it even say it anywhere? What is doppio?

54
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,017
Actually, scratch that, I changed my mind.

55
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,528
I'm just gonna get today's special...

56
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,308
whatever that drink happens to be.

57
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:41,231
Well, uh.

58
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:48,262
For today, the special is also the espresso.

59
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,618
Fine then. That one.

60
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:52,883
Right.

61
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,323
Would that be a solo...

62
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,429
...or a doppio for this order?

63
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,240
Or a doppio? Or a doppio? Or a doppio for this order?

64
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:15,827
Sure.

65
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,888
I'll take it.

66
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:19,674
Huh?

67
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:23,100
I mean, uh...

68
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:28,924
Just gimme whatever feels right in your heart.

69
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,531
Coming right up then.

70
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,375
Thank you for waiting.

71
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,399
Here's your solo espresso.

72
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,112
It's so tiny.

73
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,865
And so bitter!

74
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,079
Thank you! Please come again!

75
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:30,137
Welp, I have no choice.

76
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,720
It's vending machines for life.

77
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:35,040
They'll never judge me.

78
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,449
For my dear grandson's birthday, I
bought him a brand new baseball glove.

79
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,090
Grandpa! Here it comes!

80
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:49,614
Try your best, my boy!

81
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:51,958
You're pretty far away, so give it all you've got!

82
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:56,708
Ah, the young people. Always
so full of excitement and dreams.

83
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:57,859
You ready?!

84
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:00,516
Ready as I'll ever be.

85
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,316
Now throw it as hard as you can!

86
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:06,232
This is the perfect opportunity to
show him how cool his grandpa can be.

87
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,288
Curveball.

88
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,052
Uh, 'scuse me.

89
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:17,179
Yes?

90
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:22,248
Can I get one of these Agonizing Super-Hot
Chef's Fanciful Chicken Bars on a stick please?

91
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,949
Seriously? You actually want one of those things?

92
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,865
What's the matter, Koujirou?

93
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:47,433
Oh, yeah. I gotta hurry before the post offices clo...

94
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:48,171
Mio!

95
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:50,896
Oh, it's you. What up?

96
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:52,684
I was lookin' for ya.

97
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,339
You kinda booked it as soon as homeroom was over, y'know?

98
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,158
Yeah. I guess I did.

99
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:58,506
Well, it doesn't matter.

100
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:00,091
Now that we're here, why don't we walk home t...?

101
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:01,403
I gotta do something.

102
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:02,307
Really? What?

103
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,253
It's, uh... It's kinda hard to explain.

104
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:08,456
Ah, come on! It can't be that
hard. You should at least try.

105
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,903
Uh, I just have, um, a thing!

106
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:11,931
What kind of thing? Is it a...?

107
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,129
Excuse me a moment.

108
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,993
You're a...

109
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:21,286
I didn't do it!

110
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:24,211
Wait, what? He didn't ask anything!

111
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:26,586
Uh! That was just a weird reflex.

112
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:30,042
I didn't mean to catch you off guard.

113
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:32,039
And relax, you're not in any trouble.

114
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:32,957
That's good.

115
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:35,286
Is there something we can help you with, officer?

116
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:36,533
Yes, actually.

117
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,946
Some counterfeit bills have been
used in these vending machines.

118
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:42,244
I was wondering if you've seen
any suspicious activity in the area.

119
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:43,593
I haven't seen any.

120
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:46,324
Me neither, but I don't pass by here that often.

121
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:49,337
Based on an eyewitness report, there was a shady person

122
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:51,482
carrying a beige tote with red stripes.

123
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:52,659
Hm.

124
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,178
Nah. There's no way that you could...

125
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,274
Wait.

126
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:58,953
Why is she actually making that weird, kinda gross face?

127
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:01,233
Did she actually do it? Is she the culprit?

128
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,584
No way. She would never do that.

129
00:09:04,614 --> 00:09:06,658
Mio. Quit joking around already.

130
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:09,645
Is she squealing on herself?

131
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:11,474
She'd never survive in the slammer!

132
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:12,403
Wait a second.

133
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,453
You aren't the one that did it, are you?

134
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:16,049
That's crazy talk!

135
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:20,021
She's just super into volleyball and is
practicing her bumping form or whatever.

136
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:21,809
Isn't that right?

137
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:23,653
Okay then.

138
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,306
If it's all right with you two,

139
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,633
I'd like to check inside your bags just in case.

140
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:28,887
Of course! Go ahead!

141
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,414
Hear that? We...

142
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:35,766
She whipped it out! She has a real fake bill!

143
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:40,724
It's all over now! I can't believe my friend's a criminal!

144
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,627
Take this... and please look the other way.

145
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,820
Take the money! And let me go!

146
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:49,903
Is this one of your counterfeit bills?

147
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:52,394
No, that's real cash! And it's also a bribe!

148
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:53,874
That's quite suspicious!

149
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:56,989
Now show me what's in your
bag! And stop resisting the law!

150
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,411
This bag isn't mine! I swear!

151
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:00,959
I've never seen it in my life!

152
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:07,291
You fool.

153
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:27,370
One, two!

154
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,807
Three! Four!

155
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:30,029
Five!

156
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,235
Where's six?

157
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,238
Passion.

158
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:13,644
Huh?

159
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:35,564
A fever? Silly.

160
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:40,929
Hm?

161
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:44,967
What? Huh?

162
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:45,600
Wait!

163
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:48,705
Oh, there you are. Don't run off like that.

164
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:53,727
It's like you're a newborn.

165
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:58,730
Mio! Are you gonna come and eat?

166
00:11:59,064 --> 00:12:00,273
Food's getting cold!

167
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:03,786
Hey, Mio! Say something!

168
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:11,340
"The Life of Koujirou"! Check him out!

169
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:15,947
Hm?

170
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,815
What are you chewing...? Ah!

171
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:34,856
There's the bell!

172
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,525
Classes are done for today!

173
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,445
Don't forget that midterms are coming up,

174
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,851
so be sure to study hard.

175
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:42,239
The test's subjects are on the
board if you need a reminder.

176
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,071
Goodbye!

177
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:52,575
Nano always books it outta here as soon as she can.

178
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,186
Hmm.

179
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:02,813
See ya!

180
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:04,053
See you tomorrow.

181
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:05,010
Have a good day!

182
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,323
You as well.

183
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,405
When I don't know something,

184
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:10,310
I just pretend that I do.

185
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:14,768
♪ Cha-cha-la-la! Cha! ♪

186
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:16,778
♪ Cha-cha-la-la! Cha! ♪

187
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,719
♪ Cha-cha-cha-cha Cha-la-la! ♪

188
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:31,608
Uh.

189
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:33,724
Yuuko, can I borrow an eraser?

190
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:34,827
You may!

191
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:36,593
Which hand?

192
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,767
Uhh...

193
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:40,792
Hey, Mai, do you have an eraser?

194
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:42,213
I do. Here.

195
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:43,798
A character eraser?

196
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:45,716
Man, this isn't gonna work.

197
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:48,189
These just smudge everything.

198
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,566
Yuuko, lend me your eraser.

199
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,473
This is really all you had on you?

200
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:54,181
Wouldja look at that?

201
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:56,253
'Kay, which hand?

202
00:13:58,303 --> 00:13:59,384
This one.

203
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:00,710
Whoa! Wait a sec! That's cheating!

204
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:02,918
The rules clearly state you have to pick one at a time.

205
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,777
You mean the rules you just made up?

206
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:06,396
Mai, you first.

207
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,670
Go right ahead. You can zoom in as much as you'd like!

208
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,460
Ah! Zoom out! Zoom out!

209
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:15,750
What the heck?! You're not allowed to attack the hand!

210
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:17,239
That'll be a strike for you, Mai.

211
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,424
And that means?

212
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:20,086
It's a penalty. Duh.

213
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:22,359
And so what happens when you get a penalty?

214
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,205
Uhh...

215
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:26,078
You gotta treat me to 23 juices!

216
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,594
You're still hung up on that?

217
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:32,965
Are ya hungry, Yuuko? Have a snack!

218
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:36,945
Ready... kan-ji-zai-bo-sa-gyyo-

219
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,845
jin-han-nya-ha-ra- mi-ta-ji-sho-kei-go.

220
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,145
There! Did it!

221
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:42,482
Man, that was a close one!

222
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:44,803
It's not sho-kei-go, it's sho-ken-go.

223
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:46,933
And you were this close to falling for it.

224
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:48,917
Yeah? Two strikes for you!

225
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:50,802
Rock-paper-scissors!

226
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:52,184
Heh. Ha!

227
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:54,564
Like I would play with the hand that has the eraser in it.

228
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:55,479
This one.

229
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,795
<i>Dios mio</i> ! I fell for it!

230
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:00,057
Hand it over. We won fair and square.

231
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,681
Yeah, all right, fine.

232
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:02,856
Here. Your prize.

233
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,620
More character erasers?

234
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,204
Thank you! Please come again!

235
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:11,421
Why are there so many character erasers?

236
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:14,862
Tell me about it. Oh. Isn't that Nano?

237
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,694
Yeah, it is!

238
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,511
She's definitely, probably, maybe a robot.

239
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,776
Would you cut that out already?
It really bothers her, y'know?

240
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:27,421
Why would it bother her?

241
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,008
Robots are legit!

242
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,088
Gah.

243
00:15:51,798 --> 00:15:52,480
Hey.

244
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,387
Wanna run for it?

245
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:04,172
What? C'mon, Dad. I don't get it.

246
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,445
Why do you want me to wear this thing in public?

247
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:07,914
It's like embarrassing!

248
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:09,505
Ya think so, huh?

249
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:14,407
Well then... you're just a spineless, mugwort dumpling!

250
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:32,401
Let's see. Which one is Shinonome?

251
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:35,134
Ah! This one!

252
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:38,623
Wait. Shinonome Lab?

253
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,590
Oh! I guess a lab makes sense!

254
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,252
That's awesome!

255
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,871
'Scuse me! Anybody home?

256
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,714
Huh. No answer.

257
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,988
Coming! Be right there!

258
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,445
So sorry to keep you...

259
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,387
Wha...?

260
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:59,342
Oh, no! How did this happen?

261
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,511
What am I gonna do?

262
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,696
Why did she show up at our front door?

263
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:05,277
If she somehow gets the chance to meet Hakase,

264
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:07,175
then my secret'll be out for sure!

265
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:09,655
Hmm. How should I handle this?

266
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,071
Wait. Hang on.

267
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:14,176
Maybe she's just here to give
me a print-out I forgot at school.

268
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,868
That would explain why she came all the way out here.

269
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:18,056
So, this is the hall.

270
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,171
Thank you for the grand tour!

271
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:20,412
No!

272
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,755
She's already made herself at home.

273
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:33,133
I'll just have to find out what she
wants before Hakase says anything crazy.

274
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:34,625
Ugh. I'm starving.

275
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,303
I'm starving. I'm starving.

276
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:36,873
Hm?

277
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,320
Hey! Who was that?

278
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,490
It was Sakamoto, our talking cat!

279
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:42,987
Hakase!

280
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:44,055
For real?

281
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:46,600
No! Don't be silly! Of course he isn't!

282
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,832
Hey! Meow for me! Now! Do it right meow! Please?

283
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:51,493
Huh? Why do I have to...?

284
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,081
Please, Sakamoto!

285
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:54,709
Uh. Meow.

286
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,537
See? He's a normal cat!

287
00:17:56,872 --> 00:17:57,824
Uh. Mh-hm.

288
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,434
All right, kitty, we have a guest here today,
so why don't you go and play outside, 'kay?

289
00:18:02,477 --> 00:18:04,176
You're kicking me out of...?

290
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,430
Fine!

291
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,404
Meow.

292
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,747
I haven't introduced myself to you yet, huh?

293
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,303
I'm Yuuko Aioi!

294
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,499
So, are you Nano's little sister or something?

295
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:21,513
I'm not a sister. I'm Hakase!

296
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:22,858
Oh, and I built Nano!

297
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:25,856
You built her?

298
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,736
Awesome! Small and smart!

299
00:18:28,768 --> 00:18:30,803
I'm just your run-of-the-mill kid genius.

300
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:32,828
Wait, no! She's just messing around with you!

301
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:34,539
I actually have some relatives that live nearby,

302
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:36,070
but they work all the time,

303
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,311
so they drop their daughter off here so I can watch her!

304
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:39,053
She's here so often, it's like a second home!

305
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:41,180
Right? Isn't that right? Huh? Huh?

306
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,259
Whatchu talkin' 'bout?

307
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,127
Would you take a hint?!

308
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:48,974
Uh, please excuse me! I'll go make some more tea!

309
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:50,749
Ah! No need! I got it!

310
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,422
Well, more like, you got it.

311
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:54,544
Huh?

312
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,200
There you go!

313
00:19:00,278 --> 00:19:02,871
That is the coolest ever!

314
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:07,510
And the other hand is a gun.

315
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:09,980
There's more? That's even cooler!

316
00:19:11,223 --> 00:19:12,483
My life is over.

317
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:17,426
And next up, we're gonna say a buncha random cool things!

318
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:18,942
Yay!

319
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:21,311
Our first contestant is yours truly!

320
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,299
Hey. Open your eyes. Wake up.

321
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:26,944
Don't you die on me!

322
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,566
Wow. Now that's a cool scene!

323
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:30,995
Now, Hakase!

324
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:31,866
Me!

325
00:19:31,934 --> 00:19:33,443
Rhinoceros Beetle!

326
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:34,792
That's cool!

327
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,900
So... why did she come over anyway?

328
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,656
They're on top of each other!

329
00:19:40,273 --> 00:19:41,236
I give! I give!

330
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:42,395
You're so tiny!

331
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,135
It's too big!

332
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:45,986
'Kay. I'mma go.

333
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,492
She came for nothing?

334
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:55,674
Thanks for having me over.

335
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,190
Sorry I stayed so late.

336
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:59,089
Uh. No problem.

337
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:01,782
And, um, I wanted to say.

338
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:02,268
Yeah?

339
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:05,531
Truth is, I've actually been
practicing some magic tricks lately!

340
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,445
So I'm not a robot, or anything, I swear!

341
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,020
Yeah, I already knew that.

342
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:11,380
You're Nano. And that's good enough for me!

343
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,652
There we go.

344
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,636
As long as you're happy with who you are,

345
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,201
that's all that matters.

346
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,420
I just wanted to stop by here and tell you that.

347
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:22,046
But I got distracted.

348
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:28,183
See you at school, Nano!

349
00:20:28,398 --> 00:20:29,755
Uh. Yeah.

350
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:40,730
Hey!

351
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:41,507
Hm?

352
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:42,833
Uh.

353
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,608
Come by at any time.

354
00:20:49,071 --> 00:20:50,424
Sure! Sounds fun!

355
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:53,726
Really? Hooray!

356
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:56,528
I gotcha! How 'bout we doodle next time?

357
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,445
Yeah! We can draw sharks and stuff!

358
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,220
Oh, I like that! Sharks are cool!

359
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:02,212
They sure are! They're the best!

360
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,195
You really like those sharks, don'tcha, Hakase?

361
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,136
Not like! I love sharks!

362
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:07,111
They're the coolest!

363
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:09,417
Rawr! I'mma shark!

364
00:21:09,471 --> 00:21:11,594
Do more! Do more shark things!

365
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,762
Rawr! Shark attack! Rawr!

366
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:14,801
Again! Again!

367
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:18,765
Hakase! I wanna play!

368
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:20,580
Look out! I'm gonna thrash!

369
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:21,156
So cool!

370
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,636
Oh, no!

371
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,022
Me shark! Me hungry!

372
00:22:58,356 --> 00:22:59,674
Hi, Sakamoto!

373
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:02,015
'Kay, bye!

374
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,247
See ya.

375
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:19,484
Huh, bizarre.

376
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:28,923
It's me, the screw!

377
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:31,173
I have a Phillip's head, so that's a plus!

378
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,501
I also give off plenty of positive vibes,
so I'm sure that adds lots to my character!

379
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:38,825
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 17.

380
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,976
Look forward to it!
