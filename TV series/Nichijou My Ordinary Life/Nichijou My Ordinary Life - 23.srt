1
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:03,777
<i>Selamat pagi</i> !

2
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:06,826
Huh? I'm the first one here?

3
00:00:10,518 --> 00:00:12,769
Stag beetle dance, yeah.

4
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:14,336
You having fun there? Nice moves.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,540
What are you doing here so
early in the morning, Mr. Takasaki?

6
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:19,485
Well, I am on morning duty today.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,379
I know. Why don't you come and help
me take out all the school's garbage?

8
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:23,091
Yeah, sure!

9
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,338
As long as you don't tell anyone about what you just saw!

10
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,838
You don't have to worry about that.

11
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:28,298
Of course I'm gonna worry!

12
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:33,907
That was a close one.

13
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:06,744
Hey, Mio?

14
00:02:07,323 --> 00:02:07,784
Hm?

15
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:10,601
I whipped up a batch of homemade jam yesterday.

16
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,001
Wanna taste it for me?

17
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:14,252
That's kind of random, but, yeah, why not?

18
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,020
I used up all of your marmalade the other
day, so I figured I'd make it up to you.

19
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:19,823
Oh, yeah.

20
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:21,247
Well, thanks, I guess.

21
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,728
I never would've expected you to pull something like this.

22
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:26,387
It's almost like you're a
responsible and considerate grown-up.

23
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:28,389
I can have my moments, you know!

24
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:30,785
Now, go ahead and try it and tell me what you think.

25
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,225
Okay. Let's see what we got here.

26
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:37,568
Gross!

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,180
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

28
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:41,399
It's like my taste buds are drowning in sewage!

29
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:44,429
Here! I made some Russian tea to wash it down.

30
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:47,590
Hot!

31
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,987
It burns! It burns!

32
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:50,811
Not just 'cause it's hot, but it's gross, too!

33
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:52,876
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew...

34
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:54,059
All right, then, uh,

35
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:55,550
maybe some more jam will help?

36
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,043
Why?!

37
00:02:57,124 --> 00:02:58,874
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew,

38
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:00,424
ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew...

39
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:02,385
Water!

40
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,351
Where's the water? I need water!

41
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:05,895
Some good, clean H2O!

42
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:08,074
I could drink a whole lake right freakin' now!

43
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:10,725
Water! I need it! I need it!

44
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:13,993
Water!

45
00:03:16,345 --> 00:03:17,255
Why?

46
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:20,207
I know!

47
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,341
Milk! That'll do!

48
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:25,617
It's just what I need!

49
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:28,866
Oh, heads up.

50
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:30,859
I put the rest of the jam in that milk carton.

51
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,450
Why?!

52
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:37,782
This is the worst thing I've ever
experienced in my entire life! Ever!

53
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:39,803
What'd I do to deserve this? Who'd I hurt?

54
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:42,414
What'd I do wrong? Nothing! It's not fair!

55
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,737
I just get shafted every time!

56
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:21,908
That was weird.

57
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:23,080
Doin' okay there?

58
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:24,316
Just look at me!

59
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,799
How could you even ask that?

60
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:29,082
My life was flashing before my eyes
and it's all because of your stupid jam!

61
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:30,964
So, no, I'm not okay, and it's all your fault!

62
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:34,725
I knew that it wouldn't taste good, but I
didn't think you'd have such an extreme reaction.

63
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,882
If you knew it tasted like garbage,
then why'd you make me taste it?

64
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,545
No reason, really. I just thought it might be kinda funny.

65
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,009
You are the actual worst!

66
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,619
But anyway! Question for you.

67
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,152
What kind of jam do you think this is, huh?

68
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:50,982
Who cares? I don't wanna think about
some goop that tastes like rotten fish!

69
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:52,734
Close!

70
00:04:58,534 --> 00:04:59,951
You got the "fish" part right.

71
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:01,284
Except that it's dried!

72
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,674
Why?!

73
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,757
That was the first and last time...

74
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:09,104
...I ever had dried fish.

75
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:38,213
Ah!

76
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,560
Mako?

77
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:57,093
I'm ordering take-out tonight since Dad's not gonna
be home until late, so let me know what you wanna eat!

78
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:01,012
He always makes such a mess.

79
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:02,599
Just look at all this!

80
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,269
Even after I told him to tidy up.

81
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,290
He never listens unless somebody scolds him.

82
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:09,072
Huh?

83
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,455
Wait, this couldn't possibly
be what I think it is, could it?

84
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,555
Maybe it is? It is, isn't it?

85
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,557
Hey! Why are you snooping around in my room?

86
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,356
I wasn't snooping! I, uh...

87
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:43,731
I told you before, you're not allowed in here!

88
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,127
If you invade my personal space again,

89
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:48,074
I'll, uh, uh, you know, whatever!

90
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:49,594
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:54,863
Huh? Uh...

92
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:06,065
Be strong.

93
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:07,970
He needs to learn his lesson.

94
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:08,524
Hey!

95
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:11,379
What did I just say about invasion of personal space?

96
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:13,379
Huh? Well, I just, uh...

97
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:16,504
Who told you that you could barge
in and clean my room anyway? Jeez!

98
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:19,707
Well, if you refuse to clean it
yourself, then you leave me no...

99
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:21,960
It's my organized mess, and you're ruining it!

100
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:23,695
Just stay out of my business!

101
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,742
Mako!

102
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:33,129
Really? Did you not hear me
the first two times or something?

103
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:33,738
Well...

104
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,846
As your sister,

105
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:39,094
I think you're too young to be
looking at lewd things like this!

106
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:41,157
As your sister,

107
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:44,384
I think you're too young to be
looking at lewd things like this!

108
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:46,106
As your sister,

109
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:49,088
I think you're too young to be
looking at lewd things like this!

110
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:51,093
Wait. How did you find...?

111
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,879
That's, uh...

112
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,703
I... I can explain...

113
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,383
I, uh...

114
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:09,679
That's... uh...

115
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:13,304
What is that? Huh?

116
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:15,337
Weird! That's new!

117
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,331
Never seen it!

118
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,075
Never in my whole life!

119
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:20,738
But I just found this under <i>your</i> bed in <i>your</i> room!

120
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:21,551
Really?

121
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,313
Well, that's crazy 'cause it isn't mine!

122
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:25,943
And just because you found it
in my room doesn't mean squat!

123
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:28,771
Someone could've planted it there for all you
know! You're so smart, you ever think of that?

124
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:31,100
Regardless, I still think you
shouldn't be exposed to this.

125
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,023
You're too young!

126
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:32,784
What?

127
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,875
How could I be exposed to something that isn't even mine?

128
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:37,390
I didn't even know it was there,
so there's no reason to freak out!

129
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:39,832
If that's the case, then I'll throw it away!

130
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:40,419
Huh?

131
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:04,104
That's my club president's!

132
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:05,069
What?

133
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,126
I can't believe you would throw
away something that isn't yours!

134
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:09,839
I'm so sorry!

135
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:12,383
Also, I couldn't help but take a peek inside,

136
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:15,453
and it was fascinating, to be honest.

137
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:17,292
But... I still think you shouldn't

138
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,668
look at things like that.

139
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,747
At least not till you're older.

140
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,713
I get it already, "no looking"!

141
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:24,667
Now get out of my room and stay out!

142
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,142
She is stressing me the heck out.

143
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:32,194
What does Mr. Takasaki see in her anyway?

144
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:33,549
Please don't be mad at me.

145
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,172
Could you at least try knocking, for once?

146
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
Well, I was just worried that
you might be angry with me, so...

147
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,122
I'm not angry with you!

148
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,938
See? I knew you'd be upset.

149
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:43,991
I said I wasn't!

150
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,639
If you don't get out though,
that could change pretty quick.

151
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:48,729
Don't forget to knock next time! You hear me?

152
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,097
See what happens if you don't!

153
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:54,090
Ugh, can I just move out already?

154
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,732
I don't think that went well at all.

155
00:09:57,816 --> 00:10:00,940
But I was able to clean up his
room a little bit, so that's good.

156
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:03,334
And I'm glad that magazine wasn't his.

157
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,456
This whole ordeal just reminds me that
I have kids at school to take care of.

158
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:11,581
So, I need to shape up if I want
to be a good guidance counselor!

159
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,956
Be the change you want to see.

160
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:17,035
I almost forgot to ask.

161
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,349
Hey, Mako? What do you want for dinner?

162
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:22,469
How many times do I have to tell
you to knock before you get it?!

163
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:30,844
Let's see.

164
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:33,765
I just wanted to ask you if you've
thought about your plans for the future.

165
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,220
Are there any goals or aspirations you have that
you want to achieve after you graduate high school?

166
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:39,533
Uh, yeah, sure.

167
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:47,648
So, uh...

168
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:48,179
Oh!

169
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:51,048
I wanna be on TV at least once before I die!

170
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:53,425
Uh... well, that's good,

171
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,667
but not exactly what I was asking for.

172
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:57,215
I apologize.

173
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,530
Maybe my wording wasn't quite clear enough for you.

174
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:04,020
I was referring to what you'd like to do for
your job and the career paths you'd like to pursue.

175
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:05,515
Oh. I get it.

176
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:07,798
In that case, yeah. I guess...

177
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,647
I'd, uh...

178
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:11,628
Maybe...

179
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:15,405
I guess I'd like to become a
respectable teacher like you one day!

180
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:19,433
You think... that I'm a...

181
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:23,174
Huh?

182
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:30,650
Helvetica Standard.

183
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:34,907
The sash represents... our bond!

184
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:36,854
It's all you!

185
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:38,209
Nakamura!

186
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:44,049
This is... the last race... of our college careers!

187
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:52,381
Disqualified.

188
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:55,263
Tokisadame College has been disqualified.

189
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:05,625
Oh, hey, Nano!

190
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,211
Yes? What's up?

191
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:09,570
Sorry we didn't show up at your place the other day.

192
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,996
We were on our way over, but then we
got attacked by some dogs out of nowhere.

193
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:15,626
Wow, I'm glad you guys are okay.

194
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:19,630
We'll be sure to stop by and see you
and Hakase sometime soon though, I promise!

195
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:21,276
I look forward to it!

196
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:28,467
Please be our adviser, Mr. Takasaki!

197
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:30,810
I said it once, and I'll say it again: No!

198
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:31,871
Come on!

199
00:12:31,996 --> 00:12:34,547
We had a deal, and you have to
keep up your end of the bargain!

200
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:36,711
Huh? I never made a deal with you!

201
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:38,303
What? Did, too!

202
00:12:38,962 --> 00:12:42,427
Don't you remember we agreed that if
I defeated you in a Go+Soccer match,

203
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,534
then you would become the adviser of our club?

204
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,208
Oh, yeah, that one.

205
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,935
Well! That match ended in a
draw anyway, so it doesn't count!

206
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,130
Really?

207
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:53,532
Fine.

208
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:56,520
Guess I'll tell everyone how you feel about my sister.

209
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:02,125
Show me the way to the club room.

210
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:03,445
It's over here!

211
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,815
All right! Now we can finally have a real club!

212
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:08,455
Yeah!

213
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:12,447
President!

214
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:13,827
Huh?

215
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,221
Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you!

216
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:18,441
But, anyway,

217
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,982
I brought a teacher who agreed to be our new adviser!

218
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:22,935
Hey, get back here!

219
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:24,466
Why are you running?

220
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,821
Mr. Takasaki!

221
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,295
I wonder where he's going.

222
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,713
We're all supposed to be getting ready for recruitment.

223
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:33,379
Without him around, no one'll be able to explain

224
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,438
what the club is actually supposed to do.

225
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,680
Eh! Whatever!

226
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:41,607
This is my club, so I guess I'll keep doin' what I want!

227
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:51,847
Man. I'm freakin' out right now.

228
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,561
Why the heck are you getting so nervous, anyway?

229
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:57,462
You're planning on confessing to that one guy, aren't you?

230
00:13:57,487 --> 00:13:58,929
Nakanojou or something?

231
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,570
Uh-huh! He's like a beacon of punk
in a sea of plain at this school.

232
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,634
I can't get enough of that mohawk of his.

233
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:08,637
Okay, but are there any other
features you like outside of his mohawk?

234
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:12,894
Mr. Takasaki! Come back!

235
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:14,874
Uh...

236
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:30,870
Finally. Mr. Takasaki.

237
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:33,104
Why are you running away from me?

238
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:34,980
You're incredible at Go+Soccer.

239
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,125
Our match... it was amazing!

240
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:40,299
There's nobody that's more fit
to advise this club than you!

241
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:42,399
Sorry.

242
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,070
I, uh, have reasons, and stuff and things.

243
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:48,725
So, uh, yeah.

244
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:50,134
That's it!

245
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:53,632
Just... take it or leave it... I guess.

246
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:56,514
But you already agreed to it earlier!

247
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:58,122
All right, fine.

248
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:00,371
Mr. Takasaki...

249
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:02,849
Take a look at this!

250
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,618
I think it might change your mind!

251
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,453
No way! This is...!

252
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,126
That's right.

253
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:20,060
It's a picture of my sister
from when she was in high school.

254
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:21,525
So how 'bout it?

255
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:22,642
That's yours,

256
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,117
only if you agree to become our club adviser.

257
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,844
Crap. I want it!

258
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,007
More than anything in my entire life!

259
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:37,464
But I can't help but feel like I'll
regret this if I give in to him now.

260
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:39,812
Listen.

261
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:40,932
Uh-huh?

262
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:46,668
I just can't...

263
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:54,151
...pass up this chance!

264
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:55,626
So I'll take it.

265
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:58,576
What the hell did I just do?!

266
00:15:58,668 --> 00:15:59,562
All right!

267
00:15:59,587 --> 00:16:01,686
Our club will finally have an adviser!

268
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:03,867
How pathetic!

269
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:06,362
I'm a teacher! I can't behave like this!

270
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:10,597
But... I'm also a man, and a hungry wolf!

271
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:13,953
Sacrifices must be made!

272
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:16,290
Listen up, now!

273
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:18,781
If we're gonna do this, then we're gonna do it right!

274
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:19,721
Huh?

275
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:21,182
You hear me?

276
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:21,869
I do!

277
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:24,941
It's time to show the school what Go+Soccer is all about!

278
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:27,420
Starting tomorrow, we're going all out!

279
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,771
Right!

280
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:35,976
Is this the place?

281
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:38,366
Wow! That's crazy.

282
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:38,868
'Scuse me!

283
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:39,273
Huh?

284
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:40,435
Hello.

285
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,680
Is there a guy named Nakanojou here?

286
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:43,800
Yeah! There is!

287
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,197
Hey, Nakanojou!

288
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,870
You've got company.

289
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:48,959
In the hall!

290
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:53,130
Yes?

291
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:54,697
How can I help you?

292
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:00,613
Uh? Uhh?

293
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,343
He's so lame now.

294
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,527
Hey, um, Dad?

295
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:28,193
Can you go and check it for me?

296
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,890
Yeah. Of course.

297
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:31,784
Hmm...

298
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:39,788
How is it?

299
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:45,180
Uh...

300
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:56,165
Uh... What's that mean?

301
00:18:20,492 --> 00:18:22,919
The train is temporarily delayed.

302
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:36,344
Uh... oh, hey, Mai. I didn't expect you.

303
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,604
I came here to play.

304
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:43,673
How thoughtful!

305
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:46,033
But you didn't have to bring this many snacks with you.

306
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:46,648
Hey!

307
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:47,127
...Huh?

308
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:49,558
That's the mean girl with the
mean dogs that tried to eat me!

309
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:50,158
Huh?

310
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:55,798
Here.

311
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:58,822
It was her for sure!

312
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,825
Well, I'm gonna go put on some tea. I'll be right back.

313
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:11,254
What business do you have here?

314
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:16,868
For you.

315
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:18,368
And what is that?

316
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:19,801
The lord of death.

317
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:20,852
I'll pass.

318
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:23,373
But this is really cool.

319
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:24,988
Well I don't think it is, so there.

320
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:32,063
How about this? Interesting?

321
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,356
What even is that?

322
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,256
A 36 room apartment layout.

323
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,332
How is that interesting at all?

324
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,379
No bath, toilet, or windows.

325
00:19:39,602 --> 00:19:41,054
That sounds awful.

326
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:52,453
Whatcha drawin' over there?

327
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,130
I'm drawin' a buncha nunya.

328
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,667
Here.

329
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:04,887
Hm?

330
00:20:05,513 --> 00:20:06,649
It's a Blue Shark.

331
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,474
That's so cool!

332
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:14,894
For you.

333
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:15,982
Really?

334
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:18,765
Hey, do you think you can draw me another shark?

335
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:19,412
Okay.

336
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:21,262
Draw one with a big, toothy smile!

337
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:21,902
Okay.

338
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,146
I can trade you mine if you wanna!

339
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:24,712
Okay.

340
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:27,991
Sorry to keep you waiting...

341
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:31,917
Huh?

342
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:38,937
Wait, so, what happened? Did Mai already go home?

343
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:41,474
Yeah. But she said that she'd come back soon

344
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:42,740
and draw me more sharks.

345
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:44,315
Oh, did she now?

346
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:47,945
Wonder if that's why she stopped by.

347
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,132
So amazing.

348
00:23:27,652 --> 00:23:29,216
I'm a graduation photo!

349
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,922
If people saw me and said, "Wow,
you looked so cute back then!"

350
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:34,709
You'd say, "What are you implying? Am I not cute now?"

351
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:35,432
Wouldn't you?

352
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:38,979
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 24.

353
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:40,080
Look forward to it!
