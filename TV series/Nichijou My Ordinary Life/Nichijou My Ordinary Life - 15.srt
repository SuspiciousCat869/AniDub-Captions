1
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:05,547
I bet she's a total master at mental math!

2
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:06,731
Who's a what now?

3
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:08,619
Nano, the transfer student.

4
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:09,960
Hm?

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,127
A robot like her would have a
calculator function or something, right?

6
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:17,831
What're you talkin' about?

7
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:19,829
There's no way that she's a robot.

8
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:22,658
Come on, it's so obvious with
that thing sticking out of her!

9
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:26,006
Huh? The key in her back is your only piece of evidence?

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,026
You're jumping to conclusions.

11
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:31,195
Hang on! Just hear me out on this one.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,729
If she is a robot...

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,878
...that'd be dope!

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,968
And it'd also be off the chain!

15
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:39,650
I have no idea what that means, but you're sure excited.

16
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:43,629
I think I'm gonna officially start
investigating to see if Nano is a for-real robot.

17
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,854
Hold on! Isn't that going too far?

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,958
It's no prob!

19
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:49,036
I've come up with a foolproof plan!

20
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, Nano?

21
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,406
Yes?

22
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:25,182
Question for ya.

23
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:25,811
Hm?

24
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:30,980
What's 3,260 plus 260, then divided by 320?

25
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:37,803
Well, uh, if I were to follow
the order of operations, uh...

26
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:39,265
It sure is a thinker.

27
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:42,826
Maybe you should calculate this one.

28
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:45,400
You're kidding me! That was your big idea?

29
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:46,824
That's a toughie.

30
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:50,264
If you don't mind, I'd like to use something special.

31
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:51,248
A bite!

32
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,299
The line snapped!

33
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:55,886
'Kay, first things first.

34
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:58,373
I'll need to start by wiping the slate completely clean.

35
00:02:58,437 --> 00:02:59,604
She's legit using it!

36
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:03,687
Here goes. One, two, three.

37
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:04,699
She's like... like a...

38
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:06,909
...like a... She's a like, a total newb!

39
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:10,848
All right, take 3,260 and...

40
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:13,003
What happened to using the abacus?

41
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:15,521
Wha...?! Hey, pull it together!

42
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:17,331
What happened to her?

43
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:18,404
How you holdin' up?

44
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:20,432
Don't worry 'bout me.

45
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:23,361
I just crumbled under the weight of my ambitions.

46
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:26,845
I told you right from the get-go
that she wasn't a robot girl, didn't I?

47
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:31,537
Any way I can help? I could offer you a drink?

48
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:40,809
This is it! It's the sacred chalice!

49
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:46,482
Could it be? Show me the oil!

50
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:50,041
What a soup-prise!

51
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:50,827
Yuuko!

52
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,474
Oh, guess not. Huh?

53
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:56,490
Hey there.

54
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:00,192
Here.

55
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,470
She threw a fastball!

56
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:07,184
Oil?

57
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,670
For you.

58
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:11,301
Oh! That's so nice.

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,111
I appreciate the gesture.

60
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,139
Strike!

61
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:19,567
You can have this, too.

62
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,937
Curveball!

63
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:31,192
A monkey wrench?!

64
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:34,503
Wow, thanks a bunch. I needed one of these.

65
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:35,218
To eat?

66
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:36,757
Another strike!

67
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:42,052
All right, you two.

68
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:44,283
I think now's a good time to chill the heck out.

69
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:46,857
Can't you see that she's uncomfortable?

70
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:48,216
It's skinship.

71
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,081
Yeah, we just wanted to be friends with you.

72
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:53,083
Seriously?

73
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:56,206
There's no way she'll be your friend
if you keep freaking her out like that!

74
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:57,906
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,735
That's better.

76
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:02,065
Hey! I'm not bothered, so don't worry.

77
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:03,688
Huh? You sure?

78
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,812
Oh. That's right! The soup!

79
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,808
I'll help myself if no one else wants it.

80
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,254
Would you look at that?

81
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:10,495
I guess things are all good then!

82
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,312
She's obviously...

83
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:12,557
Did I lose a tooth?

84
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:15,536
If you try putting yourself in
her shoes, how would you feel?

85
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,369
Cut it out already.

86
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:55,309
I need to know.

87
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:59,231
How did such a highly advanced technology come to be?

88
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:04,102
That transfer student who just
started here has a strange demeanor.

89
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:06,495
In addition to that bizarre key.

90
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:09,292
Well, no matter how you slice it,

91
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,780
she absolutely has to be a robot.

92
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:16,475
Why was such an innovative
piece of tech being kept secret?

93
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:20,671
And why is she attending our plain
little high school, of all places?

94
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:23,813
I want to know. I need to know.

95
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,274
For science.

96
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:29,793
Once I do, that robot will be mine.

97
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:34,214
Oh!

98
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:39,029
Pardon the intrusion, but I brought the
textbooks you asked me to get, Ms. Nakamura.

99
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:40,251
She came!

100
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:42,182
Now I must act, posthaste!

101
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,359
All done! If you'll excuse me, I'll be going.

102
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,194
One moment, Miss Shinonome!

103
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,810
So, uh, would you like a cup of coffee before you go?

104
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:53,629
Huh? No! I would hate to be a bother!

105
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:55,823
Oh, come on. Don't be such a stick in the mud.

106
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:57,775
You can think of this as a "thank you."

107
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,073
Here, I just brewed a fresh beaker.

108
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,597
Get it while it's hot.

109
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:05,611
One cup won't hurt me.

110
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:09,002
Let's see what happens if I add a
little something to calm her down.

111
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:09,808
Way down.

112
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:11,060
For science, of course.

113
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:14,452
If there are no results, I'll
resort to my trusty Mr. Short Circuit.

114
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,144
Again, for science.

115
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:17,797
Here ya go.

116
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:20,419
Thanks so much. It smells really good!

117
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:35,030
Why'd I drink it?

118
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:43,874
Fight it.

119
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,088
Hang in there!

120
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:52,145
Well, uh, I'm gonna head out now.

121
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:54,918
Wait, come back.

122
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,907
I need to study you... for science.

123
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,039
Hey. Did ya hear?

124
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:06,723
Ms. Nakamura the science teacher passed out.

125
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:09,854
Oh, wow, she sure does that a lot, doesn't she?

126
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:13,494
Rawr! Rawr!

127
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,418
Today was pretty stressful.

128
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:25,697
There were one too many close calls,

129
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,786
but my classmates seem really nice.

130
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,957
I hope we can all be friends someday.

131
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:32,761
Take this!

132
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,500
Rocket punch!

133
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:37,381
Ka-boom!

134
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:42,604
Taste my robot's maximum power!

135
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:50,063
Ha-ha!

136
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:55,895
Hakase! Hakase!

137
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,612
Ah, Nano! Good to have you back!

138
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:00,391
Ah, Nano! Good to have you back!

139
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:03,900
Huh...? Why did you just say the same thing twice?

140
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,692
Know what, never mind that for right now!

141
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:09,798
I wanted to ask you to take this key off of me!

142
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,737
Uhh... But why?

143
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:15,354
What do you mean "why"?

144
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,545
It's negatively impacting my school life!

145
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,712
I can never sit back properly in my chair.

146
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,187
Students look at me weird and one even filmed me!

147
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,718
I've been able to get by so far,

148
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,270
but I don't know if that'll last.

149
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:26,529
Ahh.

150
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:28,473
That key's so cute though.

151
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:31,001
But can't you see that as long
as I have it stuck on my back,

152
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:33,592
the other kids are never gonna
treat me like a normal girl?

153
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:35,285
It'll help make you popular!

154
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:37,128
I wanna be normal!

155
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:39,892
And I wanna have an ordinary high school life, so...

156
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,206
Huh?

157
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,111
Why? I never asked to have these crazy features.

158
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:16,546
At least my hand didn't come off at school.

159
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,882
What's the big deal if everyone
finds out that you're a robot?

160
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:24,236
People will think that I'm not cute
'cause everyone knows that robots aren't cute.

161
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:27,144
But robots are the cutest!

162
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,161
They're not even the littlest bit cute!

163
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,153
They are!

164
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,145
Is this gun barrel cute?

165
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:32,929
Yeah, it is!

166
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:35,496
And what about the USB drive in my big toe?

167
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:36,188
Adorable!

168
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,270
Even the sweet buns in my forehead?

169
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:40,087
I said it's cute!

170
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,520
Yeah? I say you're a mad scientist!

171
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:44,901
I said it's cute!

172
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,534
I just wanna live an ordinary high school life!

173
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:16,420
Wow! It's <i>chikuwa</i> !

174
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:22,257
Those sure are tasty!

175
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:33,024
Sorry I'm late, fellas.

176
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:50,916
Three. Two. One.

177
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:54,395
Four o'clock! Four o'clock!

178
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:02,293
Four o'clock! Four o'clock! Four o'clock! Four o'clock...

179
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:08,511
Four o'clock! Four o'clock! Four o'clock...

180
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:18,474
Hey there! It's me, <i>daifuku</i> !

181
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:21,732
And I'm cheap! Get your <i>daifuku</i> here!

182
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:24,981
Mr. Nakanojou! I hope you're doing well!

183
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:33,368
True <i>daifuku</i> don't talk!

184
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:43,527
I'm sorry. But I can't help it.

185
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,740
I get so worked up when I wear this mask!

186
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:49,212
I put my entire heart and soul...

187
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,685
What did I say about speaking?

188
00:12:57,217 --> 00:12:59,800
Okay. Mistakes may have been made.

189
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:03,012
And I might have taken things
too far, but that's science for you.

190
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,167
I can't underestimate that robot.

191
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:08,297
It's gonna take all I have to bring her in and study her.

192
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:10,535
Enter Mr. Short Circuit!

193
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:12,437
My trusty robot disabling device

194
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:14,484
that's never failed me 'cause I've never used it!

195
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,557
I'm positive that this'll do the trick.

196
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,893
Or why else would I call it "trusty"?

197
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,485
Time is of the essence.

198
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,596
Run away!

199
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:58,112
Uh. Ms. Nakamura?

200
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:04,951
Hold on! What's this?

201
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,462
You need to you fasten that top button of yours, mister!

202
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:09,300
Would you just leave me alone?

203
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:11,075
I can have it unbuttoned if I want!

204
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:13,812
No way! You need to do what your student counselor says!

205
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:15,062
Ugh. Seriously?

206
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,520
You're playing the counselor card?

207
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,937
Yes, I am. Come here so I can button you.

208
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:21,587
I can do it myself! Don't embarrass me like that!

209
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,161
Uh...

210
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,524
What's going on?

211
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:33,099
I can't count on you to fix it,
so I'll just do it for you, Mako.

212
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:34,744
Hey, back off.

213
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:36,275
Wait, "Mako"?

214
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,150
Come here.

215
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:39,415
What are you doing manhandling me like that?

216
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,893
I said back off!

217
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,420
Hold still. I'll fix you up so you can go to class.

218
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:45,707
"Manhandling"?!

219
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:47,765
"I'll fix you up"?

220
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:49,008
Ugh, cut it out.

221
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:51,714
Hey, just stop groping me would you?

222
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:57,736
"Groping"?!

223
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,901
What kind of relationship do these two have?

224
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:05,776
Well, what do ya know, problem solved.

225
00:15:05,816 --> 00:15:08,009
'Kay, see ya. Got places to be.

226
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,057
Hold on a sec!

227
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:12,720
Aren't you afraid everyone'll make fun of
you for being dressed all sloppy like that?

228
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:13,736
I'm sloppy?

229
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:16,994
You're the one who dresses
sloppy at home all the time, y'know?

230
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,974
"At home"? Does she wear a-a sloppy dress?

231
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,757
Sloppy dress at home! Oh, yeah!

232
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:27,842
Wait, that doesn't make sense!

233
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:30,355
When would a Chinese dress ever be considered sloppy?

234
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:31,942
Am I dumb or something?

235
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,959
How could I possibly be a teacher and be this stupid?

236
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:35,776
I've gotta pull myself together!

237
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:38,797
Think! What's counts as being sloppy in a normal sense?

238
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:41,817
Dressing like this?

239
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:45,563
Enough! Stop it! You idiot!

240
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,669
Are you finished? I'm outta here.

241
00:15:47,694 --> 00:15:48,951
You didn't fix your button!

242
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:53,924
"The Life of Oguri Cap!" Check him out!

243
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:11,483
You idiot!

244
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:13,721
Are you finished? I'm outta here.

245
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,531
You didn't fix your button!

246
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:17,229
I've gotta follow.

247
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:18,504
Mr. Takasaki!

248
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:21,504
We found Nakanojou unconscious
on the floor of the science room!

249
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,615
Wha...?

250
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:25,205
We need you to come help like, right now!

251
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:25,770
Hey, wait a second!

252
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:26,738
Leave me alone!

253
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:36,859
Okay. Now listen up.

254
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:37,637
Yeah?

255
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,062
I'm sure Nakanojou's fine!

256
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:43,004
Huh?!

257
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:45,703
That's right! He's probably just napping!

258
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:49,187
But I looked at his eyes and they're all whited out!

259
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:50,739
Wha...?

260
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:52,354
Fill them in.

261
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,560
Huh?

262
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:55,687
I'll give it a shot.

263
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:57,595
Wha...?

264
00:16:57,781 --> 00:16:58,562
Don't do that!

265
00:16:58,587 --> 00:16:59,749
Huh?

266
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:01,704
Look over there!

267
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,898
Give me the lowdown on this business!

268
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:07,193
It's my sworn duty as a teacher to
stop this kind of illicit relationship.

269
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:10,013
It's more important than, uh, you know.

270
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,253
Get what I mean?

271
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:14,153
You mean Ms. Sakurai and her little brother over there?

272
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:15,494
Let's go.

273
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:16,248
'Kay?

274
00:17:16,273 --> 00:17:17,410
Prepare yourself.

275
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:24,341
There's no time to waste.

276
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:28,698
After all, I am a teacher.

277
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,670
Hey, it's this way!

278
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,423
Hop! Hop! H...

279
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,162
Hop!

280
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:38,138
Hop!

281
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:38,923
Hop!

282
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:39,855
Hop!

283
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:41,761
Hop!

284
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,459
Next stop: Tokisadame Station, North Gate.

285
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:14,947
A stop has been requested.

286
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,437
That's not even close to your stop, dude!

287
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:21,199
Yeah, but it's so fun to push the buttons every time!

288
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:23,322
You pushed the last one too, right?

289
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:24,552
And no one even noticed

290
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:26,187
'cause someone had to get off anyway!

291
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:28,461
So I guess you're actually helpin' 'em out then!

292
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:30,520
Oh, look! Someone needed to get off again!

293
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:31,774
Hey, you're welcome!

294
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:40,045
Mom, where'd we put the daily
calendar with all those tear-off pages?

295
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,000
It should be in the closet, I think.

296
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:57,899
Hakase! Hakase!

297
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,398
Ah, Nano! Good to have you back!

298
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:03,779
Listen! I think it's about time
to take this key off of my back!

299
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:07,966
It's starting to cause more and more
problems in my daily school activities!

300
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:11,923
We did the high jump in gym class
today, and I could only belly roll over it!

301
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,497
And during soccer, I got put on the
bench because I fouled a kid with my key.

302
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:17,102
Okay. I can take it.

303
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:18,456
Splat!

304
00:19:22,568 --> 00:19:24,754
If you were so willing, you should've told me earlier.

305
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:27,350
I gotcha. I'll take it right now if you want.

306
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:30,972
Not a day goes by that I don't
wish to have this thing off my body.

307
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:35,143
But now, I can finally start my
new life as a normal high school girl!

308
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,400
If you don't mind, I'd like to
get this key taken right away.

309
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:42,270
Cheese.

310
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,845
Hakase? Don't tell me you're...

311
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,622
I took it.

312
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,685
Plop!

313
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:49,942
I feel betrayed.

314
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:50,833
Why?

315
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,104
I thought you meant you were gonna remove my key,

316
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:54,480
not take a picture of it!

317
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:55,788
Oops, my bad.

318
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:58,833
So, are you ever gonna take off my key for real?

319
00:19:59,061 --> 00:19:59,883
Let's see.

320
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:06,447
Hmm...

321
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:08,383
Kapow!

322
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:10,952
I've had it up to here with your silly gags!

323
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:13,670
Will you do it? Or will you not do it?

324
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,060
Calm down. I can do it!

325
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:19,475
I've taken more than my fair share of keys in my life.

326
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,440
So taking one more key like yours is gonna be a snap.

327
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,099
Coin, coin, coin, swish!

328
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,961
Wow! I can't believe you just went "coin, coin"!

329
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:31,440
And then flew away like "swish!"

330
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:35,142
Hakase! I have a question for you!

331
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:38,345
Lemme catch my breath.

332
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,942
I was laughing so hard I forgot how to breathe.

333
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:45,163
Listen, I can't help but notice that I'm
making some pretty strange reactions today.

334
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,703
You didn't, you know, do something to me,

335
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:49,904
did you now?

336
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,712
Well, actually, I gave you a funny bone feature yesterday!

337
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:54,623
Shibibi! Shibibi!

338
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,480
Shibibi! Shibibi!

339
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:59,534
Why would you give me such a
bizarre and obnoxious feature?

340
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,729
What is even the point of it anyway?

341
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:03,300
I thought it would be funny.

342
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:03,912
Thump!

343
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,286
Goal!

344
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:08,511
Dodododo!

345
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,087
Mwah!

346
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:09,910
Bang!

347
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,954
This is it.

348
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:15,369
This is how I'm gonna die and it's gonna be awful.

349
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:16,927
See how much fun we're having?

350
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:18,460
I'm not having any fun!

351
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:20,158
All right then.

352
00:21:20,183 --> 00:21:23,900
Forget about the key for a sec and
please just remove this funny bone feature.

353
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:25,363
That'll be a hundred yen.

354
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:28,938
Boom!

355
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:23,296
This takes every last ounce of my strength.

356
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:28,479
I'm oil.

357
00:23:28,504 --> 00:23:30,983
People say I'm slippery, but I can't really blame them!

358
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:32,094
That's just who I am.

359
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,440
My boss pours me all the time, but
you're not the boss of me, so hands off!

360
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:38,587
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 16.

361
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:39,753
Look forward to it!
