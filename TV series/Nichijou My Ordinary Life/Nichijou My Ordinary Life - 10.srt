1
00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:10,698
Green light...

2
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:11,912
And red light.

3
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,636
This is bad! Really, really bad!

4
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,997
Homeroom's starting and I'm so freakin' late!

5
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:47,004
Gotta come up with a really good excuse!

6
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,716
I can't say I stopped to help an old lady,
or that my mom didn't wake me up on time...

7
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:51,906
I used those already!

8
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,075
What's believable?

9
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,919
And what'll for sure get me out of trouble?

10
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:00,413
What was even the point of the red light?!

11
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,750
How did I hit every single stop light on the way over?

12
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:10,555
Thanks to that, I have to awkwardly
show up in the middle of first period!

13
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,847
What's with the booby trap?

14
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:21,395
As if I'd fall for such a basic prank.

15
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:24,651
Ah! A two-fer?

16
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:27,077
What kind of cruel and unusual punishment is this?

17
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:30,324
I didn't even do anything wrong! Besides being late.

18
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:33,683
It's a good thing I can just slip
in through the little side door here.

19
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:37,347
At least that saves me the embarrassment of
getting chewed out at the front of the classroom.

20
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,871
Yup. Of course it's locked.

21
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:47,295
It just had to be locked today of all days!

22
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:51,193
I know! I can just sneak through the bottom door thingy!

23
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:56,263
I'll just slip in like the wind, completely
undetected, and they'll be none the wiser.

24
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,180
What is going on?

25
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:00,418
I should've known!

26
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:04,757
There's only one mastermind in this entire
school who'd do this and she's in my class.

27
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,489
I guess it could be for the best.

28
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:09,349
If I crawled through there, I'd
probably get into even more trouble.

29
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:10,695
But if I'm gonna go down,

30
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,202
I might as well take the high road!

31
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,101
Since when do we have stained-glass windows?

32
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,104
Hang on, why am I running?

33
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,572
There's nothing to run away from.

34
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:44,418
I've got no choice but to go back and face the music.

35
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:46,203
It's the right thing to do.

36
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:51,059
Looks like there's only one way
this can go that works out for me.

37
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:54,848
If I am to perish, I shall accept my fate proudly.

38
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,891
I'll march in through the front
door and go out with a bang.

39
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,856
That would be awesome!

40
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,802
Now, it's show time!

41
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:03,643
Prepare yourself, eraser.

42
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:06,805
You're gonna smack this class
clown with a giant grin on her face!

43
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,433
Sorry I'm late, but I <i>erased</i> to get here!

44
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:13,432
Everyone will think I'm hilarious!

45
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,942
Do you have any idea what time it is, young lady?

46
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:20,588
But I just can't stay mad at you.

47
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:22,893
Go ahead and take your seat, ya rascal!

48
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,911
I got this! I totally got this!

49
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,042
I am beauty. I am grace.

50
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,154
I shall appear...

51
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,063
...with a smile on my face!

52
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:34,700
Good morning, my fellow classmates!

53
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,185
I'm here and ready to start the tardy party!

54
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:24,411
I'm an invincible alien!

55
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:29,792
What stupid crap are you up to this time?

56
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,334
Aren't you a little old to be messing around like this?

57
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:36,482
People from planet Invincible
are safe from every sort of attack!

58
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:41,306
Hey! Uh. Heads up! I guess!

59
00:06:58,813 --> 00:06:59,886
Would you shut up?!

60
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:01,761
Miles Davis is rolling in his grave!

61
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:02,752
I'm so sorry!

62
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,808
I guess we got a little bit carried away there, huh?

63
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,600
So what'd you think of our sound, cool cat?

64
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:07,632
It was pure torture!

65
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:10,685
And the only "sound" I could hear
was the rupturing of my ear drums!

66
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:13,052
Maybe you'll change your mind if I play it again.

67
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,496
Did you hear a word I said?!

68
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:21,615
Heh?

69
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:47,943
Looks like there's gonna be flowing
noodles at the park by the shrine today.

70
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,340
Guess I'll check it out!

71
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,270
I've only ever seen it done on TV,

72
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:55,775
but I bet it'll be super neat
to do it myself in real life!

73
00:07:56,369 --> 00:08:00,670
Gotta try and get a good spot at the front,
or I might miss out on the noodly goodness!

74
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,161
I haven't eaten at all today,

75
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:06,762
so I gotta make sure to snag
a buncha noods and eat my fill!

76
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:16,370
Uh...

77
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,539
Noodles!

78
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:27,643
What the hell are you doing?!

79
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,524
Are you trying to screw things up?!

80
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,828
Here comes some more.

81
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:36,279
Um, excuse me, but I don't, uh...

82
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,614
What?! Are you gonna show up here,
waste my noodles, and just give up?

83
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,616
I don't know who you think you
are, but that ain't gonna fly with me!

84
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:46,146
Uhh...

85
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:47,574
So, don't be mad,

86
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:50,308
but, uh, I don't have any chopsticks with me.

87
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,415
You're quite the demanding brat, huh?!

88
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:54,935
Here, you better be ready now!

89
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,863
Okay.

90
00:08:58,225 --> 00:08:59,434
Eww...

91
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,546
Sorry to bother you,

92
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:04,524
but I think these are kinda-sorta used already.

93
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,405
Deal with it.

94
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:10,442
Enough chatter! My noodles wait for no one, get it?

95
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:13,413
Oh, well, guess I have no choice.

96
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,456
Aww.

97
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,917
When I dish out a joke, you're supposed to laugh.

98
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:36,825
The next one coming up will be different,
and I'll show you what true hell is like!

99
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,908
So get ready!

100
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:44,336
Uhh...

101
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:47,070
I'm not gonna waste all my water on you!

102
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:49,166
It's dry noodle or no noodle!

103
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:53,427
Don't you even think about skipping them.

104
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,602
I, uh...

105
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,677
Would you quit being so flaky?

106
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:08,767
Dig in and savor the flavor of raw noodles!

107
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:10,918
Uhh...

108
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:14,509
What are you waiting for?! They
won't stay fresh all day, y'know!

109
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:17,887
You haven't changed one bit.

110
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:26,372
Uh?

111
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,935
Y-You came back.

112
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:33,157
Uh...?

113
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:38,672
Masaharu!

114
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:42,391
When I caught word of the flowing noodles in the park,

115
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:43,931
I knew it had to be you.

116
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:48,898
I only did it all this time because I
knew that you would come back to me someday.

117
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,831
It's been 30 years since you left to search

118
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:54,966
for the most delicious flowing noodles.

119
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:56,706
Were you able to find them?

120
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:57,349
Huh?

121
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,917
I sampled noodles from all across the land,

122
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,469
but I'm afraid that it was all for naught.

123
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,366
I used our savings to support my travels,

124
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,689
but I must report, they're as dry as an uncooked nood.

125
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:11,427
Eh?

126
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:13,859
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:14,526 --> 00:11:17,575
Could you ever accept a broken man without his noodles?

128
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,172
Huh?!

129
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:19,738
Of course.

130
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,681
What are you lookin' at?! Keep on walking!

131
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,672
Excuse me, miss, but could you make
like a flowing noodle and slip away?

132
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:33,132
Huh?!

133
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:43,411
Listen up, freshman, it's announcement time!

134
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:47,394
There are some people who learn with
praise and others who learn through criticism.

135
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:51,558
And I will be the one to determine
which type you are, you understand me?

136
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:55,794
When you learn through praise, but never get praised.

137
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:09,720
Eight. Seven. Six. Five.

138
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:14,685
Four. Three. Two. One. Zero.

139
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:18,618
Launch when I say it like that!

140
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,285
Wait, what?

141
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:31,242
Seriously?! Why?!

142
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,182
Nano!

143
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:39,329
Look at what I did! I put my hair in a ponytail!

144
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:40,440
Oh...

145
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:41,473
What do you think?

146
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:45,270
It makes you look a lot more mature
when you put your hair up like that.

147
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:50,445
Uh! Really?

148
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,014
Okay, so can you tell me more about
how grown up you think I've gotten?

149
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:55,476
Yeah, okay.

150
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,963
I guess you seem more mature than you used to be?

151
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,308
How about you? How grown up do you think you are, Nano?

152
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:02,668
Huh?

153
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:07,189
Well, I suppose I've never thought of
myself as the particularly mature type.

154
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,223
Yeah, you're right.

155
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:11,408
I guess you aren't all that mature, huh?

156
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,289
So, it looks like I have to be the one who cleans up!

157
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:20,204
Pick up this, and this.

158
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:25,381
Here, I'll grab that for you!

159
00:13:25,564 --> 00:13:28,748
Um, I was still reading that. You don't have to take it.

160
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,894
Oh, silly Nano. Uh.

161
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:32,736
Uhh...

162
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:37,462
What am I gonna do with you, Sakamoto? Huh?

163
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:39,896
Uh, what're you doing?

164
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:41,505
I don't want you to catch a cold.

165
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,253
I dunno what you're up to,

166
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:44,365
but leave me out of it.

167
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:46,361
Oh, silly Sakamoto.

168
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:47,631
What?

169
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:48,955
You'll catch a cold.

170
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:49,846
No, I won't!

171
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,495
And if you're gonna cover me, use a
towel or a blanket, not a stupid book!

172
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:56,594
Oh, Sakamoto. Always so quick to complain.

173
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,405
Cut it out!

174
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,956
I do not appreciate this harassment!

175
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:04,200
All right, I'm gonna go and put the laundry in.

176
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:05,984
Hey! Good idea! Let's do it!

177
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:10,986
I've got this covered, Hakase.

178
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:13,390
All that's left to do now is turn on the dial.

179
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:15,382
Then it looks like I have no choice.

180
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,288
I'll turn the dial for you!

181
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:20,833
No. Don't worry. I can handle this part by myself.

182
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:24,360
I said I can turn it, so lemme
turn the dial thing, 'cause I wanna!

183
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:26,679
Okay, sure.

184
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:28,601
Could you please help me with the laundry?

185
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:45,455
If you need my help, you just have to ask.

186
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,915
Right. Sounds good.

187
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,531
Oh, well.

188
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,692
It looks like you're having trouble with
the cooking, so let me take care of it.

189
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:24,414
Actually, I think things are going fine on my end.

190
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:27,475
I bet my cooking will taste better if you try it!

191
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,167
Come on, I'll prove it to you!

192
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:30,249
Cut it out! That's dangerous!

193
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:31,725
Just lemme use the thingy!

194
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:33,935
I'm serious! You need to be careful!

195
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:36,039
You can trust me.

196
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,679
Oh my goodness! Is everything okay, Sakamoto?

197
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,076
Do things look okay to you?!

198
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:50,704
No! But I was just hoping!

199
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,521
You are so reckless, Sakamoto, walking
straight into harm's way like that.

200
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:55,759
How is this my fault?!

201
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,350
You were the ones messing around!

202
00:15:57,433 --> 00:16:00,676
Try to relax, kitty-kitty. Being mad isn't helping anyone.

203
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:02,725
You are making zero sense right now!

204
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:05,355
It's not a big deal. I'll just start over.

205
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,929
Don't worry! You can leave all the cooking to me!

206
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,775
Well, I don't want all the other food to get cold,

207
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:12,174
so it needs to be quick.

208
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:13,507
Yeah, I get it.

209
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,940
I'll have to take care of things then.

210
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,700
Watch the eggs, Hakase!

211
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:19,391
You're gonna knock 'em over like that!

212
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:21,359
Don't worry so much! I'm grown up!

213
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:22,616
Hey! Careful!

214
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:24,456
I have everything under control!

215
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:27,754
Oh, clumsy kitty.

216
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:28,733
It's your fault!

217
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:32,548
Ugh. What is her deal today, anyway?

218
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,852
I think she's trying to act mature for us.

219
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,702
Because I am mature.

220
00:16:39,153 --> 00:16:39,537
Psh.

221
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:42,317
Oh. Hey, kid.

222
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:43,621
Yeah, what's up?

223
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,175
You do know that mature kids don't get snacks.

224
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,885
Ta-dah! It was actually the
same ol' Hakase this entire time!

225
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:04,672
I lied.

226
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:07,969
Wha...?

227
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:12,941
Hm?

228
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:15,032
Whoa! It looks like I've got a big one!

229
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:19,775
Wow! A single rain boot!

230
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:21,444
Hm?

231
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,857
Ah! It's a giant one this time!

232
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,919
Whoa! It's an old tea kettle!

233
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,822
This is starting to feel more
like treasure hunting than fishing.

234
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:37,766
If I knew I'd find such cool stuff,
I would've brought some friends.

235
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,877
I guess I'll come back later.

236
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:58,341
Some trendy things.

237
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:11,758
Bare-handed sushi.

238
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:20,683
Dammit!

239
00:18:21,153 --> 00:18:24,132
I don't wanna do my homework!

240
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:27,347
Why does homework even exist in the first place?

241
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,320
Well, my grades are in the crapper
right now, so I kinda have to do it.

242
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:35,750
I'm usually so good at doing just enough to scrape by.

243
00:18:35,994 --> 00:18:36,925
Usually.

244
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:38,635
But right now...

245
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:43,330
...I'm wondering what I'll even do
if I graduate and go off to college.

246
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:46,145
What comes next? Getting a job?

247
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:49,504
I keep hearing about how tough the job market is nowadays,

248
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,673
so what chance do I have if I don't get my degree?

249
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:58,736
High school... College... Career...

250
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,788
The biggest hurdle right now
would be college entrance exams.

251
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,491
But... studying is the worst!

252
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,931
How is this school work applicable to real life anyway?

253
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:12,213
Wait, hang on.

254
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,765
What do I even want out of life?

255
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,693
"My dreams for the future" by Yuuko Aioi!

256
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:23,111
What do I want to be when I grow up?

257
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:26,155
I wanna be a frilled lizard, 'cause they're cool!

258
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:29,246
I'm... a Lizard.

259
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:31,328
La, la, la, la, la.

260
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:33,998
I don't wanna study!

261
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:39,488
I don't wanna be a frilled lizard anymore
either, so I'm running out of options!

262
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:41,212
Wait, actually.

263
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:46,075
If I was a frilled lizard, I wouldn't have
to deal with real people problems anymore.

264
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,968
But if I didn't want any problems,

265
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:50,825
I think I'd have a pretty easy life

266
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,926
if I was a living national treasure.

267
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:56,403
If I did become one, I wonder how much I would make...

268
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,036
And how do I become a living
national treasure in the first place?

269
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:03,625
Come to think of it, I'm not even sure what one is.

270
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:06,001
All right, enough crazy talk.

271
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:08,683
I need to come up with some realistic options.

272
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:11,810
What do I want to become? What do I want to do?

273
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:12,840
What to do...

274
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:17,971
No good. I've got nothing.

275
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,849
I just started high school, so I guess
I have a few years to think it over.

276
00:20:22,077 --> 00:20:26,274
If I've still got nothing by then, that means...

277
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:31,430
College! Exams! And studying!

278
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:34,710
And I don't wanna study!

279
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:36,985
No, I can't think like that!

280
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,390
I just need a plan.

281
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,711
I have to figure out what I wanna do with my life.

282
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:43,914
Once I figure that out, everything will fall into place!

283
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,162
What do I wanna do?

284
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:49,847
What do I wanna do?

285
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:04,052
Oh, hey, Mom!

286
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:13,141
Would you stop banging on the floor?!

287
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:15,414
Don't you know how late it is?

288
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:42,347
Well, I'm not too great with tough questions.

289
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,510
For now, I'll just do my homework.

290
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:25,645
Dammit! I still don't wanna do my homework!

291
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,385
Heya! I'm a frilled lizard!

292
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,258
I'm pretty tough to fold as origami!

293
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:34,578
It might take a few sheets before
you finally figure out how to make me!

294
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:38,341
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 11!

295
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:39,857
You better look forward to it!
