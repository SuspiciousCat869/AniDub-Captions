1
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:09,117
A-A-A-choo!

2
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:17,221
It sure is getting cold lately. Huh?

3
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:20,329
Wha...?

4
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:23,492
Sakamoto.

5
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:26,127
Sakamoto.

6
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:28,034
Sakamoto.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,221
Sakamoto.

8
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:31,908
Sakamoto.

9
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,187
Stop it! Stay back!

10
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,627
Cut it out! Wait!

11
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:36,976
Just hold on a second!

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,038
Leave me alone!

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,666
You're freakin' me out!

14
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:43,009
At least... tell me why you're doing this.

15
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:17,226
Okay, Mai. You can apply the screentones on this one.

16
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,746
Yuuko, take those and use the pen to draw in
the appropriate page numbers in the corners.

17
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,846
And fill in the shade of the character's hair, too.

18
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:23,846
Okay!

19
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:24,945
Amazing!

20
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:28,513
I had no idea you were so proficient in creating manga!

21
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:30,944
I'm nothing special, so I wouldn't put it that way.

22
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:36,080
She's actually been drawing forever,
but kept it a secret until recently.

23
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:37,935
Well, it's not secret anymore, is it?

24
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,366
But why did you hide it?

25
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:40,377
Just 'cause.

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,832
But now,

27
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:45,904
I guess I don't really think it's that big of a
deal if people find out about what I like to do.

28
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:49,414
Things kinda got put into perspective
after I submitted to a manga magazine.

29
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,013
They said that they were looking
forward to my next submission,

30
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:55,596
so I figured there's no point
in keeping it a secret anymore.

31
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:58,640
That means they think you're talented
enough to get published one day!

32
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:00,606
Let's not jump to conclusions yet.

33
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:04,572
Is it okay if I take a look at some of your work?

34
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,747
Uh...

35
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:08,193
Um... Nano?

36
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:09,406
You okay?

37
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,685
Uhh. Hey, don't force it.

38
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,675
You don't have to read it if it's not to your taste.

39
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:16,629
What's the matter?

40
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:19,070
Um, excuse me.

41
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:20,836
I think I need to get some fresh air.

42
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,862
I can come with you if you want company.

43
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:24,322
It's fine.

44
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,258
I don't want to distract you
guys from working on the manuscript,

45
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:28,888
so just keep on keeping on.

46
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:30,693
I'll be back in a little while, okay?

47
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,236
Huh. I guess there must be a lot on her mind, huh?

48
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,317
Aw, crap!

49
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,037
It's this late already?

50
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:42,455
We really can't afford to waste any more time now!

51
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,305
Let's buckle down and focus!

52
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:45,788
No more playing around.

53
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,582
We gotta hit that deadline tomorrow.

54
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:49,599
You got it, boss lady!

55
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:54,086
I dunno if you know this, but I'm quite
the artist myself, so this'll be easy-peasy!

56
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,626
Everybody to battle stations!

57
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,608
Or something.

58
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,168
Come on, Yuuko.

59
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:27,467
You just started and you're slacking off already?

60
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:28,447
Here.

61
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:29,971
Whoa, that was quick.

62
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:31,823
All right, I'll check it over.

63
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,732
Now let's see what we got here.

64
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,263
I'll make you a slave.

65
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:36,039
A what?

66
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:39,763
Are you kidding me? Why did you draw this?

67
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,143
It's Kuya the Monk.

68
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:43,002
I don't have time for your stupid pranks!

69
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,944
What made you think you had to add things?

70
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:48,388
The blank page called out, longing to be filled.

71
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,637
What does that mean?!

72
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:52,694
Take the white out and fix it as fast as possible. Please.

73
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,721
Just stick to the screentones like I asked.

74
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,344
And stop vandalizing my art!

75
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,096
I've experienced a lot of pain in my life,

76
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:02,346
but that had to be the absolute worst. Ever.

77
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:05,055
I better get to work.

78
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,689
Uh... huh?

79
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:08,396
Huh?

80
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:14,942
Oh, no.

81
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:19,143
Wait! This is bad!

82
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:20,832
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap, crap, crap!

83
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:22,105
Oh, yeah, and...

84
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,812
If you make any mistakes, make sure to tell me
right away so I can fix it before it gets any worse.

85
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,707
Any worse?

86
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:33,466
Ooh, it can't get any worse than this, right?

87
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:35,070
So, I might as well try to fix it!

88
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:36,116
It's done.

89
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,182
Oh? Already?

90
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,367
I hope you didn't add anything
weird to the background again.

91
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:43,994
I'll make you a grave.

92
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:45,044
A what?

93
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:47,977
It's a grave now?!

94
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,018
What even is this?

95
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,918
A graveyard.

96
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:52,396
That was a rhetorical question!

97
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:55,506
That background's supposed to
be a fancy palace in Daikanyama!

98
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:57,746
So? Why didn't you just draw that?

99
00:05:57,796 --> 00:06:00,060
Why'd it have to be something weird?

100
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,350
Because there was empty space left over.

101
00:06:02,388 --> 00:06:04,030
You're the absolute worst!

102
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:05,124
Just forget it!

103
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:07,260
Erase it and I'll do it myself later!

104
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,580
You can only erase, no adding!

105
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,596
Am I making myself clear?

106
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,637
Understood.

107
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,067
There.

108
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,820
That doesn't look too bad!

109
00:06:30,018 --> 00:06:32,388
I mean, I'm sure it'd be fine if I drew it on its own,

110
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:35,267
but right now... it doesn't match!

111
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,767
Mio is gonna kill me, isn't she?

112
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:39,106
I'm finished.

113
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:41,359
I hope you only erased things like I asked.

114
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:42,732
Ugh, whatever.

115
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:45,495
My characters better not still
be on that weird background.

116
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:49,250
Why?! What did you do?

117
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:50,050
I erased.

118
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,151
I'm about to erase you here in a second!

119
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:55,135
Why do you keep messing with my artwork like this?

120
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:58,555
Because I don't think the manga
you're making is very interesting.

121
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,652
I'm asking for your help, not your opinion!

122
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:04,052
Forget the erasing and just
take this and draw some panels.

123
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:06,206
Make sure they match the other page!

124
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:07,736
You got it, boss lady.

125
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:09,545
You better not screw this one up!

126
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,614
Helvetica Standard.

127
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:20,827
Now ten seconds.

128
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,170
Twenty seconds.

129
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:32,049
And one, two, three, four, five,

130
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:37,040
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

131
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,853
The time is up.

132
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,829
This is not going well!

133
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:57,208
I don't even know what the heck
he's supposed to look like anymore!

134
00:07:57,373 --> 00:07:58,290
Who is he?

135
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,390
Where did he come from?

136
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:01,290
Mio is definitely gonna kill me now!

137
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:02,330
I'm finished.

138
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:03,866
Okay...

139
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:09,209
And you only drew the panels, right?

140
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,121
Long, long ago,

141
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:13,746
there lived an ordinary man and woman.

142
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,011
The man ventured out to gather firewood.

143
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:31,897
The Private second class was born from a peach.

144
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:33,351
That makes no sense!

145
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,555
Will you please just follow instructions?

146
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,693
I can do that.

147
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,846
♪ Cha-cha-la-la! Cha! ♪

148
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:44,882
♪ Cha-cha-la-la! Cha! ♪

149
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,761
♪ Cha-cha-cha-cha Cha-la-la! ♪

150
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:59,210
Thi... is... the worst!

151
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,204
I'm trying my best to fix things, but
it gets uglier every time I touch it.

152
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:04,610
This is a pickle.

153
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:05,930
What should I do?

154
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:07,472
What can I do?

155
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:11,802
Wait, Mai?

156
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:13,263
Just leave it to me.

157
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,095
You mean you can fix it?

158
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:18,119
You can draw? Seriously?

159
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,682
Of course she can't.

160
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:26,055
There's no way.

161
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:28,275
That'd be too good to be true.

162
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:30,923
Wait! Unless...

163
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:32,891
...she's good!

164
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:34,786
She is, like, crazy good!

165
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:36,359
Maybe she's too crazy!

166
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,219
But, right now,

167
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:42,008
if crazy is what it takes, then let's get crazy!

168
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,095
Let's go back to the good ol' days.

169
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:57,688
Back when I didn't know the
difference between right and wrong.

170
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:00,809
When everything was fresh and innocent.

171
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,587
And then, tell the truth and be set free.

172
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:10,983
I'm so sorry!

173
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:14,216
You'll have to draw this section over again!

174
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:16,845
But...

175
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:19,997
We don't have any manuscript paper left!

176
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:38,292
Hey, wait.

177
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:41,111
No running in the hallway.

178
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,995
Sasahara!

179
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:01,629
Dammit, it won't come off!

180
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:05,864
They wanted nothing at all.

181
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:30,291
Gotcha!

182
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:33,271
Hey, Yoshino.

183
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,777
What are you doing here?

184
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:35,827
Looking for me?

185
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,829
I just stopped by, same as you.

186
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,107
Okay...

187
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,727
So, what are you up to?

188
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,963
Um, well, uh, nothing, I guess.

189
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:46,130
Really?

190
00:11:47,678 --> 00:11:49,626
Actually... It's just...

191
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,612
I can't concentrate during practice,
and we have the competition coming up.

192
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:58,115
I'm not sure if you've ever felt anything
like this when you were in high school,

193
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:02,371
but I feel like it's getting harder
and harder to keep my guard up sometimes.

194
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:04,224
She's not listening.

195
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,593
Have you ever read this manga before?

196
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:09,691
It's hilarious!

197
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,197
For real? She's not helpful with anything but kendo.

198
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,130
Not surprised.

199
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:15,888
What? Quit muttering!

200
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:17,053
What were you saying?

201
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:18,720
Don't worry about it!

202
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:23,594
By the way, you were planning on
being at the national kendo championship,

203
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:24,400
isn't that right?

204
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:26,388
Oh! Yeah, I am.

205
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,400
If that's true,

206
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,888
then how come Mihoshi's been saying
that you haven't been to the dojo in...

207
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:33,097
I forgot I have to go grocery shopping today!

208
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:35,468
Huh? W-Wait, hang on!

209
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,305
You can have my rice crackers.

210
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:39,180
Thanks?

211
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:40,205
See ya!

212
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:47,553
What was that all about?

213
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:49,553
Hey, Sis!

214
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:53,494
What are ya doin'?

215
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:54,638
Just chillin' here?

216
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,230
I was, uh, just talking to Yoshino.

217
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:59,996
Even though the national championship's tomorrow?

218
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,687
Hold on. Tomorrow?

219
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,297
Did she mention anything?

220
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,510
Mm... Not really.

221
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,285
Wait! She left me these things.

222
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:09,338
Want one?

223
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:10,879
Sure.

224
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:13,595
Wow, its red.

225
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:16,312
It sure is.

226
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:23,867
Spicy!

227
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:25,060
I don't think so!

228
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:27,633
I'm not sure!

229
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,772
Hey, Mio. Turn around. I want you to see this!

230
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:51,626
Huh?

231
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:53,065
You like my new look?

232
00:13:53,144 --> 00:13:56,617
I've been wanting to change things up, so I
bought some of these thingies the other day.

233
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:57,799
You like 'em?

234
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,314
Yeah, they suit you.

235
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,492

Then ready or not, here I come!

241
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:21,496
Oh, Hakase!

242
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,058
Where are you?

243
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:30,694
♪ I'm ready! ♪

244
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:36,632
Sakamoto has been caught!

245
00:14:37,138 --> 00:14:37,665
Huh?

246
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:42,606
Beginner's luck is a hell of a thing. Whatever.

247
00:14:42,663 --> 00:14:43,714
If you say so.

248
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:47,800
I usually don't reduce myself
to playing with kids like you,

249
00:14:47,996 --> 00:14:51,303
but sometimes the boredom can be a little too much.

250
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:52,483
Right.

251
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:55,711
What are you waiting for?

252
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:56,743
Don't just sit there!

253
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:58,059
Let's go play some more!

254
00:14:58,505 --> 00:15:00,212
All right!

255
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:14,327
Hakase?

256
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:17,169
Where are you?

257
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:19,282
Hey, kid! You there?

258
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:21,105
Come on out!

259
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:23,871
Who knew she'd be so good at hiding.

260
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:25,809
She really did disappear, huh?

261
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,352
They're never, ever gonna find me in here.

262
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:34,664
Knowing her, I'd wager that she's
probably hiding somewhere outside.

263
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:35,875
That makes sense.

264
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:37,510
But maybe we should take a break.

265
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,490
Sounds good.

266
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,823
It's just as well.

267
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:43,450
I dunno about you, but I'd be fine with never finding her!

268
00:15:47,397 --> 00:15:49,151
Whoa, there you are.

269
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:54,596
Did you build this room all by yourself?

270
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,306
Mm-hmm.

271
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:58,130
Why'd you come out of such a good hiding spot?

272
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,449
There's no point in us seeking if you don't hide.

273
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:01,382
Get it?

274
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,530
I was scared that you wouldn't be able to find
me in my secret room and I'd be hiding forever.

275
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,396
Well, that's a good point.

276
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:12,684
Hakase.

277
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:19,544
Did you... blow your nose on me?

278
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:20,692
Yeah.

279
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:24,797
Now I'm gonna have to put my
school uniform in the laundry, too.

280
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,263
Then I guess that settles it.

281
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:30,011
Looks like I'll be it this time!

282
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:31,531
Sound good? Ready, set, go!

283
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:34,017
I can help you wash your school uniform if you want.

284
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:37,412
That'll probably just make
things worse, so I think I'll pass.

285
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:39,260
You won't know for sure till you try!

286
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:41,828
No, I think I'm pretty sure about this one.

287
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,681
Aw, come on! It'll be fine!

288
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:50,609
The Life of Pyon!

289
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:51,763
Check him out!

290
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:36,706
That's it. No more excuses!

291
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,445
I can't believe you!

292
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:41,971
Well, yeah, uh, I was saying...

293
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,868
I don't care what you have to say!

294
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:50,621
You coming over to help out
was a nice gesture and everything.

295
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:52,215
I get that.

296
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,314
But all you did was make things worse for me.

297
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:59,246
And then, after I said that we were out of
paper, instead of going out and getting more,

298
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:00,678
you had to make it difficult.

299
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,940
Do you remember that?

300
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,499
I asked you to go buy some, and what did you say?

301
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,117
Hey, how's about we flip for it?

302
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,445
Take it off our hands... and leave it to fate!

303
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,778
Not a chance in hell!

304
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:20,620
You're the one who spilled
all the ink and ruined the page.

305
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:24,785
How could you even consider making me go
when I have so much work to do? Come on!

306
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,815
But I got over it!

307
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:29,027
You ended up agreeing with me and you
said you'd be the one to go to the store.

308
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,722
And then what did you have to say?

309
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:32,249
Mio, I, uh...

310
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:33,429
What did you say?

311
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,788
Question.

312
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:37,472
Judging by my face, how old do I look?

313
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:39,132
Who cares?!

314
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:42,000
You just keep wasting my time
and the paper store's gonna close!

315
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,823
Why bring that up now of all times?

316
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:45,288
Why would you ask me that?

317
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:46,252
But I got over it!

318
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:48,682
You finally decided to head off to the store,

319
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,217
and what did you suddenly have to complain about?

320
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:52,874
It sure is chilly out.

321
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:56,138
Oh, speaking of, I think I might've caught a cold.

322
00:18:56,163 --> 00:18:58,388
How could you have caught a cold out of nowhere?!

323
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,263
You just kept on wasting my time!

324
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:02,167
And... it's not even that cold out!

325
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:03,500
But I got over it!

326
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:05,770
And? What did you come back with in hand?

327
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,045
The hell is that anyway?!

328
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:10,888
All you had to do was get the
manuscript paper like I asked!

329
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,875
But you had to make your stupid jokes!

330
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:14,996
And you just could never tell when enough was enough!

331
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,598
Here.

332
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:17,400
That's a hard pass for me!

333
00:19:17,428 --> 00:19:19,305
I thought I was at the end of my rope with you,

334
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,203
but you keep finding more rope to cut!

335
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:24,242
Especially when you don't stop
coming up with dumb things to say!

336
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,848
I'm so sorry, calamari.

337
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,770
Calamari?!

338
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:31,163
This isn't even funny anymore!

339
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:33,830
Where the hell did calamari come from anyway?

340
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:35,065
And after all that,

341
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,721
I still actually believed that
you got the manuscript paper.

342
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:40,415
But it was some esoteric joke that gave me a headache!

343
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:44,471
All I wanted was for you to hurry up and
get the paper, but what did you say to that?

344
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:47,010
Sorry for the delay. Please frog-ive me.

345
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:48,810
It's a frog now?!

346
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:50,851
Are you actually asking for forgiveness?

347
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:52,953
Or are you asking me to give you a frog?

348
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:54,633
I ask you one final time

349
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:56,983
if you actually got any of the manuscript paper,

350
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,023
and what did you have to say to that?

351
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:00,245
Sorry safari.

352
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:04,295
Where'd safari come from and what happened to calamari?!

353
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:06,290
Wait, who cares about calamari?

354
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:08,327
Where is my paper?

355
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:10,706
Oh, yeah! You gave me something else!

356
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:11,173
Here.

357
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,926
Writing paper. Indeed.

358
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:15,782
Now I have all the tools I need... for my novel.

359
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:17,629
Wrong kind of paper!

360
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:20,805
How long do you intend to make a joke
out of my life until you're satisfied?

361
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,292
What do you want from me, huh?

362
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,746
Oh wait, you said...!

363
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,624
You know, there's a funny thing about the truth.

364
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:27,163
It's not always true.

365
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,292
Yes, it is!

366
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:31,720
I decided you were a lost cause and
I had no choice but to turn to Nano.

367
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:34,368
But I messed up and showed her my work in progress.

368
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:35,397
And then she...!

369
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:37,956
She got hooked!

370
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:39,383
Thanks, but no thanks!

371
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:41,222
She just can't stop squealing!

372
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:44,110
I got so desperate, I even asked Mai for help!

373
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:47,093
Mai, could you do me a favor and get me some more paper?

374
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:50,321
But she bounced already!

375
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,043
She vanished like the wind!

376
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:54,722
Flowing swiftly yet silently at her own pace!

377
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:57,666
Sure, it was kind of disrespectful,
but that's not the point!

378
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,496
The point is, you saw the goodbye letter she left behind,

379
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:01,849
and you said what?

380
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,775
This could be a sign from God,

381
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,010
or the trap of a demon.

382
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,434
You're the demon who's trapping me!

383
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,538
This entire day has been a trap since
you showed up to quote-unquote "help"!

384
00:21:12,574 --> 00:21:14,874
And it just kept on going and going!

385
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:17,596
I don't even get that one!

386
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,286
Uh, you know...

387
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,788
Shut up!

388
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:20,906
I don't wanna hear any more excuses from you!

389
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,765
You're just a pumpkin head!

390
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:24,092
Hang on, now.

391
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:24,887
Don't go nuts.

392
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:27,402
I'm only going nuts because you're making me!

393
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:28,210
You dumb...

394
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:33,133
...giant peanut head!

395
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,335
I'm trying to tell you...

396
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,034
Don't try to give me another one of your...

397
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,427
Your...

398
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:38,922
Huh?

399
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:47,371
Uh...

400
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:50,139
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,782
Please... frog-ive me?

402
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:27,554
Hello!

403
00:23:27,592 --> 00:23:30,805
I'm the medium of your dreams, Manga Manuscript Paper.

404
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,774
Draw your heart out and achieve fame,

405
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,149
shooting me through the mail service of your choice.

406
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:38,413

407
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:39,873
Walk-ins are welcome, too.
