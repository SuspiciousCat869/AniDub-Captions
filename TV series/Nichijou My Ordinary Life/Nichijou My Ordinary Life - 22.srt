1
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,686
Everything in this world can be explained by science.

2
00:00:24,988 --> 00:00:29,102
Our society is infatuated by things
like ghosts and paranormal phenomena,

3
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:31,894
but such stupid stuff couldn't possibly be real!

4
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,626
They can't exist.

5
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:38,235
Which is why...

6
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,639
...I refuse to believe in spirits!

7
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:20,135
I stopped by my local temple to
ask for a so-called "exorcism."

8
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,135
Hmm. Now, what can I help you with today, young man?

9
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:25,630
If I act like I'm possessed by an evil spirit,

10
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:28,462
I can call him out on his nonsense when he tries to help.

11
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:33,923
My throat's been kinda sore lately, and it almost
feels like someone, or something, is strangling me.

12
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,756
Oh?

13
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:37,598
Try this.

14
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,095
It should clear that right up.

15
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,064
I knew it!

16
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:43,327
He's probably gonna give me some sort
of trinket to ward away evil or something!

17
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,805
Those cough drops help with all kinds of throat pain.

18
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,516
Well, I guess that's a perfectly logical solution.

19
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:54,277
Maybe my symptoms weren't supernatural enough for him.

20
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:57,518
It looks like I'm gonna have to
go further to make him believe me!

21
00:02:57,714 --> 00:02:58,198
Huh?

22
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:00,466
You don't get it!

23
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:02,700
This isn't just some ordinary sore throat!

24
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:03,527
It's like...

25
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,482
...I can feel someone's hands around my neck, choking me!

26
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:11,497
And when it gets really bad, I start
making these creepy noises against my will.

27
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:13,458
It's almost like I'm possessed!

28
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:15,289
Well. That's something.

29
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:17,381
Maybe lay off the horror movies.

30
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,700
And, uh... go away.

31
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,845
I never expected that this paranormal
professional would just shoot me down like that.

32
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:30,926
Then again, I guess I didn't double
check if he actually did believe in spirits.

33
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,749
But whatever. I can't let this trip be for nothing!

34
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,897
I'm not gonna leave without giving it my best shot!

35
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:41,318
I can feel something sinister trying
to choke the life out of me right now!

36
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm sorry!

37
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,377
He wasn't fooled at all!

38
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:58,577
Of course he wasn't.

39
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:02,487
I'll have to commit to my performance if I'm
gonna have any chance at convincing an expert!

40
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:05,146
I've really gotta sell this.

41
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:10,102
If I want him to buy it, I have to take it to the limit!

42
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:15,866
Huh? What the?

43
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:24,457
Stop! Whatever you're doing!

44
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:30,531
What is the matter with you?

45
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:32,140
You're going off the rails!

46
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:34,569
Chug-a, chug-a choo-choo!

47
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:36,968
Chug-a, chug-a choo-choo! Chug-a, chug-a choo-choo!

48
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:39,077
That's not funny!

49
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:42,892
Cut it out!

50
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:57,650
Chug-a, chug-a... Chug-a, chug-a...

51
00:04:58,153 --> 00:04:59,225
Damn you!

52
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,315
I cannot allow this!

53
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:05,562
How dare you defile my temple!

54
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,353
When I grow up,

55
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,767
I want to become a brilliant scientist.

56
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,782
Aw crap.

57
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:18,545
I went a little overboard.

58
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:23,297
I believe that everything on this
planet can be explained by science.

59
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:27,250
And one day, I hope to spread knowledge
and understanding throughout the world.

60
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:30,348
When that day comes, I have but one piece of wisdom.

61
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:31,861
Are you okay, sir?

62
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:34,081
Leave.

63
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:36,860
Get out of my temple, you demon!

64
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:40,637
That is: there's a demon inside all of us, you see.

65
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:55,534
Gotcha!

66
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:56,163
Hey!

67
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:56,839
Who the...

68
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,291
Long time no see, Mihoshi!

69
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,944
Yeah? Well, same to you!

70
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,823
The last time we saw each other, you
weren't even in middle school yet, were you?

71
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,678
That's 'cause you stopped coming to the dojo forever ago.

72
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:14,858
Yeah, well,

73
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:18,281
I just don't really have any
motivation to keep up with my training.

74
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:19,072
Like, ever.

75
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:21,742
You never train but you still
won the national championship?!

76
00:06:22,484 --> 00:06:24,117
You stupid, lazy prodigy!

77
00:06:25,664 --> 00:06:26,772
Heading to the dojo?

78
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:29,420
Yeah, since I'm done with all my school stuff for today.

79
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,655
You wanna come with me?

80
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,241
Hmm.

81
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:36,359
I feel like I actually get worse the more I
practice, so I think I'm gonna have to pass.

82
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,979
Are you kidding me?

83
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:40,214
You frustratingly talented moron!

84
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:44,659
How skilled she is isn't what bothers me.

85
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:48,627
I just can't stand that she got so good
without training as hard as the rest of us.

86
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,908
I heard that during her first year of middle school,

87
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,776
she was able to score a point
against one of the instructors!

88
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:56,158
Almost like it was nothing!

89
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,635
I'm in middle school now,

90
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,760
and I'm not even close to that level.

91
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:03,385
I go to the dojo every day to try and improve,

92
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:05,426
even on the weekends!

93
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,885
My instructor told me that my hard work'll pay off,

94
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:09,843
and that's what I wanna believe!

95
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:11,635
Aw, look! It's a kitty cat!

96
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,847
Hey, little guy, you sleepin'?

97
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:18,270
Being around her is so infuriating.

98
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:19,498
I can't stand it.

99
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:21,411
Aw, you're just the cutest!

100
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:24,085
If only I could land a single blow.

101
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,693
Just one strike.

102
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:28,728
This might be the only way for me right now.

103
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:30,701
But maybe someday,

104
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:34,004
I could land one in a real match, against her,

105
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:35,847
and even the instructors!

106
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:38,754
Then we'll see who the prodigy is!

107
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:43,044
I'm so sorry!

108
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:45,345
Instructor?!

109
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:05,699
I'm freezing.

110
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:13,528
Okay. It's your time to shine.

111
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:16,563
My father wants me to follow in his footsteps so badly.

112
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:17,836
Hold on to this balloon.

113
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:20,139
Give it to a kid if one passes by.

114
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:21,639
But he can't make me do it.

115
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:23,179
So, I'm gonna find a way out!

116
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:31,518
This is humiliating, and...

117
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,819
...this thing doesn't even float!

118
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:53,643
At the end of the day,

119
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:57,346
everyone hopes at least to see a happy ending.

120
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:09,867
So, do you know what you're
asking Santa for this year, Hakase?

121
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:11,267
Yeah, I know!

122
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:14,195
Some chocolate snacks, new colored pencils,

123
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,133
and some cake erasers, and um, some, uh...

124
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,541
Wow! If you're asking for all that, then...

125
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,596
...I'll come up with the stuff I want.

126
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,500
Like two dozen more eggs, a gallon of two-percent milk,

127
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:28,336
and maybe an Ivan Bilibin book.

128
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:29,818
I asked for a buncha stuff first,

129
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:33,215
and there's no room for Santa to carry
any more presents, so you only get one!

130
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:37,401
Really?

131
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:39,622
Wait, don't cry.

132
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:41,462
Maybe you can have more than one present.

133
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:45,352
I think you can ask for a little
bit of a lot of stuff if you wanna.

134
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:48,793
You wanna borrow my Santa hat?

135
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:53,016
Helvetica Standard.

136
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:00,543
Ho, ho, ho!

137
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,382
Oh, wow! It's Santa!

138
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:04,819
Merry Christmas...

139
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:34,759
I'm not gonna be part of this embarrassment anymore!

140
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,320
Time for the mask to come off!

141
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:38,134
Ow!

142
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:41,693
Trying to escape, Tsyoshi?

143
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:42,390
Father?

144
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,521
I took some "precautions" with
that headpiece this time around.

145
00:10:45,572 --> 00:10:46,594
Precautions?

146
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:49,015
That mask's not coming offa your head.

147
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:52,222
Because...

148
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,447
...it's glued on!

149
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,228
Ah, hot!

150
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:13,250
Dang it! I just bought that meat bun!

151
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:15,533
And I didn't even get to take a bite out of it yet.

152
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:16,859
Just look on the bright side!

153
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:20,903
If that meat bun was actually filled with poison,
you might've gotten sick or died or something.

154
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,350
So, you dodged a bullet!

155
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:23,870
Whatever.

156
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:26,448
I wanted to eat that snack
and now I can't, and that sucks.

157
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:27,604
Don't sweat the negatives!

158
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:29,235
If you try to think positively,

159
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,010
then good luck will come your way for sure!

160
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,555
Everything is gonna work out.

161
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:33,595
Trust me.

162
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,433
What's got you in such a chipper mood all of a sudden?

163
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,460
Well, you see,

164
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,450
I just realized that no matter how bad
things might seem, there's always a bright side.

165
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:48,358
For example, you can peel off the
dirty bottom, and then your bun's fine!

166
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:50,144
What happened to it being poisoned?

167
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:57,111
See? You can work your way around
it like this, and it'll be... ow!

168
00:11:57,572 --> 00:11:58,418
Whoa!

169
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:00,303
And it's safe. Woo!

170
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:01,270
Ya see that?

171
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,935
If that's not the power of positivity, then what is?

172
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:05,450
You can't make this stuff up!

173
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,661
I think my meat bun would say otherwise.

174
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,621
Aw, cheer up!

175
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:10,340
Remember to look on the bright side!

176
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,631
If you actually did eat that poisonous meat bun,

177
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:13,821
you'd be a goner.

178
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,641
That's your only hypothetical?

179
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:21,652
Even if I peel the bottom off at this point, your
popsicle contaminated the top of it with your spit.

180
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,892
Don't say that!

181
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,702
Remember! Positivity!

182
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:25,502
Oh, no!

183
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:29,017
It looks like the bun is still hot
enough to melt your popsicle a little bit.

184
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:32,068
If I just pretend that it was poisoned,

185
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:33,401
then everything's fine.

186
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:34,722
But you already ate some of it.

187
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:37,414
What's wrong?

188
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:41,891
So much for positivity bringing good luck!

189
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:46,774
No! This is a sign telling me that I would've
gotten a stomach ache if I ate another popsicle.

190
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:50,337
Wow. You sure are sticking to your
guns despite all the crappy luck.

191
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:51,511
And look closely.

192
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,065
This would've been completely done for
if it was soft ice cream or something.

193
00:12:55,096 --> 00:12:56,568
But since it's made out of solid ice,

194
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:58,146
I might still be able to clean it off.

195
00:12:58,249 --> 00:12:59,046
Good as new.

196
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:00,260
Bright side!

197
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:01,838
You're still gonna eat that?

198
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:05,775
Uh...

199
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:10,170
Wait! Wait!

200
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:13,803
Uh...

201
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:38,065
So, how bad is it?

202
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:40,999
Your butt is totally soaked.

203
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:44,609
Anyway!

204
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,151
What about the bright side?

205
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:48,708
Aw, screw it! I give up!

206
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,996
Accept the fact that you're meant to carry on my legacy.

207
00:14:07,021 --> 00:14:10,193
I'll continue to glue things
to you until that reality sticks!

208
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:15,007
Father.

209
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:16,868
Hm?

210
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:19,522
You can take...

211
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:20,868
What?

212
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,194
...your <i>daifuku</i> ...

213
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:24,869
It can't be!

214
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:35,379
...and go shove it!

215
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:41,256
Misato, what are your goals and plans for the future?

216
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:42,230
Uh...

217
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:46,756
Right now I'm still deciding if I want to
go to college or become a professional chef.

218
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,750
Really? A chef, huh?

219
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:57,095
And, uh... I might, kinda, sorta, possibly, maybe...

220
00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,437
...marry that goat guy!

221
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:01,516
Let's not get carried away, now.

222
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:07,026
Tie it around here...

223
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:09,549
And good to go!

224
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,975
I'm home!

225
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:12,042
Hey! Nano!

226
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:14,425
I was about to take Sakamoto for a walk.

227
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,240
Some friends of mine wanted to
come over to study later today.

228
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:18,135
Is that all right?

229
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,075
Fine by me!

230
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,585
As long as I get to play with you guys when I get back.

231
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:23,647
'Kay then, I'm off now!

232
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:24,894
'Kay!

233
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:28,761
Hey, get this off of me right now!

234
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:31,556
You're gonna choke me to death if you
keep on dragging me around like that!

235
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:37,876
All right, fine! I'll give you
anything you want if you let me go!

236
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:38,976
So, what do you want?

237
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:39,678
A shark.

238
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:41,360
Are you freakin' kidding me?

239
00:15:41,385 --> 00:15:44,808
♪ Walking alone and crying tears. ♪

240
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,348
I'm the one who is legit crying!

241
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:48,998
So if you'll please just untie
me, I promise I'll get you a shark!

242
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,163
Hear me? I'll do it!

243
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,099
I'm dyin' here!

244
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,016
Dogs!

245
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,493
Everyone knows dogs could bite at any moment.

246
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:04,906
Isn't that right, kitty?

247
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,083
Dogs bite whenever they feel like, huh?

248
00:16:07,108 --> 00:16:09,018
What, uh... what are you freaking out about?

249
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:11,346
It's just a couple of dogs.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

250
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:13,255
They've got leashes on, so it's fine!

251
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,135
We've gotta get outta here, kid!

252
00:16:19,193 --> 00:16:20,448
Okay! Run!

253
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,265
Sakamoto! We've been trapped!

254
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,499
Don't give up! That's just what they want you to do!

255
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:29,381
We can tell their owner to call
them off and put their leashes back on!

256
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:33,253
Crap! We're so dead!

257
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:35,274
Come on, we have to think of somethin'!

258
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:36,051
Anything at all!

259
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:37,087
Or else it'll be over!

260
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,407
Or maybe it's already over.

261
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:39,378
It is, isn't it?

262
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:41,110
We're done! We're dead! We're...

263
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:42,718
I found a gummy in my pocket.

264
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,166
That's great!

265
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:46,214
You can use that to distract them while we get away!

266
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,250
I know! Why don't you make an
invention that'll get us outta here?

267
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,036
Oh, yeah! That's a great idea!

268
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:56,693
But hang on!

269
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:57,248
What?

270
00:16:57,332 --> 00:16:59,261
I don't have my tools to make inventions!

271
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,296
Dammit!

272
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,278
I give up!

273
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:06,057
Boil me, grill me, do whatever
you want as long as it's quick!

274
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,330
Boil me?

275
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:09,331
Grill me?

276
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,144
Whatever you want...?

277
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:13,806
Food?

278
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:16,883
But I don't wanna be food, 'cause then I'll be eaten.

279
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:20,068
I don't wanna be eaten, 'cause then I can't eat anymore!

280
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:24,360
Huh? Hakase?

281
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:26,240
What are you up to?

282
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:27,127
Are ya lost?

283
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:27,915
Yuuko!

284
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:30,743
Whoa! So you're the Hakase I've heard so much about!

285
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:32,574
Hey, you brought Sakamoto!

286
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,073
I'mma give him some pets, 'kay?

287
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:35,402
Hang on, Yuuko!

288
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:36,615
Help us with the dogs!

289
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,916
Aw, he's even fluffier than I imagined!

290
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:40,359
I wanna pet him after you're done!

291
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:41,651
I'm not messing around!

292
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,421
We have to stop these bloodthirsty dogs!

293
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:46,134
Wait a sec, one of the dogs
bit you and you wanna get it back?

294
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,281
No! But it looks like it's gonna bite me! I can tell!

295
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:51,505
I guess that explains why you're a cat person.

296
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:52,511
Am I right?

297
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:53,449
No, you're not!

298
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,220
Dogs are bite-y! I know they are!

299
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:56,566
Aw, but just look at 'em.

300
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:57,885
There's no way they would hurt anyone.

301
00:17:57,927 --> 00:17:58,677
They will, too!

302
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,699
No they won't.

303
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:01,572
They will!

304
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:02,556
If they chew,

305
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:03,367
I gave gum!

306
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:05,766
That's not funny!

307
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:07,543
C'mon, I'll show you.

308
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:10,117
All right, shake...

309
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,118
Looked like that hurt.

310
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:31,331
Are you okay?

311
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:35,785
They won't bite as long as you
keep your distance from them,

312
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,997
so don't worry about it.

313
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,665
I told her, but Yuuko still...

314
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:40,511
It's fine.

315
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,481
That kind of stuff always happens to her.

316
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:43,755
If you say so.

317
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:44,974
Come on, then.

318
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,255
Let's grab Yuuko and head back to your place to see Nano.

319
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:50,591
Wait, you know Nano?

320
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:51,430
Of course I...

321
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,751
Where the heck did you go?

322
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:27,098
Don't you know you need to keep those beasts on a leash?

323
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,908
Did you play with them?

324
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:33,009
Don't be ridiculous!

325
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,451
They were gonna kill me to death!

326
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,192
Here you go.

327
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,032
Shark Choco!

328
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:48,054
Thank you very much, nice lady.

329
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,985
Well I got some chocolate and we saw some puppies.

330
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,379
I'd say that was a nice walk.

331
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:54,298
Yeah right!

332
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:56,800
I saw you practically pee your lab coat back there.

333
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:59,102
Now that that's over, can you take this rope off?

334
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,846
I have my snack now, so sure!

335
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:04,988
Huh?

336
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:06,234
What's wrong?

337
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:08,693
The rope is stuck. Help me.

338
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:10,198
What makes you think I can help?

339
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:12,766
Maybe they can help us get it off.

340
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:17,562
Hey, Yuuko. Get up. Hey!

341
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:19,162
You gotta help me.

342
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,239
Yuuko, I gotta problem.

343
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,206
Hey. Isn't that, uh...

344
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:26,022
Uh... huh?

345
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:47,900
I'm home!

346
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,250
There're too many dogs out there.

347
00:20:50,277 --> 00:20:52,068
Huh? You're all sweaty!

348
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,097
Oh, I forgot!

349
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:54,150
I have chocolate!

350
00:20:54,443 --> 00:20:55,065
Huh?

351
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:58,419
♪ Choco, choco, chocolate! ♪

352
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:00,863
♪ Choco, choco, chocolate! ♪

353
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,888
I'm getting worried about Yuuko and Mio.

354
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:05,115
They don't usually take this long to get here.

355
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,186
I think they went this way.

356
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:20,995
What the heck happened here?

357
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,880
Buddy! Li'l-Buddy!

358
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:25,587
What did you guys do?

359
00:21:28,352 --> 00:21:29,619
Grandpa!

360
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:34,231
As people, we must always be
there to help each other, Takashi.

361
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,611
Uh...

362
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:39,949
Also, that same compassion lives in
the hearts of animals, too, Takashi.

363
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:41,347
Uh...

364
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:46,707
The bond between humans and animals is
one that can never be forgotten, Takashi.

365
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:50,468
Uh...

366
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:51,655
Hey, Grandpa?

367
00:21:53,318 --> 00:21:54,423
I'm Kiyoshi.

368
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,731
I'm Melon Bread.

369
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,198
Simple humans bicker for all eternity over
whether or not I should taste like actual melon.

370
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:35,484
Truly a question for the ages.

371
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,989
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 23.

372
00:23:39,014 --> 00:23:40,186
Look forward to it!
