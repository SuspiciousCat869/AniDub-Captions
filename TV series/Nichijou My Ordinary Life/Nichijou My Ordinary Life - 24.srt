1
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:06,880
Nano Shinonome.

2
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:10,272
I've used every single trapping trick I have up my sleeve.

3
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:13,777
Since you still remain out of my reach,
your system has to be far more advanced

4
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:15,184
than I initially thought,

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,945
and I must know what makes you tick!

6
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:18,225
For science!

7
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:23,703
Unfortunately, my various attempts at capturing
you have garnered some unwanted attention at school.

8
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:25,227
I must tread carefully.

9
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:25,687
Hm?

10
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,094
Could that be...?

11
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:36,166
Wait!

12
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:36,966
Come back!

13
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:38,659
Don't you walk away from me!

14
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:48,614
Me-Meow!

15
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:51,175
Thanks for the food!

16
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:52,624
Wait for your father to get here first!

17
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:53,810
Aww!

18
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:01,527
Hey, Sis, have you seen the remote?

19
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:03,780
I think I saw it next to the kettle.

20
00:01:07,803 --> 00:01:08,537
Meow?

21
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:09,125
Hm?

22
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,528
That's the wrong cat.

23
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:14,916
Who's out here snooping around at this hour?

24
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:16,143
The heck are you doing?

25
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:17,325
Is that a thief?

26
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:19,260
Not good!

27
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,779
Hey, lady! What's the matter with you?

28
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:04,022
Hm?

29
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:06,916
Huh. It's Nano.

30
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:11,690
Thank you very much for the help.

31
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,494
Those books look heavy.

32
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:14,620
Not at all.

33
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:16,679
But I appreciate the assistance.

34
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,914
Mm. It was the least I could do.

35
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:24,033
Mio! Hey! Guess what I just saw!

36
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:26,520
Can you tell me later? I'm busy.

37
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:27,947
It can't wait until later!

38
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:29,951
I have to tell you about it right now!

39
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:31,064
'Kay, go.

40
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,578
I just caught Nano and Koujirou
walking together out in the hallway!

41
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:36,633
And?

42
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:39,510
Huh?

43
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,698
That's weird.

44
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:44,729
I thought she would totally freak out over this.

45
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:47,803
So?

46
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:48,590
Uhh.

47
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:52,766
Hmm.

48
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:56,131
So!

49
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:59,437
They, uh, were being all polite to each other!

50
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,462
Hmm.

51
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:04,256
Doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary to me.

52
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:04,676
Huh?

53
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,620
People talk to other people.

54
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:08,046
That stuff happens all the time.

55
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,532
So, yeah. Is that it?

56
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:11,583
Um, guess so.

57
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:12,570
That's all I got.

58
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,762
All right, well, I've gotta finish
this report before the next class.

59
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:16,808
So, you know.

60
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,025
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop distracting me.

61
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:20,820
'Kay, sure. Sorry.

62
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,404
Well, dang. That was a buzzkill.

63
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:24,203
So?

64
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,858
Huh?

65
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:28,329
And then?

66
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,208
What happened? After?

67
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:32,917
After what?

68
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,193
After you saw those two being
all buddy-buddy with each other.

69
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:37,553
Well?

70
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:40,088
You were so chatty just a second ago.

71
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:41,818
Well, um, he, uh...

72
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:45,400
Koujirou told Nano that he thought her
big stack of books looked really heavy.

73
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:46,820
And then?

74
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:49,616
And... then that's it.

75
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,696
Oh, my gosh, Yuuko!

76
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,873
You are so silly, you know that?

77
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:03,757
I always knew you were a total goofball, but all
of your crazy talk really cracked me up this time!

78
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,287
I can't believe you made such a big deal out of this!

79
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:11,636
You can be such a little dummy-dumb!
It's kinda crazy how clueless you can be!

80
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,930
It's fine 'cause you're dumb!

81
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:13,791
Ya idiot!

82
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:18,418
I guess I forgot to mention that after they talked,

83
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,318
Koujirou and Nano started making out.

84
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:29,633
What? No way.

85
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:31,425
You're kidding. How could that even happen?

86
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,912
Well, it started off with a little
bit of smooching here and there,

87
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:35,970
then they went to the cafeteria for a snack,

88
00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:36,900
if you know what I mean.

89
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,670
Turns out it was an actual snack,

90
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:41,094
'cause they bought some bread,
but one thing led to another...

91
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:42,720
...snd suddenly, Koujirou...

92
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:43,980
Koujirou what?

93
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:45,937
He took his clothes off outta nowhere!

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,112
He took off his clothes?

95
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:51,387
And then he mentioned that wanted to
get his hands on something "delicious,"

96
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,845
so Koujirou decided to make his move.

97
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,595
What move?

98
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,627
In the courtyard.

99
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:56,640
The courtyard?

100
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:01,865
I totally forgot that I gotta do
that report thing before class, too!

101
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,159
Aw, crap!

102
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:06,162
We have to come up with our own
subject for this stupid assignment?

103
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:07,275
But what happened?

104
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:08,830
In the courtyard...

105
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:10,645
What did they do?

106
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:17,277
Ah? You decided to get the <i>yakisoba</i> bread again, I see.

107
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:19,740
So what? It's my favorite!

108
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:23,030
You sure do love that bread, don't you?

109
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,574
Looks like you're the Yakisoba Princess.

110
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:26,770
Well, uh...

111
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,742
What kind of bread did you buy then?

112
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:29,849
Me?

113
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:31,704
I bought a sweet roll.

114
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:34,165
Then... does that make him...?

115
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:35,325
Hm? What's wrong?

116
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,706
It's none of your business, so there! Hmph!

117
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:40,645
Does that mean... I should call him...

118
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:42,412
...the Sweet Roll Prince?

119
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,445
How delicious!

120
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,110
Then... does that make him...?

121
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,263
Hm? What's wrong?

122
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,840
It's none of your business, so there! Hmph.

123
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,248
So then... does that mean...

124
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:03,974
...I should call him... the Silky-Skinned Beauty?

125
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,640
Let's eat in the courtyard!

126
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:06,990
What a splendid idea.

127
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:10,245
And then I heard the teacher ate a
whale that was caught in the wild!

128
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,075
Ha! That's preposterous!

129
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,917
I'm telling the truth!

130
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:16,553
But, if that's the case, it means they went outside of

131
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:19,320
the established 200 nautical mile exclusive fishing zone.

132
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,942
Oh, that's no problem at all, because
the teacher is actually an Inuit!

133
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:25,708
Nano.

134
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,279
Hmm?

135
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,014
There's a crumb on your cheek.

136
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:30,455
Let me get that for you.

137
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:38,890
It was like a gentle moment

138
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:41,282
floating on the soft spring breeze.

139
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,422
Our moment.

140
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:43,863
in the courtyard.

141
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,364
Our rendezvous.

142
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,652
Rendezvous!

143
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,760
How am I supposed to focus like this?

144
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,857
I can't stop thinking about those two!

145
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:54,090
I have to know!

146
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:54,832
Yuuko!

147
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,951
I was just about to think of a topic!

148
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:00,328
Tell me what happened between those two in the courtyard!

149
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:02,603
Will you stop yelling at me?

150
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:03,788
Let's see.

151
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:04,880
They were, uh...

152
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:07,062
You're useless!

153
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:10,347
Fine then! I'll have to find out myself!

154
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,788
I'll go to the Courtyard of Eden!

155
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:16,570
Thank you again for your help.

156
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:18,987
It was my pleasure.

157
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:20,535
Farewell.

158
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:29,135
Huh? Mio, are you okay?

159
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,321
Why are you on the floor?

160
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:31,088
Nano.

161
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:31,788
Yes?

162
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:35,967
I heard that you were eating <i>yakisoba</i>
bread with Koujirou out in the courtyard.

163
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:37,547
And who is Koujirou?

164
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:41,739
Uh... oh, you mean that guy?

165
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,202
All he did was help me pick up
one of the books I dropped earlier.

166
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:47,265
And that's it?

167
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,131
Yup. That's all that happened.

168
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,028
But... what happened to the <i>yakisoba</i> bread?

169
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,868
Huh? What are you talking about?

170
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:07,300
Helvetica Standard.

171
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:08,715
Hey!

172
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:10,262
Come on, you can trust me!

173
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:11,592
Just tell me who you like, Yumi!

174
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:12,338
Aww.

175
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:14,062
I dunno if I should.

176
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:15,307
I won't tell anybody,

177
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:17,578
but if I do, I'll give ya a million yen! 'Kay?

178
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:18,485
All right.

179
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,512
But you better not tell anyone, you promise?

180
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:21,335
Yeah, totes!

181
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:24,512
It's Takashi.

182
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:26,095
Hey, everyone, listen up!

183
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,342
Yumi just told me that she likes Takashi!

184
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,410
Fascinating.

185
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:57,431
Ha!

186
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:58,095
Head!

187
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:07,868
Thank you for all your help today.

188
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:09,655
Take this.

189
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:09,938
Huh?

190
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,989
That stupid prodigy!

191
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:25,308
It's so rare for you stop by the dojo nowadays.

192
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:26,970
With the competition coming up,

193
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:29,828
it's good to get some extra lessons
with our instructor outside of school,

194
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:30,881
so I can be ready.

195
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:34,365
And having Yoshino there also
helps out with my training a lot, too.

196
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,958
You're lucky, because she usually never shows up.

197
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:38,630
What? She doesn't?

198
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:41,774
She told me she actually starts
to get worse the harder she trains.

199
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,495
Like some kendo freak of nature.

200
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:48,210
So, if you don't learn from her, who
do you normally get your lessons from?

201
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,383
The instructor.

202
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:53,703
And Sasahara has also been
coming to the dojo a lot lately.

203
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:54,357
Hmm.

204
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,372
Sasahara?!

205
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:00,110
Since when does he go to the dojo?

206
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:01,284
Since always?

207
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:04,902
He was going there throughout all of
middle school, so it's really nothing new.

208
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,533
Yeah, but, well, I... I guess that's true.

209
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,769
I don't get why you're making such a big deal.

210
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:11,346
Aren't you in the same kendo club?

211
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:12,336
The one at school!

212
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:13,576
No, we are not!

213
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,188
He's been in the drama club ever since his first year.

214
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:17,215
Hmm?

215
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:19,439
Wha?!

216
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:21,791
He's part of the drama club?

217
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:23,775
Why isn't he in the kendo club?

218
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:26,081
How the heck am I supposed to know?

219
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:29,037
If you take a weird guy like him
out of something cool like kendo,

220
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:31,102
all you're left with is a weird dude!

221
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,262
You don't know Sasahara like I do,

222
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,912
'cause you've only ever seen him at the dojo.

223
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:36,058
What do you mean?

224
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:39,892
I mean that his performances in
the drama club are a bit out there,

225
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,762
but they're honestly pretty unique and interesting.

226
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:43,078
Don't be silly. This is grape juice.

227
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,609
I guess I can imagine that.

228
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:45,837
So, you get it?

229
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:49,512
What I don't get is why you haven't
just invited him to the kendo club yet.

230
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,766
It's such a waste!

231
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:51,609
What?

232
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:54,206
Why do I have to be the one to invite him to the club?

233
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:56,943
I don't think about him. He can do whatever he wants.

234
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,320
But I bet you guys could totally make
it to nationals together with his help!

235
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,435
Don't hold your breath.

236
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,656
He ran off and joined that stupid
little drama club of his own accord.

237
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,266
Who cares? I don't! That idiot!

238
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:09,781
But if you insist...

239
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,602
There's no need to twist my arm.

240
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:14,919
Maybe I can invite him for your sake.

241
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:17,158
Oh, wow.

242
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,325
I can read her like a book.

243
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:20,988
So?

244
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:21,566
Huh?

245
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:23,488
When does Sasahara come to the dojo?

246
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:25,008
Uh...

247
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:30,320
Well, he stops by every three days or so, so I get
the feeling that he'll probably be there tomorrow.

248
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:32,355
Mm...

249
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:34,949
'Kay, whatever. It's not like I care.

250
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:36,557
Hey, Sis.

251
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:37,986
What?

252
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:40,434
You should just confess your feelings to him already!

253
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,647
I don't wanna hear it from someone younger than me!

254
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,606
I'm going home!

255
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:53,397
Sis. You're so transparent.

256
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,510
It's freezing!

257
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,251
Icy hand attack!

258
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:16,187
See ya!

259
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:36,001
Fascinating.

260
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,522
Yuck.

261
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:43,135
Mm!

262
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,445
Ahh, so yummy!

263
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:50,631
Thank you for all of the food!

264
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:54,467
Hakase!

265
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:57,049
You need finish those green
onions you flicked to the side!

266
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:00,497
I think it's still a bit too early
for me to eat green onions right now.

267
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:02,377
What is that supposed to mean?

268
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:03,301
Regardless,

269
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:05,776
you should finish every bit of food that's on your plate.

270
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:09,452
But the green stuff is always bitter,
and gross, and weird, and whatever.

271
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,296
If you don't finish your food,
then you don't get snacks tomorrow.

272
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:15,731
Just look at Sakamoto and follow his example.

273
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:17,414
He eats his food no matter what...

274
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:22,617
Sorry. I'm just not feeling it.

275
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,377
Oh, no! What happened?

276
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:26,747
Aw, come here, kitty! Are you doing all right?

277
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,713
I'm fine. It's just a little cold.

278
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,746
I'll sleep it off...

279
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:33,841
You'll have a hard time recovering if you don't eat.

280
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:35,203
Can you at least give it a try?

281
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:36,336
I think I'll pass.

282
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:38,566
Would it help if I got you some milk?

283
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,706
Don't think so.

284
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:41,070
Then I'm at a loss.

285
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:43,545
Do you feel like eating anything at all?

286
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:44,698
Not really.

287
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,855
I don't even wanna think about it.

288
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:47,988
Oh, no.

289
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,430
Here, Sakamoto, you can have my green onions.

290
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:52,782
Ya tryin' to kill me?!

291
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:01,939
Ooh.

292
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:09,239
Are you sure there's nothing I can get for you?

293
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:09,932
Yeah.

294
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:13,930
Then I'll just leave this milk right
here in case you change your mind.

295
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:17,818
If you need anything at all, let me know, okay?

296
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:19,265
Sure.

297
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:26,928
I think I'm coming down with a
cough, so can you get me some chocolate?

298
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:27,794
Please and thank you.

299
00:15:27,853 --> 00:15:29,512
Only if you eat your green onions.

300
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:32,867
Why does Sakamoto get offered stuff for free but I don't?

301
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:35,262
Because Sakamoto's sick and needs the help.

302
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:37,620
Well, I'm coughing over here, so I can be sick, too!

303
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,662
Sick people usually aren't this energetic.

304
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:41,952
I just really want chocolate and it's pumping me up!

305
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:43,887
I can be sick and excited at the same time!

306
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:44,970
If you're actually sick,

307
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:46,495
then you have to take some medicine.

308
00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:48,241
So, do you wanna take medicine?

309
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,362
Forget it!

310
00:15:51,388 --> 00:15:52,852
Wait, Hakase!

311
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:55,247
Did you put yourself in timeout?

312
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:56,341
Leave me alone!

313
00:15:56,938 --> 00:16:00,553
You hate me, so that's why you're being
mean and making me eat those yucky green onions!

314
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:04,162
And you like Sakamoto more because
you're not making him eat any onions at all!

315
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:05,983
Wait, I don't think you understand.

316
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:08,620
Cats can't eat onions. It's toxic for them.

317
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,667
Well, how was I supposed to know that?!

318
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:13,291
You're so silly.

319
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:19,300
If I'm being honest, I actually like you the most.

320
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:22,075
Is that true?

321
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:23,588
You betcha!

322
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,854
So can I have chocolate now since you like me most?

323
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,517
Lemme think.

324
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,327
I'll let you have it if you eat your onions.

325
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,987
What? No fair!

326
00:16:33,012 --> 00:16:35,637
You're being the worst most-liker of me ever right now!

327
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,900
Then maybe I'll just go like Sakamoto the most.

328
00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:40,875
Can you make up your mind already?

329
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,776
Okay, I choose both of you!

330
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:46,766
That doesn't count, Sakamoto!

331
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,917
Which floor would you like?

332
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:28,771
The seventh floor, please, if you wouldn't mind.

333
00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:35,693
The thing is,

334
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:38,428
I don't remember feeling embarrassed this year.

335
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:43,051
Now then.

336
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,833
Let's talk about your hopes and dreams for the future.

337
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:49,600
Hmm.

338
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:58,548
A manga artist.

339
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,772
Um, that's right.

340
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:04,906
Your drawings have always been
excellent, so this is great!

341
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,706
Huh? Well...

342
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:08,186
I believe in your skills.

343
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,961
So, feel free to chase your dreams.

344
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:12,091
I wish you the best of luck!

345
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:14,233
Hmm?

346
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,147
Let's see, Yuuko wanted the melon juice,

347
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:29,427
but what do I wanna drink?

348
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:32,303
Well, money is pretty tight this month,

349
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,095
so I probably shouldn't get anything fancy.

350
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,211
Just stick with the usual banana juice.

351
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:40,844
Oh! Wait! Don't roll away!

352
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:45,546
Sorry about that...

353
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:52,080
Wait. No. Yes? Yes! No!

354
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:53,018
It's him!

355
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,623
Koujirou's right in front of me!

356
00:18:57,883 --> 00:18:59,374
I hope I didn't startle you.

357
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,564
You're practically a deer in headlights right now.

358
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:04,970
No! You're fine and I'm fine and sorry!

359
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:05,347
Mm.

360
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:06,654
Come on!

361
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,113
Talk about something.

362
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,510
Anything at all!

363
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,025
So, uh...

364
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:13,582
The weather sure is nice today, isn't it?

365
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:16,341
Wait! No it isn't, you idiot!

366
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,650
See? The sky's all gray and gloomy!

367
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:27,269
That was rich.

368
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:28,275
Yeah.

369
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:31,350
By the way, miss, might this coin belong to you?

370
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:32,330
Uh, yes!

371
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:34,598
Is that right?

372
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,770
Well, this is certainly a surprise.

373
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:39,392
Huh? 'Kay, sure.

374
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:42,336
Perhaps I was fated to come across you and this coin.

375
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:42,769
Huh?

376
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:44,982
This just so happens to be the only day

377
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,298
I've forgotten to bring my wallet with me to school.

378
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:49,615
And right as my throat was becoming parched,

379
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,164
I was conveniently walking near a vending machine.

380
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,665
And lo, I picked up this coin.

381
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,520
The heavens... are shining down on me.

382
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:03,290
In a way,

383
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:05,925
the drink I'm to receive is like ambrosia,

384
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,324
passed down to me directly from on high.

385
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:19,013
Um...

386
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,552
This vending machine...

387
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,872
Huh! Looks like it can be quite the prankster!

388
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,272
Oh! Yeah!

389
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:41,654
To think.

390
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:44,973
A simple dispenser of drinks managed to get the best me.

391
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:48,704
Must be a bold contraption to be
able to pull off such an admirable feat.

392
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:49,954
I like it!

393
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:52,964
You deserve my coin, you dastardly device!

394
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,182
Uh, Koujirou?

395
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:09,717
Shh.

396
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:43,260
I don't really know why, but...

397
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:46,997
...I feel like I've gotten a little closer to him.

398
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:51,176
Mio! Where's my juice?

399
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:09,758
I wonder if she was trying to tell me something.

400
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:14,342
Yoshino is so strong and skilled,
she's practically unstoppable.

401
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:16,946
The Knight.

402
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:18,819
What does it mean?

403
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:20,341
What do I do with it?

404
00:22:20,532 --> 00:22:22,095
Confess your feelings already!

405
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:26,032
Hey, Sis, the bath is free now.

406
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:26,425
Uh...

407
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:40,537
I wonder.

408
00:22:41,008 --> 00:22:43,529
Is Koujirou looking at the moon right now, too?

409
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:45,682
Sasahara!

410
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,495
You're not half bad, y'know!

411
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:49,796
You should come back and train with me sometime!

412
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:50,770
Mm.

413
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:52,338
Cool!

414
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,872
I might even teach you my secret move next time!

415
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:02,660
Sis!

416
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:05,802
Look, what's that over there?

417
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,182
Hm?

418
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:08,565
Sisters!

419
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,380
Don't barge into my room and scare me like that!

420
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,930
I wasn't interrupting a special moment, was I?

421
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,867
No, of course not!

422
00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:21,034
Don't worry about it!

423
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,709
Are you blushing?

424
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:23,953
No! I'm not!

425
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,463
Just leave me alone!

426
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,124
I'm a vending machine, and here's my MO.

427
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,149
When you're low on cash and need a snack,

428
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:03,360
we'll eat your change and won't give it back!

429
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:04,885
Respect my law!

430
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,535
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 25.

431
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,762
Look forward to it!
