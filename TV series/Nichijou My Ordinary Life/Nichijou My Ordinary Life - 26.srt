1
00:00:02,081 --> 00:00:03,206
Hey, so, idea.

2
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:03,886
Yeah?

3
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:06,654
We should throw Nano a surprise birthday party!

4
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:08,469
Oh, sure! When do you wanna do it?

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,583
Today.

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,596
Today?

7
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,848
You could give us more of a
heads up before planning this stuff.

8
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:14,754
My b!

9
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,288
'Kay.

10
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:18,383
I got nothin'.

11
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:20,648
What can we put together in a day?

12
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:23,142
Well, I honestly don't even know
if today is her actual birthday,

13
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,847
so I wouldn't sweat the details too much.

14
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:25,938
Then what's the point?

15
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:26,845
Because.

16
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:27,820
Because what?

17
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:29,137
That's what makes it a surprise!

18
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,206
I guess so?

19
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:31,412
Hakase, too.

20
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:31,906
Huh?

21
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,890
We should also celebrate Hakase's birthday today.

22
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:36,746
Ooh! Yeah, sure!

23
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,693
Knocking out two birthdays at once? I like it!

24
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:43,951
Now that I think about it, I guess
surprise parties can still be fun for everyone,

25
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:46,686
even if it's not anybody's birthday.

26
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:48,139
Okay, I got it!

27
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:51,273
We should all go pick up a cake
for the party after school today!

28
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:52,253
Let's do it!

29
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,281
Does that sound good to you, Mai?

30
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:55,927
I left my purse at home.

31
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:58,962
Oh. That's all right.

32
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,206
Yuuko and I can split it then.

33
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:03,030
I actually forgot my wallet, too.

34
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:06,345
Please, Mio! We're beggin' ya!

35
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,130
Uh...

36
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:12,873
I suppose I never paid you back for all
that money I lost at the amusement park.

37
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:14,945
So, don't worry about the birthday cake.

38
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,887
It's on me.

39
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:20,554
I'm gonna go tell Nano about the
awesome party we're throwing for her!

40
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:22,472
It's supposed to be a surprise!

41
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:25,330
Close one.

42
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:27,029
I forget how dumb you can be.

43
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:27,557
Uh... Yeah?

44
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:33,487
Well, at least Koujirou didn't shoot me down.

45
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:34,187
Wow!

46
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,345
Hey! I wasn't shot down!

47
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,470
Oh, yeah? Then why'd you run away crying?

48
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:39,878
I, uh...

49
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,378
I was just surprised by the sudden turn of events
and needed a hot second to process it all, 'kay?

50
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:47,191
Koujirou having a girl on his arm doesn't mean anything!

51
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,766
And I haven't even tried to tell him how I feel yet.

52
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:53,038
Unless he turns me down to my
face, I won't give up on him!

53
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,353
He's the guy that I love! Got it?

54
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,501
So, deal with it! Okay?!

55
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,248
All right!

56
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,463
Do I have everything? Yup!

57
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:20,332
Hakase! I'm heading off to school now!

58
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,754
Nano!

59
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:25,620
Yoink!

60
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,444
Huh?

61
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:35,887
What'd you do that for, Hakase?

62
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:39,085
Because! I made you a little
guy so I'm taking the big one off!

63
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:46,167
Hang on. What exactly do you mean by "little guy"?

64
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,242
Here, I can show you.

65
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:49,635
It's, uh.

66
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:53,529
Are you saying that my back could
be smooth with this "little guy"?

67
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:55,885
Uh... yeah, I guess.

68
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:02,745
But this little guy can do more than
just that! It can, uh... Wait, uh...

69
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:05,591
Nano?

70
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:06,012
Yes?

71
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:07,314
I kinda lost it.

72
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:09,985
Oh, no!

73
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:11,059
What's the matter?

74
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:14,080
Why are you being so rowdy this early in the morning?

75
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:18,182
You little brat!

76
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:20,320
Stop leaving these weird traps all over the place!

77
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:23,512
Sakamoto broke the little guy I was gonna give you!

78
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:24,336
Wha?

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,029
Wait! Hang on, I, uh...

80
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:31,792
No. It was an accident!

81
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,440
Look! Mean old Sakamoto made Nano cry!

82
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:35,966
What are you talking about?

83
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:38,519
You're the one who left it on
the ground! It's not my fault!

84
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm gonna go to school now.

85
00:03:45,838 --> 00:03:47,854
Nano! You forgot this!

86
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:53,790
I, uh...

87
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:57,347
I can make another one if you want me to.

88
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,134
Would you be able to finish it before I get home?

89
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:03,558
It's not hard for me to make, so yeah.

90
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:08,235
Okay!

91
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:09,961
I'll be back real soon!

92
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:12,282
Great!

93
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:14,280
All right, I'm off!

94
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,988
See ya later!

95
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:19,253
Yeah. See ya.

96
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:28,154
Oh, my, how bizarre.

97
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:28,682
Huh?

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,830
Vice-Principal!

99
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:37,128
If it isn't the statue of me that stood in this very place
when I held the position of principal at this school.

100
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,196
Yes. Strange indeed.

101
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:43,160
I wonder what happened to your
statue, Principal Shinonome.

102
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:48,109
These young students do the darndest things.

103
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:51,029
I simply can't understand the
humor behind pranks like these.

104
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:52,624
It just doesn't make any sense!

105
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,183
Unless there is a reason.

106
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:58,557
Perhaps I have some secret supporters in the student body.

107
00:05:01,262 --> 00:05:02,345
Vice-Principal!

108
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:03,969
We finished your delivery!

109
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:07,725
This is where you wanted us to put the statue, right, sir?

110
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:11,400
Uh, well, um, you must be mistaken.

111
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,765
Hey wait. Was this... your doing?

112
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,112
Uh... that's ridiculous.

113
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:26,208
This must be another part of
the prank the students are pulling.

114
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:28,507
It's quite elaborate, don't you think?

115
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:30,978
Excuse me, young man,

116
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,362
but could you take this statue away as well?

117
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,516
Huh? You really want us to take this dinky statue back?

118
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:37,406
Dinky?!

119
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,706
Understood, sir!

120
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:41,362
We'll be hauling this ugly thing
out of your sight immediately!

121
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:42,712
Ugly?!

122
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:45,455
Hey! We gotta load up this pathetic-looking one, too!

123
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:49,460
It's okay, Vice-Principal.

124
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,337
Don't take it personally.

125
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:54,929
We can put it right next to the crappy
one we already have on the back of the truck!

126
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:56,635
What?!

127
00:06:08,497 --> 00:06:09,366
Huh? It's unlocked.

128
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:12,323
Hmm?

129
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:16,825
Oh, wow, I didn't expect you to be so early.

130
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:19,287
I thought I'd be the first one here.

131
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,854
I took the blackbird and everything.

132
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:24,270
So, did you come in to take part in the morning practice?

133
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:26,763
Well, I...

134
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,226
I, uh... just, uh...

135
00:06:31,882 --> 00:06:32,883
I did!

136
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:34,698
What? Really?

137
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,052
Yes.

138
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,390
I should've known that I would end
up buying both of your lunches, too.

139
00:06:57,755 --> 00:06:58,616
Sorry!

140
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,800
Nah, since you both forgot your
wallets, I really don't mind it.

141
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:04,054
Wow! That's so generous of ya!

142
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:05,792
You're the bestest!

143
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,410
Whoa. I hit too hard.

144
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,420
Yeah. You should really be more careful, you know.

145
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:13,947
That's my bad!

146
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:16,314
That's my head.

147
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,365
Sorry, I didn't see you there, Mai!

148
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:20,282
Me neither.

149
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:28,887
Oh! By the way, did you end up asking Nano
if we could come over to her place later today?

150
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:30,845
Crap! I totally forgot to!

151
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:34,860
So, I'll run and tell Nano about
her surprise party right away!

152
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:37,154
No! It's supposed to be a surprise!

153
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:39,490
Just ask if we can hang out at her house later!

154
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:41,112
I knew that, silly!

155
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:42,725
I don't think that you do!

156
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:44,260
Fine! I'll ask her myself!

157
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,560
Come on! I said I'd do it!

158
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:47,952
Yeah, and that's the problem!

159
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,222
Aww, you can trust me!

160
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:50,302
I really can't!

161
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:52,737
I can ask her.

162
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:55,525
Uh... wait! Hang on, Mai!

163
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:57,760
Don't worry about it! Just gimme a chance!

164
00:08:02,396 --> 00:08:04,938
'Kay, I'm gonna go find Nano and ask about the thing!

165
00:08:05,074 --> 00:08:06,583
I totally got this, guys!

166
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:15,621
I'm sorry!

167
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:17,467
No worries.

168
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,251
Godspeed!

169
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,726
Uh, yeah, sure, thanks.

170
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:24,381
And I'm really sorry! And, uh, bye!

171
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,776
Aw, man!

172
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,362
But I didn't want coffee.

173
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,297
Oh! That was my bad!

174
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:38,410
No big deal.

175
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,445
I get you're probably in a hurry right now.

176
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:42,622
I am! But I'm still sorry!

177
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:44,197
Come on!

178
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,417
Uh?

179
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:04,612
Um! Excuse me!

180
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:06,337
No running in the hallway!

181
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:17,022
Rainbow.

182
00:09:23,845 --> 00:09:25,954
I just can't believe that it's actually over!

183
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,214
Found it!

184
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:35,355
Huh? Huh...

185
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:48,998
Aw man, that one stung.

186
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:50,200
Yuuko!

187
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:50,595
Huh?

188
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:52,154
You're not hurt, are you?

189
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,701
Oh! You're just the person I was looking for!

190
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,612
You were trying to find me?

191
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,455
Yeah! I actually wanted to...

192
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:00,908
Wait! That's not...!

193
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:02,179
I, uh...

194
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:03,933
Whoa! Are you okay?

195
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,269
I didn't hurt you, did I?

196
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,184
Oh. Don't worry. I'm all right.

197
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,577
Really? Well, that's good.

198
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:15,002
And, uh, this isn't what you think it is, I swear!

199
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:16,945
It's a trick I can do!

200
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,565
Anyway! I wanted to ask you if me and the
others could come over to your place later today.

201
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,318
Huh? Sure you can.

202
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,506
Oh! Also, it's...!

203
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,737
Heh, heh, heh. I can't tell you anything else,

204
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:28,067
'cause it's a surprise!

205
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,269
Um, okay.

206
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,910
We'll see you later then!

207
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:33,327
Yeah. Sure.

208
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:41,802
It looks like I'll have to buy more
if Yuuko and the others are stopping by.

209
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,836
Can you believe we made it to the end?

210
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,587
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

211
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,778
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and one, two, three! ♪

212
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:58,938
What the heck?

213
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:43,762
This dumb pumpkin is too strong!

214
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,263
I'm so sick of that kid.

215
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,612
Why does she always pull that...

216
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:51,667
Taisho?

217
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:53,335
Is that you, Taisho?

218
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:54,977
It is!

219
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,412
Wait! Nakamura?

220
00:12:56,873 --> 00:12:58,529
I've been looking all over for you!

221
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,184
I'm glad you're okay.

222
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,782
Why are you running?

223
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,487
Don't you remember who I am?

224
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:04,720
Of course I remember!

225
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,344
That's why I'm running!

226
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:08,683
Taisho, time for dinner.

227
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:09,544
Here.

228
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:16,112
Hm? What's the matter, boy?

229
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:18,914
Are you not hungry? Huh? Huh.

230
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,179
What's wrong, Taisho?

231
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:26,516
Time for your bath.

232
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:29,812
And now.

233
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:32,380
Bad kitty!

234
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,042
Oh, no. I have to hurry or I'll be late.

235
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:37,792
Okay, Taisho. I'll see you when I get home.

236
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:38,972
Bye.

237
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:40,523
Wow! Close one.

238
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:42,856
Gotta run.

239
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:49,820
Taisho!

240
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,507
Where'd you run off to, kitty?

241
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,777
Taisho!

242
00:13:54,595 --> 00:13:56,367
Just get out of here already!

243
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:57,747
Oh! Ms. Nakamura!

244
00:13:58,595 --> 00:13:59,762
Nice to see you!

245
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,137
Uh, Nano?

246
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,639
Perfect! I'm sure she can do something!

247
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:04,282
Is something the matter?

248
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,235
You looked like you were searching... It's like
she's a robot moth drawn to my flames of science!

249
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:13,345
But... I can locate Miss
Shinonome any time I want at school.

250
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:15,928
Right now, my cat takes priority.

251
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:17,855
Sorry to bother you,

252
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,862
but have you seen a black cat around here?

253
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:22,320
Oh! You wouldn't happen to own a black cat, would you?

254
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:23,495
What a fun coincidence!

255
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:24,963
Well. Sort of.

256
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,536
He ran away a while ago.

257
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:27,538
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:29,762
I have a black cat, too, so I can sympathize.

259
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:30,673
That so?

260
00:14:31,224 --> 00:14:33,181
Would it be okay if I helped you look for him?

261
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:34,675
Of course.

262
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,570
Sorry for the inconvenience.

263
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:37,512
Not at all!

264
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:38,768
You are useless!

265
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,112
So, can you tell me more about your cat?

266
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,813
I heard you call out a name earlier.

267
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:44,762
What was it again?

268
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:45,673
It's Taisho.

269
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,103
That's an interesting name for a cat.

270
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:50,043
Huh?

271
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,862
My cat's named Sakamoto,

272
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:54,345
because that's what was written
on the box we found him in!

273
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,076
That's a weird way to name a cat.

274
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:59,326
That's true. It really is kind of weird, I guess.

275
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,320
Tell me, is he cute?

276
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:04,880
Huh?

277
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,200
Your cat Taisho?

278
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,597
Is he a cute kitty?

279
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,979
Heh. What a ridiculous question!

280
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,260
Of course he is.

281
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,543
Well, it's not like she meant
to treat me poorly on purpose.

282
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:22,384
Then again, if she kept that up, my
day's probably would've been numbered.

283
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,278
Wait, now that I think about it,

284
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,988
that's not any different from how I have it right now!

285
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,570
If I were to compare the two, they're equally bad!

286
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:34,016
Oh, it's this late already?

287
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:36,344
I'm sorry about this, Ms. Nakamura,

288
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,799
but I have to start heading home since
this won't stay fresh for very long.

289
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:42,254
Ah. Sure. That's fine.

290
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,497
When you find Taisho, would it
be okay if I came to visit him?

291
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:48,203
Of course!

292
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,949
You can visit whenever! Any day! Tomorrow even!

293
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:53,845
Well, I look forward to it.

294
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:54,887
Same here!

295
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:02,404
This... this sucks!

296
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,991
It doesn't matter who I go with, they're both the worst!

297
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:11,309
Hakase! Sakamoto! I'm home!

298
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:13,604
Nano!

299
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,819
Here's the little guy!

300
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,929
You really managed to finish it?

301
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,031
Yeah! But Sakamoto stepped on it again!

302
00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:24,010
Sakamoto...

303
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,950
Yoink!

304
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,344
Wait. Did you...?

305
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:32,082
You're still okay with taking that off?

306
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:33,756
I'll make another one, quick!

307
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:38,487
You're the best!

308
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:41,845
♪ This goes here, and that goes here... ♪

309
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:44,723
I had no idea that this key would come off so easily.

310
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,154
It wouldn't budge at all whenever
I attempted to remove it by myself.

311
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,238
That was me!

312
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:53,220
I made it so you couldn't take it off yourself,
but any other other person could do it easy-peasy!

313
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:54,445
Of course she did.

314
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:55,279
Plot twist!

315
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,945
Anybody can hook it back up, including you, Nano!

316
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,961
That's an oddly specific feature.

317
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,132
I've been meaning to ask.

318
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:04,995
How will this new little guy
affect all the features I have?

319
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:05,669
Huh?

320
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,949
Once you have this new part in, your
big toe won't be able to fly off anymore.

321
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,122
I wouldn't consider it a loss.

322
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,426
That must be Yuuko and the others.

323
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:18,325
Wha? Yuuko!

324
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,512
Yuuko's here!

325
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,176
Oh, that's right!

326
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:27,285
I should probably hide this key.

327
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:32,669
I'm so glad I look like normal person now.

328
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,886
Maybe I'll get along better with
everyone without having to worry so much.

329
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:39,532
I'll be able to do things normally.

330
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,407
I can just live my ordinary life, doing ordinary things.

331
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:44,728
Anyway!

332
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:48,365
I wanted to ask you if me and the others
could come over to your place later today.

333
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,880
I wanna leave it on 'cause it looks cute.

334
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,102
As long as you're happy with who you are,

335
00:17:57,203 --> 00:17:58,622
that's all that matters.

336
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:01,616
I just wanted to stop by here and tell you that.

337
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:03,230
But I got distracted.

338
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,072
Nano!

339
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:20,135
Nano!

340
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:21,135
Hey, kid.

341
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,324
Shh! This is the important part!

342
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:36,937
Let's do it like we practiced!

343
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:38,759
All right, I got it.

344
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:41,529
Ready, and...

345
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:43,082
Hey, Nano!

346
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:46,417
Ta-da!

347
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,425
We brought a yummy cake for you!

348
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:49,973
To celebrate your birthday!

349
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,790
Huh? You all did what?

350
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:53,320
For my birthday?

351
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,710
Wait, how did you even...?

352
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,862
It was part of the surprise. Are you surprised?

353
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,237
Is that cake? I want cake!

354
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:01,696
Gimme! I want cake! I want it, I want it!

355
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:02,595
Hang on, Hakase!

356
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,218
You gotta wait your turn!

357
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:05,798
Be careful with that!

358
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:07,266
We're all gonna share.

359
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:11,366
Well, that sucks.

360
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,279
My cake!

361
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:15,289
What are we gonna do? Mio spent a lotta money on that!

362
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,737
I brought another one.

363
00:19:16,762 --> 00:19:18,352
Mai!

364
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:19,679
What the heck?

365
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:20,638
A shark!

366
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,029
What was that? Do it again!

367
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:29,097
Nah! This time it's Mio's turn!

368
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:33,365
I wonder how they found out today was my birthday.

369
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,098
I didn't tell anyone.

370
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:52,572
Nano!

371
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:54,835
I finished making the little guy!

372
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:56,956
Thanks, Hakase!

373
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:02,637
Honestly, I always felt that this key was inconvenient,

374
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,353
and I really wanted to get rid of it.

375
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:10,565
But now,

376
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:11,915
I like it!

377
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:14,488
This key's part of who I am! Huh?

378
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:18,842
Now, with this little guy in, you have an extra
feature that makes your key spin around and round

379
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,390
whenever you're genuinely happy in your heart of hearts!

380
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,297
What's the point of that?

381
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,350
Oh! That's right!

382
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:32,307
Hakase, do ya think you could help me
carry this cake in to the other room?

383
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:34,353
Whoa! You got another cake?

384
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,820
I'll be right behind you after I make the tea.

385
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:41,089
Got it! Cake time, cake time, cake time, cake time!

386
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:43,341
Hakase?

387
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,446
The cake.

388
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:46,263
Not another one.

389
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:48,491
Hey! Be more careful with stuff like that!

390
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:51,573
Are you okay? Any way I can help?

391
00:20:51,643 --> 00:20:54,045
I just need something to wipe this cake off me!

392
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:54,805
Right!

393
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,025
I'll put the candle on it.

394
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,279
I wanna do it!

395
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:58,331
That's no fair!

396
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,056
We can save that for later.

397
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:01,404
Help us clean all of this up first.

398
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:03,345
We gotta clean it up before the cake cakes!

399
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:09,690
Hang on, Mai!

400
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:11,818
Hang on. What' so funny?

401
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,743
I, um... Uh...

402
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,203
Another one.

403
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:18,090
No! Stop! One's enough!

404
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:23,048
I still don't get what's happening!

405
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:27,975
I did it.

406
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,490
You better not have hay fever.

407
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:15,396
I'm fine, I just can't stop sneezing.

408
00:23:15,554 --> 00:23:16,730
Don't be silly!

409
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:19,472
If you wanna stop, you just gotta have the motivation!

410
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:24,227
I don't understand how motivation has
anything to do with constant involuntary sneezing.

411
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:25,147
Hmm...

412
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:29,123
Sometimes, you just gotta do it!

413
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:30,123
No way.

414
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,015
What a complete idiot.
