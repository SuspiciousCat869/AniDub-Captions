1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,071
I've noticed some unruly behavior
among the students as of late.

2
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:10,777
And since you are the school's guidance counselor,

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:14,186
I trust that you'll be stricter
with students and enforce our rules.

4
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:15,122
Of course!

5
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:18,316
Yes! You can count on me!

6
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:51,228
Just trust me, the next time...

7
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:51,971
That's right!

8
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:58,521
Becoming the guidance counselor was the first step
I took to growing as a person! I have to do my best!

9
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:12,205
Oh, my goodness! I can't believe what I'm seeing!

10
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:15,342
Wait, just calm down. You can do this.

11
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:17,472
Um. Excuse me!

12
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:19,609
Uh. What can I do for you, madam?

13
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:26,251
I'm sorry to bother you, but you see, uh, I was thinking
that it might be inappropriate to eat while walking?

14
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,862
Or something like that.

15
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:29,936
Apologies!

16
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,699
I skipped breakfast this morning.

17
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,124
And my stomach couldn't wait until lunchtime.

18
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:36,618
But I shall put this away immediately.

19
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:39,383
You mean it? Thank you so much!

20
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,368
I'm really glad you understand.

21
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:44,784
That wasn't so bad. All I had to do was speak up.

22
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:49,622
Please tell the chef...

23
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:56,035
...the meal was to die for!

24
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:05,594
If you don't stop making a scene in
the hallway, you really will die here,

25
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,516
so quit being such a weirdo at school!

26
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,468
Correct me if I'm wrong,

27
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,384
but I don't think those are allowed?

28
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:13,138
Hey, Misato! We're headed out!

29
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,203
Coming!

30
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:17,699
Sasahara! We'll continue this during the lunch break.

31
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:19,186
Don't you forget it!

32
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:23,380
The principal was right about the unruly behavior.

33
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:25,048
My apologies.

34
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:28,735
I'm sure she meant no harm.
She tends to be a bit dramatic.

35
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:29,790
Don't mind her.

36
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,615
Uh, okay. I guess, if you say so.

37
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,086
Oh! One more thing!

38
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:37,476
Question.

39
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:40,510
What do you call that frilly
piece of cloth around your neck?

40
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:42,192
Ah, you mean this?

41
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:45,618
Yes, I have to say, it looks rather dashing.

42
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,837
We live our ordinary lives, day after day, in succession.

43
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,881
Each hour can be considered a miracle in itself.

44
00:03:57,684 --> 00:03:58,403
Uh.

45
00:03:58,894 --> 00:04:03,249
So, you see. Each moment should be truly savored.

46
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:13,918
So, uh, you never actually
said what that frilly thing was.

47
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,368
Ahh! That's a good one!

48
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:29,708
Now, then. I bid you <i>adieu,</i> madam.

49
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:43,610
Thank you. I appreciate it.

50
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,932
...Go+Soccer club is a club that plays Go and Soccer.

51
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:49,607
Both individually, and at the same time.

52
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:53,661
Excuse me, Nakanojou! A moment please?

53
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:56,965
Yes. How can I help you?

54
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,920
Uh, well, you see, thing is...

55
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:03,953
I was just thinking that your haircut
might be a little too extreme for school.

56
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:04,378
Uhh...

57
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:08,549
Uh. I mean, just by a little bit!

58
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,220
On second thought, it's not all that bad.

59
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:11,494
It's all I have.

60
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:14,364
Hey, I'm really sorry if I offended you.

61
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:15,371
I was only saying...

62
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:15,928
My hair.

63
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,978
My hair doesn't grow out on the sides!

64
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:25,765
Green light!

65
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,872
Still green light.

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,550
Green light...

67
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:32,407
And red light!

68
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,267
Everyone went home already.

69
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,638
Um, what are these?

70
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:49,186
Those are green plums.

71
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,143
I thought it might be kind of fun if I
tried pickling some of them at home this year.

72
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:55,058
Pickled plums are so sour.

73
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,012
But they're very healthy for you.

74
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:59,214
Plus, if you put them inside of rice balls,

75
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,119
it'll keep the rice from going bad.

76
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:03,098
Ah! Yum!

77
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:05,348
Hey, Nano!

78
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:06,578
I think not.

79
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,453
You say no, but I haven't even asked anything yet!

80
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,793
We bought you plenty of snacks the other day,

81
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:14,411
and I thought I made it clear
that we're not going to buy any more

82
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:16,902
of them until you finish the
ones you already have at home.

83
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,369
Are you listening to me?

84
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,078
Remember we came here for a purpose.

85
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:24,887
To shop for... uh...?

86
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:26,078
Sakamoto.

87
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:32,044
Right. We told Sakamoto that this grocery trip
was to get him food, so we can't get distracted by...

88
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:36,850
Whoa that's giant.

89
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:38,273
Um, 'Scuse me.

90
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:40,312
Yes? Anything I can help you with?

91
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,959
That thing up there. Is it new?

92
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,478
Yes, our snowman just came in this morning.

93
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,941
It's the only one we have in the whole store.

94
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:52,802
Can I eat it?

95
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:56,910
Well, I guess it wouldn't be too
different from a shaved ice dessert.

96
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:58,529
Oh, it's cold!

97
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,934
And cheap, too!

98
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:05,918
Gonna buy it?

99
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:08,978
Uh. No, I was just wondering how much it was!

100
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,462
Check out the snow man.

101
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:11,621
I want it.

102
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:12,155
Uh.

103
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,028
Young lady.

104
00:07:15,097 --> 00:07:15,857
Yes ma'am?

105
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,201
If you're not going to buy that
snowman, please give it to me.

106
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:28,831
Okay, I'll take it!

107
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:35,217
So, I don't get to buy anything, but you can
buy whatever you want? You're such a big meany.

108
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,558
Listen. It's not like that.

109
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:43,230
Yes, it is! You wouldn't let me get my favoritest
snacks, but you picked up a snowman just cause he's cute.

110
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:45,970
It's not fair! I wanna buy stuff too!

111
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:48,526
Okay, fine, I give... you can get one snack.

112
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,639
Do you mean it?

113
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:52,897
All right. We're good.

114
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,061
So that's why you ended up buying that thing.

115
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:05,266
Uh-huh! It's cute, it's cold, and I like how it feels.

116
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:07,660
Hmm...

117
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:11,898
Okey-dokey, here's some more.

118
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:12,916
Yay!

119
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,707
Nano, I need more snow! Right away!

120
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:21,791
Coming right up!

121
00:08:22,624 --> 00:08:24,469
You two are unbelievable.

122
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:27,694
Anyway, where's the food you got for me?

123
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,064
Oh.

124
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:35,687
She forgot my food.

125
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:41,225

That's not it.

132
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,578
Okay! It's time to turn in your tests!

133
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:51,570
Say what?!

134
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:03,633
That was a bald cap.

135
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:15,952
Figuring out what people want is no simple task.

136
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:18,824
Because all people want different things in life.

137
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:23,368
Instead, focus on what your own goals are.

138
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,327
That can be easier to grasp.

139
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:29,572
From there, do the best you can and have faith.

140
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,532
That's all we can do.

We work hard, and hope life takes us down the right path.

Still green light.

143
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:46,140
Green light...

144
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:46,970
And red light!

145
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:50,125
Are we still not done?

146
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,493
I got sent out to the hall again.

147
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:10,358
Huh?

148
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:18,248
I'm finally starting to get used to this body.

149
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,298
Just looking at them is making me hungry.

These are called pickled plums! They're quite delicious!

154
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:36,092
Oh.

155
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:38,392
Huh? Uh!

156
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:41,211
You can't eat them yet!

157
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:43,240
They won't be ready for a little while!

158
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,757
Hey, Sakamoto! Come play with me!

159
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,181
Oh, a foxtail.

160
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:53,193
Come on, pretty kitty. Here, Sakamoto.

161
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:55,594
That's "Mister" Sakamoto to you, ya little brat!

162
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:56,832
Or did you forget already?

163
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:59,606
Oh yeah, I did forget. Sorry, Sakamoto.

164
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,431
Now you're just doing it on purpose!

165
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:02,812
I just forgot again!

166
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:05,364
But I promise I'll remember it next time, Sakamoto.

167
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,991
Do you mock me, child?

168
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:15,311
All right, I'm off to the store!

169
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,083
See ya later!

170
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:23,446
Jeez. You two really need to learn some manners.

171
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:24,858
You've got no respect.

172
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:27,513
Sorry, Sakamoto. I'm not doing it on purpose.

173
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,426
Could you, for once, add the "mister"?

174
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,620
Want some gum? Would that help, Sakamoto?

175
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,645
How many times do I have to tell you
before you get it through your thick skull?

176
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,803
And what makes you think you can give gum to a cat...?

177
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:45,916
Would you cut it out?

178
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,146
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:51,635
Listen up. As I've explained before, I'm
older than you in human and in cat years.

180
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:54,907
And as your elder, I deserve respect...

181
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:59,951
in the... form... of... the title "mister"...

182
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:01,860
So, uh...

183
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:05,053
You gotta... do the thing.

184
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,840
You know... what I said before... about the...

185
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:09,549
...you know, name and the...

186
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:11,285
What?

187
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:13,291
Can I go and use the potty?

188
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:15,039
Yeah! Sure! Go ahead!

189
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,110
Potty time!

190
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,102
And she took it with her.

191
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,944
As I suspected,

192
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:31,885
those two kids are the only ones living in this place.

193
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:34,797
Now I get it.

194
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:37,904
That explains why they're so undisciplined.

195
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:43,441
So, if I'm older than both of them,

196
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,224
I guess that means I'm the oldest in the entire house.

197
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:52,198
Heh. So be it. Seems like I'll have to
step in as the parental figure they're lacking.

198
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:57,998
Hm? This is quite the unusual
family I've been brought into.

199
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,510
Oh man, this thing is so much fun!

200
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:05,588
Hey, Sakamoto. What are you up to?

201
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:12,680
Crap! If she finds out I was playing with
an eraser, she'll lose her respect for me!

202
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:17,684
The respect I worked so hard for.

203
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,610
I was, uh, taking a nap?

204
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,863
Cats sure do sleep a lot.

205
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,818
Anyway, that's the way things are.

206
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:31,175
The way things are?

207
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:33,231
Yup. Now you're getting it.

208
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:36,005
You've gotta get a grip on the basics first.

209
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:40,297
Like... learning how to respect... your... el... ders!

210
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:42,847
Oh man! This is so much fun!

211
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,953
Ah! Sakamoto! Do it again!

212
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,587
Do it again! Come on, the jump flip!

213
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:52,207
Hey! Don't forget the basics!

214
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:54,581
I told you to call me "mister" Sakamoto!

215
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:55,637
I'm home!

216
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:57,057
Hooray!

217
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:32,773
Don't you ever knock, Mom!

218
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,519
Green light!

219
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:47,305
Red light!

220
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,884
Green light!

221
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:02,424
It's like she begging me to make a
joke about how she's reading weird stuff.

222
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,316
Well, I guess I'll take the bait.

223
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:08,065
That book your reading is going undercover!

224
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:10,628
Yuuko.

225
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,539
Please don't ever make a joke like that one again.

226
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,642
Uhh...

227
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,463
The jokes you make are always so good.

228
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,325
My own aren't nearly as funny when compared to your jokes.

229
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,001
Uhh...

230
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:29,191
Well, I don't always come up with the jokes on my own!

231
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,153
Sometimes, the jokes come up with me!

232
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,657
Y'know! Like just now when you had your books
stacked up weird, it's almost like you were asking for it!

233
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,291
But, like. Thing is...

234
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:39,691
I wasn't sure you'd think it was funny.

235
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:41,188
Really, you weren't sure?

236
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:44,418
Are you being honest when you say that?

237
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:46,765
Uh? Huh...?

238
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,759
I figured that you would understand.

239
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:50,259
Huh?

240
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:54,455
I thought you'd catch on to what I
was doing since you're so intelligent.

241
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,161
I had no idea you saw me in that way!

242
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:02,718
I mean, I'm flattered you think
so highly of me! And it's so good

243
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:05,270
to know there's someone out
there who thinks I'm trustworthy.

244
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:06,290
Trustworthy?

245
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,806
I'd rather not bring trust into this.

246
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:13,943
And I don't think we should speak to each other.

247
00:18:14,574 --> 00:18:16,930
After all, we aren't friends anymore.

248
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:18,097
Hm?

249
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:22,501
We're best friends.

250
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:24,803
We don't need words to convey our feelings.

251
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,708
You mean it?

252
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:35,784
Come on! Don't be silly!

253
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:38,644
Even though we're best friends, we can still talk, right?

254
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:42,974
But... Mai...

255
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,708
I would prefer it if you didn't touch me so frequently.

256
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,724
Uh. Um.

257
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:49,988
All right then.

258
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:51,911
Sorry.

259
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:53,564
Please stop it.

260
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,887
You keep saying things like that and I can't help it.

261
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:58,815
Huh?

262
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:03,176
I can't stop myself from liking you even more.

263
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:10,787
Huh...?!

264
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:14,353
Um, uh, hey, it's not a big deal!

265
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:16,350
Of course you like me! Because we're friends!

266
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,342
Best friends, right?

267
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,137
High-Five!

268
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:21,164
No, it's not like that at all.

269
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,608
Huh?

270
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:23,844
I do like you as a friend,

271
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:26,575
but I also like you like you as more than that.

272
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:35,713
Sorry. I just... can't really explain it.

273
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:40,952
Well, I... That's, uh...

274
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:49,422
What the heck is going on?

275
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:50,605
I knew something was up!

276
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,297
She's talking way more than usual!

277
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:55,746
Come to think of it, she was the one who
suggested that we go somewhere alone today!

278
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:59,663
Did she want to confess her feelings?

279
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,414
But why, and since when?

280
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:03,326
How long has she felt this way?

281
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,515
Hey, uh, Mai, I just have a little something to clear up.

282
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:13,924
Uh. The thing is, I don't know what to say!

283
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:17,412
This is all happening so fast, and we're
both so young, and we're only in high school!

284
00:20:17,437 --> 00:20:19,176
We've got our whole lives ahead of us!

285
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,101
I think we might be rushing into things!

286
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,950
You know that I was just kidding, right?

287
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:29,067
That was super, ultra, great,
delicious, wonderfully hard to understand!

288
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,787
Why would you do that?! You totally had me going there!

289
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:35,973
Now you're saying it was all a joke?!

290
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:37,774
I see.

291
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:38,794
Uh...?

292
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:43,353
You're usually so perceptive to these kinds of
things, so I was expecting that you would figure out

293
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:44,978
what I was up to and play along.

294
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:45,735
Well, I...

295
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,739
I had a feeling you were up to something.

296
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:49,937
You're a liar.

297
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,646
Not exactly. I knew that something was off,

298
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:56,087
it just took time for my brain to process the signs.

299
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:58,120
I almost had you figured out, too.

300
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:02,746
You ended up dropping the act before I could
put it all together and start playing off of you.

301
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:05,965
Didn't you just say that I totally had you going earlier?

302
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:06,473
Huh?

303
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:11,048
I hate being lied to more than
anything, so you can stop making excuses.

304
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,740
Uh...

305
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:15,770
Sorry.

306
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:17,986
Chill out I'm still just joking with you.

307
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,803
I don't even know what to believe anymore!

308
00:21:21,253 --> 00:21:22,712
So you didn't notice then?

309
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:24,730
You couldn't catch the other joke I made?

310
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,955
I don't care, just tell me what it was!

311
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,852
It was at the very beginning when
I said I thought you were smart.

312
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:36,933
You went along with it, so I
just kept on messing with you.

313
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,510
That was why?!

314
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:45,107
Well, at least I can understand
why you made that first joke.

315
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:27,190
It's me!

316
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,476
Your friendly neighborhood apartment complex!

317
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,777
Can you believe I'm over 40 years old now?

318
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,992
I guess you could call me the land lady.

319
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,507
That's got a raunchy ring to it, doesn't it?

320
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:39,492
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 5.

321
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:40,460
Look forward to it!
