1
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:08,550
Lunch time, so I'm out of the woods!

2
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,109
I can't believe you got away
with not doing your homework again.

3
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:13,702
It's about time that I had some good luck, Mio.

4
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:16,403
I was getting tired of having to
stand out in the hallway every day.

5
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:17,874
Maybe things are looking up for me.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,113
Just do your homework.

7
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,292
Y'know what'd be great?

8
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:23,332
You getting me a juice to celebrate my luck!

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:23,639
Huh?

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,072
Young lady. We need to have a little
chat about your missing assignments,

11
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:55,346
so please come to the faculty room immediately.

12
00:00:56,673 --> 00:00:57,432
Okay.

13
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,600
Maybe I should get her a juice.

14
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:33,668
Hey! I'm over here!

15
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:35,459
Oh, hey! I'm sorry.

16
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:36,518
Were you waiting long?

17
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:37,558
Not at all!

18
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:39,341
I actually just got here myself.

19
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,225
Sis sure is being extra loud with her friends tonight.

20
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:48,479
'Kay, so, I gotta know.

21
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:49,629
How are "things"?

22
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:50,213
Hm?

23
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,354
How's what now?

24
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,660
Don't you be shy!

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,842
Come on!

26
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,483
I'm talkin' about you and Koujirou's love life.

27
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:01,467
Why would I even think about marrying
and spending my life with that weirdo?

28
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:04,719
What? I never mentioned that!

29
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:06,198
And children?

30
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:07,232
You can forget it!

31
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:09,375
I hear ya loud and clear!

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,885
You, Koujirou, and his goat already have
a long and happy life planned out together!

33
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,585
No, we don't.

34
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:17,125
So, what's been going on with you, Weboshii?

35
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,468
Huh? Who, me?

36
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:20,023
Nothing you need to know about.

37
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:22,209
Aww, hey, you can tell me!

38
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:24,089
Is there somebody you have your eye on?

39
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:25,975
Uh-huh.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,209
Just spit it out!

41
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,594
I wanna know!

42
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,304
Stop it, stop it!

43
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:32,131
Okay! I'll tell you...

44
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:34,901
I'm not stopping till you say who it is!

45
00:03:36,273 --> 00:03:39,346
All right! As soon as you let me go!

46
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:43,259
You better speak up right now, or else!

47
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,092
Ow!

48
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,792
I already said I'd tell you!

49
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:49,000
Sorry. I was having so much
fun, I guess I got carried away.

50
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,058
So? Give us the juicy details!

51
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:52,797
I wanna know more about this guy you like!

52
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:56,104
Hmm. I wouldn't say that I like him, not yet anyway.

53
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,550
Sure, I'm interested, but I don't even know his name.

54
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:00,880
He's that one cool guy with the mohawk.

55
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:02,228
Ahh.

56
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:03,364
It's that guy.

57
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:06,038
Oh, so you know who I'm talking about, then?

58
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,645
Everybody knows about him.

59
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:09,923
He's pretty popular with that crazy hairdo of his.

60
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,268
Of course we'd know him.

61
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:14,385
But why are you interested in him of all people, Weboshii?

62
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,445
Hmm.

63
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:16,873
I guess he kinda...

64
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:19,366
...gives off a bad-boy vibe.

65
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:24,167
I dunno, there's something about the dangerous type.

66
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,212
He totally seems like one of those, right?

67
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:27,592
Yeah, definitely.

68
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,810
And his mohawk is like a bad-boy beacon!

69
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:31,913
Get this. I saw him the other day,

70
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,890
and he was being a good, upstanding member of society.

71
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:39,750
Yeah, okay!

72
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:42,137
The only thing that's upstanding is his hair!

73
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,680
I'm serious. I know what I saw.

74
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,853
He was watering the school's flowers.

75
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:48,693
What? Get outta here!

76
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:50,095
Oh, yeah, and then, he, like,

77
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,459
even fed the plants with this fertilizer stuff.

78
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:53,400
Oh, wow!

79
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:55,006
I never thought he'd be so sweet!

80
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,815
You can't judge a book by its cover, huh?

81
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,215
Yeah, you got that right.

82
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,850
I guess he isn't a punk after all.

83
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,792
And I think I might actually
like him more now that I know.

84
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:05,897
Yeah I get what you mean. I
prefer it when guys are nice, too.

85
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:08,789
So does that mean there's someone
you've got the hots for right now?

86
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,584
What, me? Well, I, uh...

87
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,011
Sasahara's that way.

88
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:13,947
Here you are.

89
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:18,415
I saw him feeding his goat this one time in the
pouring rain and I thought that was pretty nice.

90
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:21,967
Yeah, I get it!

91
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:23,418
That does sound pretty nice. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm!

92
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:25,360
I see why you like him.

93
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:27,667
What? I never said I liked him or anything

94
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:28,950
just because he's nice.

95
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:30,584
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm! So anyway!

96
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:31,959
Tell us who you're after!

97
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:33,359
Huh? What do you mean?

98
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,710
If you like someone, then tell us who it is.

99
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:39,351
Um, I can't think of anyone in
particular that I'm interested in.

100
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:42,537
I guess I'm just not into weirdos like you guys are.

101
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:48,051
Helvetica Standard.

102
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:49,937
Begin!

103
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:51,188
Seiya!

104
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:54,276
Here I come!

105
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:58,700
Soiya!

106
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,647
One point!

107
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:10,667
Ow! Man, that hurts.

108
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:13,247
Hang on a sec. Here.

109
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,188
Thanks, I really appreciate it...

110
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:18,067
What's wrong? Lemme see your hand.

111
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:18,766
Huh?

112
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,851
It's finally my day off,

113
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:40,241
but since I have so many errands to run,

114
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:43,935
this will end up being just as busy as a regular work day.

115
00:06:44,392 --> 00:06:46,229
Oh, well. At least it's peaceful.

116
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,555
I guess that's enough.

117
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:51,834
It looks like this'll be another
boring day for me, then, huh?

118
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:54,506
Hello there.

119
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:55,013
Hm?

120
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:02,039
Casual clothes?

121
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:04,949
This is what she looks like outside of work?

122
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:07,627
Are you out shopping as well, Mr. Takasaki?

123
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:08,933
And those pigtails!

124
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,719
Bumping into Sakurai like this on a weekend?

125
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,377
It's almost as if we're more than just colleagues.

126
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:17,208
I'm so happy.

127
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,312
This is the best day ever.

128
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:20,798
Oh, no, are you okay?

129
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:22,396
You're not feeling ill, are you?

130
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,122
Don't worry about me!

131
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,925
I'm surprised to see you here, that's all!

132
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,554
Oh! Could you be out shopping today, too, Ms. Sakurai?

133
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,943
Yes! There's a great sale on green onions today,

134
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,597
so I figured I'd go out and pick some up.

135
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:33,957
Green onions, huh?

136
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:38,513
Well, if you ever find yourself needing bamboo
sprouts, just give me a shout and I'll get you some!

137
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:40,908
Uh, you have extra bamboo sprouts?

138
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,109
Well, I kind of have...

139
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:44,132
You know, come to think of it...

140
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:45,384
Really, you do?

141
00:07:45,513 --> 00:07:46,957
That sounds wonderful!

142
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:50,177
Bumping into her like this on the weekend...

143
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:52,442
It feels like it was meant to be.

144
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,174
Almost as if fate brought us together.

145
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,769
This wasn't some chance encounter. It was destiny.

146
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,668
I never believed in this kind of stuff before,

147
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,677
but I think I get it now.

148
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,282
I wish I were a green onion!

149
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:10,719
You sure you're okay?

150
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:12,799
It kind of looks like you're in pain, so...

151
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,489
...maybe we should sit down.

152
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,317
Don't worry about me!

153
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,406
I'm doing completely fine, 100 percent fine!

154
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:19,692
I wouldn't want you to trouble
yourself with something like...

155
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,251
...maybe we should sit down.

156
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,771
With something like...

157
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:24,415
...maybe we should sit down.

158
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:26,863
...maybe we should sit down.

159
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:30,317
...maybe we should sit down.

160
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:34,390
This is the best.

161
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:35,757
I hope it never ends.

162
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:38,331
I know! I have a great idea, Ms. Sakurai!

163
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:41,334
There's a park a few blocks down, so
why don't we go down there and sit down?

164
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,454
Uh, okay!

165
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,291
Oh, man.

166
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:49,035
I can't believe this is actually happening right now.

167
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,378
Hang on!

168
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:53,804
Could this be... considered a date?!

169
00:08:57,528 --> 00:08:59,018
Why is she here?

170
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,375
Actually, you know what? I'm fine!

171
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,109
So maybe we should just turn around.

172
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:04,605
A student, here? Now?

173
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,342
I can't have her seeing us together.

174
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:09,619
Uh... Hey! What are you two doing over there?

175
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:10,889
D-Don't be silly!

176
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:13,000
This is just a completely casual meeting between adults.

177
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:13,837
And, uh, that's it!

178
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,077
Fancy seeing you here!

179
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:16,584
If I didn't know any better,

180
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:19,065
I'd say you two were on a secret date or something.

181
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:21,674
If you think it's a secret, why would you say it out loud?

182
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:23,167
Aw, what's the big deal?

183
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:24,968
You guys look like you're having fun!

184
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:26,061
You turd.

185
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,431
Uh... hm?

186
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,108
I hope you're having a fine morning today, Ms. Sakurai.

187
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:34,168
Huh?

188
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:38,584
Look, it's the two love birds!

189
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:39,548
Look at 'em blush!

190
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:41,061
Ooh!

191
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:42,020
That's enough!

192
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:43,878
No teasing the teachers!

193
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:48,985
Those darn kids always take things too far.

194
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:50,618
I'm sorry about all this.

195
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,919
I hope it didn't cause you too much trouble.

196
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:54,379
It didn't.

197
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:55,826
But, um...

198
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:59,096
I, um, thought it was kinda cute.

199
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:02,303
That's it! Okay! Let's do this!

200
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:03,717
What's wrong with me?

201
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:05,650
It would never work out so perfectly like that!

202
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:06,807
I gotta get outta here!

203
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:07,869
What's going on?

204
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:08,661
Nothing!

205
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:11,247
Why does it look like you're
hiding something, Mr. Takasaki?

206
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:21,469
Well, it's been a lovely coincidence
seeing you here, Ms. Sakurai!

207
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,874
And wouldn't ya know it, there's a student here, too!

208
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:26,859
What are the chances of seeing two people
from the school in the exact same place!

209
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:28,157
Hm? What was your name?

210
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,682
It's Aioi, isn't that right?

211
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:31,464
Just kidding! Of course I'd remember!

212
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,350
Uh...

213
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,458
Well! In any case!

214
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:38,222
I've got places to go and people to see, so if
you'll excuse me, I'm gonna hit the 'ol dusty trail!

215
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:53,259
Maybe... I should pick up some green onions.

216
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:59,109
Sorry for calling you out like this.

217
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:01,281
You sleep okay last night?

218
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:05,203
I did, but... I had the most peculiar dream.

219
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,515
Oh, really? What happened?

220
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,283
Well, um... we were standing here kissing.

221
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:14,467
What if I made that dream a reality?

222
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:17,275
Hey! Uh, Hakase!

223
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:18,969
Let's go get you some more snacks!

224
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:21,784
Do you really have those kinds of feelings for me?

225
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,929
Save your questions for after.

226
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:26,831
Oh, my! Sir!

227
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:41,403
After one whole month of investigating,

228
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:46,234
I've determined that Nano Shinonome visits
the supermarket in this district every Saturday.

229
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,144
If my calculations are correct, she'll be arriving soon.

230
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:51,779
And once she does, I'll be right behind her.

231
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:53,292
When I find my opening,

232
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:58,192
I'll call upon my trusty friend, Mr. Short
Circuit, once again to assist me in this abduction.

233
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,251
For science!

234
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:00,857
It's the perfect plan!

235
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:04,132
Today shall be the day I study you, Miss Shinonome!

236
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:08,408
Or not!

237
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,895
Why isn't she showing up?

238
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:12,719
Could it be that she doesn't
come to the supermarket every week?

239
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:14,482
Maybe my calculations were off.

240
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:18,352
No. I can't give up now.

241
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:21,287
I've already waited this long,
so I can't let it be for nothing!

242
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:22,247
Hmm.

243
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:24,904
I knew it! So it is you, Ms. Nakamura.

244
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,542
Fancy seeing you here.

245
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,974
Likewise, you walking pair of sideburns!

246
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:30,264
Uh, hello there.

247
00:12:30,353 --> 00:12:33,614
I hardly recognized you without your usual lab coat on.

248
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,956
I don't have time for this pointless small talk right now.

249
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:41,788
If I don't focus, Nano Shinonome might slip
through my fingers without me even noticing her.

250
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:45,564
I never woulda guessed that your
street clothes would be so boy-ish.

251
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:46,590
I'm surprised.

252
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,424
It looks pretty cute on you.

253
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:53,084
Um, well, no, actually, this is just my, uh...

254
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:56,065
I'm so used to you being all
serious with that lab coat on,

255
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:58,662
so seeing you like this makes you seem cuter, I guess.

256
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,380
I'll have to retreat for today!

257
00:13:03,502 --> 00:13:05,367
Hang on, you forgot your science thingy!

258
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,199
So then,

259
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:15,012
have you given any thought to what you might
want to do in the future at all, Miss Minakami?

260
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:16,712
I have thought about it.

261
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:23,024
Uh... So, are you planning on finding a job?

262
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,898
Then... are you... looking into higher education?

263
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:33,299
Uh... 'Kay that means...

264
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,150
I think I get it.

265
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,176
Hey, you find it yet?

266
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,817
It's no good.

267
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,073
We can't find the cube.

268
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,552
I thought we stored that thing somewhere safe.

269
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:02,199
How could it just disappear?

270
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:04,169
Well, look on the bright side.

271
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,363
There's gonna be a huge cash reward
for whoever finds the dang thing.

272
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:09,858
I'd say that's worth all the trouble we're going through.

273
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:11,012
Ha, yeah!

274
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:13,238
If we can find one, then we can find the other.

275
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,204
Better keep looking.

276
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:17,069
If I could just get my hands on that cube.

277
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:19,361
I wonder if that would help me
get in the King's good graces.

278
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,147
Hey, uh, who's that?

279
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:22,180
Over there?

280
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:23,167
Huh?

281
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:29,586
My wooden cube.

282
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:30,726
Give it back.

283
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:37,364
Hey, now.

284
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:39,919
What seems to be the big problem here, little girl?

285
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:42,052
How did you manage to get on this ship?

286
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:43,012
Don't tell me.

287
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:44,567
You're some kind of stowaway?

288
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,875
Do you know how we punish kids for doing that?

289
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,845
We throw them straight into prison.

290
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,242
Ten years minimum.

291
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,686
And the worst part is, I'd be your warden!

292
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:54,692
That what you want?

293
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:57,275
No, 22!

294
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,841
Damn it! You're gonna pay!

295
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,835
Hold it. I can handle this.

296
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,250
I got careless for a split second there.

297
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,955
But I've got this under control now, trust me.

298
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:07,435
I gotta say.

299
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,948
You sure do pack quite a powerful punch

300
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,414
for such a tiny girl.

301
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:12,591
Now then.

302
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,044
This has been fun,

303
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,923
but it's time you started talk...

304
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:19,442
Is he okay?

305
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:20,650
Negative. He's dead.

306
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:21,498
She's a monster!

307
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,261
The stowaway isn't gonna stop
until she gets the wooden cube!

308
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,647
Let's charge at her together!

309
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:26,787
We've got her outnumbered.

310
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:28,702
Hmm.

311
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,123
There's no reason to panic,

312
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,542
now that I'm here, so everybody can settle down.

313
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:33,497
Officer!

314
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:40,465
Relax. Just sit back and watch how it's done.

315
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,299
In this situation,

316
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,902
the Officer might actually be our only hope.

317
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,043
Hmm. So, she's on a solo mission to claim the wooden cube.

318
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:52,973
Undoubtedly a highly-skilled
agent sent by an unknown enemy.

319
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,016
All that skill and power could be quite useful, though,

320
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:58,983
if we can convince her to switch over to our side.

321
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:02,392
Fortunately, I am in possession of the other wooden cube.

322
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:03,785
It's what she wants,

323
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:05,574
so it makes the perfect bargaining chip,

324
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:08,007
and we should be able to come to an agreement.

325
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:11,184
I just happen to have the cube you're looking for,

326
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,225
so what do you say we make a trade?

327
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,189
We could strike a promising deal...

328
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,715
Ooh!

329
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:26,961
Officer!

330
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:28,054
He's dead, too!

331
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:29,592
This is not good!

332
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:31,806
She took down the Officer like it was nothing!

333
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:32,804
We'll show you!

334
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:34,923
We're not gonna let you out of here alive!

335
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:38,266
This is bad! Really, really bad!

336
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:41,515
By definition, that means it's not good.

337
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:44,950
What does that mean, Scholar?

338
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,609
How bad is "really, really bad"?

339
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:50,483
If you would all stop yelling at me for
a moment and observe the intruder's head,

340
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,792
you'll notice that she has a wooden cube in her hair.

341
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:56,094
And if you look on the other side of
her head, there's another wooden cube.

342
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:58,976
Meaning that she has a total of two wooden cubes!

343
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:01,547
Which means that she has both
wooden cubes in her possession!

344
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:05,380
But even if she has both the cubes, we
should be fine as long as she doesn't know

345
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:06,859
how to summon the ancient weapon.

346
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:08,375
That's right! We can still win if...

347
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,650
Shut up and listen to me!

348
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:13,764
It says here in the Hell Encyclopedia,
that whoever possesses both of the wooden cubes

349
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:16,662
will be bestowed with the
unstoppable power of the ancient weapon!

350
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:18,588
In other words,

351
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,500
it means that whoever possesses both of the wooden cubes

352
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:24,567
will be bestowed with the
unstoppable power of the ancient weapon.

353
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:25,597
What does that mean?

354
00:17:25,622 --> 00:17:26,869
Explain that once more, please!

355
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,569
Yeah, I didn't get it the first time!

356
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:29,542
In other...

357
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,877
There's no time to explain!

358
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:33,910
It is over!

359
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:36,078
If we try to fight here, not only will we be doomed,

360
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:38,233
but the entire world along with us!

361
00:17:44,886 --> 00:17:46,823
Don't you dare back down!

362
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:49,852
Never run from you fears!

363
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:50,872
Conquer them!

364
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:54,399
It's the Captain!

365
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:55,366
Captain!

366
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,074
All right!

367
00:17:57,153 --> 00:18:01,782
Listen. Trying to attack her head-on one
at a time will only guarantee your demise.

368
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:03,148
It would be futile.

369
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,114
However! The enemy is but one lone girl!

370
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:08,424
So we have the advantage of numbers on our side!

371
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:13,147
We must work together as a complete unit to rush in
and take those wooden cubes from her no matter the cost!

372
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,464
I'll take point and lead the vanguard!

373
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,657
Attack!

374
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:21,818
Captain!

375
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:24,195
Forget about me! Carry on!

376
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:25,419
But, we can't just...

377
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:26,778
You piddling maggot!

378
00:18:26,862 --> 00:18:30,047
I don't remember training a
pathetic, cowardly soldier like you!

379
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,169
It's all over.

380
00:18:40,563 --> 00:18:41,947
The Officer is gone.

381
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:43,887
The Captain is stuck in a hole.

382
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:46,197
What hope do we have left now?

383
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:47,097
We're a team.

384
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:48,959
And we still have each other.

385
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,946
One for all... and all for one!

386
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:16,437
Captain, no!

387
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:21,816
It's been 12 long years since I joined this squad.

388
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:27,141
Over a decade of my life gone in a flash,

389
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:30,387
because of this girl.

390
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,764
It can't be over.

391
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,109
I'm not done yet.

392
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:44,175
It won't end like this!

393
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,192
We're doomed!

394
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,174
Please, no!

395
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,857
I don't wanna die here!

396
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,221
Huh?

397
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:35,907
I'll go stand in the hallway.

398
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,010
Huh?

399
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:46,317
That's so obvious!

400
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:47,764
Whatever.

401
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:51,875
I've got nothing else to do right now,
so I might as well indulge the little brat.

402
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:57,010
Making something a waste of time

403
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,233
is a special talent indeed.

404
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:08,490
Hmm.

405
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:11,377
Oh, you have bed-head.

406
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,142
It's actually pretty cute on you.

407
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:16,569
It looks pretty cute on you.

408
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,613
What the hell am I doing?

409
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:32,026
What's wrong with me?

410
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,569
I'm finished now!

411
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:39,586
The bath is all yours whenever you...

412
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,023
I'm a Love Umbrella.

413
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:30,339
If you need a matchmaker, I've got you covered!

414
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:33,589
Write your name on one side, and
your special someone on the other.

415
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:34,862
Oh? You don't have one?

416
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:39,160
Then for a sad sap like you, the
next <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 22.

417
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,280
Look forward to it!
