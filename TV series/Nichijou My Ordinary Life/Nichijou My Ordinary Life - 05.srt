1
00:00:01,714 --> 00:00:03,396
Nano!

2
00:00:04,174 --> 00:00:07,634
Nano? Hey, Nano!

3
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:10,087
Nano!

4
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:11,738
What is it?

5
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:14,391
Are you outside?

6
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,351
Yes.

7
00:00:23,353 --> 00:00:24,353
Nano?

8
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:25,686
Yeah?

9
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:34,111
Hey, Nano!

10
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:34,984
Huh?

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,007
Looky, look!

12
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:37,904
I'm a cat, check me-owt!

13
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:40,464
Meow!

14
00:00:41,362 --> 00:00:43,044
Sakamoto! I'm like you!

15
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,814
I'm a cat, check me-owt!

16
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:47,662
Check me-owt! See?

17
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,358
Hakase.

18
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:53,447
I think your cat look is purr-fect!

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,170
Meow?

20
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,952
Meow! Checking me-owt?

21
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:01,215
That's paw-some!

22
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,491
Here and meow?

23
00:01:02,516 --> 00:01:03,684
So a-mew-sing!

24
00:01:03,753 --> 00:01:05,036
You're checking me-owt!

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,657
I'm really feline it!

26
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:07,729
Meow I'm a cat!

27
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:08,911
You're kitten me!

28
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,186
I'm fur-real!

29
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:12,895
Meow you're talkin'! Meow and fur-ever!

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,768
It's another peaceful day at the Shinonome household.

31
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:57,802
Why is the Earth round?

32
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:00,407
How do planes and rockets fly?

33
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:04,077
Why do magnets attract and repel one another?

34
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:10,044
Every one of those questions can be answered by science.

35
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:13,854
Our society is infatuated by the afterlife.

36
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,956
Things like ghosts, and paranormal phenomena.

37
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,096
But such stupid stuff couldn't possibly be real!

38
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:22,781
They can't exist. There's no way.

39
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:27,231
Which is why...

40
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:32,273
...I refuse to believe in psychic mediums!

41
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:38,535
During one of my days off,

42
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:41,642
I decided to make an eight-hour trek up Mount Osore.

43
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:43,751
And the closer I got to the summit,

44
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,849
the faster my heart raced.

45
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:48,804
Was there really a medium up here?

46
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:51,036
If there was, then where?

47
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:54,251
What was the point of living in such a secluded place?

48
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:55,409
Maybe if...

49
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,906
I found one!

50
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,711
All right, good.

51
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,105
I'll say there's a spirit I need channeled.

52
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,116
Excuse me.

53
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:17,822
Yes?

54
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:18,735
Um.

55
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:20,913
Can you to channel the spirit of Soap?

56
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:21,966
Yeah, sure.

57
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,512
Hello! It's me, Soap!

58
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,715
Brr, ow! Mic test. Check.

59
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,736
Check, one, two. Check, check.

60
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:34,187
Testing. One, two, three.

61
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,269
What the...?

62
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,900
It feels like something crazy is going on here.

63
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:45,780
Could there actually be somebody
out there with the name Soap?

64
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:49,554
Testing. Check. One, two.

65
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,865
Yes, it's me. I'm Soap. Yup, yup, yup, this is Soap.

66
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,850
No. I can't falter now.

67
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:59,315
If I just keep asking her stuff, I'm sure
she'll end up contradicting herself somehow.

68
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,980
I have a question.

69
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:04,125
If you're really Soap, then what's your blood type, huh?

70
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:07,764
Dunno.

71
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,517
Let's try again with someone more recognizable.

72
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,057
Excuse me.

73
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:20,386
Could you channel the spirit of the great Oda Nobunaga?

74
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:22,190
Give me a break here, would ya?

75
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:29,532
She's refusing my request without even trying?

76
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:32,346
Wait. I'm dealing with an elderly woman here.

77
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,418
She might be overexerting herself.

78
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:36,930
I'll figure out another angle.

79
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:49,316
Thank you for your time.

80
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,895
I'm gonna go home.

81
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:53,527
I don't like criticizing people.

82
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,585
Realizing that alone makes this trip worth it.

83
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:58,186
Oh, one more thing.

84
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:58,888
Uh?

85
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,538
That'll be 5,000 yen.

86
00:06:26,947 --> 00:06:27,925
Huh...

87
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:00,891
Oh?

88
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:04,435
Mm. Ah...

89
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:06,673
Ah-chee.

90
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,366
Wha...?

91
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:18,781
Boys are so weird.

92
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,471
Okay, you ready?

93
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:26,703
Rock, paper, scissors!

94
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,658
Huh? Wait, what? Huh?

95
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:40,412
Come on, Mai! Wake up!

96
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:42,084
You're supposed to bop me on the head when you win!

97
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:43,707
Didn't I just explain the rules?

98
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,074
You're no fun. That hurts, you know?

99
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,054
It hurts more than actually getting smacked.

100
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,811
All right. Let's try this again one more time.

101
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,832
If you lose, you guard, and if you win, you get to hit.

102
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:56,451
Wah!

103
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:59,875
I didn't mean hit me right this
second! Why would you do that?

104
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,650
Because I won the game earlier.

105
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,958
That was earlier! You can't do it now!

106
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:06,491
Act when the time is right! Live in the moment!

107
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:09,385
Strike when the iron is hot!
Just be spontaneous or whatever!

108
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,215
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

109
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:19,451
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and a one, two, three! ♪

110
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:20,959
You're Nya-no now!

111
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:22,705
Whatever, let's try it again.

112
00:08:22,872 --> 00:08:23,898
Fresh start, okay?

113
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:26,226
Rock, paper, scissors!

114
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,102
She doesn't even care at all!

115
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,818
Do you enjoy making me look like a fool?

116
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,046
She's so not in the mood.

117
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,581
And now I'm not either.

118
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:39,209
Uh, where do you think you're going?

119
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:41,519
There it is.

120
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:47,133
That statue. Where did... you get that?

121
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:48,800
Carved it.

122
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:52,186
Oh, thank goodness. Here I thought
it got reincarnated or something!

123
00:08:52,218 --> 00:08:54,354
I'll put this right here.

124
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:59,451
She looks strangely happy.

125
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:03,718
Hey, let's forget about that
silly statue and keep playing.

126
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:08,698
Kay. Rock, paper, scissors!

127
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:12,558
Uh. I don't think that counts.

128
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:14,693
Okay, maybe it does!

129
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:18,582
Unbelievable. She's so vicious.

130
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,418
I'm begging you, Mai! Please cut it out!

131
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:26,264
Just play by the rules! And no
using that statue as a weapon!

132
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,327
Are you ready now?

133
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:33,448
First comes a rock. One, two, three.

134
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:43,454
Uh.

135
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:50,687
You did it right.

136
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,356
That's it!

137
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:54,045
You just played the game!

138
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,499
Aw! I knew you could do it all along!

139
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:58,364
Cool! Let's go for another round!

140
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,685
Ready? And first comes a...

141
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:04,066
...rock.

142
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,868
God is dead!

143
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,610
God is indeed dead.

144
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,009
What gives?

145
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:12,159
Why'd you hit me?

146
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:15,436
We haven't even played the next round yet!

147
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,634
Maybe it's because

148
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:20,956
I don't really feel like playing.

149
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:21,686
Oh.

150
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,044
Then can I see your statue thing? Please?

151
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,433
Yeah, sure.

152
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm headed to the library to return some books!

153
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:48,246
Take care of the house while I'm gone!

154
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,810
'Kay!

155
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:53,874
Huh?

156
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:02,881
Why does Nano's daruma guy
only have one eyeball filled in?

157
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:08,544
I know! If I help her out and fix the other
eye for her, I bet she'll really appreciate it!

158
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:13,170
She'll be so grateful, she might even say that
I can eat all the snacks I want, whenever I want!

159
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:35,224
Oh... I think I messed it up, 'cause
that doesn't look right. Now what do I do?

160
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:36,956
Nano'll get mad, and...

161
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:40,229
Uh! What if she gets so mad she takes my snacks away?!

162
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:43,385
No more snacks for Hakase ever again!

163
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,668
Just put a little this, and a little there, and uh...

164
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:54,999
Is something wrong?

165
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:58,728
Uh! I don't know what to do Sakamoto! Look.

166
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:00,434
At what? Whoa!

167
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:03,415
What happened to its face? You did a number on that thing.

168
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:07,331
I was just trying to even out the eyes.

169
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:11,431
Hmm...

170
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:18,285
Don't you worry. I know what we have to do.

171
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,486
I'm home!

172
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:33,297
Gah!

173
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:34,899
You're on your own.

174
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:37,176
Sakamoto!

175
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,584
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

176
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:42,007
Hey, Hakase!

177
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:44,524
Sorry I took so long,

178
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:46,682
but I was picking out new books to bring home.

179
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:48,762
What'd you do while I was gone?

180
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:49,604
Wait, what the...?!

181
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,421
What's going on with your belly?

182
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,638
Well, uh. You know how it goes sometimes.

183
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,852
What does that even mean?

184
00:12:59,469 --> 00:13:00,979
It's coming!

185
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:02,788
Wait.

186
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,807
There's no way. You can't possibly be having a child.

187
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:07,722
I'm having one now! The baby is coming!

188
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:10,471
O... kay? Are you pulling some sort of prank?

189
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:13,696
I'm not! I'm bringing your baby brother into the world!

190
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,386
It's your baby brother.

191
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:39,129
Goo-goo. Ga-ga.

192
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:40,502
This could be a problem.

193
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,768
Helvetica Standard.

194
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:29,926
Mio! You wanna play a game?

195
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:30,747
What kind?

196
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:33,128
How 'bout we play Kokkuri?

197
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,509
What's that?

198
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,759
Wait. You've never heard of it before?

199
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:37,862
Nope, never.

200
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:40,613
Okay then, I'm gonna break it down for you.

201
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,229
You start by drawing a shrine
gate at the top of the paper here.

202
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,841
Then you write Yes and No on
the sides, and the alphabet below.

203
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:48,952
Okay.

204
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:52,531
And in some regions, I think you're supposed to draw a

205
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:55,222
little piece of fried tofu
somewhere on the paper too, but...

206
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:58,329
Let's stick to the simplified version for now.

207
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:04,390
Then. You have to make sure to open up a north
facing entrance so the spirits can get inside.

208
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:09,682
Next, we take a ten-yen coin and set it
on top of the gate we drew at the beginning.

209
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:13,697
Finally, we both touch the coin
with our fingers and ask it a question.

210
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:18,885
There's no restriction on what kind of things you can
ask the spirit, so the sky's basically the limit here.

211
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:19,409
Sure.

212
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,532
And then, without any effort of our own,

213
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:25,739
spirits will slide the coin around and
spell out the answers to our questions for us.

214
00:15:25,942 --> 00:15:26,795
Really?

215
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:30,163
Yeah! I know it's awesome, but some things are taboo.

216
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,074
First off, you can't play the game
by yourself and you can't half-ass it.

217
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:36,924
Because if you do, you might get possessed!

218
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:37,488
Oh?

219
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:41,827
You also risk getting possessed if you
stop partway through, so you gotta commit.

220
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:43,049
Right, I get it.

221
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:48,599
Now you know how to play the wonderfully spooky
game of Kokkuri! So, whaddaya say we give it a shot?

222
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:49,412
Nah, I'm good.

223
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,712
Ahhhh....

224
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:08,276
So, uh, that concludes the lessons

225
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:09,744
I have for you today.

226
00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:12,271
Remember that we'll be having a quiz tomorrow,

227
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:14,473
so make sure you don't forget to study tonight!

228
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,657
What? Can't you push the quiz back?

229
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:18,598
It doesn't matter if you take it later,

230
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:19,915
you're still gonna bomb it.

231
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:22,932
Yeah, probably.

232
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,315
Excuse me, Miss Sakurai?

233
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:26,756
How can I help you, Miss Aioi?

234
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:29,354
I just had a question for you, if you don't mind.

235
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,266
Go ahead!

236
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:34,334
Well, about that English test we had a little while ago.

237
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,331
What is this supposed to be?

238
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:39,253
The correct answer for that one was "Fly."

239
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,571
No, I'm not asking about the answer.

240
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:45,057
I'm wondering if you were the one
who drew this low-level looking monster.

241
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:50,716
Yes, I did. I figured it would help make the
test a little easier if there was a visual aid.

242
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:53,435
Well then, you have some pretty awesome drawings!

243
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:58,345
How kind of you. But my drawings aren't
great, so I'm sorry if they were hard to identify.

244
00:16:58,699 --> 00:16:59,773
Uhh...

245
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,102
I know!

246
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:05,312
How about I give you a hand, and draw you
a picture that you can put on the next exam!

247
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:07,417
I promise it'll be something really cool!

248
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:08,377
Sure, okay!

249
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:09,872
Oh! Hey, Mio!

250
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:10,602
Hm?

251
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:13,882
Check it out! My drawing is gonna be in the next test!

252
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,934
Really? Why?

253
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,911
The teacher said she would use it!

254
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:20,973
I bet you could get yours on there too if
you drew a little doodle of your own right now.

255
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:23,973
Yeah, I dunno if I'm cut out for something like that.

256
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,880
Huh. What do mean?

257
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,515
I'm just not the greatest.

258
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:29,742
And besides, I gotta go return this thing.

259
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:31,677
If you say so!

260
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:32,323
'Kay!

261
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:34,692
I think I'm gonna draw a cool-looking dude!

262
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,117
Get a load of this handsome stud!

263
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:49,869
Wow! He looks so cool!

264
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:52,231
That's impressive!

265
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:54,654
I'd say you've got quite the artistic talent there!

266
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:57,011
Aw, well it's not that amazing.

267
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:59,344
Oh wait, maybe it is.

268
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:05,095
I think I'm gonna name my
dapper doodle dude Hubbu Hunkerson.

269
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:07,520
Wow! That's such a cool name!

270
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,684
None of this is cool!

271
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:19,618
I dunno guys, I think it should look more like this.

272
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:23,952
Feast your eyes!

273
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:27,256
Wow, amazing! It looks like it's from a manga!

274
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:31,004
You must put a lot of time and
effort into practicing your art skills.

275
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,904
Well, uh, just a little!

276
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:35,525
Remarkable! Show me some of your other work!

277
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:37,487
Uh. I don't think so.

278
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:39,021
Oh? But why not?

279
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:40,890
I would love to see more of your stuff.

280
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,342
Um. Well. It's just...

281
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:46,704
Gimme that thing!

282
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:49,813
My drawing is way cooler than yours, see?

283
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:55,532
You straight-up copied me!

284
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:56,841
You don't know that.

285
00:18:56,892 --> 00:18:58,120
I saw you do it!

286
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:00,516
"Homage" may be the word you're looking for.

287
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,307
So you're admitting that you copied?!

288
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,334
Wow! That's so cool!

289
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,009
You are so easy to please!

290
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:17,229
All right, then, prepare yourselves for some of this!

291
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:23,394
Glasses! Every girl swoons over the cool
and collected demeanor behind those lenses!

292
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,900
Ah, so he wears glasses.

293
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:28,368
Huh?

294
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,831
Is his eyesight bad?

295
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:34,318
He'd probably look better if he wore contacts.

296
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:36,995
You two don't understand anything!

297
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,505
Y'know? I'll add an extra bit!

298
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:40,362
There we go!

299
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,238
They're hanging under his ears!

300
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:44,544
You so stole my glasses idea!

301
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,902
Tch. Tch. Tch. They're sunglasses.

302
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:48,635
Wow! They're so cool!

303
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,161
Are you kidding me?!

304
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:52,322
Oh, yeah? Then how's this?

305
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:56,445
A butler! The perfect gentleman who
serves you tea and follows your every command!

306
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,465
He'll treat you like the fine young lady you are!

307
00:19:58,516 --> 00:20:00,013
Huh. Glasses again?

308
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,491
I don't think I understand the appeal.

309
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:06,132
Maybe you should have taken my contacts idea.

310
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,583
I feel like you're a bit out of touch, Mio. Tell ya what.

311
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,488
I'll show you what being cool is really all about.

312
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:17,969
Some of this, and some of that.

313
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:18,588
Check it.

314
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,512
It's floating!

315
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:25,341
Wait! Hold on a sec! Is he supposed to be driving?

316
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:27,645
Wow! He's so fast and dangerous!

317
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,504
You've gotta be kidding me!

318
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:33,811
They don't understand coolness at all!

319
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:38,346
You wanna see something cool? Then I'll have to show you.

320
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,094
This is a lesson now.

321
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:43,954
You're gonna see what true coolness really is!

322
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:47,390
You'll see! You'll all see!

323
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:51,783
This is the coolest!

324
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:52,450
Yo.

325
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:53,569
Uh...

326
00:20:53,682 --> 00:20:54,608
Uh...

327
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:02,557
Oh, no.

328
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,335
I'm just kidding!

329
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,564
I kid!

330
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:37,432
I drew this while listening to jazz.

331
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,504
Good morning!

332
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:48,002
Oh. Oh, good morning, all knowing master.

333
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:49,319
Don't you even!

334
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:50,541
Listen up class!

335
00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:52,273
It's time for this morning's quiz,

336
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:54,373
so take one and pass it down, please.

337
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:56,429
Aw man, this sucks.

338
00:21:56,557 --> 00:22:01,918
I was hoping that I could keep my drawing skills a
secret for a while longer, and then I had to go overboard.

339
00:22:03,176 --> 00:22:06,678
All things considered, after going berserk like that,

340
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:10,188
I should be relieved that what I
drew ended up as tame as it was.

341
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:12,532
I guess I should count myself lucky.

342
00:22:14,005 --> 00:22:18,961
But I'm sure I won't hear the end of it from Yuuko,
at least for the next few days. That's okay, though!

343
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,622
I gotta look on the bright side! And stay positive!

344
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,011
Yo.

345
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:27,090
Hurry up and pass it back.

346
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:27,796
Uhh.

347
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,608
Ready, and... begin!

348
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,277
Yoink! Bang! Zoom!

349
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:13,801
Hello! It's nice to meet you!

350
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:15,201
I'm an Onomatopoeia!

351
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:17,460
Cock-a-doodle-doo! Now you try it!

352
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:18,992
But don't chicken out!

353
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:22,039
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 6.

354
00:24:22,064 --> 00:24:23,317
Look forward to it!
