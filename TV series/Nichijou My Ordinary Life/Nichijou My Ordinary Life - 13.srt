1
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:17,508
Man, I'm starving.

2
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:18,056
Oh?

3
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:20,361
Well, that's subtle.

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,142
Don't these kids have anything better to do?

5
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:24,589
Whatever.

6
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,475
There's a fish in it for me, so I guess I'll get trapped.

7
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:29,556
Seems pretty harmless.

8
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:35,163
I gotchu! Kitty fell for it!

9
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:36,976
Nope. Not harmless.

10
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:38,182
Harmful.

11
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:39,269
Huh?

12
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:42,735
I was gonna cook this up for lunch in a little bit.

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,247
Now I hafta go out and buy something else.

14
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:46,548
What a bad boy.

15
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:48,201
Don't you blame this on me!

16
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,129
But why not?

17
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:51,290
You're the one who said you wanted to eat it.

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,063
I did not! When did I ever say that?

19
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:55,770
You ate it, didn't you?

20
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,631
Can you believe how hot it is today?

21
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,234
Ugh. I know, right?

22
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,086
Wanna grab some ice cream after school?

23
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,861
Oh, yeah! For sure! I could totally go for that.

24
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:04,057
That sounds perfect!

25
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:06,448
There's a new spot I wanna try.

26
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:09,481
Hey, kid.

27
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,898
It looks like she wants to go to school.

28
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:19,874
You can't go!

29
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:22,439
Where's this coming from all of a sudden?

30
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,609
Nano, why are you leaving me?

31
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:25,283
What?

32
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:27,581
Who in the world told you I was gonna leave you?

33
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:28,414
Him.

34
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:31,030
That's not even remotely close to what I said!

35
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:33,455
So then, are you still gonna go?

36
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,717
Well, I am planning on going to the store,

37
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,780
if that's what you mean.

38
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:40,149
There's just a few things I need to
pick up so I can make us some lunch.

39
00:01:41,608 --> 00:01:43,487
I want go to the store with you!

40
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:44,767
I'm not buying you any snacks.

41
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:46,531
I want the shark chocolate!

42
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:47,721
Not happening.

43
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,065
Come on! It's only chocolate!

44
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,661
I already told you no.

45
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:52,559
Just one! That's like almost nothing!

46
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:53,684
It's still something.

47
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,355
Actually, Sakamoto wants it.

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,008
Don't drag me into this!

49
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,583
Hey, it's Mio. Morning.

50
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:36,691
Ah! What's wrong with your face?

51
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,902
You look awful!

52
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:41,700
Now you mention, I didn't been feel not very good.

53
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:43,631
So, yeah...

54
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,226
Oh, man.

55
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:47,492
You can't even form a proper sentence right now.

56
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,315
And that fever looks real bad.

57
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:51,910
Why didn't you just stay at
home if you're feeling this sick?

58
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:54,659
I couldn't 'cause...

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,910
I told you, I gotta show you those magic tricks.

60
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:01,246
Remember? The secret ones.

61
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:06,416
What magic tricks? You never told me about them.

62
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:10,442
Hey! Just forget about the
tricks and go back home to rest!

63
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,826
But I spent so much time practicing my magic.

64
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:16,003
I guarantee you, it'll be so worth it.

65
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:18,338
Just sit back and be prepared to be amazed.

66
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,678
It's gonna be...

67
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,561
I'm amazed you came to school.

68
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:25,188
Why don't you take it easy?

69
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:28,214
Yuuko!

70
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:32,273
Your prop... is already migrating out of your bag!

71
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:37,450
I'll just pretend I didn't see it and act surprised later.

72
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,907
Otherwise she would've dragged
herself out here for nothing.

73
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:41,932
But I don't get it.

74
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:45,062
Why is she trying so hard to show off her...?

75
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:49,068
Bird! It's totally out in the open now!

76
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:51,101
Her props are on the loose!

77
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:00,070
It flew away!

78
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:03,604
My tissues.

79
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,615
'Kay, so I'm gonna start the show now.

80
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:22,297
Sure. Go ahead!

81
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,547
Great, what do I do with this thing?

82
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:26,145
I just hid it on instinct.

83
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:28,304
All right.

84
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:31,379
First we have... I have, uh...

85
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:33,342
She's really out of it.

86
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,234
She hasn't even noticed that
her dove and wand are missing.

87
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:40,992
First, I'll pass a cigarette through this ordinary coin.

88
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:46,102
This is pathetic. I can already see the hole!

89
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:51,226
Every card in the deck is an ace of hearts!

90
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:52,940
Now what?

91
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:05,136
Hang on.

92
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:07,997
Something just flew out of her mouth.

93
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:09,887
With her gross sneeze.

94
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:28,796
I don't understand. What were you planning?

95
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:33,993
Yuuko!

96
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,483
And she's out.

97
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,935
Rest in peace. Or whatevs.

98
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,477
'Kay, I'm heading to the supermarket now.

99
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,663
Great! I'm gonna go, too!

100
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:59,459
That's fine, but I'm not getting you
anything since you were misbehaving.

101
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,580
Ya hear that? Too bad for you!

102
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,241
She's not talking to me!

103
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:05,855
Come on. Let's go to the store.

104
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:08,796
So, what are you gonna get?

105
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:11,576
Well, I was thinking another fish.

106
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:14,767
I wonder what kind of snack I should buy.

107
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,792
I said I wasn't buying you anything.

108
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,613
Huh? But what if I wanted a not snack?

109
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:22,340
It doesn't matter, you're not getting any food.

110
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:24,786
Huh?

111
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,719
In that case, what's left at the
grocery store that I can buy? Anything?

112
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:30,643
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

113
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,503
Whoa! Check it out! It's a shark castella!

114
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,458
Oh, they put a food stall here?

115
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,593
That dessert looks super tasty, right?

116
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:41,156
Hey, don't try anything funny.

117
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,574
I've made up my mind.

118
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,475
Aww. But what if it was for Sakamoto?

119
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,603
Would that be okay?

120
00:07:46,628 --> 00:07:49,732
Sakamoto misbehaved, too, so he's in the same boat as you.

121
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,332
Oh, did I say it was for Sakamoto?

122
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:54,008
I meant it was for you.

123
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:55,572
Nope, it's not gonna happen.

124
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:59,156
If I'm not firm with her, she's just gonna end up spoiled.

125
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,727
All right, come along.

126
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:02,299
Let's get going now.

127
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:11,390
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

128
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:13,671
No! I need to stand my ground!

129
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,691
But then again...

130
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:19,725
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

131
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:21,614
I really shouldn't. Should I?

132
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,139
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

133
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:24,491
I definitely can't!

134
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:26,207
But what if I did?

135
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,625
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

136
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,236
No! Absolutely not! Maybe one snack?

137
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,683
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

138
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,441
Ugh! There's no way!

139
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:34,798
Unless...

140
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:35,824
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...

141
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:38,834
So yummy!

142
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,592
Really? You ended up caving?

143
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:44,451
I'm sorry. She's persuasive.

144
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:47,064
This little brat can just throw a tantrum

145
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:49,209
and ends up getting whatever she wants.

146
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,314
Someone oughta teach her a lesson.

147
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:54,928
Hey, kid, don't you have any self-control?

148
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:56,199
I sure do!

149
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:57,207
Don't you lie to me!

150
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:02,398
It's another peaceful day at the Shinonome household.

151
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,750
Wow! You got a whole 80 points!

152
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:22,139
I knew you had it in ya!

153
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,885
Yeah!

154
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:27,176
Perfect. Can you tell me your secret to success?

155
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,854
There's no secret! It just kinda happened, ya know?

156
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,366
Ah. Really? Don't be like that!

157
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:34,180
Eighty points! Yeah!

158
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:35,488
Can you please stop?

159
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:36,628
Eighty points! Yeah!

160
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:37,346
That hurts. Hey!

161
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:38,933
Quit it!

162
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:41,708
Jeez.

163
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:42,962
Okay, okay.

164
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:44,803
Do you really wanna know my secret?

165
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,658
Not really. I got a 96, so it's fine.

166
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,404
Well then, I'll tell you.

167
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:52,575
It takes a whole lotta hard work.

168
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,870
And some heart.

169
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:55,576
Shut up.

170
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:06,860
Here's your test back.

171
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:16,730
Ohh...

172
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,315
Huh?

173
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,881
Wha...?

174
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:34,249
Oh, yeah!

175
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:45,140
Hey, Dad? I'm here to make dinner!

176
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,803
Mom's still out enjoying her vacation, isn't she?

177
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:50,335
She is. Thank you, dear.

178
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:51,855
Hi, Grandpa!

179
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,735
Hello there, kiddo.

180
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:54,880
Wonderful.

181
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:59,387
Playing with my grandson will help clear
my mind and ease the hardships of reality.

182
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:04,106
So then, what would you like to play today?

183
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,926
I wanna... I wanna see your official seal!

184
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:08,468
Eh?

185
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:10,420
Come on, where you hiding it?

186
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:13,654
I wanna play with it. Is it somewhere in here?

187
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:18,519
Am I warm?

188
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,639
It's somewhere on the bookshelf, right?

189
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,580
Somehow, this is even worse than reality.

190
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:26,349
Let me see the seal! Let me!

191
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,949
Helvetica Standard.

192
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,392
Did you forget that we were meeting up or something?

193
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:53,434
You're so late!

194
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,018
I'm really sorry!

195
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,731
I thought I took the right bus,

196
00:11:57,018 --> 00:11:59,989
but I ended up riding the waves of life instead.

197
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:08,020
No prob! We can ride them all
the way to the train station!

198
00:12:30,676 --> 00:12:31,570
Nano.

199
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:21,781
Hey, Nano. Wake up.

200
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:27,034
Is there something wrong, Hakase?

201
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:31,679
I think I gotta go potty, but I'm
scared to go to the bathroom alone.

202
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:34,446
Can you come to the bathroom, too?

203
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,305
Come on, can you?

204
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:40,168
Nano. Please? Nano?

205
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:42,630
Wake up. Please?

206
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,599
Huh?

207
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:47,594
Hakase, you're being so funny.

208
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,789
About what?

209
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:54,903
Borscht is a soup that's made
out of beetroots, you silly goose.

210
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,169
What? That's not it.

211
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,732
Let's go potty.

212
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,731
Hey, Nano.

213
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,588
Wake up, dummy!

214
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,798
Just go!

215
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,857
Wait. Did you just...?

216
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:21,181
No, it's okay. I don't have to go that bad.

217
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:25,446
But still, you should go to the bathroom anyway.

218
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,073
'Kay...

219
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:40,589
Nope.

220
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,589
Seriously?

221
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:44,616
Sakamoto is a considerate cat

222
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,425
and doesn't speak aloud.

223
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,661
Aw, man. What a pain.

224
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,621
Can't believe this kid.

225
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:56,327
Frozen in fear just because the night
happens to be a little bit dark and stormy.

226
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:58,073
Not surprising.

227
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,441
Wait a second. I can take advantage of this.

228
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,691
I'll accompany her and then she'll understand who's boss.

229
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:07,891
Hey, brat.

230
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:11,663
Since no one else will, I'll take you to the bathroom.

231
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:15,396
But you're tiny and really weak,
so that doesn't help me at all.

232
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,465
It looks like she wants to go to school.

233
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:46,029
Oh, hey. Hakase, what are you doing in my bed?

234
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:50,191
Nano, can we go potty together?

235
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:53,839
Well, I don't really need to go right now, so...

236
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:57,763
It's kinda scary outside, so I really wanna go together.

237
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,906
Oh.

238
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:02,188
You know, you could've just woken me up.

239
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:04,835
I tried, but it didn't work!

240
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,040
There's a banging sound.

241
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:21,250
You think someone's inside the house?

242
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,809
Pretty sure it's just the chimney blowing in the wind.

243
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:27,216
But it really is coming down hard out there.

244
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:34,309
Nano? What's the matter?

245
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:36,283
Hey. What's wrong?

246
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:37,885
Hey. Hey!

247
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:43,469
Hakase! I'm scared!

248
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,667
The thunder and lightning!

249
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:50,724
I'm here for you, so there's nothing to be afraid of.

250
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:57,254
Let's hurry and do our business so
we can get back to bed where it's safe.

251
00:16:57,377 --> 00:16:58,230
Okay.

252
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:02,469
You know, going alone would've been really spooky.

253
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:05,877
But since we're together, it's not so scary after all.

254
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:08,948
I think so, too.

255
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,180
Nano, do you really wanna go to school?

256
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:19,276
Huh?

257
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:25,356
I think, uh, I'm fine staying at home.

258
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:30,059
But Sakamoto said you looked like you
wanted to go, and I wanna know if that's true!

259
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,939
Well, I suppose it is.

260
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:06,480
Things we think are freakin' cool!

261
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:06,838
Huh?

262
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,330
My 80 point score!

263
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:10,594
Shut up.

264
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:22,281
One month goes by fast,

265
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:25,698
but Sunday always seems so far away.

266
00:18:34,152 --> 00:18:36,652
Next stop: 80th street.

267
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:38,037
That's eight zero.

268
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:40,446
Stand clear of the closing doors please.

269
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:41,229
Shut up.

270
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:43,229
Want me to sing you a song from the 80s?

271
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:45,893
'Cause you know that's my jam now. Heh.

272
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:46,677
Shut up.

273
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,892
♪ Got an 80! A what? An 80! ♪

274
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:52,719
♪ That's right! Got an 80! Booyah! An 80! ♪

275
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:54,092
Shut the hell up!

276
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:55,266
Can you believe it?

277
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,700
All right, let's settle down.

278
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:00,169
I'm announcing the average score for the test.

279
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:02,474
It was... 92.

280
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,826
That means...

281
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:09,480
Don't say it! Just let it go.

282
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:46,047
Huh?

283
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:52,202
Hey, you brat! What's the big idea?!

284
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,953
Aww. Look at what you did now.

285
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:58,908
I'd appreciate it if you stopped horsing
around and helped me with the laundry.

286
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:03,474
Starting tomorrow, you can go to school!

287
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:04,937
Huh?

288
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,230
Are you serious?

289
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,611
Mh-hm!

290
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:15,564
Wait, but why?

291
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,776
What made you change your mind all of a sudden?

292
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,861
My generosity knows no bounds.

293
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:26,548
All right!

294
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:36,541
Now I can eat all the snacks I
want for lunch and not get yelled at.

295
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:46,537
But, Hakase, I can't carry a bag with this key on, so...

296
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:47,736
Yes, you can.

297
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,085
Just hear me out.

298
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,106
If you take the key off of my back, then I can, uh...

299
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:58,342
You like your school uniform?

300
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,974
I love you, Hakase!

301
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,661
Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano!

302
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:29,436
Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase!

303
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:31,723
Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano!

304
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:34,353
Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase!

305
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:36,517
Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano, Nano!

306
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:38,917
Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase, Hakase!

307
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:39,903
Nano! Nano!

308
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:42,276
Hakase! Hakase!

309
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,142
Nano, Nano!

310
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,206
Hakase, Hakase!

311
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:44,917
Nano!

312
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,834
Hakase!

313
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:47,371
Nano, Nano!

314
00:23:26,787 --> 00:23:28,120
I'm national flags!

315
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:32,756
People wonder if I'm a string of international flags,
or the flags of many nations, but I'm actually both!

316
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:34,269
"Don't sweat the small stuff."

317
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:36,531
That's the last thing my father ever said to me.

318
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:39,428
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 14.

319
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:40,444
Look forward to it!
