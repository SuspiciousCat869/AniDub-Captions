1
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:05,301
Oh, yeah, don't worry.

2
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:06,493
It's cool. See you!

3
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:08,706
Hey, Mai, do you wanna walk home together?

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,839
Can we stop by the fire station?

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,604
Stop by what? Why would a pair of
ordinary high school girls go there?

6
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:19,665
I know what we can do!

7
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:23,175
How 'bout we go and visit that
Daiku Coffee place on the way home.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,762
But their sizing system is kinda weird, so don't
feel too bad if you get confused by the names and stuff.

9
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:29,580
Got 'em.

10
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:32,354
I've been there before, so I can help walk you through it.

11
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:50,189
Mai. Something's... afoot.

12
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:53,986
I'm stepping up my game.

13
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:57,133
Uh, yeah, I can see that! I just can't understand why!

14
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,387
Is this some sort of fashion statement or what?

15
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:01,295
It's just a joke.

16
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,406
She really threw me for a loop there.

17
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:15,914
It's happened. Mai's completely lost her mind.

18
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:17,948
I don't even know what to say anymore!

19
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:26,195
Oh, well. I'll just see what happens, I guess.

20
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:05,483
I wonder... What I should make for dinner tonight?

21
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:10,179
Green onions are on sale today,

22
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,753
so maybe I can do something with those.

23
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:16,510
Wait, no. Hakase hates onions.

24
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:26,552
Nano! Nano! Nano!

25
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:30,602
Hey. Look. I caught this crow outside.

26
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:34,592
Caught a what?

27
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:36,550
Wait! You can't bring that in here!

28
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:39,487
It's dangerous, and it might carry diseases or something!

29
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:40,606
Nah. It's fine.

30
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:42,918
Oh, I have an idea.

31
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:48,931
It's not in here.

32
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,052
I might die in here.

33
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:20,003
It's not in here either.

34
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:22,340
How could I have misplaced my scarf?

35
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:25,897
Greetings. I am Crow.

36
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:28,012
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

37
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:29,427
Say what?!

38
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:32,334
I'm so surprised by how polite and considerate he is.

39
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,366
Well, yeah, he's a crow.

40
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:36,592
You are too kind. It is an honor.

41
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,746
Do you think crows can drink strawberry juice?

42
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,031
Huh. Good question.

43
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:42,345
We should try giving him some! It'll be neat!

44
00:04:51,286 --> 00:04:52,323
Oh, wow.

45
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:55,606
He's nice enough to kill bugs for us!

46
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,608
It was nothing. I simply did what I felt was right.

47
00:04:58,866 --> 00:04:59,926
What a good crow.

48
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,290
Oh, hey.

49
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:05,886
What happened to that scarf you always wear, Sakamoto?

50
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:09,993
You're so silly! We can't
understand you and your cat speak!

51
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,868
Allow me to translate.

52
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:17,701
Ah, yes. I see.

53
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,856
It appears he's upset because
he would like to wear my scarf.

54
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,054
Ah, I see.

55
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,445
It's my scarf in the first place!

56
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:39,452
Hakase, did you take your scarf invention

57
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,748
from Sakamoto and put it on the nice crow?

58
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:44,522
This is quite a predicament.

59
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:49,052
Did you stop to think about
how that might make Sakamoto feel?

60
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:51,841
I know! I'll make him something!

61
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,039
Excellent idea.

62
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:54,332
It's done!

63
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,598
This is Biscuit #1!

64
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,955
You are not helping!

65
00:05:58,495 --> 00:05:59,767
I must inquire.

66
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:03,550
What exactly is this "Biscuit #1" of yours capable of?

67
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:05,338
I'm very glad you inquired, Crow.

68
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:07,499
He comes with a rocket punch feature!

69
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:08,904
Here, I'll show you!

70
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:12,892
Three, two, one. Blast off!

71
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,539
Hang on. Shouldn't we be helping Sakamoto?

72
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:25,248
What about his scarf?

73
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,200
Sure, but check this out.

74
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,546
Let's see what power the left hand is packin'!

75
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:33,058
Three, two, one! And launch!

76
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,557
I'll kill you. I'll kill you all.

77
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,221
Well. Ha. This day has been quite entertaining.

78
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,281
But I believe my mischief has overstayed its welcome.

79
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:53,294
It is about time that this scarf
was returned to its rightful owner.

80
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,376
Though it was short-lived,

81
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:58,281
I enjoyed being able to communicate with you humans.

82
00:06:58,366 --> 00:06:59,316
Mr. Crow.

83
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:01,638
You should stay with us!

84
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:02,384
Wait!

85
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:08,048
I hope for our paths to cross again one day!

86
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,590
Until then, I bid you farewell.

87
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:16,269
See you again!

88
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,716
Goodbye, Mr. Crow!

89
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,201
Crow.

90
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:24,063
He took my freakin' scarf!

91
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:33,455
There's no way, Chief. It's impossible.

92
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,306
No, trust me on this. Everything will be fine.

93
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,481
Yeah, but...

94
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:39,753
But what? You don't believe in me?

95
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:43,682
Of course not! I just, uh...

96
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:46,374
Chief. You can always count on me to have your back!

97
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:49,570
Perfect. Then allow me to have yours as well.

98
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:50,681
Huh? Wait!

99
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,879
Well? How does it feel?

100
00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:58,588
Come on, use your words.

101
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:20,585
Yesterday, I dug a few pitfalls behind the
gym and filled them with a powerful adhesive.

102
00:12:21,222 --> 00:12:22,755
And with this letter,

103
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,089
I shall lure her in to my scientifically crafted trap!

104
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:29,292
Prepare yourself, Nano Shinonome.

105
00:12:29,352 --> 00:12:30,570
Today is the day.

106
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:48,034
She's here!

107
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:49,360
Gotcha!

108
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:17,900
Fascinating.

109
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:21,198
Who would've thought that Ms. Sakurai
had a little brother at this school.

110
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:25,336
Maybe I could find out more about
her through this brother of hers.

111
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:34,915
This kid. He can play Go+Soccer?!

112
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:37,684
Interesting.

113
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:41,988
'Scuse me, young man.

114
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:42,663
Yeah?

115
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:46,565
I was wondering: You don't
happen to have a boyfriend, do you?

116
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,925
You idiot! What is wrong with me?

117
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,452
Why am I like this? Why am I so stupid?

118
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:55,015
A boyfriend? No, I don't, but...

119
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,478
No, I don't, but...

120
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,979
Sprout. Sprout. Sprouting!

121
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,318
Wait! No, it's not! Nothing's sprouting at all!

122
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,774
Uh...

123
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:05,950
Sorry about that!

124
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:08,357
Just, uh, forget about what I said. Ha-ha.

125
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:11,465
Anyway, I see that you, uh, know how to play Go+Soccer?

126
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,674
Yeah, and I'm pretty good, too.

127
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:17,162
By the way, Mr. Takasaki.

128
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:19,391
You have a crush on my big sister, don't you?

129
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:19,916
Uh.

130
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:26,758
What?! Don't be ridiculous!

131
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,744
I'm just making small talk with a
fellow Go+Soccer player, that's all!

132
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:31,875
Hold on. You know how to play Go+Soccer, too?

133
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,820
Oh, yeah!

134
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:35,443
You're looking at the former high school MVP right here!

135
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:40,963
You know, the Go+Soccer club at this
school doesn't actually have an advisor yet.

136
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:46,200
I'll tell you what... sign on as our club advisor and I'll
see if I can help you score some points with my sister.

137
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,340
No, what makes you think that I would
ever care about something like that?

138
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:54,200
If you don't do it, then I'll tell everybody
in school that you have a thing for her,

139
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:55,758
and it'll get real awkward for you.

140
00:14:55,783 --> 00:14:56,926
Uh! Blackmail?

141
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:59,491
How 'bout it? Sounds like a good deal to me.

142
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:01,183
Well.

143
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,312
What's it gonna be?

144
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:07,206
It's just, being a club advisor, it's kind of a hassle.

145
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,270
Hey, everyone!

146
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:09,611
You'll never believe what I found out!

147
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:12,758
He's doing it? I have to stop him!

148
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:13,815
There you are!

149
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,788
Nakanojou fell into a hole filled with
glue behind the gym and now he can't get out!

150
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:18,724
Wha...?!

151
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:20,562
We need your help, like, right now!

152
00:15:20,849 --> 00:15:23,683
Hey! Who wants to hear some dirt on Mr. Takasaki?

153
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:24,422
Sir!

154
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:33,423
All right, then. Listen closely.

155
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:34,234
Okay.

156
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:35,464
Nakanojou...

157
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:37,079
...is totally okay!

158
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:37,849
Wha...?!

159
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:39,826
Maybe he's pretending to be a golf ball!

160
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:40,534
Wha...?!

161
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:43,054
So is that why somebody shaved all of his hair off, then?

162
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,560
Wha...?! Draw it in.

163
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:46,017
Wha...?! I can try.

164
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,207
Wha...?! Hang on!

165
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:48,057
Wha...?!

166
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,877
First help me with this!

167
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:52,022
He likes green tea.

168
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:55,908
Stopping a student from blabbing about a
teacher's private life is just as important

169
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,067
as a student that needs to be excavated!

170
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:01,050
Because, well, I'm a teacher!

171
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:02,229
Mr. Takasaki!

172
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:02,908
What?!

173
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,683
I kept my mouth shut!

174
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:07,669
I'll be waiting for you, club advisor.

175
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,775
That's a good call, my dude.

176
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:13,167
Annaka, let's bounce!

177
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:13,794
'Kay!

178
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:16,137
There's no time to waste.

179
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,062
After all, I'm a teacher!

180
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:20,331
It's this way!

181
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:21,585
One sec.

182
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:27,864
Even though I always thought his hair was weird,

183
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:30,478
I do feel kinda bad for shaving it off.

184
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:32,224
So...

185
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,552
I guess I should dig him out.

186
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:38,294
He doesn't know I set the trap in
the first place, so it should be fine.

187
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:43,775
What's this? What's going on?

188
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:44,771
Where am I?

189
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,693
This feels weird! I don't like it! I'm stuck!

190
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:50,338
Anyone? Uh. Please?

191
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,492
My hair.

192
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,707
Run away!

193
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,148
My hair!

194
00:16:58,158 --> 00:16:59,926
♪ Swim, swim! ♪

195
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,881
♪ Shark, shark, chomp! ♪

196
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:03,700
♪ Shark, shark, chomp! ♪

197
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:06,824

198
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:12,171
"The Life of Chitchi." Check her out!

199
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,616
What the heck?!

200
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,469
Help me!

201
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:32,461
What the heck?

202
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:33,675
Help me!

203
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,947
My hair!

204
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:35,800
What the heck?

205
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:37,160
What happened here?

206
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:38,867
Help me!

207
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:39,565
My hair.

208
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,508
What the what?

209
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:42,229
Oh, my. That was a close one.

210
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:46,008
What's with the hole? That's just dangerous.

211
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:46,495
Help me!

212
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,279
My hair.

213
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,815
I'm heading out!

214
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:03,747
This is it.

215
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:06,101
I won't call out Mai's jokes today!

216
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:14,618
It's like she's practically
begging me to make jabs at her.

217
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:18,933
She just lobs 'em up, and I can't stop
myself from knocking 'em out of the park!

218
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:23,612
But if I don't cut it out now,

219
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:26,741
we're gonna get stuck in some
weird, never-ending joke cycle!

220
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,943
We're just normal high school girls

221
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:32,422
living our ordinary high school lives.

222
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:34,239
At least we're supposed to be.

223
00:18:34,437 --> 00:18:37,482
But the way we act is anything but ordinary.

224
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:42,764
But starting today, that's all gonna change.

225
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:45,911
My resolve is like a diamond,
and this diamond is unbreakable!

226
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,328
Hey. Good morning, Yuuko.

227
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:51,156
Hey! How's it going?

228
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:54,167
Double glasses!

229
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:57,503
This is harder than I thought!
She really brought her A game today!

230
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:59,169
It's almost like she's testing me!

231
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,805
But I won't give in!

232
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:03,747
I can... no, I will change!

233
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:07,173
Hello, Mai! <i>Selamat pagi</i> !

234
00:19:07,803 --> 00:19:08,610
Perfect.

235
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:11,360
And now's my chance to start an ordinary conversation.

236
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:13,435
Oh, yeah, I was wondering:

237
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,604
Did you see yesterday's Muscle Theater show?

238
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:22,665
Wha...? Wait, am I supposed to choose?

239
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,902
Where are my glasses?

240
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:32,922
It's just one gag after another with her today!

241
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:35,752
And the more I ignore them, the more she does it!

242
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,355
But I can't give in! I have to stay strong!

243
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,335
Don't take the bait!

244
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:42,175
What's up with you, Mai?

245
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,402
You've got two pairs of glasses on!

246
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:46,968
How dare you, Tanaka! I wanted to call her out!

247
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:51,687
The one thing in this world that I
wanted and you took it away from me!

248
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:54,811
Ah! Wait! No, this is a good thing!

249
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,868
It might just help me not make fun of her!

250
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:58,153
Wait, hold on.

251
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:00,746
What class do we have for first period today?

252
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:01,937
No idea!

253
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:05,003
But did you hear that Ms. Nakamura
tripped and fell the other day?

254
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:08,261
No. I hope she's okay.

255
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,658
Wait, hold on.

256
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:12,248
What class do we have for first period today?

257
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:13,879
Uh, didn't you just ask...?

258
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:15,110
Shut your mouth, me!

259
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:17,110
That was so sneaky, I almost didn't notice!

260
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,744
She's changing up her tactics
to try and catch me off guard!

261
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:21,617
Crafty, Mai. Very crafty.

262
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:24,953
All right, who's on day duty today?

263
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:27,288
Stand. Bow.

264
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,841
Take your sheet.

265
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:34,917
Okay, let's get started with class. Everyone...

266
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:36,475
"Take your sheet"?

267
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,451
Are you freaking kidding me with this?

268
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,565
And nobody even called her out on it!

269
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:45,140
Now then, who would like to read this section?

270
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:46,331
Me.

271
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:49,607
Of course she would!

272
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:51,019
Sure, now go ahead.

273
00:20:51,224 --> 00:20:51,799
Right.

274
00:20:58,328 --> 00:20:59,794
"A peaceful shade enveloped the mountain"...

275
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:01,341
She's reading it!

276
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:03,424
She's saying the words!

277
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,487
"It was my first time there"...

278
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,696
She's saying them perfectly.

279
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:10,381
Which means... that she...

280
00:21:16,022 --> 00:21:18,835
She memorized it!

281
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:41,831
You know what?

282
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,284
Calling someone out...

283
00:21:47,913 --> 00:21:49,870
...it feels...

284
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:57,164
...so darn good!

285
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:10,932
I apologize for shouting randomly.

286
00:22:13,302 --> 00:22:14,530
I'll be in the hallway.

287
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,778
Oh. Okay.

288
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:20,061
So... this is how it is.

289
00:22:21,211 --> 00:22:24,151
Maybe things don't have to change.

290
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:25,477
Because...

291
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:30,316
This is the path that we chose together.

292
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:33,223
Yuuko.

293
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,038
This entire time...

294
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:39,120
...I had contacts on.

295
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:46,978
Very well played, my friend!

296
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:04,356
Hm?

297
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:09,508
Wake up, Hakase. You shouldn't sleep here.

298
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,289
You should crawl into bed or you might catch a cold, okay?

299
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,571
Are you listening to me?

300
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:17,938
Gimme a little longer.

301
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:20,203
Huh? Longer for what?

302
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:23,808
That's what!

303
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:05,914
Sakamoto, you should really go to your bed, too, y'know.

304
00:25:07,253 --> 00:25:09,461
Uh. Sure.

305
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:15,124
In the end, she had to be carried.

306
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,725
I'm the three of spades!

307
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,786
My number may be low, but don't count me out!

308
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:25,076
The deck may be stacked against me,
too, but that's not a deal breaker!

309
00:25:25,152 --> 00:25:27,212
This spade is my strong suit, after all!

310
00:25:27,704 --> 00:25:30,738
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 18!

311
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,769
Look forward to it!
