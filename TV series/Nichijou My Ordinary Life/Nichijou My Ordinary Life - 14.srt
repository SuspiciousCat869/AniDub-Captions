1
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,686
It's more beautiful than I ever could've imagined!

2
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,404
Hey, what's goin' on in here?

3
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,216
Just the best thing ever!

4
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:28,719
Hey, be careful over there, Sakamoto!

5
00:00:30,584 --> 00:00:33,572
I wouldn't want you getting
your hair on my nice new uniform.

6
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,552
You've been shedding a lot lately.

7
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:41,210
I see how it is. I'm just in the way now.

8
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:44,329
I'm changing, so wait out here for a few seconds.

9
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:35,385
Check me out! Isn't this the most perfect fit ever?

10
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,452
Uh, well, yeah!

11
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,460
It was made based on your
measurements, so of course it fits!

12
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:40,595
How do I look?

13
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,024
You look pretty good, I guess.

14
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:46,107
Ugh. You don't get it! That's not what I meant at all!

15
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:51,660
Uh. Does it make me, um... look normal?

16
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:52,995
Sure.

17
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:55,404
I suppose you look like any other school girl.

18
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,261
Do you really mean it?

19
00:02:57,491 --> 00:03:00,566
You're the bestest kitty in the whole world, Sakamoto!

20
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:01,648
Oh, wait! Fur!

21
00:03:01,786 --> 00:03:03,378
What is up with you today?

22
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:05,487
I'll tell you what's up. School!

23
00:03:05,563 --> 00:03:08,229
And maybe even some new friends on the horizon!

24
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:09,769
I don't get it, but okay.

25
00:03:09,794 --> 00:03:10,950
Oh, hey, Nano.

26
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:14,128
Wanna do what friends do and
grab some ice cream after school?

27
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,710
Uh. Yeah. That sounds wonderful.

28
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:19,348
Great! How about we go sing karaoke, too?

29
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:20,976
Huh? Really?

30
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:22,873
Well, um. Maybe.

31
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,744
I've never done that before!

32
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:27,894
Don't worry! I'll show you how! Come on, everyone's going!

33
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:31,152
Oh. In that case, okay.

34
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:33,575
Wouldn't that be amazing?

35
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:35,369
Hi, Nano. Morning.

36
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:37,429
Oh, Hakase! Good morning!

37
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:39,559
Look at how well the uniform fits me!

38
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:42,029
So, what do you think? Do I look all right?

39
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:45,715
Um, yeah! You look cool!

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,617
Thanks, Hakase!

41
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:52,973
And I think you look cool in your pajamas!

42
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,510
You mean it? I'm cool?

43
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,616
You are super-duper cool!

44
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:58,703
But she wears that same thing all the time.

45
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:01,948
Sakamoto! Don't worry, you're cool, too!

46
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,738
Handkerchief, check! Student ID, check!

47
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:07,846
Textbooks, check! Notebook, check!

48
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,098
Pencils, check! Extra lead, check!

49
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,830
And mechanical pencil, check!

50
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:15,463
Okay! Everything is here!

51
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:17,740
What is it?

52
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:19,364
You're forgetting something.

53
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:21,246
Huh? Am I really?

54
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:23,979
What'll you do if you're hungry?

55
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,744
Grab a Snickers!

56
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:28,864
Good thinkin'!

57
00:04:29,497 --> 00:04:31,489
I left some food in the kitchen for you.

58
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,830
There should be enough for breakfast and lunch.

59
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,161
And I'll take care of the laundry later today,

60
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:40,324
so make sure to gather the clothes you
want washed before I get home from school.

61
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:43,853
Okay, but what time will you be getting out of school?

62
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,674
Well, it ends around 3:30, I think.

63
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:49,422
But I'll need to do some
shopping for dinner on the way back,

64
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:51,780
so I should be home by 5:00, at the latest.

65
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:53,513
At 5:00?

66
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:56,682
What's up? Did I forget to tell you that?

67
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:59,074
Five o'clock is like nighttime.

68
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:01,773
I guess. But that's just how it's gotta be.

69
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:03,219
'Kay, I'll be on my wa...

70
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,658
Hey, uh, what's the problem?

71
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:07,788
I changed my mind!

72
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:08,534
What?

73
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:11,144
But you were completely on board with it a second ago.

74
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:12,707
I don't want you to go! You can't go!

75
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:15,614
No way! I'm gonna be late for school!

76
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:17,903
So could you please just give me back my...

77
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,967
Ah! My left hand!

78
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,494
Rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, roll.

79
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,386
Listen, kid! Now really isn't the time for this.

80
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:27,405
Hakase.

81
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:31,411
How about I make it up to you by cooking
your favorite rice omelet for dinner?

82
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:32,774
No strings attached!

83
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:35,093
Okay then.

84
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:38,241
I'll pick up some shark castellas while I'm out shopping.

85
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:43,286
And I'll, uh... I'll throw in
an extra strawberry juice, too!

86
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:46,051
Rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, rolly, roll.

87
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:47,472
Also.

88
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:49,114
What is it?

89
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,173
Win the Akutagawa prize.

90
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:53,767
But that's impossible!

91
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:58,698
I was starting to get worried there for a second,

92
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:00,955
but thankfully, I was able to convince her.

93
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:05,197
Today marks the first step
towards me becoming a normal person!

94
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:14,692
Oh, no! It totally slipped my mind!

95
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:17,313
What am I gonna do about this key on my back?

96
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:23,376
Things we think are freakin' cool!

97
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,311
Let's do this! It's time to get to work!

98
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,961
Awesome! A motivated upperclassman!

99
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:38,751
What should I do?

100
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,150
I've been thinking all morning,
but I can't come up with anything.

101
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:44,774
And there's no way I can back out now.

102
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:48,181
Now then, I'd like to introduce our new transfer student.

103
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:49,430
Miss Shinonome?

104
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:50,331
Yes!

105
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,494
I knew it! Everyone's freaked out by my key!

106
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,058
Here.

107
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:11,029
Miss Shinonome, take this and write
your name on the chalkboard, please.

108
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:16,196
Oh, no. Now they're all staring at my back!

109
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,762
I've gotta come up with an excuse quick!

110
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,749
Uh, hi. My name's Nano Shinonome!

111
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:24,361
And, um, you see.

112
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:28,662
I, uh, I was on my way to school, and then I fell?

113
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,725
And a key got stuck to me!

114
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,079
That made it worse! How do I fix this?

115
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:39,947
Uh, that story I told you, just, uh, forget about it!

116
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:42,204
I was kidding!

117
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:45,650
Oh, no! Now it's even more suspicious!

118
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:49,488
Uh, let's see. I've gotta say something. Anything!

119
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:54,311
It's not like my big toe will fly off and
turn into a USB drive if you wind up the key,

120
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:56,583
or anything weird and robotic like that!

121
00:07:56,704 --> 00:07:58,388
I'm so dead!

122
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:08,492
♪ Tomorrow the weather will be nice! ♪

123
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:14,419
Come on, Sekiguchi.

124
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:16,979
Put the book down and let's play something.

125
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:20,983
Please, I even brought the Game
of Life for the two of us to play.

126
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:27,101
Man, this is so boring.

127
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:30,411
I guess we could try playing Go
for once, or maybe even soccer.

128
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:32,072
We are the Go+Soccer club.

129
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:34,494
Um, excuse me!

130
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,109
Hello!

131
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:39,504
Is there where I can find the Go+Soccer club?

132
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,036
Yeah?

133
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,029
Are you accepting new members right now?

134
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:48,639
Welcome to the club!

135
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:50,266
So what do I call ya, kid?

136
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:53,150
I'm Makoto Sakurai, and I'm a first year.

137
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:56,467
Well, my name's Kenzaburou Daiku, a
second year and the club president.

138
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,975
And this here's Sekiguchi, who's also a first year.

139
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,861
Come on in and have a seat!

140
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:03,345
Yeah, okay.

141
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:04,713
So, what do you wanna play?

142
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:07,017
How 'bout a round of this board game.

143
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,208
Well, uh, I was hoping that we could practice.

144
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,019
For?

145
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,701
Um, for Go+Soccer?

146
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:16,486
Don't be silly. That's a fake game I made up.

147
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:19,061
It's not like it's supposed to be a real sport.

148
00:09:19,112 --> 00:09:24,034
See, this club is pretty much just about relaxing inside
and playing a few random games every once in a while.

149
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:26,532
Kinda like a recreational thing. Know what I mean?

150
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:27,512
Sure.

151
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,219
Hm?

152
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:29,927
The thing is,

153
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,772
I was actually in a Go+Soccer club in middle school.

154
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:33,423
Uh?

155
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:37,976
And I had absolutely no idea there would
be a Go+Soccer club in high school, too.

156
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:41,059
But then I saw those banners
hanging on front of the building.

157
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:43,078
So I had to find the club and join!

158
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:47,206
And not to brag, but I was the
MVP of my middle school club!

159
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:01,563
Uh, Miss Shinonome?

160
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,892
Oh. Yes?

161
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:05,805
Oh, I just... I was just curious about something.

162
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:08,686
Uh, that thing on your back.

163
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:11,161
Uh! It's.... Uh, well.

164
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:13,087
Huh? Right. Yeah, no. Uh.

165
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,992
Um. This is... Uh!

166
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:15,667
Well, I mean. Um!

167
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:18,661
So then, if Go+Soccer is a real sport,

168
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:19,681
how do you play?

169
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:22,534
Well, it can be kinda complicated,

170
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:24,058
so it'd be better if I show you.

171
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:26,726
Here. I'll give you a little demonstration.

172
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:28,791
First off is the lifting.

173
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:35,220
After lifting, its Go stones!

174
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,703
And then you go into...

175
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:45,945
...a solo suplex!

176
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,186
And that's the avalanche <i>joseki</i> !

177
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:50,409
Three Star Point!

178
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,202
That was incredible.

179
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:59,548
I never thought this club would
go anywhere when I started it.

180
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,366
But now, it's way cooler than I ever imagined!

181
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,410
Hey, wait up!

182
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,753
Where the heck do you think you're running off to?

183
00:11:23,946 --> 00:11:25,215
Buddy! Come back!

184
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:39,820
Sakamoto! C'mere! C'mere! C'mere!

185
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:41,625
Hey! Are you crazy?! Cut that out!

186
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:46,095
If asked what it is, it is spinning.

187
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,749
That's what I told him.

188
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:20,503
Yeah, you see what I mean, bro?

189
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,433
Hey, let's go!

190
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:27,924
I told you we'd make it back early.

191
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:32,239
I can't believe I messed everything up on my first day.

192
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,854
Everyone probably thinks I'm crazy.

193
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,713
Oh, hey, Nano, did you bring your own lunch?

194
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:39,325
Uh, yeah, I did.

195
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,010
It looks really tasty.

196
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,029
So, do you pack one every day?

197
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:43,989
Yes, I do!

198
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,541
Like a normal girl.

199
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:52,777
Hm?

200
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,761
You can look at this.

201
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:00,688
Wow. It is pretty cool.

202
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:02,015
Thank you!

203
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:07,476
Oh, hells yeah. I'm right on time.

204
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,454
Uh, no. You're crazy late.

205
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,205
Lunch break is almost over already.

206
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:12,488
I'm sorry!

207
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:16,328
My shoes flew off while I was on my way
back, and they got stolen by a car and a dog,

208
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:18,034
so it was a real pain to get 'em back.

209
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:18,550
Huh?

210
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:21,117
That sounds fake, but also kinda interesting.

211
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,325
I totally wanna hear the whole story later.

212
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:26,504
But right now, I'm just glad you made it here all right.

213
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:28,975
Hang on. Where's your lunch?

214
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:29,761
Hm?

215
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,678
I ate it while I was on the way back.

216
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:33,630
Huh? What'd you have?

217
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:35,419
A twice-cooked pork lunch box.

218
00:13:35,543 --> 00:13:36,982
Whoa! How did you even...?

219
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:38,490
Ugh. Never mind.

220
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:42,972
Anyway, did you wanna eat
lunch with the three of us, Nano?

221
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,683
I'd really like to hang out with
you and get to know you better.

222
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,583
Um, okay.

223
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:52,707
Maybe I didn't freak them out
and they think I'm normal after all.

224
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:55,112
Maybe I can even make some friends!

225
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,633
Oh, hey, what's with that strange key thing on your back?

226
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,197
Uh! Uhh...

227
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:01,811
It's definitely nothing suspicious

228
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,421
if that's what you're asking! So, uh...

229
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:06,541
You aren't actually like some
weird robot girl or something, are ya?

230
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:10,539
Don't be ridiculous, Yuuko.

231
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:12,800
Sorry, she can be kinda dense.

232
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:15,550
Oh, we're almost out of time.

233
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:18,473
Sorry, Nano. Let's have lunch together tomorrow.

234
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,039
Let's see.

235
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:31,686
There's no way they're gonna believe that!

236
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:34,585
Uh...

237
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:38,017
No, seriously.

238
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,882
I climbed the entire mountain
looking for her, and by the...

239
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:42,323
Hey, Yuuko, what did you get me?

240
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:44,489
Hm? I got the <i>yakisaba</i> .

241
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:46,365
...but she's just an urban legend.

242
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:48,422
Could you repeat that one more time, please?

243
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:50,328
Uh. <i>Yakisaba</i> , right?

244
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:52,003
I said <i>yakisoba</i> !

245
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:54,604
Oh. Well...

246
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,243
I guess I heard you wrong and got you a different thing.

247
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:58,328
Yeah, that's my bad.

248
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:02,175
Don't act like it's not a big deal! I
asked for noodles and you gave me a fried fish!

249
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:03,547
But can you blame me?

250
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:05,418
Those two names sound so similar.

251
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:06,537
That's not the...

252
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:07,981
Uh.

253
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,829
Whatever. I give up.

254
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:14,157
Just give me my rice.

255
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:14,871
Hm?

256
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,095
What rice?

257
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,685
The rice that comes with the fish!

258
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:20,378
Oh. Yeah, no, it's just the fish.

259
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:22,489
How am I supposed to eat this by itself?!

260
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:26,099
Huh? But you didn't clarify when you
asked for the <i>yakisaba</i> in the first place.

261
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:27,829
I asked for <i>yakisoba</i> !

262
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:30,395
<i>Yaki</i> ! <i>Soba</i> ! They're noodles!

263
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,056
'Kay. I get it now.

264
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,677
On the bright side,

265
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:37,213
you could post this whole story on
social media and I bet it'll be hilarious.

266
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:39,088
I don't own a computer!

267
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,221
Aww. Well, it's not my fault you're
missing out on a chance to score some likes.

268
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,201
All right, fine. I'll run out again and get you your food.

269
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:46,873
I just need money.

270
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:49,471
Why should I be the one who has to pay for your mistakes?

271
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:51,423
'Cause I don't have any money left on me.

272
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:51,804
Uh?

273
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:55,241
Okay, fine. Just hurry up and come back quick.

274
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:57,971
We hardly have any time left.

275
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,386
You can count on me!

276
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,547
That's all I have.

277
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:05,100
Wha...?

278
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:07,016
One peso is all I have!

279
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:10,980
I can't believe the only money in my
wallet is this peso I kept as a souvenir.

280
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:11,853
Huh?

281
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,328
What can I do with a single peso?

282
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:15,167
One peso?

283
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:16,255
I don't know!

284
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,328
You're the one who caused this mess in the first place!

285
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,703
You should be the one to pay for it!

286
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,744
I already spent all my money when I
bought my lunch, so I don't have any more.

287
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:24,884
And what am I supposed to do about my lunch?

288
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:28,822
Well, I guess... you could eat...

289
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,975
...the mackerel.

290
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:32,533
Mackerel?! Ugh!

291
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:34,760
You're just a never-ending cycle of pissing me off!

292
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:37,353
And I'm sick of letting you copy my homework every day!

293
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:39,711
Why don't you just do it by yourself for a change?!

294
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:41,344
You idiot!

295
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:43,263
I understand that you're upset,

296
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:46,733
but the fact that I'm an idiot has absolutely
nothing to do with me getting your lunch order wrong.

297
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,078
It has everything to do with it!

298
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:49,686
Yeah? I'd like to hear why!

299
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:52,753
Only an idiot would mishear me like that!

300
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,610
Hmph.

301
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:56,775
Everyone's guilty of making a
few mistakes sometimes, ya know!

302
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:59,482
But you just have to overreact!
It's not the end of the world!

303
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:02,607
I didn't eat breakfast, so I needed that
lunch to keep me from starving all day!

304
00:17:02,644 --> 00:17:04,644
I wouldn't expect an idiot like you to understand!

305
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:05,768
I'm not an idiot!

306
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:08,161
You just said you were an idiot earlier!

307
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,161
Oh, and FYI, I'm never letting
you copy my homework ever again,

308
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:12,028
so good luck!

309
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,521
Yeah, that's fine! But this is a two-way street!

310
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:16,272
If I can't copy your homework,
then you can't copy mine either!

311
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:18,536
Why would I wanna copy your homework in the first place?

312
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,453
Your answers would be as wrong as my lunch order!

313
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:22,516
Which you never apologized for, by the way!

314
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,828
So get on your knees and apologize right now!

315
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:26,751
Fine, if that's what you really want,

316
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:28,830
I guess I should just bend over then!

317
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:30,372
How's that?

318
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,072
This good enough for you, Miss Perfect Hearing?

319
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:35,415
There's my apology! Are you happy now?! Are ya?!

320
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:38,062
What?! You call that weird pose you did a bow?

321
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:40,868
No! It wasn't a bow because I was just stretching!

322
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,953
And I'm never gonna bow to you! Fool!

323
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,516
Why can't you just admit that you messed up?

324
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:49,909
Because you pissed me off!

325
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:53,390
Also, calling me an idiot would make you a hypocrite.

326
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:55,328
Did you remember those weird doodles you drew?

327
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:56,105
'Cause I do!

328
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:59,388
Wait, the doodles were, uh...

329
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,215
You moron, those were just...

330
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:02,326
What were they?

331
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:06,292
Go ahead and tell me! I'm an idiot, so I
won't get it unless you spell it out for me!

332
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,019
Go ahead!

333
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,620
You moron!

334
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:10,561
You're a complete and utter moron!

335
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:11,978
Ugh! Who's the moron?!

336
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:15,175
Only a real moron would draw these weird
sketches and leave them out in the open!

337
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,718
Come on, I want you to taste defeat!

338
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,328
Eat it along with this <i>yakisaba</i> !

339
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:20,831
I wanted <i>yakisoba</i> !

340
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:22,287
Would you apologize already?

341
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:24,021
Get down on your knobby knees right now!

342
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:25,453
I apologized earlier!

343
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:26,714
Was that not good enough for you?

344
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,183
Apologize like you mean it,
or you're just a waste of space!

345
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:31,059
All right, fine!

346
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,060
I'll show you the ultimate bow to end all bows!

347
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:35,626
Behold its glory!

348
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:40,364
The one true bow!

349
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:43,886
Hmph. I see the bow, but I don't hear an apology!

350
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:45,753
What are you sorry for? Tell me!

351
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:48,288
Say that you're sorry for messing up my order!

352
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:50,005
Say it!

353
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:52,118
Say that you're an idiot that messes things up!

354
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,827
And you're just a useless human
being that can't get anything right!

355
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:57,329
Come on! I'm waiting! Do it already!

356
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:58,670
Are you not listening?

357
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,935
Apologize, you moron!

358
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:03,238
Worthless! Idiot! Moron!

359
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:19,433
I'm sick and tired of you constantly calling me a moron!

360
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,505
You don't even know me!

361
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,927
We've only been friends for like, what,

362
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,263
six lousy months now?

363
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,358
I could say the same about you!

364
00:19:24,383 --> 00:19:26,305
You don't understand me or my drawings!

365
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:27,488
I do understand!

366
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,887
Your drawings are so good that you might
as well become a professional manga artist!

367
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:37,371
Uh! What are you talking about? Stop being stupid, stupid.

368
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:38,055
Huh?

369
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:41,282
Well, if I'm stupid, then you're stupid, too, so suck it!

370
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,138
You just called yourself stupid.

371
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,324
I did not!

372
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:45,427
But you did!

373
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:49,878
But that stupid side of you isn't all that bad.

374
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:57,552
What are you saying? You've got the good side!

375
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:01,412
Uh. Hey, you stop it now, with your positive energy.

376
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:05,474
Well, I think you're way too
talented at drawing art things!

377
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,235
Shut up! You run too fast!

378
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:08,370
Well, you're too smart!

379
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:09,744
Well, you're optimistic!

380
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:10,898
You're a great person!

381
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:12,593
You're a super fun person!

382
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:29,053
Amazing!

383
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:45,197
Captain! I'm sorry. We tried!

384
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:47,866
Save your tears. We always have next year.

385
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,346
I'll win it! I'll win for him!

386
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:52,777
Woohoo!

387
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,900
Those were the days.

388
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,111
Hey, Nano,

389
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,170
did you have fun on your very first day?

390
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,096
I sure did.

391
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:08,634
So many things happened. It was kinda like...

392
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:10,700
Oo, like what? Tell me about it!

393
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:12,501
I love having friends!

394
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:14,600
It's the greatest feeling in the whole world!

395
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,308
That sounds amazing!

396
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:20,014
Come on. You're both getting too excited.

397
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,031
Huh? One of these?

398
00:21:28,928 --> 00:21:29,681
Hakase!

399
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,429
Please take this key off of my back!

400
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:33,728
Uh...

401
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:34,534
No way.

402
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,226
Huh? But why not?

403
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:39,510
It's having a negative impact on my life at school!

404
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:43,103
People are already starting to
suspect that I might really be a robot!

405
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:45,792
And that makes it harder for me to make friends.

406
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:48,269
You can to make friends. Your key is pretty.

407
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:49,478
I don't think it is.

408
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:51,478
But it's cute. And it's a key.

409
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:52,928
But why?

410
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,112
Just hurry up and give me my food.

411
00:23:27,148 --> 00:23:28,547
It's soccer ball here.

412
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:31,470
All I do is get kicked around, day in and day out.

413
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:34,703
Kicked and crushed until I deflate and get put to rest!

414
00:23:34,728 --> 00:23:36,301
I don't even have goals!

415
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:39,411
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 15.

416
00:23:39,436 --> 00:23:40,674
Look forward to it!
