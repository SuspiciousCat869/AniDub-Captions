1
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:07,359
I'm telling ya, Daiku Coffee is
pretty great after that remodel they did.

2
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:07,928
Really?

3
00:00:08,935 --> 00:00:10,373
See? Check it out!

4
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:11,936
You weren't kidding.

5
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:13,717
It's like a real café now.

6
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:15,740
Welcome!

7
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:20,859
I've already been here, but take as long as
you need to figure out their menu and order.

8
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,557
Oh, really? Okay.

9
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:27,725
Yeah, lemme get a white chocolate
mochaccino in a grande, please.

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,626
Huh?

11
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:30,750
And if it's not too much trouble, can I get it with

12
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:33,442
caramel sauce, hazelnut syrup,
extra whip, chocolate chips,

13
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,172
and an additional shot of espresso, affogato style?

14
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:44,753
Screw this!

15
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:46,160
Wait! Where are you going?

16
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:21,734
My previous attempts at researching
Nano Shinonome were unsuccessful.

17
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,342
But luckily, I have a plan!

18
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:26,625
Now with double the oxidizing
strength, unleashing the power of oxygen,

19
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,358
it'll make my tough problems disappear like magic!

20
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,469
It's Mr. Oxidation Plus!

21
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,319
With this, I'll finally have my chance to study that girl!

22
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:35,697
For the sake of science!

23
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:38,655
I don't even know what I wanna study first!

24
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:40,063
There are so many options.

25
00:02:40,088 --> 00:02:41,028
Maybe I'll start...

26
00:02:46,094 --> 00:02:47,385
See what you can muster!

27
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:50,531
Oh, no. What do I do?

28
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,392
Whoa. I guess we're working
with these compass things today.

29
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:56,861
It looks like you're pretty excited to get started, huh?

30
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:57,496
Uh, sure!

31
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,341
Hey, guys!

32
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:00,834
Today's class is a study hall now.

33
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:03,513
Yeah! All right!

34
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:06,500
I wonder if it's because Ms. Nakamura collapsed again.

35
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:08,554
She sure does fall over a lot, doesn't she?

36
00:03:12,162 --> 00:03:13,294
Hey, Sasahara!

37
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,072
You're supposed to be on cleaning duty!

38
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:18,440
I completed the sweeping responsibilities assigned to me.

39
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:20,951
Uh! But you left a pile of crap on the floor!

40
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,175
Hm. Did I really?

41
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,433
Go back downstairs and finish it up!

42
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:28,824
I'm curious as to how you knew that
you would be able to find me on the roof.

43
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:35,484
Don't be stupid! It's a nice day
so I came to enjoy the warm weather,

44
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:37,761
and you just happened to be up here, okay?

45
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:39,775
I see.

46
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:44,214
Sorry for troubling you.

47
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:46,749
I appreciate you always looking out for me.

48
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:52,056
Hm.

49
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:55,372
Don't you dare take it the wrong way!

50
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:57,528
It's not like I did it for you or anything!

51
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,861
Wow.

52
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:28,846
It's my day off!

53
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,582
I've got plans to meet up with Mai in the next town over.

54
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:35,260
She said that there would be free candy
involved if I came, so how could I say no?

55
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,350
Want some bread?

56
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:41,424
Oh, no thank you, it's fine. I ate earlier, so...

57
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,812
I thought dogs were like, not allowed on trains.

58
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:51,857
Here.

59
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:52,769
I'm quite all right.

60
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:56,250
Look, my stop is coming up,

61
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,103
so I better hop out of my seat
right now and get ready to go!

62
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:04,125
The next stop is Tokisadametonyamachi.

63
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,751
Good call, Mr. Announcer man!

64
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:11,959
We've now arrived at Tokisadametonyamachi...

65
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:14,166
Perfect. Get me off this thing.

66
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:17,137
So long train-riding people. Yuuko out.

67
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,082
This is fine!

68
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:28,229
I'm just taking longer for dramatic effect!

69
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:34,195
I gotta keep my cool!

70
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,024
Once I'm off the train, this'll all be over!

71
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:38,708
I'm so sorry! I wasn't looking where I was going and...

72
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:43,625
Come on! Don't sweat it!

73
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,552
I'm in the next town over, and it's
practically a different country here!

74
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,792
I'll never see any of these people ever again,

75
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,505
so it's totally fine!

76
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:55,289
Is it just me or am I being followed?

77
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,560
I'm just imagining things!

78
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:00,184
It's pro'bly 'cause I'm still flustered from earlier.

79
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:03,856
Things will be fine if I focus on
getting to the Daiku Burger place.

80
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:05,816
Where ever that is.

81
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:08,525
Well, according to the map Mai gave me...

82
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:10,474
...this thing is nothing but treble.

83
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,633
I'll just ask for directions. Yeah.

84
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:16,724
'Scuse me, but do you know how
to get to Daiku Burger from here?

85
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:22,525
Ah! Okay! That's it! You better stop following me around
or I'm gonna report you for breaking some sort of law!

86
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:23,780
I'm sure I can find one!

87
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:26,194
I heard you're looking for the Daiku Burger nearby.

88
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,039
I'm actually meeting somebody there, so I
can show you the way if you need some help.

89
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:40,552
Welcome!

90
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:42,268
Hm?

91
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:44,516
Sorry, Sis. Club ran long today.

92
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,373
You're late!

93
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:47,549
Looks like she was telling the truth.

94
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,147
Thank you for your patience!

95
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:54,819
I don't see Mai, so I guess she isn't here yet.

96
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:58,093
Aw, man.

97
00:06:58,144 --> 00:07:01,478
This has been a day, and it's barely even started!

98
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,465
Oh, well. At least I'm in a different city.

99
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,324
Yeah! I just need to look at the bright side!

100
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:10,423
I'll learn from what happened here, so
I can be prepared for when it matters!

101
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,448
That's right!

102
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,507
If I can survive this level of humiliation,

103
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:15,986
I can take on anything the world throws at me!

104
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,375
Yuuko.

105
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:18,638
Sorry I'm late.

106
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:22,864
Wait, what? Is that what I think it is?

107
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:24,222
Trick or treat.

108
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,032
I'm already in this deep. Might as well commit.

109
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:32,191
I'm all in!

110
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,736
Trick or treat to you, too.

111
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:37,547
Don't they know Halloween was last week?

112
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:42,051
"The Life of Crow"! Check it out!

113
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:05,082
I'm not sleepy enough to sleep right now.

114
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:08,031
You could always try counting sheep in your imagination.

115
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:09,365
I've heard that helps.

116
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:11,806
Okay, I'll try counting sheepies.

117
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,165
One sheepy jumping over a fen...

118
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:16,993
She fell asleep after one?

119
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:18,430
Wow, that really works!

120
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:19,604
Let me try!

121
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,743
One fluffy sheepy...

122
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,945
That sheepy never made it over.

123
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:32,483
There ya go.

124
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:35,376
Thanks a lot! You're the best, sis.

125
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:40,811
Hey, so does that Sasahara guy
teach you how to do stuff like this?

126
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:44,251
What makes you think that?! Huh?

127
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:46,998
Why would I ever go to a guy
like that to teach me anything?

128
00:08:47,023 --> 00:08:48,359
I just thought you two seemed close, so...

129
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, we're not close, like, at all!

130
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:51,692
And don't you dare think that we are! You got it?

131
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:53,348
Uh, sis, you're scaring me.

132
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:56,652
But if you two aren't close, then
why did you iron his handkerchief?

133
00:08:56,677 --> 00:09:00,230
Uh, that was just something I found on
the ground and wanted to fix up a little.

134
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:03,321
Did you wanna make it nice because it was Sasahara's?

135
00:09:03,388 --> 00:09:05,304
Yeah, right. I would never do that.

136
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,192
I felt like practicing my ironing, and the
iron just so happened to be out and ready to use

137
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:12,512
and the handkerchief I found also just
happened to be sitting underneath it.

138
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:13,679
I guess.

139
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:16,044
Yeah! It was just circumstance!

140
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:19,205
Dang. She's so transparent.

141
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:24,609
That doesn't explain why you looked so
happy ironing something you found on the street.

142
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:26,431
There's a simple explanation for that!

143
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,864
It... was because...

144
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:33,383
It's because the Earth must've entered the
Photon Belt at that moment and reality shifted.

145
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:54,030
You'll never guess what happened!

146
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:55,078
Yeah? What?

147
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:56,947
I finally talked to Oono yesterday!

148
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:58,550
Wow! Really?

149
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:04,002
Two hours by train. And one hour by bus.

150
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:08,720
I left behind the hustle of city life.

151
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:14,035
In its place, I now have the
peacefulness of S Town's countryside.

152
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,215
I searched for so long,

153
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:30,267
never thinking for a moment that I
would actually be able to find it again.

154
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,029
Yet I never wavered.

155
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:35,559
I continued my quest for that one special book.

156
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:40,414
It brought a spark of color and
excitement into my heart when I was a child.

157
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:44,250
Coloring the gray, uneventful days of my youth.

158
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:48,651
This is the place. The library.

159
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:57,762
At last... I can see it once more.

160
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,030
Fate was kind enough to bring me and this book together.

161
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:10,895
And fate has my thanks.

162
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:16,903
While trying to ignore my racing heart...

163
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,625
...slowly...

164
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,519
...I open up the cover.

165
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:35,900
Time's almost up, so finish what you can,
and don't forget to put your name on the top

166
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:37,058
before you turn it in.

167
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:42,264
Ten, nine, eight, seven.

168
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:42,849
Uh?

169
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:46,975
Six... Five...

170
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:50,717
And four... And three...

171
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:54,793
Two...

172
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,059
And one...

173
00:11:59,187 --> 00:11:59,853
Zero!

174
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:02,736
Okay. Everybody pass your papers up to the front.

175
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:19,302
You do know that Halloween is over already, right?

176
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,973
Helvetica Standard.

177
00:12:35,737 --> 00:12:39,331
Gross! I wanted to like this
coffee, but it's not very coffee-y.

178
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:42,693
You wanna run that one by me again? It's not coffee-y?

179
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:45,703
I can't really think of any
other way to explain how it tastes!

180
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:47,783
It's simply not coffee-y enough!

181
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:50,359
Here, try it and you'll see what I mean! Come on!

182
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:53,442
Okay. I don't see the big deal, it's just coffee, right?

183
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:57,299
It's not coffee-y enough.

184
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:01,044
Hop! Hop! H...!

185
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:01,941
Hop!

186
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:02,855
Hop!

187
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:03,728
Hop!

188
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:04,530
Hop!

189
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:06,559
Hop!

190
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:11,443
Hey, guys! I finally finished my latest project!

191
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:13,460
Look, Biscuit #2!

192
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:15,064
I'm Biscuit #2.

193
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,834
Oh. It's that thing.

194
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,805
Okay. Ouch.

195
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:24,051
Come on! Don't ignore him like that!

196
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,320
Um, but I've already seen this one before.

197
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,633
He's not a "one," he's a "two," and that's different!

198
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,038
He's <i>way</i> cooler than before!

199
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:32,276
Sure.

200
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:35,747
My name is Biscuit #2.

201
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:39,338
I was made by Hakase Shinonome, and I'm a biscuit robot!

202
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,335
As my name implies, I run solely on biscuits.

203
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,475
Biscuits are like fuel. They give me life.

204
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:48,986
Hakase, I require a biscuit at once!

205
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:50,176
Wha...?

206
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:52,736
But this is the last one and I wanna eat it.

207
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:53,697
Huh?

208
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:03,293
Biscuit #2's special skill is speed reading!

209
00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:04,055
Check it!

210
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:06,215
I'm finished.

211
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:06,953
Done.

212
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:07,909
Uhh...

213
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,761
Why aren't you excited, Nano?!

214
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,700
Well, it's just that I can speed read also.

215
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:14,599
Then how come you always read so slow?!

216
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:15,456
Explain that!

217
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,959
Um, I enjoy taking my time with books.

218
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:21,004
It makes me feel like I'm
reading them like a normal person!

219
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:24,031
Yawn.

220
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:26,747
Now what seems to be the problem, Biscuit #2?

221
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:30,236
Looking at all of these tiny
letters is kinda making me sleepy.

222
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:32,331
That's how a normal person reads.

223
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:40,374
Why don't you ever say how amazing I
am when I do all this awesome stuff?!

224
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,834
Oh, wow, I had no idea it would make you that upset.

225
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:44,192
I'm not upset, you are!

226
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:47,302
If it helps, I've always thought
what you do is pretty impressive.

227
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,375
I'm pretty impressive, but you don't
have to make such a big deal out of that.

228
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:54,339
I don't know if I'm the one that's making it a big deal.

229
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,109
Okay!

230
00:14:55,134 --> 00:14:57,525
So tell me more about how impressive I am!

231
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,921
You're as impressive as a mountain range!

232
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:02,744
I don't know what that means, so try again.

233
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:05,423
'Kay. You have an incredibly vast knowledge!

234
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,749
Like it's big? As big as what?

235
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:09,417
How 'bout as big as a whale?

236
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,459
Oh, I like the sound of that!

237
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:12,792
Whales are pretty big, huh?

238
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:14,073
They're the biggest!

239
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,851
Never say something is good enough.

240
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:28,407
Never say "this is good enough."

241
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:30,280
"That's good enough."

242
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,420
So, what do you plan on doing?

243
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:42,471
Play a board game!

244
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:43,920
What's your act gonna be?

245
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:47,529
I'm doing an exciting, yet
intellectually stimulating, quiz game!

246
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,109
Entertaining the princess for prize money
seems like a great way to pass the time,

247
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:52,917
and it can end up being kinda fun.

248
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:56,025
Feels nice to enjoy ourselves and
take a break from all the serious stuff.

249
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:57,246
Yeah! For sure.

250
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:01,155
I'm sure you all thought you knew where the ball was.

251
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:06,168
But in reality, it's under here.

252
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:07,969
Not bad, #66!

253
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:10,370
That's quite the hidden talent you got goin' there.

254
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:14,179
Heh. To be honest, my dream is to
become the Royal Magician someday.

255
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:16,635
I'd say that dream might become a reality soon!

256
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:17,794
I hope so!

257
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,827
All right! I'm getting pumped!

258
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:22,545
Let's get this thing started already!

259
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:24,984
Men! The time has come!

260
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:34,867
Silence!

261
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:38,029
We'll now proceed in the order
indicated by the slips you drew.

262
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:40,595
Whoever drew one, come forward.

263
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:42,127
That would be me!

264
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,363
Whoa, #66 right off the bat!

265
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:46,982
Looks like this will start with a bang.

266
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,436
The Royal Magician, huh?

267
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:51,762
Embrace your dreams, 66!

268
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:06,598
Now, go ahead and guess which cup has the...

269
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,936
I just wanted to be a Royal Magician!

270
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:12,722
Next.

271
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:16,187
Whoever drew two, step forward!

272
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,927
My turn now.

273
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:20,707
It's time to show the world what I can do!

274
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:24,229
I'll make a name for myself right here!

275
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:25,777
Hey. Who's that?

276
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:31,211
It's him, Funny 4! If anyone can do it, he can!

277
00:17:31,236 --> 00:17:34,231
I am #4, here to entertain.

278
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:44,170
Next.

279
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,982
I can't believe 4 failed.

280
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:48,324
Hey, you doin' all right?

281
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,658
I'm up next.

282
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:52,933
Huh? Wait, aren't you the quiz guy?

283
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:54,352
I'm so screwed.

284
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:57,392
But I don't have a choice. The quiz game's all I've got.

285
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:59,423
But if I make it easy enough,

286
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:02,515
maybe it'll appease the princess
and I won't fall to my doom.

287
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:03,737
It'll be fine.

288
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,683
As long as she gets the answers right...

289
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,791
I'll just give her simple, easy-to-solve questions.

290
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:13,817
Uh, #6! And I'm here to give you a quiz!

291
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:21,018
Can you name something that has the
word "bread" in it but is also inedible?

292
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:24,959
Uh, it's a multiple choice question!

293
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:28,311
Uh, The first option is breadbox
and the second option is melon bread!

294
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,779
Wow, that's easy!

295
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:30,462
Ah!

296
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:38,200
I give up.

297
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,559
That is... the correct secret answer!

298
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:48,238
My whole life, I regretted nothing.

299
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,526
Except this!

300
00:18:54,703 --> 00:18:56,120
We're so dead.

301
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:58,366
Even the quiz master was sent packing.

302
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,215
Next.

303
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:00,860
Um, I'm #7!

304
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,739
And I can recite every location
the Olympics have ever taken...

305
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,695
We'll never forget your courage, #7.

306
00:19:11,422 --> 00:19:12,453
What's the matter?

307
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,409
Is no one here capable of entertaining the princess?

308
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,199
What am I gonna do?

309
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:20,232
And here I thought a cheerleading
routine would be a good idea.

310
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:21,018
Speak for yourself!

311
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:23,081
I was splitting chopsticks with my butt cheeks!

312
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:25,031
I was gonna dance with a sushi mat!

313
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:27,190
I thought I'd be cool to shred a cabbage!

314
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:34,821
We're all doomed. Every last one of us.

315
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:39,765
Relax.

316
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,349
You didn't forget that you have me around, did ya?

317
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,360
Wait! You're the...

318
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:48,166
His harlequin antics have made him the best clown in town.

319
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,499
There's nobody funnier than this guy.

320
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,932
He's... Harlequeen 13!

321
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,762
I'll turn those frowns upside-down and
put on an unforgettable show in the process.

322
00:19:59,153 --> 00:19:59,786
Boom!

323
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,137
Hang on a sec, 13!

324
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,919
I dunno what you have planned, but it's suicide!

325
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:10,405
Do you honestly think I would dance
Swan Lake or something stupid like that?

326
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,280
Just watch and learn.

327
00:20:16,054 --> 00:20:19,929
I'll show you why they call me the Harlequeen 13...

328
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,773
Harlequeen 13!

329
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,674
Huh?! Why am I fall...?!

330
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,087
Next, #5.

331
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:31,401
Don't make me say it twice! Come on out!

332
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:33,524
Who drew that one? Who is #5?

333
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:34,358
Is that you?

334
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,000
No! That's just what it says on my hat!

335
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:36,987
Who is it then?

336
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:38,606
Not me!

337
00:20:41,421 --> 00:20:44,875
Hang on. Aren't you #5?

338
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:48,705
Yeah. He's dead.

339
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:51,144
Number 5 had better step forward immediately!

340
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:52,573
What is the hold up?

341
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:02,196
Huh?

342
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:03,577
I knew it!

343
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:06,215
Next. I don't care who it is. Just go.

344
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:08,604
What do we do now?

345
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:09,941
We're all...

346
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,960
...completely screwed!

347
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:32,576
We could have a thousand more men
and it still wouldn't make a difference!

348
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:37,058
I've had enough of this stupid game!

349
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:40,499
And I won't watch this anymore!

350
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:55,077
I'll go stand in the hallway.

351
00:23:26,997 --> 00:23:30,761
I'm a white chocolate mochaccino with
caramel sauce, hazelnut syrup, extra whip,

352
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:33,292
chocolate chips on top, and
an additional shot of espresso,

353
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:35,507
affogato style, in a grande size!

354
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,714
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 19!

355
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:39,960
Look forward to it!
