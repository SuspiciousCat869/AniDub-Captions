1
00:00:57,873 --> 00:00:59,966
Such a beautiful morning!

2
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:07,160
Guess I should go wake Hakase up.

3
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:20,343
Maybe after breakfast, I could
take a quick stroll around the block.

4
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:22,081
Hm?

5
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:26,246
Huh? Wait! Ahh!

6
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:09,625
Wait for me, you guys! <i>Selamat pagi</i> !

7
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:11,323
Oh, hey, good morning, Yuuko.

8
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:12,411
Good morning.

9
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:14,272
Great day for a walk, huh?

10
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,934
Yeah! Even though the forecast said it would rain.

11
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:19,673
I thought weather people were usually right. But maybe,

12
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:23,486
they use a numpad to pad their numbers! Ya get it?

13
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,014
Ah! What's wrong with them?

14
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,665
They're totally deadpan!

15
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:30,632
It's like they didn't even hear me!

16
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:33,006
Am I invisible? Am I a ghost?

17
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:38,977
Wait a sec. What if my joke was too
complicated for them and they didn't understand it?

18
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:43,495
Oh well, that's a shame. It was such a good one.

19
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:46,371
But maybe I should try something that's more their speed.

20
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:49,200
Not everyone can keep up with my quick wit. Okay!

21
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:52,902
Man, it's gettin' kinda hot!

22
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:57,144
The clouds are patchy, but I hope my hair isn't!

23
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:58,648
That'd be bad.

24
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:05,092
Okay! Now they're really starting to freak me out!

25
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:06,538
I'm so spooked!

26
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:08,188
But I get it.

27
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:11,685
Sudden and irregular hair loss is no laughing matter.

28
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:13,776
I gotta keep it light.

29
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:15,863
All right!

30
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,334
It's time to unleash my secret weapon!

31
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,551
You better brace yourselves!

32
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:22,681
Hey, listen!

33
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:26,254
What do you call a thousand-leg insect that asks for help?

34
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:30,943
You call it... a centiplead!

35
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:32,055
Get it?

36
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:36,313
Still nothing? How is that possible?

37
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,792
They've got the most intense
poker-faces I've ever seen in my life!

38
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:45,894
Hold up! What if they just didn't get it
'cause they didn't know I was telling jokes?

39
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:47,314
That's fine then.

40
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:50,404
It's nobody's fault! Well, at least not mine. 'Kay!

41
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,342
Hey! It's joke time!

42
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,949
What do you call a thousand-leg insect that asks for help?

43
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:59,359
You call it... a centiplead! Get it now?

44
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:05,500
That's the coldest shoulder I've ever seen.

45
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,789
I never thought that they could
be total ice queens like this.

46
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:11,029
But what if...

47
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:14,677
Maybe...

48
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:18,516
This is their way of saying that
I need to get up to their level.

49
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:24,028
You know what? I will!

50
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:25,758
Watch me.

51
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:30,193
Fine then! I accept your challenge!

52
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:32,886
I'll show you what I can do, just you wait!

53
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:35,222
You'll see! You'll all see!

54
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:36,372
All two of you!

55
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:43,841
I can do this! I'll never...

56
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,452
...give up!

57
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:50,577
So Oxygen went on a date with Potassium!

58
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:54,668
It went OK!

59
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:19,125
A fake noodle's an im-pasta!

60
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,810
A fat psychic's a four-chin teller.

61
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:29,249
Ahh... I tried to catch the fog.

62
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,479
But I mist!

63
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:49,031
So basically, you can just substitute the X
in the equation, then plug and chug the answer.

64
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:50,951
Then this Y over here...

65
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,562
President.

66
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,046
Ogi!

67
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:15,440
It's been forever since you've showed up to the club!

68
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:17,665
And I was starting to think you abandoned me!

69
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,145
How've ya been? Good?

70
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,337
Uh. Yeah.

71
00:07:20,362 --> 00:07:22,654
Well I'm really glad you came back here, so hey!

72
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:25,252
Tell ya what! Let's celebrate your return!

73
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:28,002
Come on. How 'bout some Isei-no-sei?

74
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:29,350
Nah, I'm just here to quit.

75
00:07:54,901 --> 00:08:00,828
Why do I always get the urge to clear my
throat just before a movie is about to start?

76
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:11,436
And then, I was all like...

77
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,690
Weboshii! Fe!

78
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:14,853
Have you seen Sasahara?

79
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:15,607
The goat guy?

80
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:19,516
Oh! I think I actually saw him
heading up the stairs, to the roof.

81
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:20,470
'Kay, thanks!

82
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:24,821
Looks like somebody's in a hurry. She's so smitten.

83
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:27,297
We should totes go and follow her!

84
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:30,672
Those two might be up to something spicy!

85
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:37,423
Oh!

86
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,680
In the deep blue sky, clouds drift and linger above.

87
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:43,812
It was a right hand.

88
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:45,002
Sasahara.

89
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,723
What a masterpiece!

90
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:49,412
Hey, you dork!

91
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:51,819
Do you have any freakin' idea what you've done?

92
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,822
Huh? Today's weather appeared to be quite pleasant,

93
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:57,999
so I came to the roof to write a poem about it.

94
00:08:58,024 --> 00:08:59,293
I'm talking about this!

95
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:00,772
That's right. Look here.

96
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,296
This thing ring any bells?

97
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:04,633
Huh. I do believe that's one of mine.

98
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,424
I must wonder why it's in your possession.

99
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:09,704
Don't act like you're innocent!

100
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:12,174
You were littering, so I had to pick it up for you!

101
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,676
It's certainly not trash.

102
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:16,433
And I never meant to throw it away.

103
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:18,986
I just dropped my handkerchief by acci...

104
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,679
Yeah right! That thing is yours, which means it's garbage!

105
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,237
If I dropped it, how did you know it was mine?

106
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,499
We don't even walk the same way to school.

107
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:34,421
Huh, looks like you ironed it for me, too.

108
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:44,930
Don't go assuming things! You're so stupid!

109
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:51,015
I was just wandering around lost in thought, and I
happened to find it on a street somewhere near your house.

110
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:56,315
Hm.

111
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,464
I appreciate what you did, Miss Tachibana.

112
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:05,729
Uhh...

113
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,769
You drop a lot of things in the morning,

114
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:13,732
all the time.

115
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,474
I suppose I've never realized that. Good to know.

116
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:18,760
Well, cut it out!

117
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,120
You'll cause problems for the city if you don't!

118
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:28,960
But, uh, if you keep dropping stuff,

119
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,480
I guess I can pick up after you.

120
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:32,083
Hm?

121
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,988
But don't get the wrong idea!

122
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:41,195
I'm only doing what's necessary to keep the streets clean!

123
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:56,658
Dang, that Misato never changes, does she?

124
00:10:56,683 --> 00:11:00,351
Hey um. What do I do with this?

125
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:02,623
Uh! Why'd you grab that thing?!

126
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,250
I didn't know what to do with it!

127
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:05,608
Just leave it somewhere!

128
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,775
But then what do I do?

129
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,300
Just leave it and walk away!

130
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,708
But then what do I do after that?

131
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,256
Keep on walking!

132
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:16,007
Things we think are freakin' cool!

133
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,748
Super-car bicycle!

134
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:45,502
I give up. It's all over.

135
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:48,456
Help isn't coming.

136
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:12,211
There is no God.

137
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:14,562
There is no Buddha.

138
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:30,247
Yesterday...

139
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:35,546
...was pork cutlet bowls?

140
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:46,464
Oh, well. This is fine.

141
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:09,828
Huh?

142
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:19,015
How long has it been?

143
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:34,211
Oh, whoops. I think I...

144
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,755
...dozed off there.

145
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:46,400
Yeah. It's fine.

146
00:13:57,718 --> 00:13:59,032
The word-chain game.

147
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,842
Wanna play?

148
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:07,190
Mandarin.

149
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:20,213
Oh. Sorry.

150
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,943
Say that again?

151
00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:30,900
What would that be?

152
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,180
Be.

153
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:35,227
Be...

154
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,593
Be.

155
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:52,671
Uh, can I just say any random word?

156
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:56,440
Eggplant.

157
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:20,337
Heh... Heh. Heh.

158
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,069
Eggplant!

159
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,717
She's dead!

160
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,927
Help isn't coming!

161
00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:55,184
Isn't coming!

162
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:56,858
Guess I'll die.

163
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:11,373
It looks like the club is down to just you and me again.

164
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:16,116
We'll have to disband if we can't find
a third member to join us sometime soon.

165
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,444
If only we could make the club more
appealing to recruit more members.

166
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:21,528
Question.

167
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:22,025
Huh?

168
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,123
What do we even do in this club?

169
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:25,765
Oh, right!

170
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,698
That's what we have to figure
out to make us more appealing!

171
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,567
We kinda don't do anything.

172
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:37,087
On your mark...

173
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:39,337
Get set...

174
00:16:40,496 --> 00:16:41,022
Go!

175
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,503
Helvetica Standard.

176
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,034
Hey! Cut it out, dude!

177
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:52,937
Let go of my jersey!

178
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,034
Come on, bro, just relax!

179
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,488
Lemme take it off for you!

180
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:57,930
I can't do that, dude!

181
00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:01,192
I didn't score at all today! Not a single point!

182
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:05,428
It's fine, bro! It's not like you'll need
this old uniform after you retire anyway!

183
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:06,570
Just hear me out, dude!

184
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:10,425
My uniform won't be worth anything
if I'm a player that's never scored!

185
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,702
That's not true, bro!

186
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:14,673
You inspired me to play ball and that's worth it to me!

187
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,105
All right, dude, all right, fine, I'll do it!

188
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:19,505
I can take if off myself!

189
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,547
Just like, uh, let me go so I can do it!

190
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:24,050
Uhh...

191
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:27,023
All right, ya got me.

192
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:29,523
Psych!

193
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,832
Hey uh, sorry, bro.

194
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:48,888
Listen up!

195
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:52,334
I'm gonna remind you again that
you need to respect your elders.

196
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:53,428
'Kay...

197
00:17:57,384 --> 00:18:00,350
As always, she can be such a pawful.

198
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:02,485
Hm? Oh!

199
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:25,466
Oh, man, this is too fun!

200
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:27,172
C'mere tail!

201
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:40,244
At first, I wanted to make a sport that
captured the best parts of Go and Soccer.

202
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:43,071
So... That's why I made a club for it.

203
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,613
But...

204
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:49,710
I got nothin'.

205
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,975
Draw a boomerang shape.

206
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:59,216
Then a triangle shape, then a rectangle shape.

207
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,375
Hakase! It's time to go to bed!

208
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:02,487
'Kay!

209
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:07,540
You weren't just eating snacks were you?

210
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:09,310
I didn't eat any snacks.

211
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,090
Why are you looking to the side?

212
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:13,267
I'll look the other way to even it out.

213
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,624
That doesn't make sense.

214
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:16,019
Ah-ha! See!

215
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,653
Why are you snacking after I told you not to?

216
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:22,175
I, uh, wasn't the one who ate those snacks!

217
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,281
If you didn't eat them, why do
you have crumbs all over your face?

218
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:32,211
I think I've caught a cold.

219
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:34,102
Enough! I'm not playing around!

220
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:36,542
When I say no, it means no! And you're not listening!

221
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:37,534
Not one bit!

222
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,494
It's not my fault!

223
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:41,281
Sakamoto forced me to eat all of the yummy snacks!

224
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,986
He's got a little snot bubble. That's gross.

225
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,764
Don't try to change the subject!

226
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:03,710
Jeez. You need remember to brush your teeth before bed.

227
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:05,519
I already brushed 'em!

228
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:09,167
Huh? Did you brush them again after you had snacks?

229
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,918
I did. Extra good.

230
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,394
What are you so embarrassed about?

231
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:15,110
It's fine!

232
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:17,238
Brushing once a night is all I need to do!

233
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:19,845
No, it's not! You brush after you eat.

234
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:22,250
Well, did you brush after my snack?!

235
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,524
I don't have to. I didn't eat!

236
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:27,305
Uh! Then, uh...

237
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:32,056
I'm all ready to go to bed, and you're
not. Now go brush before you get cavities.

238
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,331
You're a robot, so you can't even get cavities!

239
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,548
Ah! Wait, uh!

240
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:47,493
I mean, um, that I just, uh.
Maybe you can get a tiny cavity.

241
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:50,116
Can I really?

242
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:51,313
Uh, yeah sure.

243
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:53,079
Uhh! You're lying.

244
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:55,836
Oh! But you can still get other grody stuff, like rust!

245
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:57,803
I'll rust.

246
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,189
Okay, uh!

247
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:01,675
I'll add a feature that lets you get cavities!

248
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:07,427
I promise! It'll be the best feature ever!

249
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:10,327
Do you really swear?

250
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,513
You can count on me!

251
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:20,442
Come on, Nano!

252
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:22,230
Let's go and brush our teeth again!

253
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,271
Okay. But you know I don't have to, right?

254
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:26,082
Whoa! It's already ten o'clock!

255
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:27,002
It sure is.

256
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:28,219
Today was a blast!

257
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,685
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,214
I had so much fun!

259
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:11,123
Man.

260
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:15,263
I wish Sasahara would just take things seriously for once.

261
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,149
We're a double-yolk egg! Like twins!

262
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,290
Twinning!

263
00:23:30,382 --> 00:23:32,185
Ow! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

264
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:33,486
Hot! It's hot!

265
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:37,150
Th-The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 9!

266
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:39,611
Ouch! Look forward to... Ah, ah, hot!
