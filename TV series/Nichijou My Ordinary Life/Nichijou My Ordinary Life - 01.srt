1
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:06,036
What's up, Yuuko?

2
00:00:06,614 --> 00:00:08,677
I've got zero motivation.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,919
You serious right now?

4
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:12,161
But we like, just started a new semester.

5
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:14,036
Think of the possibilities.

6
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:17,681
I'm sure you'll find something that gets
you motivated if you get the ball rolling.

7
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:21,138
I can barely roll out of bed, let alone roll a ball.

8
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:25,180
How am I supposed to find the
motivation to be motivated, huh?

9
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:28,391
A motive for motivation. Hm...

10
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:30,715
How 'bout you just do it?!

11
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:32,007
'Kay, sure!

12
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:39,442
It must be nice to be a complete idiot.

13
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:50,352
Hakase! It's about time to get out of bed!

14
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:56,436
There we go.

15
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,261
Morning.

16
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,787
Whatcha got there?

17
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:09,744
It's a fish that I'm grilling
up for this morning's breakfast.

18
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:12,072
Fish? But I want a rice omelet!

19
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:14,662
But you had that for breakfast yesterday.

20
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:18,004
Besides, fish are packed with
essential vitamins and minerals.

21
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:22,274
If you wanna grow up to be big and
strong, you need to have a balanced diet.

22
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,281
Uh?

23
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:30,583
Um. Excuse me, do you mind returning our breakfast?

24
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,975
Uh. No, this isn't what it looks like!

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,636
It's definitely not a robotic component or anything!

26
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:40,617
You see... It's a...

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,252
He's gone!

28
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:47,877
Come back you crazy cat!

29
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,744
Okay, bye...

30
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:54,824
Come to think of it,

31
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:57,735
what if the cat needs that food more than we do?

32
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:05,831
Ahh! Look out!

33
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:09,693
Hi, good to see ya, Mio! <i>Selamat pagi</i> !

34
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:12,327
Oh, hi, Yuuko. It's nice to see you too.

35
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:16,286
You think it's okay if I don't have
my student ID? 'Cause I forgot it today.

36
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,719
Wait, did she miss that I greeted her in Malay?

37
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:21,827
I hope some upperclassman doesn't notice and call me out.

38
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:26,818
If one does, you can just say you're an upperclassman
too, and they'll have no idea without your ID.

39
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:29,564
That won't solve anything. I guarantee you.

40
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,177
That sounded like thunder, but the sky's so clear.

41
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:35,188
It might start pouring any second!

42
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:37,286
It'd suck if we got rained on outta nowhere!

43
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,714
It's raining wooden dolls.

44
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:44,023
Whoa! Are you all right?

45
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,916
How does that fall from the sky?

46
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:49,927
Yeah, that's super weird. I
wonder where it even came from.

47
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:51,969
I'm just as confused as you are.

48
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:56,619
But don't worry, I bet something as crazy as
this only happens once in a girl's lifetime.

49
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:59,286
You know. It's like a freak accident. Right?

50
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:00,577
Yeah, totally.

51
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:02,656
That must mean I'm lucky.

52
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:07,786
I'm not lucky at all.

53
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:09,560
You doin' okay down there?

54
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,666
It happened again with a red cow this time.

55
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:15,113
What does it mean?

56
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:17,452
Y'know, maybe it's not about luck at all.

57
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:20,119
Sometimes, bad things happen, but it could be worse.

58
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:23,226
At least I wasn't hit by something
that's disgusting like raw meat.

59
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:26,066
So, as long as that doesn't
happen, it's really not that ba..

60
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:38,787
It's raw salmon!

61
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:44,911
Good morning!

62
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,001
Oh, heyo!

63
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:51,619
Morning!

64
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:53,286
Good morning to you.

65
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,552
Oh, hey. Good morning, Mai.

66
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:00,119
<i>Selamat pagi</i> !

67
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,499
Good morning.

68
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:03,791
That looks interesting, whatcha got there?

69
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,864
This is a real estate magazine.

70
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,927
Wha--? Are you lookin' to buy a house?

71
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,399
Undecided.

72
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:13,761
My awesome, unique greeting gets ignored yet again.

73
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:18,663
Oh, well. I guess I have no choice but
to put this short-lived phrase to rest.

74
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:19,579
Yuuko.

75
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:20,411
Huh?

76
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:22,889
<i>Selamat malam.</i>

77
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,202
Silly Mai! It's <i>"selamat pagi"</i> ! Ha!

78
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:34,797
What language are they speaking?

79
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:38,563
It's, uh, time for homeroom. Take your seats.

80
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:44,344
Okay, when I arrived at school today,

81
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,638
I found this inside my shoe locker.

82
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:49,480
Now, did one of you kids put it in there?

83
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:56,594
Um, well, uh. If you did do it, that's okay.

84
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,952
I would just appreciate if you'd own up to it.

85
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:01,094
Who do you think could've pulled that kind of prank?

86
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,463
It's pretty bonkers, huh?

87
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,136
How am I supposed to know?

88
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:07,636
I bet you it was a student that has
like, a big crush on her or something.

89
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,886
But who would give their crush a Buddha statue?

90
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:14,219
Although, I can definitely understand the feeling
of wanting to give the person you like a gift,

91
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:16,049
so I can't really blame 'em.

92
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:20,705
Oh, that's right. It's because you have a
crush on that upperclassman Koujirou Sasahara.

93
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:22,960
Ah! Don't say it out loud!

94
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:29,231
Where am I? How did I get here?

95
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:34,863
Huh?

96
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:40,439
I have to get home.

97
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:47,177
Hakase is probably worried sick.

98
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:52,554
Plus, I left the grill on, and that's a hazard.

99
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:05,434
Oh, no. I can't get down!

100
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,924
Wait. My chopsticks are gone.

101
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,979
And I'm missing a slipper!

102
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:13,712
What do I do?

103
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,486
My hand's gone, too!

104
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:21,661
Ohh! Now it'll be obvious that I'm a robot!

105
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,165
Ready?

106
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,116
Thanks for the meal.

107
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,427
Hm? Hurry.

108
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:55,517
You gotta finish eating your
food before fifth period starts.

109
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,702
Wait, all you've got left is one sausage.

110
00:09:00,702 --> 00:09:05,267
This is all part of my plan to save the
very best of my lunch for the grand finale.

111
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,334
That way, I'm for sure gonna
walk away from my meal satisfied.

112
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:09,748
Hmm...

113
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:14,150
And now, without further ado,
it's gonna go down the hatch!

114
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:45,645
Oh!

115
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:52,280
It slipped through!

116
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,677
I got it!

117
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:07,494
It's done for!

118
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,406
Over my dead body!

119
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:11,757
One... two...

120
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,125
three... four...

121
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:17,017
five!

122
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,218
It's okay!

123
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:29,369
Uh! It's totally not!

124
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,552
Ha, ha! Aw, chill out Mio!

125
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,927
Haven't you ever heard of the five-second rule?

126
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:37,809
Haven't you heard of E. coli?! That is 100% gross!

127
00:10:37,922 --> 00:10:39,016
Uh!

128
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:45,744
Tasty!

129
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,862
She... is such... a moron...

130
00:10:57,077 --> 00:11:00,427
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

131
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,972
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and a one, two, three! ♪

132
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:06,100
Aw...

133
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,311
Okay!

134
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:24,969
Good morning, students.

135
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:27,536
I hope you're having a wonderful day today.

136
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:31,052
Now that spring has sprung, it's
time to welcome a new school year.

137
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:33,998
But despite the change of seasons, the cold will stay.

138
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:37,953
Though I'm sure the cold will come to
a head for me before it does for you.

139
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:44,577
So please take care that you don't catch a cold.

140
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:45,728
After all,

141
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:48,880
it is my duty as principal to watch over you students.

142
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:53,750
But if you neglect to take my advice to
heart, and you do catch a cold, well...

143
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:58,499
I'd say you might have forgotten to
respect your principal's principles.

144
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:05,189
Can I ask you something, Mio?

145
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:07,969
Make it quick. We'll get in
trouble if they catch us talking.

146
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,764
Do you think the principal knows that none
of his jokes are funny to anyone but himself?

147
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,310
It's pretty obvious, right?

148
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:16,228
You'd think he would take the
hint when no one laughs, like ever,

149
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:19,108
but it seems like he's just in his
own little world most of the time.

150
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:21,661
Hm. I never really thought about it.

151
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:22,558
But wait!

152
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,344
What if he does know he's not funny,

153
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:28,786
and he's just trying to teach the younger,
lazier generation the importance of persistence?

154
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:29,817
Possibly.

155
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:34,784
If that's the case, then the principal
might actually be some manipulative mastermind!

156
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:40,544
Mai?

157
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,209
What's her deal?

158
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:46,520
Don't tell me she's laughing at those terrible jokes!

159
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,496
Huh?!

160
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:50,494
I've never seen Mai crack up this much before!

161
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,494
She's totally busting her gut!

162
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,616
All right! Here's my chance!

163
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:55,664
Hey, Mai!

164
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:05,474
I can't do it! I want to tell my own lame
joke, but it'll be too embarrassing for me!

165
00:13:06,344 --> 00:13:07,177
Yuuko?

166
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:09,023
Huh?

167
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,870
Sorry. Never mind. It's nothing.

168
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,437
I think... I won't say anything.

169
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:24,286
I'll just leave it where it is.

170
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:38,190
Next on the docket, we have a necessary
message from the student counselor, Ms. Sakurai.

171
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:41,298
You can step up to the microphone whenever you're ready.

172
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,095
Umm, I think it's your turn.

173
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:45,394
It is?!

174
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:47,295
Excuse me!

175
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,742
I'm Ms. Sakurai, your student counselor.

176
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:53,761
But umm. I-I guess you knew that already.

177
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:57,694
Oh man. It's so nerve-wracking
to be in front of such a big crowd.

178
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:01,052
No, I've got to pull it together!

179
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:04,687
It's my job to be a model
teacher for my students, and myself!

180
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,397
I'm going to go ahead and say what needs to be said!

181
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:13,243
All right! I've noticed that there have
been some goats on the school grounds recently.

182
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:17,788
Please try your best to not bring any
goats to school with you if you can help it.

183
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:19,340
Goats, you say?

184
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:21,802
And what is so bad about goats?

185
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:22,994
Huh?

186
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,869
I've read the school policies.

187
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:29,536
Nowhere does it say that we can't bring a goat to class!

188
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:32,994
Um, well. That's uh...

189
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:36,286
Yo, Mio. Was that Koujirou screaming about goats?

190
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:39,205
What? Goats, where?

191
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:41,373
Mm... Then.

192
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:44,365
I guess goats are perfectly fine!

193
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:45,670
Hmph.

194
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,594
Like hell your goats are fine!
You don't get to make that call!

195
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:55,344
Even if it's not in the school's rules, it's still weird!

196
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:58,337
Duly noted. But consider this, Misato.

197
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,786
Why should someone like me be forced
to hobble to school with my own two legs?

198
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,811
I am the eldest son of the Sasahara household, you know.

199
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,136
I don't give a damn about your Sasahara household!

200
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,261
You guys are a buncha normal farmers!

201
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:14,327
Regardless, that does not change the
fact that I am the eldest son of the family.

202
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:15,441
For real?

203
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:18,571
Koujirou comes from a family of ordinary farmers?

204
00:15:18,608 --> 00:15:20,943
And here I thought he was the greatest of all time.

205
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:26,005
That means the white goat I saw at the
bike rack must have belonged to Koujirou.

206
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:31,225
I can just imagine him riding majestically
atop that beautiful steed and whisking me away.

207
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,921
A happy new year to me!

208
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,721
I do.

209
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:48,842
Whoa!

210
00:15:49,393 --> 00:15:50,145
Uh!

211
00:15:54,744 --> 00:16:01,753
Uh. Also, make sure you don't use your cellphones
while riding your bikes. It's extremely dangerous!

212
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,334
And now finally...

213
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:08,025
I discovered this Buddha statue that
someone put in my shoe locker this morning.

214
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,517
I just wanted to point out that
pranks like these are unacceptable!

215
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,735
Excuse us! Coming through!

216
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,036
A Buddha statue...

217
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:18,559
Ah! Gosh, Mai! Don't stop like that without warning!

218
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:26,247
There it is again. So this is what déjà vu feels like.

219
00:16:26,412 --> 00:16:28,791
Uh. Who put this inside my locker?

220
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:31,507
I promise I won't be angry if you own up to it.

221
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,272
We can stand here all day until
someone raises their hand and confesses.

222
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:38,219
Who actually did it?

223
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:39,628
Just say it was you.

224
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:41,168
Uhh...

225
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:42,399
Uh?

226
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:50,543
Uh. Well, I heard it was your birthday through
the grapevine, so I wanted to get you something.

227
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:57,144
Ah, I guess I know now that a Buddha
statue doesn't exactly make a great gift.

228
00:16:57,672 --> 00:17:02,920
So. It seems as though one thought
it would be good to give a present.

229
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:05,876
But a Buddha statue is not so pleasant.

230
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:08,029
Sorry.

231
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,752
That concludes today's assembly.

232
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,362
Thank you for your words, and
we'll all miss you dearly, Principal.

233
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,029
Vice Principal!

234
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:31,539
I dunno about you, but staring at this fire
alarm button makes me wanna push it real bad.

235
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:32,786
Oh yeah, I get that.

236
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,327
Why don't you just push it?

237
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,869
I did one time and absolutely nothing happened.

238
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:40,619
Oh! Really?

239
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,670
A fire?

240
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:43,814
Seriously?

241
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,452
What do we do? Book it?

242
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:48,574
Let's all scramble out of here as fast as we can!

243
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,219
What do you think you're doing?

244
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,386
Quit pushing me!

245
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:53,369
You shoved me first, man!

246
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:54,452
Are you kidding me?

247
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,411
You're really starting to tick me off!

248
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:57,619
Cut it out!

249
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,911
Someone could die if you start a fight now!

250
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,286
Let's just get out of here.

251
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:01,593
You can duke it out later!

252
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:07,249
Helvetica Standard.

253
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:12,577
Excuse me.

254
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:13,664
Hey.

255
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:17,302
Sorry, but what does "being insensitive" mean?

256
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:18,445
Excuse me!

257
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:21,347
Just what does "insensitive" mean?

258
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:22,744
Do you have a moment?

259
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:25,056
Can you explain what insensitive means?

260
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:26,827
Somebody help me!

261
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:27,702
Hey!

262
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:29,244
Oh! Hi, Captain!

263
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,478
Can you tell me what's insensitive?

264
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,350
Simple. You are.

265
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:39,904
Attention. Could Koujirou Sasahara of Class 2-P

266
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:43,536
please report to Tomioka in the faculty room immediately.

267
00:18:45,382 --> 00:18:48,359
We understand that it's not against the school rules.

268
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:51,330
But really, a goat? Just, why?

269
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:53,014
I'll ask nicely.

270
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,307
Could you please stop riding a goat to school everyday?

271
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:57,748
Why don't you ride a bike?

272
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,036
Mister...

273
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,060
Tomioka.

274
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:01,161
Tomioka.

275
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:02,697
Don't forget the mister.

276
00:19:02,994 --> 00:19:09,045
All right, Mister, I'd actually prefer it if you'd
call him "Koujirou Sasahara," and not simply "goat."

277
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,130
Think I'm gonna stick with "goat."

278
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:22,695
My name is Nano Shinonome.

279
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,577
I'm just your average robot,

280
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:27,486
and I live at home with my creator, Hakase.

281
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:34,565
Hakase spends every single day inside the
house doing all sorts of really important research.

282
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:39,587
And I spend those days by helping
her out in any way that I can.

283
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:44,607
Hakase! I brought you that warm milk you asked for...

284
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:49,386
I don't have any special features,

285
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:52,128
but apparently I'm a robot that can feel pain.

286
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:54,364
Nano? What's the matter?

287
00:19:54,787 --> 00:19:58,114
Hakase! I stubbed my toe! The little one!

288
00:19:58,174 --> 00:19:59,757
No!

289
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:03,366
But pinky is the littlest piggy of them all!

290
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:09,134
There, I fixed it. You should feel better now.

291
00:20:10,238 --> 00:20:14,290
I don't have any special features,
but apparently my pinky toe comes off?

292
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,618
Could you tell me what the key on my back's for?

293
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:26,061
Oh? Have I never wound it up for you?

294
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:27,344
No, you haven't.

295
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,869
But it spins on its own sometimes.

296
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,827
Give it a little twisty-twist, and...

297
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,565
What's going on?

298
00:20:39,994 --> 00:20:41,144
I take it back.

299
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:43,446
I have all sorts of special features.

300
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:45,290
Ya see? Pretty cool, huh?

301
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:46,852
So, that's it?

302
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:49,302
That's the only reason I have a key on my back?

303
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:50,273
That's right!

304
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:53,969
It really has no additional features other than that?

305
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:54,991
You got it!

306
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:56,200
Can you take it off?

307
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:56,930
No!

308
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,036
I wanna leave it on 'cause it looks cute.

309
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,969
But I'd really like it if you took it off.

310
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,744
Aww, it's so cute though.

311
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:07,494
I just wish that I could be more like a normal human.

312
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:10,427
I'd like to sit in a chair without having to twist weird.

313
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:13,036
And be able to roll over in bed when I sleep.

314
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:15,452
With this thing,

315
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:17,591
I'll never be able to go to school.

316
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,947
It would have been better if
you never made me a humanoid robot.

317
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
Nano...

318
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:24,966
Huh?

319
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:27,880
Uhh!

320
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:31,219
Uh. I'm just kidding. 'Kay? It's a joke.

321
00:21:31,244 --> 00:21:33,827
Stop crying. Please! I'm sorry!

322
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:35,041
Fine, take it!

323
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,077
Huh?

324
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:37,854
Take the Akutagawa Prize!

325
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:39,188
Wait, what?!

326
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:40,238
You heard me!

327
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:41,386
Akutagawa prize! You should go get it!

328
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:43,546
This is my ordinary life.

329
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:51,956
So, uh. Where am I?

330
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:29,761
Hello there! This is Nano's big toe speaking!

331
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:33,040
Fun fact: My storage capacity is one gigabyte.

332
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,432
That's not a whole lot nowadays, is it?

333
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:39,420
Next time on <i>My Ordinary Life</i> : It's the second episode!

334
00:23:39,494 --> 00:23:40,769
Look forward to it!
