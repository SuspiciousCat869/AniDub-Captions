1
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:07,678
Was Sasahara was actually asleep in there?

2
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,036
Uh, yeah, totally.

3
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:11,485
Didn't you see him? He was 100 percent taking a nap.

4
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:13,682
Ooh, you should go wake him up, Misato.

5
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:14,463
Huh?

6
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:18,449
He probably isn't aware that we're changing
classrooms right now, so you should let him know.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,397
That's not my responsibility!

8
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:21,551
Why should I care?

9
00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:23,096
Come on, don't be like that.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,501
He's your friend, isn't he?

11
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:25,803
It's not a big deal.

12
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:30,160
And besides, you'll probably have the
room to yourselves if you're feelin' feisty.

13
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,323
Huh? What? No way!

14
00:00:32,353 --> 00:00:33,894
Well, have fun, you two!

15
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:35,462
Tell us the details later!

16
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:36,428
No! You...!

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,798
Why do I have to be stuck with babysitting that idiot?

18
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:42,687
Just because we've known each other forever.

19
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:45,290
You should just confess your feelings to him already!

20
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:28,527
Sasahara!

21
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,944
We're changing classrooms, so would you get up?

22
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,797
We gotta go!

23
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:34,205
Uh... it's you.

24
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:36,255
Miss Tachibana.

25
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:40,412
Just go and grab whatever you need for the next class.

26
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,785
Of course.

27
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:45,043
I only intended to rest my eyes for a moment,

28
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:47,855
but it seems as though I must have been lulled to sleep.

29
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:49,743
I don't give a crap about any of that!

30
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,487
Get your stuff before people get the wrong idea.

31
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,404
Wrong idea? How so?

32
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:56,619
Just forget it!

33
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:02,482
I'm so sorry!

34
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:04,112
I mean, I'm not sorry for doing it,

35
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:05,596
I'm sorry it that happened, I mean.

36
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,278
Who puts their glasses on a desk anyway?

37
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:09,586
Misato Tachibana.

38
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:11,723
Look. Your hand is bleeding.

39
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:17,966
You don't have to act all nice, y'know.

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,452
I broke your glasses,

41
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:21,611
so you have every right to be angry with me.

42
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,718
Why?

43
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:25,639
Glasses feel no pain when they're broken.

44
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,945
You're the one who's hurting.

45
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:31,058
Yeah, no duh!

46
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:32,216
My hand's bleeding!

47
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:33,719
That much is obvious!

48
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:37,462
Fortunately for us, one of the
lenses is still in its rightful place.

49
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:43,075
As long as the lens hangs on to the glasses, so will I.

50
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,133
It's like the glasses somehow knew...

51
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:58,090
...and let go.

52
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:04,099
Follow me.

53
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:05,214
You really don't...

54
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:05,927
I know!

55
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,357
But I have to take responsibility.

56
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:09,951
It's my fault!

57
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:12,515
You get what I'm saying?

58
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,323
It was totally lame, right?

59
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:15,605
That's why, uh...

60
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:19,950
Yeah, totally.

61
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:21,223
And then I said... uh...

62
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:26,376
Oh, man, everyone is staring!

63
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:27,941
I could die. I'm dying!

64
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:29,509
I am literally dead right now.

65
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:30,892
But I have to do this.

66
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:34,221
Sasahara's probably blind without
his glasses, so I have to be his eyes.

67
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:36,061
It's fine. No big deal.

68
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:38,146
His glasses are broken, so this isn't weird, right?

69
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:40,061
Totally, 100 percent understandable.

70
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:42,676
Yeah! I'm helping out a person in need!

71
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:43,870
Like a seeing-eye dog.

72
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,159
An embarrassed, dying, seeing-eye dog.

73
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:47,903
Excuse me, Miss Tachibana.

74
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:48,834
Uh, yeah?

75
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:53,018
Before we reach the classroom, I'd
like to take a visit to the facilities.

76
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:55,195
Wait! So... the bathroom?

77
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:56,639
The boy's bathroom?

78
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:57,665
Naturally.

79
00:04:58,249 --> 00:04:59,985
This'll be harder than I thought!

80
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:03,292
But I can't back down now.

81
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:04,865
I have to do this for him.

82
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:05,799
For us!

83
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:09,766
Fine! I'll go in with you!

84
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,573
But why?

85
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:12,512
Because your glasses are broken, aren't they?

86
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:13,217
They are.

87
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:15,440
Come on! Don't make me spell it out for you!

88
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:16,834
Your glasses are broken!

89
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:20,490
So, uh... since it was my fault,
I'm gonna be your eyes for today.

90
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:23,091
Oh. These are just for style.

91
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:26,768
Don't get the wrong idea!

92
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,056
I wasn't holding your arm because I wanted to or anything!

93
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:32,417
There was a bug on your sleeve and I
was just trying to squish it very slowly.

94
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:34,794
What beautiful weather today.

95
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,167
Uh...

96
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:51,629
Huh?

97
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:57,041
Uh...! So, uh,

98
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,247
I know this spicy curry place in Kamakura!

99
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,565
Oh! That's nice!

100
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,108
How spicy do you like your food, Ms. Sakurai?

101
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:04,974
Oh? Well, uh...

102
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:07,058
No spice at all.

103
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:08,480
Same! What a coincidence!

104
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:16,493
Uh...

105
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:20,637
So, um... our next class.

106
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:21,945
We're going to be late.

107
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,815
We're going to be late.

108
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:25,317
Wait, Mio!

109
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:27,487
The classroom is in the other direction!

110
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,669
The other direction.

111
00:06:28,977 --> 00:06:30,556
Try to think of it this way!

112
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:33,482
Life is just like baseball, and
sometimes you end up striking out!

113
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:35,098
But you can't stop playing the game!

114
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,120
Sometimes you end up striking out.

115
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:38,560
Just like baseball.

116
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:40,146
Let's not jump to conclusions!

117
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:42,130
We don't even know if those
two are actually a thing or not!

118
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:43,276
Back me up on this, Nano!

119
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:44,743
Huh? Oh. Yeah!

120
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:45,723
What she said!

121
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:47,038
But, Koujirou...

122
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:49,770
He couldn't.

123
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,187
He wouldn't.

124
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:53,976
He did.

125
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:56,810
Anyway, we should get going. Come on, Mio.

126
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,809
Mio!

127
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,524
Come back!

128
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:01,862
Nano! You get to class and buy us some time!

129
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,830
I'll take care of her!

130
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,800
Right!

131
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,125
Mio, wait!

132
00:07:10,613 --> 00:07:12,125
Mio! That's a window!

133
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:14,607
Mio!

134
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,351
Mio!

135
00:07:16,622 --> 00:07:17,984
Mio, wait!

136
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:23,665
Mio!

137
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:31,487
Mi-oh!

138
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:33,735
Mio!

139
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:34,490
Huh?

140
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:35,545
Mio!

141
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:43,458
Uh! Mio?

142
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:47,292
Hey! Mio?

143
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:51,227
Mio! Mio!

144
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,210
Say cheese!

145
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:53,085
Wait, Mio!

146
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:54,339
Mio!

147
00:07:58,743 --> 00:07:59,429
Mio!

148
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:02,410
This is my stop.

149
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:07,075
Mio!

150
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,402
Mio! Watch out!

151
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:12,456
Look, Mio!

152
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,095
Mio!

153
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:20,903
Mio!

154
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:22,008
Mio, stop!

155
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,893
Mio! Mio!

156
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,415
Maa fell in the river!

157
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,056
Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio! Mio!

158
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:41,166
Dammit all!

159
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:43,023
Mi-o-my!

160
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:54,346
<i>Dios Mio</i> !

161
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:18,966
Thank you.

162
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:23,065
Hey, Mio!

163
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:25,168
I thought I lost you back there!

164
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:37,813
I'm fine.

165
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:41,252
I just need to breathe.

166
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:42,755
Well, that's good.

167
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,611
Where is he?

168
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:44,991
This way!

169
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:46,765
There you are, Maa!

170
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:47,720
Osamu!

171
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:48,995
Thank goodness you're safe!

172
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:49,867
You all right?

173
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:51,880
Yeah, I think so.

174
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:55,168
If this lady didn't save me, I'd be in big trouble.

175
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:57,087
Wait! You again?

176
00:09:57,852 --> 00:09:58,842
From before!

177
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:04,259
I hope the two of you are aware that interfering
with official police business is a criminal offense!

178
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:05,852
But I didn't do anything!

179
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,562
Under normal circumstances, I would
report this directly to your school.

180
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:15,501
But in this case, I suppose I
can overlook it just this once.

181
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:16,514
Do you mean it?

182
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:18,230
Ah, there you are!

183
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:22,257
I've finally caught up to you and your little pigtails.

184
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:25,395
I saw your shadow boxing.

185
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,941
And you have a true gift.

186
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:30,872
Uh...

187
00:10:32,374 --> 00:10:33,588
What about it?

188
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:36,372
With your talents...

189
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:40,266
...you could rule the boxing world.

190
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,565
Help! Help! He stole my bag!

191
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,695
Don't think badly of me!

192
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,791
Well! Duty calls!

193
00:10:46,124 --> 00:10:49,315
Come to the station later and you'll
get a commendation for your help!

194
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,660
Here, lady. This is for you.

195
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:53,433
Thanks.

196
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,187
Osamu, that okay?

197
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:57,738
Yeah!

198
00:10:57,861 --> 00:11:00,845
Whenever you're ready, please visit me at my gym,

199
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,046
and then your journey can begin.

200
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:06,665
Oh, no! Mio, you lost your English
textbook during all that madness!

201
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:14,055
Mio?

202
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,817
Rejected before I could confess.

203
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:19,717
Rescued a child while running from my own troubles.

204
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,353
Received an award and a kite.

205
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:24,418
Got scouted by a boxing coach.

206
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:27,247
In a way, life really is just like baseball.

207
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:29,278
I have to keep playing the game.

208
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:29,687
Huh?

209
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,827
Isn't that what you told me before?

210
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:33,630
Who knows what'll happen.

211
00:11:34,162 --> 00:11:35,239
So keep going.

212
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:36,479
That right?

213
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:38,649
Huh? What's right?

214
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:40,729
You get it.

215
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,237
I just realized

216
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:56,930
that daydreaming is totally free.

217
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:09,285
Damn. I completely lost track of her.

218
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,493
I was hot on her trail when
she was running around the school,

219
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:15,757
but I took my eyes off her for a moment,

220
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:17,617
and she suddenly slipped away!

221
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:18,672
Huh?

222
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:21,760
A remarkable and surprising feature!

223
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:24,043
I must know more about your advanced functionalities,

224
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,286
Nano Shinonome!

225
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,904
Now then, I've traveled this far.

226
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,084
Perhaps I should try locating her home.

227
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,750
Hmm, on second thought, it
might be best to tread carefully.

228
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,310
I'll continue my pursuit for knowledge
tomorrow and retreat for the time being.

229
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,636
It's hiding in plain sight!

230
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:46,703
I've discovered this house completely by chance. Finally!

231
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:49,248
My first stroke of luck since I started this mission!

232
00:12:49,513 --> 00:12:51,513
No, this more than mere luck!

233
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:54,195
This is more like, um, what's the word...

234
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,280
It's like, uh... I can't think of it!

235
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:58,314
I'm too caught up in the thrill of the moment!

236
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:01,593
To think, the genius who built
her could be in that very building!

237
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,863
Nano's blueprints could be mine to study her every detail!

238
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:05,945
For science!

239
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:07,813
What is this strange pounding in my chest?

240
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,007
It's like a hootenanny!

241
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:13,185
Like former professional wrestler cowboy
Bill Watts is beating on my heart himself!

242
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,558
If this is indeed the house of her creator,

243
00:13:15,637 --> 00:13:18,053
then there's no telling what sort of traps there may be.

244
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:19,770
If I am to infiltrate this place,

245
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,595
I must be extremely cautious and
pay close attention to my surroundings.

246
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,653
Can I help you, lady?

247
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,671
I'm compromised!

248
00:13:26,366 --> 00:13:26,919
Oh, no!

249
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:29,425
I've been spotted by the home's surveillance robot!

250
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,402
The build quality looks lower than Nano's,

251
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:33,815
but he's likely made with the same advanced technology.

252
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,563
If it determines that I'm a threat,
he'll undoubtedly dispose of me!

253
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:37,751
I have no choice!

254
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:39,546
I must show that I mean no harm!

255
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,441
What are you doing on the ground?

256
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:42,687
Compromised again!

257
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:45,820
So, I heard that goat of yours

258
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:48,730
carried an injured old lady to the hospital last week.

259
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:49,950
Yes, he did.

260
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:55,268
Then the reason you bring a goat is because it's a
service animal for emergency situations like that?

261
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,559
Silly.

262
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,185
Yeah. Well, I'm not the one who rides a goat.

263
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:10,042
Here you are.

264
00:14:13,027 --> 00:14:15,074
I can't believe they got the jump on me.

265
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:20,262
I was trying to infiltrate the Shinonome home, but a
warm, hospitable welcome was not what I had in mind.

266
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:22,262
However, I can see through this ruse.

267
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:23,367
I'm on to their tricks.

268
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,861
For example, this tea.

269
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:28,595
I'm certain it contains some sort of drug
that will erase my memory the moment I drink it.

270
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,642
And this room may seem ordinary,
but I'm sure I'm being watched.

271
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:34,042
What is that?

272
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,403
It has a terrifyingly concerning aura.

273
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:37,893
Such random placement.

274
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,357
And those painted-on sunglasses can't fool me!

275
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:43,007
I can't see its eyes, but I can certainly feel their gaze!

276
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:47,100
I can't make a single wrong move. It's all-seeing!

277
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:48,901
What's wrong, Ms. Nakamura?

278
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:50,669
Absolutely nothing!

279
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:51,721
My apologies!

280
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:56,355
I drank it all.

281
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,355
I'm a fool.

282
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:59,647
But if this does wipe my memory,

283
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:01,520
then I might as well make a stand!

284
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:04,094
I'll be completely honest with you.

285
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,862
Huh? Sure, go ahead.

286
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:09,297
I came to your home today to
find out everything I can about you!

287
00:15:09,496 --> 00:15:09,950
Huh?

288
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,500
Wha?

289
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:15,573
I want to see what you're really like underneath it all!

290
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:17,004
So, please!

291
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:20,016
Uh, well, I mean, you're free to like what
you like and pursue what you please, but, uh...

292
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:23,600
I appreciate it, but I just don't think
any romantic involvement between the two of us

293
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,781
would be the most appropriate thing right now!

294
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,755
You idiot! You misunderstand my words!

295
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:32,762
You can't just say things like
that to me out of nowhere, you know!

296
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,861
Ah, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to!

297
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:37,105
When I said that I wanted to
see what you're like underneath...

298
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,236
Nano?

299
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,157
Hakase!

300
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:39,942
Huh?

301
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:40,862
A child?

302
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,397
It couldn't be her child.

303
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:43,258
Of course not.

304
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:44,800
She's a robot after all!

305
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:45,745
But that garb.

306
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,158
It's that of an intellectual.

307
00:15:47,298 --> 00:15:48,756
Could she be Nano's creator?

308
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:53,149
So, this child is not the child at
all, but maybe Nano is the child? Yes?

309
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:55,677
There's no way someone so young could create Nano.

310
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,412
Hello, you can call me Hakase.

311
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:58,954
Oh, and I created Nano.

312
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:00,227
Shoulder block!

313
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:01,402
Hakase!

314
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,095
So it's true.

315
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:04,307
This child is Nano's creator.

316
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:06,347
Hey!

317
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,336
Could you get me out of this thing?

318
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,322
I'm tired of all of your pranks!

319
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:15,462
A homunculus!

320
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,073
The surveillance robot, and the daruma weapon,

321
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:21,781
and the child creator, and Nano
Shinonome, and the homunculus!

322
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,570
I admit that I was a fool to think that I was even
remotely prepared to try and infiltrate this home.

323
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:28,718
But I never could have seen any of this coming!

324
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,534
I must find a chance to strategically
retreat and reformulate my plans.

325
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:34,594
But...

326
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,466
Knowing that thing is watching has me paralyzed in fear.

327
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:40,810
I couldn't make an attempt to leave even if I tried!

328
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,507
If I suddenly state out of
nowhere that I have to go home...

329
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,441
I have no other options.

330
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:50,896
Where's the bathroom?

331
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:52,103
I must pee.

332
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:53,223
Uh, okay.

333
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:54,413
I'll show you where to go...

334
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:55,440
No need!

335
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,375
If you can give me the directions,

336
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:59,115
I can find it on my own.

337
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,507
I've completely outwitted you again,

338
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:05,687
Nano Shinonome.

339
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,409
My plan worked perfectly.

340
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,832
Because of course it did.

341
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:10,298
I knew how you'd respond.

342
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:12,571
You see, I capitalized on your weakness.

343
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:13,579
That's right.

344
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,323
Your kindness leaves you gullible and far too trusting!

345
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:19,237
And when I return to this
deathtrap you call your humble abode,

346
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:20,920
I shall turn the tables on you yet.

347
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:22,226
Just you wait.

348
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:26,012
As long as I have this big brain of
mine, you'll be completely at my mercy!

349
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:27,059
Eventually!

350
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:29,193
Oh. Are you leaving?

351
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:31,148
Crap!

352
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:36,076
Uh, well, you see, I was just asked to
mow the grass on the lawn outside and...

353
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:39,102
What the...?

354
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,604
Hang on! Don't move!

355
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:41,512
I'll get help!

356
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:43,117
No! Wait! Don't go!

357
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,867
Oh, no! They're onto me!

358
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:48,575
They're going to see me out here and
realize that I lied to them and tried to escape!

359
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,088
Dammit, what is this stuff?

360
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:54,013
It's robbing me of my movement, my freedom!

361
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,215
She's over here!

362
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:57,735
Huh? But the bathroom's the other direction.

363
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,560
What is this thing?

364
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,795
Right! Hakase!

365
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:04,770
Your special glue comes off with water, doesn't it?

366
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:07,347
If they capture me here, then I'll be done for!

367
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,867
But my studies! My science!

368
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:11,896
Oh, no!

369
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:14,589
I must find a way to get out of this literal mess!

370
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:19,254
Curse you, clever bastards of the Shinonome Lab!

371
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:20,307
Water!

372
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:21,260
Somebody help.

373
00:18:21,863 --> 00:18:23,162
Anybody!

374
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:27,610
Get me out of here!

375
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:55,237
Oh, I actually have that one.

376
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:57,820
Really? Do you think I could borrow it?

377
00:18:57,911 --> 00:19:00,111
Yeah, sure. I can bring it tomorrow.

378
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:03,297
"Who knows what'll happen" and "that's baseball"?

379
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:04,838
Is that all she said?

380
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:08,944
Yeah. And she was acting all happy and laughing and stuff.

381
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:12,127
Maybe she was trying to be
strong and laugh through the pain.

382
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:15,979
Getting indirectly rejected by the guy
you like isn't something you just "get over."

383
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:18,356
Well, she doesn't not look like she's not unhappy.

384
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:20,023
Wait, run that by me again?

385
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,889
Yuuko, you forgot your homework again, didn't you?

386
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:24,612
No! Don't be ridiculous!

387
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:27,220
But wait, I actually did forget, so yeah.

388
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:29,155
Make up your mind!

389
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,243
You'll find out after the commercial!

390
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:32,984
Huh?

391
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,210
Wow! That was so random and funny!

392
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,651
Don't you think so?

393
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,651
Fleming?

394
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,261
Wait, rap?

395
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,601
Oh, and Mio.

396
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:43,347
There's something else I gotta ask you.

397
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,427
Okay.

398
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:46,957
What's up?

399
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,260
Hey, Yuuko. You know her the best, right?

400
00:19:50,443 --> 00:19:53,270
Can you think of anything that might help cheer her up?

401
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:02,881
I wonder where they all went.

402
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:07,405
And here I was hoping we could go out and
grab some food after we were done with class.

403
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,948
What are you guys doing?

404
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:12,830
Congratulations, young lady!

405
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,680
Please take a spin!

406
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:16,797
I know it's Yuuko. Cut the act.

407
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:17,971
Yuu-who?

408
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:19,153
Never heard of her!

409
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,534
You're so obvious.

410
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,154
I see Nano's key poking out.

411
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:25,013
It's not like this is a robotic key or anything!

412
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:28,982
Uh, anyways, everyone who passes through
here has to take a crack at the lottery!

413
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:30,202
So, step right up!

414
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:31,168
But why?

415
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:33,486
I don't really know what you guys are doing.

416
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:34,979
Well whatever.

417
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,806
Congratulations, we have a winner!

418
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,168
How? I don't get it.

419
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:45,034
And here's your special prize!

420
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:46,626
What makes it special?

421
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:48,231
Just open it and find out!

422
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:49,379
'Kay?

423
00:20:49,941 --> 00:20:55,357
Your weird practical jokes are getting harder and
harder to understand, you know that, Yuuko? Uh...

424
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:04,123
Wonderful! Now please move along!

425
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,250
Thank you for coming!

426
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:12,021
Bonus prize.

427
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:13,248
Freshly carved.

428
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,058
Oh, thanks a lot.

429
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:34,590
This reminds me.

430
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:37,125
There was something that Koujirou said a while back.

431
00:21:37,155 --> 00:21:38,098
What was it?

432
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:42,541
Something about our ordinary lives passing us by.

433
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:46,532
And how it may actually be a series of wonderful miracles.

434
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:50,622
I think... no, I know... all of that is true.

435
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:11,192
All right!

436
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,927
I'm gonna go home and draw some manga!

437
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:05,843
How'd this happen?

438
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:08,270
It's all your fault we got lost out here!

439
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,625
Apologies. I'll find directions on my "mobile."

440
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:13,383
Why are you saying that all weird?

441
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,970
Just talk like a normal person!

442
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:18,761
Wait! Hey!

443
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:20,501
Are you watching TV on there?

444
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:23,516
Perhaps you should consume media
content on your "mobile" as well.

445
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:26,408
My phone isn't that fancy!

446
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:33,529
I'm Nano's key!

447
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,962
Sometimes I spin!

448
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:36,312
And sometimes I don't.

449
00:24:36,465 --> 00:24:38,312
Sometimes I even get pulled out!

450
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:40,116
That's my ordinary life!

451
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:44,033
And the next <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is the last one!

452
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:45,486
Look forward to it!
