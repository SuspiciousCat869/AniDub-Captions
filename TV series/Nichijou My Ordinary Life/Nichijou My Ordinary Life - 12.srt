1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,322
Man, it's so hot out.

2
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,965
Super-duper hot!

3
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:22,969
Ah. Can you cut it out? I feel it.

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,354
This heat has been hard on me, too.

5
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:29,525
But ya know, when you bring
it up, it makes it worse, 'kay?

6
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:31,780
So could you stop saying it's hot?

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,550
Okay, okay.

8
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:37,429
Man, it's a scorcher out here!

9
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:39,622
It's blistering. Sweltering, even!

10
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:42,092
Do ya know what I mean, man?

11
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:45,818
Feels like I'm in an oven! I'm baking out here! Broiling!

12
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:47,229
So humid!

13
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:48,837
I could punch him right now.

14
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:49,904
Nobody would know.

15
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:51,595
What's with the sun?

16
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,049
This gotta be a record!

17
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:55,089
Dude, seriously, it is like fire!

18
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:28,922
What a beautiful day!

19
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,792
The sky is blue, birds are chirping,

20
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,469
butterflies are fluttering.

21
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:38,854
The air, the people, and yes, even this very classroom.

22
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:41,072
Everything is great!

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,856
Because... I actually did the homework for today!

24
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,922
I bet Mio willl get a real kick outta this.

25
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:55,537
Huh?

26
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:58,668
Hang on. Oh, no.

27
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,616
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

28
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:06,843
No!

29
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,245
It can't be! You've gotta be kidding me!

30
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,578
The one time I actually did my homework?

31
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:12,776
Why?

32
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,848
Why did this have to happen? Why me?

33
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:18,953
Oh, well, guess I'll just have to copy it again.

34
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:20,519
Hey, Mio, question!

35
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:21,876
Hm?

36
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,150
Wait, our homework.

37
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:29,377
That's right. We had to... fill in a worksheet!

38
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,198
What's the matter with you?

39
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:38,688
Did something happen, Yuuko?

40
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:41,697
My homework. I left it at home.

41
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,297
There's no hope. There's nothing good in this world.

42
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:47,333
But you always forget to do your homework.

43
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:48,733
It's different this time!

44
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,454
I did it, but I didn't bring it!

45
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,401
Uh, yeah, okay I hear ya.

46
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:54,874
It's the worksheet we got yesterday, right?

47
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,400
You sure it isn't jammed inside your bag somewhere?

48
00:03:57,556 --> 00:03:58,782
Check one more time to see.

49
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,259
I just turned this whole thing inside-out and got nothing.

50
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:03,714
There's no way it's...

51
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:10,853
Whoa!

52
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:12,583
My God!

53
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:15,888
Ah! What the hell is a Daifuku Fair?!

54
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:18,129
What's fair? Nothing.

55
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,290
Uh, don't worry about it.

56
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:21,385
Hey, who knows?

57
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,945
Maybe there's an extra that was left on the front desk.

58
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,999
Are you for real? It's a miracle!

59
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,769
Dammit!

60
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:36,776
Dammit, dammit! Damn all of it!

61
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:40,168
Are you going back home? But there's no time!

62
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,429
You're right. But I have to... try!

63
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:54,547
Uh.

64
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:56,541
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

65
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:57,945
Go and take your seats.

66
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,351
Twisty, twisty, twisty, twisty,

67
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:47,247
twisty, twisty, spinning, and spinning...

68
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,953
Slow and steady wins the race.

69
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:54,373
Out in the hall again.

70
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:57,198
Why is it that I can never get my homework in?

71
00:05:57,715 --> 00:05:58,661
Am I cursed?

72
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,516
I always end up failing. Even when I actually finish it.

73
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:04,457
School is a cruel mistress.

74
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:31,714
Hey, Sakamoto.

75
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:33,262
Hm?

76
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:35,281
Look at my business card.

77
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:40,113
Uh? What is this about? What do I say?

78
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:44,618
What's happening?

79
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,019
What am I supposed to do with this?

80
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:05,624
Excuse me!

81
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,867
What seems to be the problem, Miss Tachibana?

82
00:07:10,253 --> 00:07:12,268
Uh, nothing!

83
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:16,954
The vending machine got some new drinks,
and I was just deciding on which one I wanted.

84
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:19,083
Oh. Is that so?

85
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:20,857
Well, then, I recommend...

86
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:22,825
I don't need you to tell me what to get!

87
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:24,931
...you stay away from this option,

88
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,830
but the one next to it is actually quite refreshing.

89
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:31,777
Enjoy your drink.

90
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:43,839
It's not like I bought this
drink because you pointed at it!

91
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,597
I heard the neighborhood had some pop-up
stalls, so I decided to check them out.

92
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:06,424
I am so excited that this game is here.

93
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,294
A carnival shooting gallery!

94
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,206
I've never seen one in real life!

95
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:14,268
But all I have on me is a 500 yen coin.

96
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,657
I hope it'll be enough.

97
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:18,277
Step right up! One round is 500 yen!

98
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:19,390
Perfect!

99
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,128
Isn't that convenient?!

100
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:23,609
I wish I had enough for some <i>yakisoba</i>, too.

101
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:25,410
But this'll be worth it.

102
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,969
There's only caramels and eggplants?

103
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:37,520
Uh... Do you have any other prizes?

104
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:39,152
Whaddaya mean other prizes?

105
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,651
We've only got the finest quality, brand-name goods here!

106
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:47,564
He already took my money, so I might as well go for it.

107
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,519
Don't wanna leave empty handed.

108
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:03,129
Nice try, Miss, but you shouldn't
shoot for the grand prize right away.

109
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,711
Beginner's luck won't help you with that one!

110
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:07,164
Grand prize?

111
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:08,927
Why don't you aim for something smaller?

112
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,356
It's prob'ly more your speed!

113
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:11,608
Go ahead!

114
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:13,112
More my speed?

115
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:16,021
Whatever. Might as well go for the only other option.

116
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:28,947
So close!

117
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:31,452
Okay, that box has to be glued down.

118
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:34,357
Just a little more you and woulda had it.

119
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:37,187
Looks like you're a pretty good sharpshooter there, Miss!

120
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,276
Don't tell me. You're not a professional gunman, are you?

121
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,478
Yeah, as if!

122
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,524
Ah! That thing isn't budging an inch!

123
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,321
Oh, no. What're you making that face for?

124
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:56,063
You aren't thinking that the game is rigged, now are you?

125
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:58,968
Yeah, my stall might not be the fanciest one out there,

126
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:02,119
but an honest and genuine experience is guaranteed!

127
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:05,445
Yeah, right. There's definitely
something fishy going on here.

128
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:26,968
What is that?

129
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:33,133
Ah! Look! Right in the middle! There's a
nail! You totally nailed down that eggplant!

130
00:10:33,752 --> 00:10:36,493
I'd call this whole thing a racket, wouldn't you?

131
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,126
Come on! Why are you giving me the silent treatment now?

132
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:43,734
Have you no shame for preying on innocent people?

133
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:47,048
I bet this entire operation is rigged!

134
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:48,659
And what happened to all that big talk

135
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:50,469
you were spewing earlier, huh?

136
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:53,615
What's the point in pretending to sleep?

137
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,079
I've still got one shot left

138
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:57,143
and I have a pretty good idea where to put it!

139
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:00,153
Hm?

140
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,767
Don't ever come back.

141
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:29,199
Like I'd want to.

142
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:37,865
Things we think are freakin' cool!

143
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:49,190
Ready, Mio? Here it comes!

144
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:01,242
Hey, nice catch!

145
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:04,032
Wow! Super bouncy balls!

146
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,050
Things we think are freakin' cool!

147
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:27,110
Aw! I had it!

148
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,045
Wow!

149
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,605
Slipstreams! Created by cards!

150
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:07,177
Thanks a bunch!

151
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:13,818
I haven't been to an amusement park in forever!

152
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,376
Right? This is so fun!

153
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,842
Hey, hand me my wallet, I'm gonna get a drink.

154
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:21,402
Oh. Yeah, sure. I totally forgot I was holding on to it.

155
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,473
Thanks for that.

156
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:25,283
But you know me; I'd probably lose it.

157
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,233
Ha! Yeah, I guess that's true.

158
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:29,060
Hm?

159
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,053
Wait, wha...?

160
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,371
Just hold on a second.

161
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:35,561
AH! Because I know it's inside
this zipper pocket, or maybe that one.

162
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,467
Hang on, I know I put it in my bag.

163
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:40,416
It should be right here, but
it's not, so maybe I might have...

164
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,302
I kinda, sorta, definitely lost your wallet.

165
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:57,001
I know!

166
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,709
Why don't we check the Lost and Found!

167
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:00,053
Maybe someone turned it in!

168
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:04,531
How much did you have in there?

169
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:06,210
Four thousand and sixteen yen.

170
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:07,591
That's specific.

171
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:10,850
Uh, we're looking for a brown bifold wallet.

172
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,882
And it has a snakeskin interior.

173
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:14,503
Ah, we have one just like it.

174
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,327
That was close. Aren't you glad we found it?

175
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:19,938
Yeah.

176
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:23,173
I dunno what I would've actually
done if I lost everything.

177
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,543
Attention: This is an announcement regarding a lost child.

178
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,134
Please listen carefully.

179
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,877
A young girl has been found.

180
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:34,867
She is wearing a denim shirt
that is tucked into denim shorts.

181
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:36,708
Her hat is also made of denim.

182
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,408
She is currently looking for her mother.

183
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:40,964
If you have any information,

184
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:43,636
please come to the lost child station immediately.

185
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:13,143
I have no clue why I thought a
stupid haunted house was a good idea!

186
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:25,290
'Kay, say cheese!

187
00:15:57,251 --> 00:16:00,145
Your order is three lattes. Is
there anything else you'd like?

188
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:02,370
Oh, uh! I think...

189
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:06,921
I'd like this one, this one, and this one please.

190
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:08,655
Uh. I'm terribly sorry, miss.

191
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:11,602
But could you please provide
a specific name for the orders?

192
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:13,668
Oh, it's Sakurai.

193
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:16,385
Uh, that's not exactly what I meant.

194
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,141
Oh, no! I'm so sorry!

195
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:21,257
It's Izumi. The name's Izumi Sakurai.

196
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:24,143
Sorry, but I wasn't asking for your full name, either.

197
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:27,197
Sorry! I've been told it sounds
like I have two last names,

198
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:28,864
so I thought you were confused.

199
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:30,768
Well, I didn't mean your name.

200
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:33,149
All I need is the names of the items that you want.

201
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:36,232
Huh? You want names of the items?

202
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:39,997
I'm sorry, but I don't know what they are.

203
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:43,374
Oh! No. It's okay. I'm sorry for the trouble!

204
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,353
Yum, that food hit the spot!

205
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:54,139
I'm officially stuffed!

206
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:56,747
But I still have some room left in my dessert stomach.

207
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:57,889
Same here.

208
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:07,407
Cool! I'll do one too!

209
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:20,725
Here's mine!

210
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,808
I'm done, too.

211
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,826
Whoa! Awesome! Your stuff's great as usual.

212
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:35,477
What did you make? Done yet?

213
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:45,949
A crane?

214
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:49,690
Nano! Check it out!

215
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:51,398
Ta-da!

216
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,745
I put a big key on my back, too!

217
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:57,543
Isn't this cool? Now we're matching and stuff.

218
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,098
Yeah, I guess we are.

219
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:03,718
Since I'm like you now, I'm gonna be Nano
all day, so no calling me "Hakase," okay?

220
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,654
Okay, "Nano," you got it.

221
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,123
Meow-ch!

222
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:09,959
Already?

223
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,240
Uh, Hakase, did you quit, or...?

224
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:15,689
It's "Nano"! I'm being you right now!

225
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:19,747
Oh, well, I just figured since
you took the key off of your back.

226
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:22,344
I'm just giving my back a break right now.

227
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:26,848
I'm still Nano all day today.

228
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,285
Right. Understood.

229
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,345
Hey, Hakase... I mean, "Nano."

230
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,627
I have an idea for a game we can play!

231
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:44,419
Do ya? What'cha got?

232
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:48,579
Since you're being me, then why don't
we switch places and I can be you today?

233
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,454
You bet!

234
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,986
So then, Hakase... I mean, Nano,

235
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:53,536
would have to put her key on.

236
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:54,520
Sure!

237
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,626
And since I'm Hakase now,

238
00:18:57,651 --> 00:18:59,701
that means I should get this key off my back.

239
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:00,876
Not a chance.

240
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,388
So, what do you wanna play first? Like cards or something?

241
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:12,158
Wow, these snacks are yummy!

242
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:15,755
Those are mine! And I was saving them for later!

243
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:20,475
But now... I'm Hakase... so I get all your snacks.

244
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,822
Ah! That doesn't make any sense!

245
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,777
I can Nano, but if Nano is me and gets to eat
my snacks, then I don't wanna be Nano anymore,

246
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,321
and Nano can just stay being Nano.

247
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:33,538
Keep it down.

248
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:38,922
Since everything is back to normal and I'm Nano again,

249
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:42,291
I guess I'm gonna go to the store
and get groceries for tonight's dinner.

250
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:44,802
Huh? I wanna go, too!

251
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,416
We're not gonna buy any snacks while we're out.

252
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:48,918
I'm gonna get a chocolate shark and some apple juice!

253
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,013
Not a chance.

254
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:50,672
Oh, come on!

255
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:51,466
No way.

256
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,357
Just the chocolate shark then!

257
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:55,804
It's another peaceful day

258
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,887
at the Shinonome Household.

259
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:10,336
The first one that says anything loses the game.

260
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:11,860
Okay.

261
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,078
Oh. You just said something, so that means you lost.

262
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:19,036
You didn't say when we were
starting, so technically, I'm fine.

263
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:23,367
You wanna talk about some random stuff to
get it out of our system before we start?

264
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:26,657
You have anything you wanna talk about?

265
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,074
Okay.

266
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,788
Carbonation makes drinks fizzy,

267
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:16,820
which really seems to wake you up.

268
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,345
I was out.

269
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:34,369
Good morning.

270
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:37,842
It looks like sleeping beauty woke up without her kiss.

271
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:39,143
Hm?

272
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:42,115
That sucks.

273
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:48,796
And why is that?

274
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:28,283
Welcome home, Master!

275
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:29,550
It's me, Cider!

276
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,280
I know my bubbly personality is intoxicating,

277
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:34,410
so twist off the cap, wiff the fizz,

278
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:36,018
and join my carbon-nation.

279
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,896
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 13!

280
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:40,000
Look forward to it!
