00:00:01,523 --> 00:00:04,531
Helvetica Standard.

2
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:06,381
Come on, you two.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,465
When are you gonna get around to paying rent?

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,544
You're up to 60,000 yen now!

5
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:13,595
I'm so sorry.

6
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:16,375
I don't want apologies! I want my money!

7
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:22,565
Last time, you said you'd be able to pay the
rent in full the next time I came around for it.

8
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:24,677
Well, next time is now, so cough it up!

9
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,789
There's no use stone-walling me in this situation.

10
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,543
I'm not leaving without your rent.

11
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:42,750
Um...

12
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:48,172
This is all a poor sparrow can spare.

13
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:27,242
One: Meso-American Slider.

14
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:30,053
Two: Western Box Turtle.

15
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:32,827
Three: Red-Bellied, Short-Necked Turtle.

16
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:33,708
It's two.

17
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,036
The answer is... number three.

18
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:37,864
Great job, everyone.

19
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:40,438
Whatever.

20
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,575
Hey, what are you still doing up at this hour?

21
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:44,822
Is your cold gone?

22
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:45,798
Mh-hm.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,295
Then you should be good to go back to school tomorrow.

24
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:49,962
Your tests are coming up soon.

25
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:50,890
Fine.

26
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:55,359
You've been out for three whole days, so you're
gonna have to catch up on your homework quickly.

27
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,951
See if you can borrow your friends' notes from class.

28
00:02:58,497 --> 00:03:01,914
I better not see you bring home
another failing score like the last time.

29
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:02,779
You hear me?

30
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:06,159
Aw, come on, Mom! It's fine!

31
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:09,810
My finals don't even start until, like... tomorrow!

32
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:13,599
I totally forgot!

33
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:15,095
Why didn't you remind me?

34
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,112
You were much too sick to study anyway, so I let you rest.

35
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:19,916
Nuh-uh! I'd study in my sleep!

36
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:20,965
Would you really?

37
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:21,722
I wouldn't!

38
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:22,687
That's what I thought.

39
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:24,063
You didn't even bring it up,

40
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,242
I couldn't even try to study!

41
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:26,828
Would you have studied if you'd known?

42
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:27,931
I guess not!

43
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:30,441
If you fail your exams, I'll kill you.

44
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,070
You don't have to go that far!

45
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:37,536
I'm super, ultra, great, delicious, wonderfully screwed.

46
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:56,707
Well, it looks like I have no choice.

47
00:03:56,815 --> 00:04:00,399
The next school day starts in T-minus ten hours!

48
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,531
Luckily, tomorrow's tests are just for English and music.

49
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:06,265
In that case, I'll focus on English tonight.

50
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:12,624
'Kay, I just have to ignore all of my
natural lazy-person instincts and concentrate.

51
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:14,044
I won't procrastinate!

52
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:16,827
So that I can live on without regret.

53
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,954
So that I can laugh in each coming day.

54
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,639
Even through all the tears and sweat.

55
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:25,525
Even though obstacles stand in my way.

56
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,956
I will never give up.

57
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:31,570
I want to keep a smile on my face.

58
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,870
I am like a ship crossing the sea.

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,589
Sailing for the light where I want to be.

60
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:41,186
On a straight track.

61
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:43,851
Breaking the chains which hold me back.

62
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:45,921
Becoming my best self!

63
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,194
By Yuuko.

64
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:50,099
Perfect. I'm done...

65
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,134
...with a poem.

66
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:57,589
Things we think are freakin' cool!

67
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,258
It's nothing special. Fuggedaboudit.

68
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:06,904
The shy smile of a local mechanic!

69
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:08,515
It's go time.

70
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:12,187
I dunno what's gonna be on the
test, so I have to take it all in!

71
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,559
All right, vocab, come on!

72
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:15,301
Bring it!

73
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:17,549
Attempt: To make an effort.

74
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,813
Love: To earn my heart.

75
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,317
Always: We were always apart.

76
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:26,955
Confirmation: Your love is like.

77
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,031
Teleportation: It crosses even time, so.

78
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:34,837
Cosmos: Sailing through star and sky.

79
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:38,564
A midnight submarine: I want to ride with you.

80
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:39,982
Forever, with you.

81
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,675
Forever, eternally.

82
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,781
Forever, until the end.

83
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:47,747
I'm done! With another poem!

84
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:51,037
Ugh! It's over! I'm screwed!

85
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,429
No matter how hard I try, I can't study!

86
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,310
I'm so dead! My mom is gonna kill me!

87
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:59,992
Why did I have to get over my
stupid cold today of all days?

88
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:02,121
Being sick is way better than taking a test

89
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:03,605
that I'm doomed to fail!

90
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,537
If only I could be sick for a just little longer!

91
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,936
I got it.

92
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,970
My plan is completely foolproof!

93
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,629
Yup.

94
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:25,747
If I wanna get out of the test,
I'll make myself sick again!

95
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,902
It stings! But I gotta push through the pain!

96
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:33,447
My body is still weak from beating my last cold,

97
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:36,400
so I bet I'll be running a fever in no time.

98
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:43,153
Come on, come on! Just a little more.

99
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:49,510
If I can tough this out now, then
it'll all be worth it in the end!

100
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,007
The path will open!

101
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:57,595
If I can get a fever, then I'm all set!

102
00:06:57,624 --> 00:06:59,540
I'll have some shaved ice for good measure.

103
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,521
I'll blast the AC, too!

104
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,627
And go to sleep on top of the covers!

105
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,754
Why do I have to be so freakin' healthy?

106
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,706
Yuuko! It's time to get up!

107
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:29,683
Last resort.

108
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:31,632
Thermometer... plus match...

109
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:33,187
...equals fever on-demand!

110
00:07:33,362 --> 00:07:34,654
Are you up yet?

111
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:38,099
You're going to school today, right? Yuuko?

112
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,940
It burns! It burns!

113
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:41,173
What are you doing?

114
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:42,681
Mom, I got a fever!

115
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:44,472
Guess I must've gotten sick again.

116
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,947
How bad is it?

117
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,880
Uh. Well, lemme see.

118
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:51,795
Huh? It's 88.8 degrees.

119
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:52,486
What?

120
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,474
Now look at what you did! You broke it!

121
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:56,540
No, I didn't! I got sick again, I swear!

122
00:07:56,565 --> 00:07:58,516
You seem perfectly healthy to me.

123
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,093
Yeah, It's probably because
there was something in the water.

124
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:05,022
Thanks, man.

125
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:08,277
I had no idea that today was the
last day to turn in our application.

126
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:10,541
One more day and the club would've been a goner.

127
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:12,917
But even if you turn in the form on time,

128
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,840
won't the club still get shut
down for the lack of members?

129
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:17,445
Nah, I wouldn't worry about that.

130
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:21,880
Tell ya what, how 'bout I bring
you some juice tomorrow as a thanks.

131
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:24,285
You don't have to do that. It's all good.

132
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:27,431
It's no problem at all! See ya!

133
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:31,507
Hey, I need to stop and buy a juicer
and an apple orchard on the way home.

134
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:32,253
Yes, sir.

135
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:47,857
Ah. So that's the power of the Daiku Group.

136
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:52,527
No string left.

137
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:57,607
I won't be able to tie together a straw doll to
put in the Principal's locker if I don't have any.

138
00:08:58,575 --> 00:08:59,908
And what's worse,

139
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:02,658
it looks like I don't even have the straw to craft with,

140
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,036
nor do I have any money to buy any.

141
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,880
My wife handles the money, but she's gone.

142
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:09,896
We're all out of rice and I'm hungry.

143
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:13,471
At times like these, a swig of brandy would come in handy,

144
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:16,538
but my liver couldn't take it.

145
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:20,906
My favorite team lost, and for whatever
reason, the cheeseburger I ordered earlier

146
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:22,501
didn't have any cheese on it.

147
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:26,159
The visitor counter on the home page
of my website hasn't budged at all,

148
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:30,348
and not a single person logged on to
my usual online chat group yesterday.

149
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,538
That empty chat room reminds me.

150
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:57,765
When I got on to the bus the other day,
everyone else got off and left me alone.

151
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:00,114
And that empty bus reminds me.

152
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,607
I went on a field trip back in high school.

153
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,604
Time for bed.

154
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:07,260
And just a couple of minutes
after we turned off the lights...

155
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:08,638
Who else is awake?

156
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:11,334
I asked everyone, but they were already asleep.

157
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:16,045
And speaking of sleep,

158
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:18,718
I haven't been getting much of it lately.

159
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,545
Since I can't get any rest,

160
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,673
I ended up snacking through the night,

161
00:10:22,836 --> 00:10:25,167
and I've wound up putting on some weight.

162
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:27,257
And speaking of food,

163
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:29,693
I got a present for my birthday last month.

164
00:10:29,718 --> 00:10:32,349
But it was just a roll of bread.

165
00:10:39,757 --> 00:10:40,842
This is no good!

166
00:10:40,952 --> 00:10:43,448
All of this negative thinking is getting me nowhere!

167
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:46,562
What I really need to do is
remember the good things in life.

168
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,763
Who could that be?

169
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:50,589
Yes?

170
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:52,089
Oh-ho!

171
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:53,567
Kimiko!

172
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:55,992
Mom is still away on her trip, right?

173
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,715
I thought I'd come by and make dinner.

174
00:10:57,798 --> 00:10:59,423
I see. Well, thank you.

175
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:00,727
Hi, Grandpa!

176
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:02,497
Hello there, Mi.

177
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,724
Oh. Looks like you've grown taller, huh?

178
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:07,362
Just what I needed.

179
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:09,189
I'll spend some time with my grandson,

180
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:10,729
who hasn't a care in the world.

181
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,064
Guess what, Grandpa?

182
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:12,431
Hm?

183
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:15,069
I made a dumpling when I was at the park earlier.

184
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,758
You can have it if you want!

185
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:17,847
That so?

186
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,850
You're hungry, so you should eat it!

187
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,566
How sweet.

188
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,094
It's real chocolate, so you're gonna like it!

189
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,448
Oh, can I really? Well, thank you.

190
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,999
What's with the water works?

191
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,384
I guess you've always been the sensitive type.

192
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:38,736
'Kay, I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.

193
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:40,140
Okay.

194
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:41,096
That's right.

195
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:44,369
There's no point in focusing on
all of the negative things in life.

196
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:47,238
I made it with love just for you, grandpa!

197
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:48,984
Come on, hurry up!

198
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,735
Eat the dumpling! It's yummy, I promise!

199
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:54,913
Well, uh, this is...

200
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:57,104
Eat it! What are you waiting for?

201
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:59,624
You should eat it! It's tasty!

202
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:04,072
I'm sure.

203
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:10,228
Somehow, happiness tastes just about as good as dirt.

204
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,970
Hey, Mom? Grandpa fell down.

205
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:32,421
Your order. Thanks for waiting.

206
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:56,021
There is nothing...

207
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,484
nothing greater than peace.

208
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:15,725
Trying to kill me?

209
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,342
It's finished!

210
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,755
What's up?

211
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:23,966
Super-duper glue!

212
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:26,644
That is quite large.

213
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:28,248
Because it's super-duper.

214
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,676
I'm gonna spread this so Nano and Sakamoto

215
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:36,591
will get here stuck when they least expect it.

216
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:39,549
What kind of prank are you tryin' to pull now?

217
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,660
You're being so obvious no one is gonna fall for your...

218
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,974
Gotcha!

219
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,811
You got me in what?

220
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:49,764
Hey! Get this stuff off of me!

221
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:51,733
I've got things to do, ya know!

222
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:54,577
It'll only come off with water.

223
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,970
Then go get some water and set me free!

224
00:13:57,257 --> 00:13:58,390
Hold on, it's snack time.

225
00:13:58,454 --> 00:13:59,884
Hey!

226
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:03,390
Since it's snack time, I need to
go to the kitchen, so see ya for now.

227
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,517
No!

228
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:08,212
My feet. Hang on.

229
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:09,632
Oh, no. Uh.

230
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:10,863
Hey.

231
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,425
Do something. This sucks.

232
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:16,576
Heh. You look like a bug who got stuck in a glue trap.

233
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:17,851
What are you laughing at?

234
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:19,588
You're stuck in here, too!

235
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:21,606
Uh. Oh, that's right.

236
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:24,253
Serves you right!

237
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:25,794
That's some karma for ya!

238
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,759
That's weird. I-I can't get out.

239
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:30,013
It's your own fault for being such a troublemaker.

240
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,599
I've fallen and I can't get up.

241
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:39,643
Hang on. Where'd Sakamoto go?

242
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:44,307
Kitty-kitty? Kitty-kitty?

243
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:46,195
There you are!

244
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:01,689
This won't come off without water.

245
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,478
I won't be able to eat snacks if I'm stuck here.

246
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:08,960
What if I'm stuck to the floor for a
really long time and get super hungry?

247
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:11,613
I won't be able to eat my snacks.

248
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:12,922
Am I'm gonna starve?

249
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,180
I don't wanna become a skeleton.

250
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:19,525
I'm actually dying here.

251
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,859
Hello! I'm back!

252
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,017
It's Nano!

253
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:23,446
I'm happy to be home.

254
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,959
It's so hot out there and... What happened?

255
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:27,453
How'd you end up like that?

256
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,448
Well, I put down this glue!

257
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:32,111
Just like that! And it got all sticky-like!

258
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:34,018
But then I tripped and fell,

259
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:36,220
and got stuck in it, and now I need water, and I need...

260
00:15:36,277 --> 00:15:37,283
Water?

261
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,315
That's right!

262
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,484
You should really get up off the floor first.

263
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:43,187
And then we should get this mess cleaned up before...

264
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:47,843
Huh? What is this stuff?

265
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:49,398
Hey! Uh.

266
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:53,084
How did he...? Here, I'll, uh...

267
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:56,386
Oh, no! My hand came off!

268
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:01,674
I don't understand what's happening!

269
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:07,285
Oh, no! My other hand!

270
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:20,692
President.

271
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:28,025
So this is the true power of the Daiku Group.

272
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:49,637
Ha. Well, that sure was a lovely rainbow we just saw.

273
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:33,319
Hey! Guess who!

274
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,557
Well, is it Hakase?

275
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:38,967
Yay, that's correct! Good job. How'd you know?

276
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:43,059
I mean, it's kinda obvious. No one else lives here, so...

277
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,822
Okay! Now it's your turn to play, Nano!

278
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,405
Huh? All right then.

279
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:49,425
Hey! Guess who!

280
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,399
You! Nano!

281
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:55,842
It's another peaceful day at the Shinonome household.

282
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,542
Hey, Nano! I was right, right?

283
00:17:57,606 --> 00:17:59,766
Uh, yeah. You were.

284
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:01,779
Great! I get to go again now!

285
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,741
So turn around!

286
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:04,352
Sure.

287
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,624
This is bad. So bad.

288
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:30,497
Really bad!

289
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:32,700
I'm still stuck on the first stupid question!

290
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:33,939
What is this thing?

291
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,582
It looks like some sort of low-level monster or something.

292
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,776
But how do I describe that in one word?

293
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:43,955
Wait, I've seen this. But where?

294
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:47,611
I think I asked Ms. Sakurai about it before, but when?

295
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:49,190
Let's see.

296
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:50,882
What is this supposed to be?

297
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,970
No, I'm not asking about the answer.

298
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:55,903
I'm wondering if you were the one who
drew this low-level-looking monster.

299
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,686
That's it! I did ask about this dude!

300
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:02,375
I don't remember what she said!

301
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,790
Just calm down! I need to breathe.

302
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:07,887
If I panic, I won't be able to think straight!

303
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:10,422
All right, focus. What is this thing doing?

304
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:12,487
Flying? Was that it?

305
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:14,166
No, it can't be.

306
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,330
This little guy is so distracting!

307
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,567
Why can't I stop focusing on this monster?

308
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:19,845
Wait, monster?

309
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,794
This isn't just testing my language skills.

310
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,651
It's testing my sanity.

311
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:27,298
But this is the best I can do, so I should just move on.

312
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:28,911
So what's next?

313
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,988
It's the same monster swinging a tennis racket!

314
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:38,284
Which means the first answer is definitely not monster.

315
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:40,696
Why is this thing torturing me?

316
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,213
I'll just erase my first answer and start over.

317
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:47,532
Where is my eraser?

318
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,625
Every dang thing in my stupid life sucks!

319
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:55,701
What do I do now? This is so bad!

320
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:59,015
Do I just have to live with my mistakes?

321
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,766
Mai! You saved me!

322
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:08,053
I'm so glad we're friends! Best friends!

323
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:10,581
A sand eraser?

324
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:12,783
I can't use this! It'll rip my paper!

325
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:13,920
That defeats the purpose!

326
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:15,714
I don't have time to worry about that!

327
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:17,325
I need to see if Mai has a...

328
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:19,271
She went to sleep!

329
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:22,322
Uh. All right, ten minutes remaining!

330
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,529
My time! It's ticking away!

331
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,930
Come on, I gotta calm down.

332
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,433
That's right.

333
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:34,976
I have to relax... and just clear my mind.

334
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,815
Purge all thought. Be free.

335
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:45,791
Okay. And time's up!

336
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,370
No!

337
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:19,963
It's raining.

338
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:28,624
Only in my heart.

339
00:23:06,896 --> 00:23:07,729
Good morning, sir!

340
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:09,363
Yes, good morning!

341
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:12,242
No way! I just got a love letter!

342
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:13,867
Are you for real? Who sent it?

343
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,134
It says it's from Tanaka in Class Four!

344
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,539
Come on! Open it already!

345
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,841
Don't rush me!

346
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:28,907
I'm a dirt ball.

347
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,344
I'm an iron ball!

348
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:33,578
I'd tell you a joke, but none of mine are clean.

349
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:35,712
And I shall strike when the iron is hot!

350
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:36,526
Clang-clang!

351
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:39,103
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 12.

352
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:40,230
Look forward to it!
