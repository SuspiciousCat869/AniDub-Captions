1
00:00:07,126 --> 00:00:08,294
Sorry it took a while!

2
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:10,858
I present to you the Yuuko special! Here.

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,916
Whoa! Your twice-cooked pork looks delicious!

4
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,412
And great timing too! I was getting pretty hangry.

5
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:19,263
I made sure to throw in a dash of my secret ingredient.

6
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:20,622
I wonder if you'll guess it.

7
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:23,489
You must've gone all-out if
you put your secret ingredient in.

8
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:25,544
Thanks for all the food!

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,839
Oh. That's the overpowering burst of miso.

10
00:00:34,276 --> 00:00:36,675
It's so not subtle at all, not even a little bit.

11
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:38,628
No, yeah, that's all I'm getting.

12
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:40,759
Not much of a "secret" ingredient.

13
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:44,022
Ugh, now it's starting to taste worse the longer I chew.

14
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,034
You know what? This is one secret I wish I didn't know!

15
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,973
Wow, this isn't half bad!

16
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:37,167
Hey, Mio! Check it out!

17
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:37,465
Uh.

18
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:46,233
The heck is this?

19
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:50,090
A kappa? Why would she show me her weirdo drawing?

20
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,349
And does she really think this thing looks good?

21
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,048
But you know.

22
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:02,498
I do like the idea of drawing some
sort of mythical or fantasy-themed story.

23
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:05,246
Like this kappa and a <i>daidarabotchi</i> or something.

24
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:07,251
Kappa, hmm.

25
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,571
He'd be the bottom.

26
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:09,690
Kappa...

27
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:11,068
Kappa?

28
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:11,826
Huh?

29
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:14,262
Kappa... Kappa...

30
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:15,840
Pa... Parasite.

31
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:20,428
Heh. Might as well turn this into one
of those last-syllable drawing games.

32
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,063
Here you go.

33
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,779
Cool, thanks.

34
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,447
A parasite?

35
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:29,506
Is that what a parasite is supposed to look like?

36
00:03:31,522 --> 00:03:34,432
Wait, does this little arrow mean what I think it means?

37
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:38,116
She's challenging me to a word-chain game with pictures!

38
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:39,957
Well, I accept your challenge!

39
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:41,689
Let's see, parasite.

40
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:44,757
Site... Tuh... Tuh...

41
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:45,638
Got it!

42
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:53,743
It's huge! What is that even supposed be?

43
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:57,240
A tengu maybe? Sure, let's go with that.

44
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,367
Whatever.

45
00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:01,562
Tengu it is. Now, what starts with a "G-U"?

46
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:02,737
Guh... Goo...

47
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:06,352
Gah! Are you kidding me? <i>Tengo</i> ?

48
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,477
What the heck is a "tengo" anyway?!

49
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:11,548
Wait! Hold on a sec!

50
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:13,279
This has to be on purpose, right?

51
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:16,411
There's no way someone could
make such a basic spelling mistake.

52
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:19,445
Then again, it is Yuuko, so
we're kinda grading on a curve.

53
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,964
I don't get her at all.

54
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:26,269
It doesn't make any sense, but I just have to move on.

55
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:28,700
Starting with "G-O," huh?

56
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:32,920
Here.

57
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:37,578
Oh. Whoa, what's with the sensual-looking dude?

58
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:41,018
Wait. Goku?

59
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,497
But the last thing I drew on
my turn was a tengu, wasn't it?

60
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,628
Oh well, I guess it was an honest mistake.

61
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:50,685
It could happen to anybody, so I'll let it slide.

62
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:52,774
I'll give her crap about it later.

63
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:53,917
Let's see.

64
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:57,740
So, the next one can start with a "U." 'Kay!

65
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:05,710
Uh...

66
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,690
An eel? Wait, rabbit?

67
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,254
It's a cow? That looks udderly terrible!

68
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,056
Here.

69
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:21,702
Ohh! A tongue?

70
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,258
So that's how we're playing!

71
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,634
So, "shita" would end it a "T-A."

72
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:28,302
Then how 'bout Taxi.

73
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:33,403
Huh? Ah! What the hell?

74
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:35,345
You cannot be serious right now!

75
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,631
How hard is it to spell Taxi?!

76
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:45,737
Whatever, I'll keep playing along.

77
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,486
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

78
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:51,337
She really is trying to keep me on my toes!

79
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,410
Breakin' out the slang, huh? Okay, I see you.

80
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:57,398
Oh. Oh, crap! This ends with an "N"!

81
00:05:57,446 --> 00:05:59,934
If I pass that over, I lose. Stupid rules.

82
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,213
Okay. Quick fix.

83
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:02,118
Thanks.

84
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:21,001
I'm so bored.

85
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:28,937
I said I'm bored, Sekiguchi.

86
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:37,871
Hey, I have an idea! Let's play a game of Issei-no-Sei!

87
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:39,569
I'm gonna go first!

88
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,279
Issei-no-Two!

89
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:50,026
Aw, man come on.

90
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:53,268
I've got nothing to do, so try to play along.

91
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:55,699
Take a look.

92
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:00,172
Did you really...?

93
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,063
Forget your homework.

94
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:12,486
Forced to stand out in the hall.

95
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:15,164
Uh... "Mogami River"

96
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:16,363
by Yuuko.

97
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:24,133
I can't believe I have to stand in the hallway
just because I forgot one little assignment.

98
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,243
I'm stuck in the hall. What to do to pass the time?

99
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,540
"Mogami River" by Yuuko.

100
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:39,594
Wha...?

101
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:44,980
Uh, wha...? What the...?

102
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:45,742
Why is there a...

103
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:49,349
Guys? Anyone? There's a deer.

104
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:58,648
What? The principal is out there with it?

105
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,436
The principal! He's gonna... The deer!

106
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,571
There's a deer!

107
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,076
Oh, no! Someone get help!

108
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,068
The principal is...

109
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:24,228
Is that... a cookie?

110
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,796
Somebody, please! It's the principal! He's...

111
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,260
Oh my god.

112
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:45,513
He's up!

113
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,242
He jumped!

114
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:54,113
Ahh! And he ate it!

115
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:58,037
He's getting up again!

116
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:04,472
He changed his mind!

117
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,171
Is it a stalemate?

118
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:11,589
It's not!

119
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,832
He's dead!

120
00:09:15,857 --> 00:09:18,930
Ohh! Guys! There's a death!

121
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,000
He died! He's dying!

122
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,571
He's on his feet!

123
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:39,175
Hey! Anyone?

124
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:05,173
Everyone! You're not gonna...!

125
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:09,350
U-Uh. I mean... There's um...

126
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,514
It's uh... Out... side.

127
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:13,815
Uhh...

128
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:15,712
Uh, duh.

129
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,696
The hallway is perfectly normal!

130
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:33,139
In that moment, she spoke the honest
truth, from the bottom of her heart.

131
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:35,536
She wasn't protecting the principal,

132
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:38,619
nor was she too lazy to explain what had happened.

133
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:41,065
No, that's not the reason.

134
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:49,561
Perhaps, in the spirit of competition, she was respecting
the two brave combatants that fought for their very lives.

135
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:57,639
Early summer rain, pours down and flows through waters.

136
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:58,885
"Mogami River."

137
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,200
What's that even mean?

138
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
All right! Let's do this thing!

139
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,437
Mio! You can be the referee.

140
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,202
You don't need a referee for ten-yen soccer.

141
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,892
Uh-uh-uh. You don't get it!

142
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,406
You gotta set the mood! It's all about the atmosphere!

143
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:20,524
Now! Kick-off time!

144
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:37,161
Have it your way.

145
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:39,266
Now gimme your best shot! C'mon!

146
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:40,783
'Kay...

147
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:08,513
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

148
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,713
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and a one, two, three! ♪

149
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,323
Wha...!

150
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,053
Chomp!

151
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:14,585
I love him!

152
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,274
I trapped a cockroach.

153
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:44,645
He's under this cup. But what do I do now?

154
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,416
Okay. Think.

155
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:54,616
I have to go about this carefully.

156
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:58,478
I can't let this disgusting
menace desecrate our home any longer!

157
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:01,806
I need to come up with a plan
to keep him from tormenting us!

158
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:03,362
But what can I do?

159
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:06,948
The bug spray! No, that won't work!

160
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:11,133
It won't kill instantly, so the
roach might be able to run away.

161
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,141
And besides...

162
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,075
I don't want to see him flail
in the final throes of death!

163
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:20,017
I know! Maybe the dish soap!

164
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,778
If I spread it on the table, it
might slow the sucker down when

165
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,214
it's trying to escape! And then
I can go for the finishing blow!

166
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,911
It's jumping!

167
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:38,504
Animals put up the biggest fight when they're
cornered! So, it might leap past the soap!

168
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:41,066
It could even make a desperate charge right at me!

169
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:43,193
What if it touches me, or gets on me?!

170
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:45,474
No, what if it gets on my face?!

171
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,930
Or worse! What if... it jumps into my mouth?

172
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,306
If it does... I couldn't go on.

173
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,615
It'd be a one-shot kill!

174
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:02,149
This is it!

175
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,572
I have no other options!

176
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,952
Once I lift this bowl, it's
on! It's destroy or be destroyed!

177
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,873
Do or die!

178
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:19,151
Then again... there might be another way.

179
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:23,745
Huh? What's going on in here?

180
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:26,207
Hey! Sakamoto!

181
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:27,747
You have to help me!

182
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:31,382
There's... a roach... in... the cup!

183
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:32,354
Right here!

184
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:35,200
A what? Uh!

185
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:37,274
You want me to take care of a bug?

186
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:38,496
Mm-hm! Mm-hm!

187
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:41,976
Just leave it to me. Now, let me at 'em.

188
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,013
You're my hero!

189
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,502
Hey.

190
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:51,105
Yeah?

191
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:52,853
What do you think you're doing?

192
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,237
Lift the cup. I got this.

193
00:14:55,888 --> 00:14:56,618
Really?

194
00:14:57,028 --> 00:15:02,124
Well, I mean, if you don't lift it, I
can't do my job. So move your hand already.

195
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:06,376
Come on!

196
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:08,895
No way! Why would I release it?

197
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:11,763
I can't break the seal that's
containing this minion of evil!

198
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:15,379
It's like Pandora's box! If I
open it, I'm gonna unleash a demon!

199
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,656
What are you talking about?

200
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,485
There's no way I can help you
out if you don't show me that bug!

201
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,917
So, lift it yourself then!

202
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:22,146
I don't have thumbs!

203
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:30,246
Great. Now what do I do?

204
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,579
Sakamoto got fed up and ran off.

205
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,111
Hey, Nano!

206
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:36,129
You have any yummy snacks I can eat?

207
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:39,442
Perfect timing!

208
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:42,415
She's never been bothered by bugs before, so maybe...

209
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:45,719
Hakase! I trapped a gross cockroach under this cup!

210
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:49,042
And I'd really appreciate it
if you took care of him for me!

211
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,523
Sure thing!

212
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:52,878
You're an angel!

213
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:56,138
Oh, now don't mind me. You go and do your thing.

214
00:15:56,511 --> 00:16:00,965
All righty then! I'll bonk the
little buggy with a really good bop!

215
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:02,592
Bam!

216
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,386
Uh. It looks like I missed.

217
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:13,098
Here I am, in actual, genuine distress,

218
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:17,726
but she's goofing off and making jokes, at my expense!

219
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:18,659
You know!

220
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:21,050
I really hate you sometimes, Hakase!

221
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,025
She's crying?

222
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:32,501
Oh, don't give me that! I was just
kidding! You can forget what I said!

223
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:34,517
There's no way I could ever hate you!

224
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,252
Not in a million years!

225
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:39,532
Come on. You know I love you!

226
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:48,254
Nano!

227
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:52,824
Oh, Silly! I can't stay mad at you!

228
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:54,312
Nano!

229
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:02,805
Now! It's do or die! Let's rock!

230
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:12,951
It's getting too hot, so can I get out?

231
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,732
Get out? But you just got in a moment ago.

232
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,570
Yeah, but it's still too hot.

233
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,868
How about we count to ten,
and after that, you can get out.

234
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,434
Twenty log square root ten!

235
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:22,844
Huh?

236
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:25,522
That equals ten, so I can leave now?

237
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:28,529
Well... I meant...

238
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:32,332
One... Two... One at a time, like that!

239
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:34,031
Aww.

240
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:40,438
Man, this sucks.

241
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:43,011
I can't believe everyone left for cram school.

242
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:47,737
Mm? Well, I'm bored out of my mind, aren't you?

243
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,221
Oh yeah, weren't you supposed to be at cram school too?

244
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:01,482
Hm?

245
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,091
You skipped?!

246
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,522
Wow!

247
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:24,143
How's that curry? It smells nice!

248
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:26,271
Good! It's just about ready!

249
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:29,101
Man, it better be. I'm starving over here.

250
00:18:29,156 --> 00:18:30,625
Tell me about it.

251
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:32,891
How's the fishing going, Mai?

252
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:35,129
I sense a big catch.

253
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:39,103
We're gonna eat well today!

254
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:43,663
All right! Looks like it's all done now!

255
00:18:47,913 --> 00:18:49,375
Thanks for waiting!

256
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:52,577
Get ready for some super ultra-great delicious curry!

257
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,689
Gimme a little longer!

258
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:03,056
I should've put the rice on before we started the curry.

259
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:05,142
Oh well, as long as it's tasty,

260
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,656
it's better late than never, I guess!

261
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,092
You know what I mean?

262
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,792
Oh, if we brought some mayonnaise,

263
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,401
I bet that would really hit the spot.

264
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:16,022
Mayo does go great with curry, doesn't it?

265
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,031
Uh, yeah. Mayo.

266
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,230
Wouldn't you say so?

267
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,477
I felt sick.

268
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:31,030
No, no. It's not what it looks like!

269
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,239
It was an accident, really! I swear!

270
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:35,336
Wait! See, look!

271
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:38,664
We still have these noodles! They're... jelly noodles.

272
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:39,823
That's good, right?

273
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:45,109
I'll have your blood.

274
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,459
Huh? Wh-What was that?

275
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,071
Your blood!

276
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,498
You'll pay for it with your life! Come back!

277
00:19:58,204 --> 00:19:58,710
Uh.

278
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:01,578
Huh?

279
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,167
I'm so sorry, Mai!

280
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,919
We screwed up the rice and curry, so there's no lunch!

281
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,251
Are you mad at us?

282
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,504
At least we still have these noodles.

283
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:29,519
You're a life saver!

284
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,281
Be free.

285
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:44,989
So, uh. Here's our lunch.

286
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:46,645
One serving of jelly noodles.

287
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,324
We only brought one pack?!

288
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,280
I was thinking we could ration
it out evenly with each other.

289
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,945
But because you and I were the ones who ruined the lunch,

290
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,635
Mai gets first dibs.

291
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,619
Rock, paper, scissors!

292
00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:04,557
Boo-yah!

293
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:07,626
You better not try anything funny
and eat the entire thing by yourself!

294
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:11,286
Oh, calm down. I would never do anything mean like that.

295
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,839
Now then, it's time for me to dig in!

296
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:27,235
Down the wrong pipe.

297
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:47,238
Grumble...

298
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:48,238
Grumble.

299
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,050
Grumble.

300
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,956
Grumble.

301
00:21:52,055 --> 00:21:53,575
Grumble.

302
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:54,943
I know! How 'bout we play some cards!

303
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:55,857
How 'bout not!

304
00:21:56,254 --> 00:21:58,793
At this rate, the entire trip is gonna be a bust,

305
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:02,875
so we might as well try and have some
fun playing games and end on a high note!

306
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:10,786
I got it!

307
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:12,296
Oh, yeah? What'cha got?

308
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:14,768
I was just thinking,

309
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:17,626
when adults get sad and bored,
they like to break out the drinks!

310
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:18,809
I guess that's true!

311
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,518
Mai! Am I right, or am I right?

312
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:27,528
I came prepared. One sec.

313
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,473
Whoa, that's super hardcore.

314
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:31,684
Yeah, you bet I am!

315
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,145
Watch out! We got a badass over here!

316
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:35,123
Ta-da!

317
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,226
Ugh! I don't care!

318
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:43,035
I'm gonna chug it!

319
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,742
Don't do it! You'll die, I bet!

320
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:47,452
Maybe Mai can share whatever she has left!

321
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:49,803
Huh?

322
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:53,053
Oh, this? It's cider.

323
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,567
Ah!

324
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:49,496
Out from the bath, have some milk.

325
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:51,242
Pretend that you're drunk.

326
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:54,543
I'm Peso!

327
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:55,821
Ten-Yen here!
