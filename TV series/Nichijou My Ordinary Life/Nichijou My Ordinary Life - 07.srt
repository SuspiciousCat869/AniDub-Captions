1
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:31,658
Hm?

2
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:32,728
I've brought him, sir.

3
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,315
Enter.

4
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,357
Why, if it isn't the great King Albert.

5
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:50,614
Why you...

6
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:54,047
Tell me, what's the meaning of this, Dolph?

7
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:59,096
Oh, calm yourself.

8
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,450
I simply hoped we could enjoy a meal together.

9
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:06,777
Well, that's a shame.

10
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:09,879
It seems as though there is no more food left for you.

11
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:17,290
Restrain him.

12
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:17,932
Sir.

13
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,758
Huh...

14
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:28,985
So that's what you were after?!

15
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,241
Now, what do you say we end this game of
hide-and-seek with that princess of yours, King Albert?

16
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:42,331
Well? Your Majesty?

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,124
Did you find her?

18
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,028
Negative!

19
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,813
I'll check this section.

20
00:01:57,904 --> 00:01:59,279
Listen closely, men!

21
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,104
We're only after the wooden cube!

22
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,868
Try not to kill the princess!

23
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:08,939
Don't think for a single moment you'll
get away with this, Dolph. Hear me?

24
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:11,711
I already have.

25
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:15,144
I'm afraid nobody has the power to stop me at this point.

26
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:18,037
You're out of allies, and out of luck.

27
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,388
What a shame. Right, Albert?

28
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:25,868
Thank you for this little globetrotting trip of yours.

29
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:30,319
It was the most perfect
opportunity you could have given me.

30
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:34,375
With the help of my subordinates, I
was able to trap you and the princess!

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,100
But why? What brought upon this betrayal?

32
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:42,947
It looks like you still don't understand at all.

33
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,536
I'm grateful for everything you've done.

34
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,549
Raising an orphan like me as one of your own,

35
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:52,221
and even appointing me as the commander of your kingdom.

36
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,118
I don't understand.

37
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:00,274
Are you really this foolish?

38
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,426
It's because I have my own ambitions.

39
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:10,292
This is the kind of divine punishment that you deserve.

40
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:11,300
Accept it.

41
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:12,718
Lord Dolph!

42
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,437
Huh?

43
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:14,933
We've located the princess!

44
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,784
Okay! Let's boogie!

45
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:17,801
Excuse me.

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,939
Take this time to think carefully
about your dying words, won't you?

47
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,185
King Albert.

48
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:24,990
You filthy traitor!

49
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:27,840
What do you think you're doing?!

50
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:30,187
Have you all completely lost your minds?

51
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:32,466
Well, if it isn't Princess Starla herself.

52
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:34,310
It's so good to see you.

53
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,860
Dolph, you bastard!

54
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:40,156
You have no freakin' idea what you've done, do you?

55
00:03:41,874 --> 00:03:45,305
What a shame to ruin that pretty
face with such a dirty mouth.

56
00:03:45,513 --> 00:03:47,308
Of course I know what I've done.

57
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:50,661
I've taken King Albert's precious wooden cube.

58
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:53,297
And once I get my hands on your cube as well,

59
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:56,108
I'll be able to revive the ancient weapon.

60
00:03:56,133 --> 00:04:00,717
Then I'll finally be able to ascend
as the new King of the Fey Kingdom!

61
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:04,236
Struggle all you wish, but no one will save you.

62
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:05,963
There's nowhere to run anymore!

63
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:08,862
Now, hand it over peacefully and I might let you live!

64
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,098
Whoa. Dolph is dead!

65
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:57,492
Hurrah! All hail the Princess, hurrah!

66
00:04:57,675 --> 00:05:01,266
All hail the princess, hurrah!
All hail the princess, hurrah!

67
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:02,235
All hail...

68
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:03,008
...the princess! Hurrah!

69
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,922
All hail the princess, hurrah!

70
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,827
All hail the princess, hurrah!

71
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,689
All hail the princess, hurrah!

72
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:10,539
All hail the princess, hurrah...

73
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,380
All hail the princess, hurrah...

74
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,292
All hail the princess, hurrah...

75
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,105
All hail the princess, hurrah...

76
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,583
All hail the princess, hurrah...

77
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:18,433
You bastards!

78
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:21,363
You guys all owe me big time!

79
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,692
Now, then! Bring me to my father right away!

80
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:36,065
Hm? Wait a sec.

81
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:39,824
Isn't this the item the princess was protecting earlier?

82
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,956
Yeah, then that must mean...

83
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:55,283
Uh? Wait... what?!

84
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,320
Then, that means...

85
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:00,488
I could have the power to be king!

86
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:03,253
No, hang on, let's not get crazy here.

87
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,031
Man, I could really use a cigarette.

88
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:11,844
After 12 long years of service,

89
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:15,900
I honestly thought I would live
out the rest of my life as a soldier.

90
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:20,098
But now... To have a chance like this...

91
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,025
I could never.

92
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,649
I have no reason to become king.

93
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,565
I wouldn't know what to do if I did.

94
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:49,392
And even with both cubes in my possession,

95
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:52,410
I couldn't revive that ancient weapon if I tried.

96
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:04,991
No!

97
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:14,175
Wha...?!

98
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:20,033
What a beautiful morning.

99
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,494
All right! I won! I think?

100
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,854
I did! Awesome!

101
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,271
Check it out! I just won a 100,000
yen in this lottery prize thing!

102
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:34,535
Really?! You gonna treat me to a cut of that or what?

103
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,811
I don't even know what to treat myself with first!

104
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,521
What do I even buy? Like a car or a house or something?

105
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:40,495
Hang on a sec.

106
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,014
This, uh, is from last year.

107
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:47,430
Uhh...

108
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,822
Don't sweat it, the lottery is
almost impossible to win, so it's fine.

109
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,475
I know, but it still breaks my heart.

110
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,626
Don't be like that.

111
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:06,337
You shouldn't be so down on your birthday, so here!

112
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:10,284
Huh? For real? A present? Thanks so much!

113
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,270
Can I open it now?

114
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,401
Mm-hm. It's really nothing special.

115
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:18,563
Just something that I had laying around the house.

116
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:20,819
I'm sure it's great! A gift is a gift!

117
00:08:20,844 --> 00:08:22,161
It's the thought that counts!

118
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:30,936
Miss Sakurai?

119
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:31,552
Huh?

120
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:36,325
Oh, Mr. Takasaki! How are you this morning?

121
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,614
I'm fine, thank you. So, um...

122
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:41,204
What are you gonna do about that Aioi kid?

123
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,731
She never even attempts to do her assigned homework.

124
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:46,369
Oh, uh! I, uh... I'm sorry!

125
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:50,439
I think a nice, stern lecture from her
teacher-slash-counselor would help set her straight.

126
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,464
Uh, sure. I can try.

127
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:54,983
I'll see if there's something I can do for her.

128
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:58,732
Now if you'll please excuse me, I have a class.

129
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:00,814
I'm counting on you!

130
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:01,933
Excuse me.

131
00:09:04,063 --> 00:09:06,779
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

132
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,623
I didn't spill any on you, did I?

133
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:10,920
No, no, I'm perfectly fine.

134
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:11,655
Don't worry about it!

135
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,575
I just want to protect her!

136
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:17,170
In my 26 years on this Earth,

137
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:20,216
I've always had absolutely no luck with women.

138
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,426
But now, feelings for her have sprouted
like a surprise bamboo shoot in the garden.

139
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:28,778
No, I can't! I'm a professional!

140
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,520
There's no room for romance in the workplace!

141
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:33,592
I have to pull myself together!

142
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:37,064
Hm? Huh. Is that...?

143
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:44,730
Miss Sakurai!

144
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:45,667
Hm?

145
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:48,323
Wait, you forgot your black folder.

146
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:50,832
Oh, thank you so much Mr. Takasaki.

147
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,402
Uh. But I have my materials right here.

148
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:54,917
Uh.

149
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:56,577
Mr. Takasaki!

150
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:59,247
Where do you think you're taking my folder?

151
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:00,890
Uh! M-My apologies.

152
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:04,235
Heh! Well then, I have to get going.

153
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:13,086
I wish I could take her mushroom picking!

154
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:17,827
Come to think of it... Does she have a boyfriend?

155
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,821
She doesn't wear a ring,

156
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:22,618
so I can assume that she isn't married.

157
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:25,694
Does that mean I might still have a chance with her?

158
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:27,815
I don't even know what kind of music she likes!

159
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,526
What's her favorite animal?
And favorite sport? And vegetable?

160
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:32,948
Ah! What am I thinking?

161
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:40,046
Be gone, impure thoughts! I can't be a role-model
to the students if I let my mind wander like this!

162
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,836
Ah, Mr. Takasaki! Let me guess,

163
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,688
you're having trouble with some of your students.

164
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:51,454
But you know, it should be fine
to ask what her favorite food is.

165
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,718
Hey, Miss Sakurai, what's your favorite thing to eat?

166
00:10:54,743 --> 00:10:57,267
Um, I like a bit of everything.

167
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,870
Ha, ha, ha! Is that so?

168
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:00,852
How do you feel about shiitake mushrooms?

169
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:02,259
They're great grilled or boiled!

170
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:05,515
That's true. And fried too, right?

171
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,287
Of course! Fried is perfectly okay!

172
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,520
I bet those would be pretty tasty.

173
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,138
Yeah, I got this!

174
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:15,387
Just act natural. It'll be fine if I just talk normally.

175
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:17,645
Like if I'm talking to eggplants or something.

176
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:18,994
Nice and calm.

177
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,369
Miss Sakurai?

178
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,542
Yes? How may I help you now?

179
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:26,623
I'm sorry for bothering you so suddenly like this.

180
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:30,889
I was just wondering if you
have a boyfriend at the moment.

181
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,836
What the hell am I saying?!

182
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,269
I'm a fool! A complete idiot! An absolute moron!

183
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:39,523
Nope! Um. I'm single.

184
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:44,256
Single... Single... Single...

185
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,690
Single... Single... Single...

186
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:48,563
Sprout! Sprout!

187
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:53,332
Sprout! Sprouting!

188
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:55,573
Um, Mr. Takasaki?

189
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,434
I'm so sorry if that was too forward!

190
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:01,002
It worked out all right!

191
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,754
And I wish you the best of luck

192
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:04,508
with your next class, Miss Sakurai.

193
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:08,346
Thank you! I wish you the same as well, Mr. Takasaki.

194
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:09,569
Thanks.

195
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,081
Right, excuse me then. I'll see you later!

196
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:16,283
I wish you the same as well.

197
00:12:16,426 --> 00:12:18,042
I wish you the same as well...

198
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,106
I wish you the same as well...

199
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:22,082
I wish you the same as well...

200
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:27,217
Well, I see that you're in good spirits today.

201
00:12:27,907 --> 00:12:30,957
Helvetica Standard.

202
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:33,285
Wait! Please!

203
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,421
Give me back my sickle!

204
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:39,672
If I don't pawn off this sickle
for food, I'll die from starvation!

205
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:42,690
Oh no, a dead end!

206
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,112
Well, I'll be.

207
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:51,169
Please give it back to me!

208
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:52,486
Oh, man!

209
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:59,474
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

210
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:02,699
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and a one, two, three! ♪

211
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:04,986
Wow! I won!

212
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,447
Oh hey, thanks!

213
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:14,434
And that's not all!

214
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,474
Add the coconut milk.

215
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:16,833
For tomorrow's forecast.

216
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:18,057
Miracle's in a pinch!

217
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:19,917
But I've got more where that came from!

218
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:52,578
Hey, I bet you I can name something that you've
never ever, ever thought about before in your entire life!

219
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:54,221
Sure, go ahead.

220
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,822
A quirky office lady's travel diary!

221
00:13:59,013 --> 00:13:59,930
I have a bit.

222
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:01,103
Uhh...

223
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:05,261
Hurry!

224
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:07,652
Looks like the train is gonna leave at any second!

225
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:09,929
Wait! Hang on!

226
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,204
All right! We're in!

227
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:11,870
Safe!

228
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,659
You're the only one who made it.

229
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,889
<i>Selamat tinggal</i> .

230
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:28,903
Right. Um. Let's keep those orders coming in.

231
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:30,450
Yellowtail, and a Hamachi!

232
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,325
Let's keep those orders coming in.

233
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:34,805
One tuna and a fluke fin please.

234
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:36,055
An eel for me.

235
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,980
So, one order of albacore, and...

236
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,369
Heh. I forgot the rest.

237
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:46,559
Wow, he forgot it all.

238
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:02,441
Huh?

239
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:13,230
Hm?

240
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:14,682
Oh, hello there!

241
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,441
Huh? Uh, yeah, hi?

242
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:18,965
What do you think you're doing?

243
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,879
Uh. Heh, heh...

244
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,418
Hey, do you mind? Why do you keep doing that?

245
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:37,445
I can't help it! That thing's so cool and weird!

246
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,383
Huh? What? No, it is not!

247
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:42,441
It's normal! Keys are a very popular trend right now.

248
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,163
Huh.

249
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:49,591
How'd you pull that one off, huh?

250
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:53,946
C'mon, what's your secret! I just wanna see it! Chill out!

251
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,676
Okay. Fine. I'll go.

252
00:15:59,078 --> 00:15:59,613
Bye.

253
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:00,356
What?

254
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,548
Oh, come on, I was just messing with you!

255
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:11,210
Well, I didn't care for it.

256
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:13,244
So can you please give me my arm back?

257
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:13,958
Huh?

258
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:15,325
Pick a hand!

259
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,372
It's in your bag!

260
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:17,645
Hey! You got it!

261
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:19,242
All right, question number two.

262
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,329
Huh?

263
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:24,097
If Kenta's mom goes out to the
supermarket and picks up ten apples,

264
00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:30,005
and then eats three of them later that day, and gives
four of the remaining apples to her neighbor Yumiko then

265
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:31,820
where would you find your missing arm?

266
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:32,844
In your bag!

267
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:35,011
Oh, wow! You got another one right!

268
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,483
All I want is my arm, so can you just...?

269
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:39,724
Only if you get the answer the final question!

270
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:42,676
If you want this arm, then you gotta earn it!

271
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,621
But why? It was my arm in the first place!

272
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:47,351
Do you want it back or not?

273
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,029
Yeah, of course I do.

274
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,660
Then let's get started.

275
00:16:50,728 --> 00:16:53,393
First, try saying the word "bag" ten times fast.

276
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:55,608
Hm?

277
00:16:56,424 --> 00:17:01,399
Bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag.

278
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:03,785
What kind of cloth would you use to clean up a mess?

279
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,142
A bag! No, wait, I mean a rag!

280
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:07,382
Boop! Boop!

281
00:17:07,456 --> 00:17:08,017
Huh?!

282
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:09,984
The correct answer was a towel.

283
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:12,851
No way! That's so unfair!

284
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:14,999
I'm just playin'.

285
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:15,430
You're good.

286
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:19,467
Okay, now can you stop following me around?

287
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:22,152
All right, I'll stop. Don't worry.

288
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:24,503
Heh.

289
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:30,780
Huh. Would ya look at that.

290
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:34,772
Heh, heh.

291
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:46,803
It came off!

292
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:50,972
Finally! It came off!

293
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:53,221
I'm free!

294
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:55,293
Huh?

295
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:09,900
Mio!

296
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,939
Hm?

297
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:12,186
Hey, I'll walk with you.

298
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:14,659
Okay. Are you on your way back from class too?

299
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:18,114
Yeah, Oh, I just met the most interesting person!

300
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,773
Really? Tell me about 'em.

301
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,149
Well, her arm came off.

302
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:21,760
Huh?

303
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,532
And she had a key in her back.

304
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:24,807
What?! No way!

305
00:18:24,832 --> 00:18:26,740
I'm not kidding! That's how she was!

306
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:28,478
Sounds pretty weird to me.

307
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:41,926
I want people to look at me and think,

308
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:44,532
"Oh, he looks pretty cool!"

309
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,876
Hey! You ready, Nano?

310
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,138
Okay!

311
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:53,451
Magic ball!

312
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,911
Well, she is just a child.

313
00:18:57,977 --> 00:18:58,736
Not surprising.

314
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:00,776
I win!

315
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:02,818
Aw man, I lost!

316
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:04,064
What are they doing?

317
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,246
That is not how you play this game.

318
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,047
Sakamoto! How many points did I just get?

319
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:09,801
What?!

320
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:12,248
'Kay! It's my turn to throw the ball!

321
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:13,288
Go!

322
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:16,489
She hasn't even pitched yet!

323
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:24,485
Is she trying to kill me with that?

324
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,891
Sakamoto! How many points did I get for that one, huh?

325
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,027
Oh, come on!

326
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:30,976
She swung again!

327
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:32,754
You're up. Go get 'em, champ.

328
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,210
How do you expect me to do that? There's
no way hold that bat in these little paws!

329
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:37,575
Aww...

330
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,770
Unbelievable.

331
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:42,880
You'd think you would understand
how paws work at this point.

332
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:44,925
Since you're poking at my pads all the time.

333
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:47,610
You kids can be so simple-mind... ed...

334
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:01,246
Aww...

335
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,851
Uh, okay then. Mew-ving on.

336
00:20:07,894 --> 00:20:12,399
The way you kids are playing isn't safe, so, I uh
guess I'll just have to sit here and keep an eye on you.

337
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:14,861
Why don't you just put the bat down and play catch?

338
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,523
Sure!

339
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,562
You got it, coach!

340
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:17,205
Coach?

341
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:20,307
Coach, what do we do if we only have one glove?

342
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,048
I think you'll be fine without one.

343
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:24,721
Hey, coach! This glove doesn't fit my little hand.

344
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:26,707
It goes on the other hand like you had it before!

345
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:27,846
Help us, coach!

346
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:28,995
C'mon, coach!

347
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:32,406
Huh?! What would you kids do without me?

348
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,638
Hakase! Here comes the ball!

349
00:20:35,663 --> 00:20:36,900
Bring it!

350
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,312
Oh no, where on earth could it have landed?

351
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:51,307
And then the teacher totally freaked out at me!

352
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,037
Can't blame him.

353
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,468
Agreed.

354
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,700
You guys really think so?

355
00:20:57,908 --> 00:21:00,085
I think he went a little overboard, personally.

356
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:03,972
Yeah, maybe, but you gotta watch out from now on.

357
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,352
Yeah, I guess you're right.

358
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:07,132
It could only get worse from here.

359
00:21:12,243 --> 00:21:13,607
Oh, thank you, sir.

360
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:19,780
A true gentleman!

361
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,269
So, do mind if I borrow it from ya sometime, Mai, please?

362
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:24,261
Sure.

363
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:25,099
Great! You're the best!

364
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:27,440
I wonder if that's the girl my sister met?

365
00:21:27,658 --> 00:21:28,964
...man I'm starving!

366
00:23:27,337 --> 00:23:29,000
I am a Wooden Cube.

367
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:33,238
My master can only obtain the ancient
weapon of legend by using my power.

368
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:37,817
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 8.

369
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:39,801
Look forward to it!
