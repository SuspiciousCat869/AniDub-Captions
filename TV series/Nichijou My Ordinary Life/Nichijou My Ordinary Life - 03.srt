1
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,249
Hey, can I ask you something?

2
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,315
Yeah, of course.

3
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,219
Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but why
do you wear those exact same hair ties every day?

4
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:25,417
Oh, you mean these?

5
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:27,270
Hm... 'Cause I wanna.

6
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:28,669
Sure, but why though?

7
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:30,655
There's no real reason, it's just my thing.

8
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:31,978
Okay...

9
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:38,250
Aw man, I forgot my math notebook.

10
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:40,727
Hang on! We have a math class today?

11
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:43,446
Of course we do! That's why we had homework for it.

12
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,265
I'm gonna run back and grab my stuff.

13
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,059
You go ahead!

14
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:50,070
Well. I didn't do that homework, anyway,

15
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:51,882
so none of this matters to me.

16
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:55,385
Oh! Hey, Mai!

17
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,930
<i>Selamat pagi</i> !

18
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:11,339
Well, well, well, look who it is!

19
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:12,839
It's my bestest pal herself!

20
00:03:12,898 --> 00:03:15,573
You've finally come to grace me with your presence, huh?

21
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,680
You sure do take things to a whole 'nother level, dontcha?

22
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,698
Y'know! Like a mountain!

23
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:23,919
Tell me! What's it like being
an actual real-life mountain?

24
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:30,760
Well, I guess she doesn't like being called a mountain.

25
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,086
I get it.

26
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:06,120
You're mad at me. And I think I understand why.

27
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:09,382
Yesterday I stole a bite of broccoli from your lunch.

28
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:10,833
The last piece.

29
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,134
And now you're angry.

30
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:14,192
But don't worry.

31
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,700
I got you a new thing of broccoli!

32
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:19,953
You shoulda told me that you liked it
so much before I shoved it in my mouth!

33
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:25,351
But we can put all that behind us, now, 'cause you've
got a new broccoli! So, there we go. Problem solved!

34
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:31,853
Anyway, my old man flipped the
channel just as fast as he could.

35
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:37,513
It's not about the broccoli then.

36
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:40,873
Maybe the cauliflower?

37
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:42,357
Probably not.

38
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,748
I've done so many potentially offensive things,

39
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:59,685
I don't even know which one she'd be mad at me for!

40
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:05,307
Although, there is one thing that does stand out.

41
00:05:05,547 --> 00:05:07,955
I'll have to bite the bullet and apologize.

42
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:11,285
I don't want her to stay mad at me forever!

43
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:12,446
Okay!

44
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,605
Hey, Mai! Listen!

45
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:19,242
Sorry for eating your main dish!

46
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,941
And for stealing your apple bunny!

47
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:25,821
And your rice!

48
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,384
And for leaving the beans!

49
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:29,627
Oh, come on!

50
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,460
Why are you so mad at me?

51
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:34,618
That's all I can think of!

52
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,269
If it's not your lunch, then what is it?

53
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,511
Maybe it's because of what happened that one time!

54
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:42,966
When that Buddha statue was on your desk.

55
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:46,826
Is it because I accidently snapped its head off?

56
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,450
Or that I took it home and did a crappy job at fixing it?

57
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:54,239
U-Uh!

58
00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:57,298
Was it because I buried it and had a secret funeral?

59
00:05:58,862 --> 00:06:02,686
Or because I changed my mind, dug it
back up, and left a memorial on your desk?

60
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:08,174
Or because I changed my mind again
and decided to cremate it instead?

61
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:09,103
Well?

62
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:11,227
Help me out! I'm dying here!

63
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:26,330
Ah. Okay, so you were just
listening to music this whole time.

64
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,497
You couldn't hear anything, could you?

65
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:33,411
It's no problem, since I really was just talking
to myself anyway, so you didn't really miss much!

66
00:06:33,537 --> 00:06:35,111
Man, that was a close one.

67
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:38,089
I almost spilled every bean I had to her.

68
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:39,051
That last part.

69
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,528
Huh?

70
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:40,943
Buddha.

71
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:42,641
I didn't know.

72
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:51,644
Excuse me, Tanaka?

73
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:54,764
I'm sorry, but do you have a moment?

74
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,197
Well. Uh.

75
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:58,062
I just wanted to say that...

76
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,701
It's about your hair.

77
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:02,490
Don't you think it's getting a little big these days?

78
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:03,323
You know what?

79
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:04,720
Yes?

80
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,526
How 'bout a pancake?

81
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,345
Ah, crap!

82
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,800
I totally forgot I had to do this worksheet!

83
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:20,635
But I still have five minutes until class starts.

84
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:25,528
Mio already let me copy her work yesterday.

85
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:27,211
I'm begging you!

86
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:32,297
I can't ask her again!

87
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:35,376
That means, I have no choice.

88
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:37,547
Hey, uh, Mai?

89
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,336
So, this is totally embarrassing.

90
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:44,159
But I kinda, sorta, completely
forgot to do today's math homework.

91
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,131
Do you think it'd be possible if I could take the
quickest little peek at yours before class starts?

92
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:48,757
Kay.

93
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,968
Oh, wow, really? Thanks!

94
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:54,519
Just gimme one sec! I'll have it copied in no time!

95
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,957
This sucks! I'm so late!

96
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:58,546
This sucks! This sucks!

97
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,628
Don't make such a racket in the morning, Masao!

98
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:02,575
This sucks!

99
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,959
I'm so frickin' late!

100
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:06,705
Oh, yeah? Well, I just got laid off!

101
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:13,713
Well, isn't that something.

102
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:19,505
Sorry Mai, but I think you might have
given me the wrong paper by mistake, because...

103
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:26,052
I'll buy you some juice!

104
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:28,389
Here.

105
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,772
Thanks so much!

106
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm so late for school!

107
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:34,004
My dad just got laid off! It sucks for both of us!

108
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,843
Wait! The heck is that?!

109
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,892
Look behind you, Masao!

110
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,464
You've got way bigger problems now!

111
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:41,768
What are you gonna do?

112
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:44,460
Uh. I mean...

113
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,106
I've got bigger problems!

114
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:49,672
Why am I getting caught up in this
weirdo comic?! I can't get distracted!

115
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,071
I'll throw in an extra snack if you help me!

116
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,849
Here.

117
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:56,297
You're the best! All right, yeah, cool.

118
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:59,405
That's what I'm talkin' about. I knew you had it in you.

119
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:02,280
You didn't have to mess with me like that, you big tease!

120
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:04,029
Anyway, time to knock this thing out!

121
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,174
I don't even have today's worksheet. Oh, well.

122
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,345
I want to go to New Orleans.

123
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:33,956
So. Anyone know the solution?

124
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,616
Not a single person?

125
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:40,161
Mr. Akagi's class is the worst thing ever.

126
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,663
You get bonked on the head if you forget your homework,

127
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,387
and get yelled at for answering a question wrong.

128
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:50,458
Remember that a lack of in-class
participation will negatively affect your grade.

129
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:54,261
So that's how he's gonna play it.

130
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:57,356
Well, it'll take more than that to trap me, sir!

131
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:02,490
Now, what to do?

132
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:07,835
I guess since today is the 23rd, let's go
with the student assigned to seat number 23.

133
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,946
Not me!

134
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:09,875
Nakanojou!

135
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:11,589
Huh, he's absent?

136
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:12,282
What?!

137
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,909
Ohh! An arm cramp!

138
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:21,675
Of all times to be stuck like this.

139
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:26,381
Oh no, he might actually call
on me now that I can't back down.

140
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:31,162
I've gotta hide in the blind spot of his laser eyes.

141
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:32,067
Just gonna...

142
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:35,772
I'll pretend it was the chair!

143
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:36,676
Give it a little scoot.

144
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:40,041
Hey! I think maybe somebody's phone was just ringing.

145
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,663
Vibrate only!

146
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,965
Let's just hope that they have a "smart phone."

147
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:48,307
Get it?

148
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:51,687
Looks like you kids are in a great mood for math!

149
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:52,751
Right?

150
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:15,541
Uh, so, anyway, moving on.

151
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,097
Miss Aioi.

152
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:26,678
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

153
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:29,951
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and a one, two, three! ♪

154
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:31,318
Ready!

155
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:33,414
And lift off!

156
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:34,925
Woosh!

157
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,910
Why though?

158
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:00,469
Okay. I already bought sugar and milk,

159
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:02,047
so I can mark those off the list.

160
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:03,990
But I feel like I'm forgetting something important.

161
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,769
Did you see that insane sale on eggs today?

162
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,469
Yeah, I don't have that much room in my fridge, but...

163
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:13,004
Wait that's right! There was a special on
eggs at the store, and the sale ends today!

164
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:17,384
Mm... Do I have enough time?

165
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:20,237
If I hurry back now, I think I can make it.

166
00:12:21,746 --> 00:12:22,443
Huh?

167
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:24,231
Aww!

168
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,132
A little black kitty cat!

169
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:31,701
Aww! You're just the cutest!

170
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:40,598
Uh! Hold on.

171
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:42,668
We can't adopt a cat right now.

172
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,675
I already have my hands full with Hakase.

173
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:47,266
Sorry, kitty.

174
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,814
I'm back from the grocery store.

175
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:08,977
Hiya Nano.

176
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:10,814
Huh?! It's that cat!

177
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,163
I captured the beast!

178
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:14,947
You can't bring in cats that you find on the street.

179
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:17,108
What? But he's so cute.

180
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:20,300
You do have a point.

181
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:23,022
But he still can't stay here!

182
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:25,130
Come on! Don't you think he's cute?

183
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:29,714
Well, I guess I do. But it's not about his cuteness.

184
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:34,440
It's just that, taking care of an
animal can be a big responsibility. So...

185
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,172
Can you handle it, Hakase?

186
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:36,824
I can!

187
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:39,714
Even though you won't be getting any assistance from me?

188
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:42,474
That means you're the one who has to clean his litter box.

189
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:44,315
You're not gonna help with anything?

190
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:47,042
Fine! Then you're not allowed to pet him ever!

191
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,106
That's not fair!

192
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:52,974
All right, maybe I can help... just a little bit.

193
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:58,021
Hakase! He's napping on my lap!

194
00:13:58,288 --> 00:13:59,746
I'm gonna pet him now!

195
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,182
He's so fluffy!

196
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,126
Huh? Don't hog him!

197
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:09,556
I want to pet him, too!

198
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:12,950
His belly is so fluffy!

199
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:15,525
And his sides are super fluffy too!

200
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,541
His right paw is extra fluffy!

201
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,972
And his left paw is super fluffy too!

202
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,221
His little tail is the fluffiest!

203
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,915
His tail isn't as fluffy as this spot behind his ears.

204
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:30,589
Huh? But I think it's probably
one of the fluffiest features he has.

205
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:32,795
You're wrong! His tail isn't fluffy at all!

206
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:43,612
What's the matter?

207
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,583
You aren't hurt anywhere, are you?

208
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:46,318
Eureka!

209
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,583
Hold on a second!

210
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:49,566
Hakase?

211
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:03,279
Hey, Nano! Check it out!

212
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:05,211
I made a scarf that'll let him talk!

213
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:06,981
What an amazing invention!

214
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:09,087
Now, let's have Sakamoto try it out.

215
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:10,788
Sakamoto?

216
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,356
You decided to call the cat Sakamoto?

217
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,620
Yup! 'Cause it's the name that's on his box.

218
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:18,510
I guess that's the simplest way to go about it.

219
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:20,981
Okay! All done!

220
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:23,221
You think he's really gonna talk?

221
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,889
He'll talk, all right.

222
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:29,649
Here it comes.

223
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:38,682
I don't care who you think you
are, that petting was excessive.

224
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,970
Huh?

225
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:44,443
Also, it's common knowledge
that a cat meows when it's hungry.

226
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:46,944
Not that it matters, since I can spell it out for you now.

227
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:48,024
I'm sorry.

228
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:49,669
I wasn't aware of that.

229
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,218
And then there's you!

230
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:54,615
Taking the name straight from the
side of the box? Have some imagination.

231
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:57,337
I'm so sorry.

232
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:59,916
I told you the same thing, so I agree with him.

233
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,020
Yeah, but!

234
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:03,897
How old are you two anyway?

235
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:04,958
Eight years old.

236
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:06,141
I'm one year old.

237
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,929
In your human years, I'd be 20 years old.

238
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:13,314
It's Mr. Sakamoto. Capiche?

239
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,308
Capiche...?

240
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:19,406
While I do appreciate the free room and
board, there needs to be some ground rules.

241
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:22,863
And you'll respect those rules
since I'm the oldest one here.

242
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:25,066
Another thing you should know about cats...

243
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:28,187
Just because we're fluffy, doesn't
mean we can be pet indiscriminately.

244
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,512
Umm...

245
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:32,818
To be honest with you, I enjoy
being pet. But there's a limit.

246
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:36,250
You understand? Life is all about moderation.

247
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,436
I'll go put him back where you found him.

248
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,460
'Kay...

249
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:42,457
Huh?

250
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,877
My humblest apologies.

251
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:53,914
Hm?

252
00:17:07,837 --> 00:17:10,835
Helvetica Standard.

253
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:14,445
Here you are!

254
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:15,985
Really?

255
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:18,615
But I'm late on my rent payment again this month.

256
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:21,268
And you're still okay with giving me free food?

257
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:23,918
It's fine, I'll always here to help someone in need.

258
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:27,022
If there's anything else I can
do, feel free to let me know.

259
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,245
Do you mean it? Well then, uh...

260
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,499
How about some money?

261
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:33,733
For the rent.

262
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:37,276
Don't think that I'm going to let a
greedy goblin take advantage of my kindness.

263
00:17:37,694 --> 00:17:39,079
Yeah, that makes sense.

264
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,192
Now. Vice-Principal.

265
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:47,216
Is this...?

266
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,979
What, is something the matter, Principal?

267
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:51,027
You're sweating.

268
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:54,333
Why don't you go ahead and look inside the doll's body?

269
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:12,836
If I win this thing, I don't owe you the
extra snacks from any of our previous deals.

270
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:13,669
Got it?

271
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:15,126
Yeah.

272
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:17,404
I'm totally gonna win!

273
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,519
The battle for snacks and juice begins!

274
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:20,860
Ready... Go!

275
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:25,689
It's okay, Mai!

276
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:27,797
You were a little early on the start.

277
00:18:28,376 --> 00:18:29,679
Isn't that right, Mio?

278
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:33,820
I suppose it's possible she jumped the gun. Just a tad.

279
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:36,397
See? It's fine. We can start over!

280
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:38,323
Arm wrestlers, take your positions.

281
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:40,931
Ready... Go!

282
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,459
And Mai is the winner!

283
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:47,024
Huh?

284
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:49,288
You caught me off guard!

285
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:52,046
I'll admit, I might have underestimated you.

286
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,326
But now I'm all warmed up and ready to go for real.

287
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:56,686
All right, bring it on!

288
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:03,774
Man, I didn't think my arm would still be this sore!

289
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:05,631
It's from my all-nighter!

290
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,500
But I'm just gonna shake it
off and get my head in the game.

291
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:13,290
'Bout time I got serious. Think you can handle me?

292
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,358
Ah, dang it! I completely spaced on that one!

293
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,481
I can't believe I threw three rounds in a row!

294
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:21,107
I never woulda seen that coming!

295
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,885
That's quite the surprise!

296
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:26,185
Okay. That's enough.

297
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:28,441
Hold on. Just you wait and see.

298
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:31,856
Mm-hm, I get it. I understand what happened now.

299
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:33,214
Of course! It's simple!

300
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,092
You're all out of beginner's luck, and now
it's the end for you! Prepare to meet your doom!

301
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:37,981
Ready!

302
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:48,186
Well, isn't this an interesting turn of events?

303
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:49,647
What do they call you again?

304
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:50,341
Hey now.

305
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,258
The immoveable object, right?

306
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:57,255
Mio, hold this for me!

307
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:01,266
'Cause I'm about to unleash the unstoppable force.

308
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:03,920
Prepare for something really special!

309
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,478
Would you please cut that out?!

310
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,597
It's because you're not even trying!

311
00:20:09,704 --> 00:20:12,172
I can't fight for real if you don't take this seriously!

312
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:14,056
Come at me with everything you've got this time!

313
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,797
I'll unleash my ultimate moves!

314
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:17,186
Earth Destroyer!

315
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,241
Shooting Star!

316
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,845
Death!

317
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:21,495
Death!

318
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:46,566
Why? I don't get it.

319
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:48,759
Why does it have to be this way?

320
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:51,096
It's only arm wrestling.

321
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,797
How can you be so freakin' good at it?

322
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:59,428
I completely forgot I had to pee this entire time.

323
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:01,320
I'll be right back.

324
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:05,666
I knew something was throwing
me off from the very beginning.

325
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:06,435
Yuuko?

326
00:21:07,397 --> 00:21:09,510
One extra snack from the station.

327
00:21:10,214 --> 00:21:11,879
And 23 juices.

328
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:51,942
My stupid arm cramp got me caught and yelled at
for not doing my homework. Today really is the worst.

329
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:54,319
More importantly, tell me!

330
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:56,101
I need to know what happens to Masao!

331
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,117
Come on, Mai!

332
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:03,351
Okay fine, I'll buy you another
juice if you show me what happens next.

333
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:03,863
Here.

334
00:23:03,887 --> 00:23:04,502
Yoink.

335
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:23,337
I don't know what I expected.

336
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:29,853
What was that <i>natto</i> doing inside of me anyway?

337
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:31,884
Was that supposed to be some kind of joke?

338
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,442
Well, if it was, it was "natto" very funny!

339
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:36,108
Really, that's the last "straw."

340
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:39,116
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 4.

341
00:23:39,141 --> 00:23:40,317
Look forward to it!
