1
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:07,031
Okay, the testing period is over.

2
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:09,714
Yay!

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,437
Whoa. That's quite the celebration.

4
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:18,364
They must be relieved after putting so much
effort into their studies. It warms my heart.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,431
♪ The test is over! And it was a snap! ♪

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,799
My life flashed before my eyes. Am I
dreaming? Pinch me as hard as you can!

7
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:28,451
We finished! Nothing can hurt you now.

8
00:00:28,476 --> 00:00:31,892
My parents are sending each and every
one of you a bag of rice as a gift!

9
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:33,534
Yeah! Thanks rice man!

10
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,534
The two of us are getting married!

11
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:36,701
Wow!

12
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:38,525
Come on! All together now!

13
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:39,485
Hip-hip...

14
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:41,684
Hooray!

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,698
What the...? Could you not?

16
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:45,497
This is overkill!

17
00:00:45,528 --> 00:00:46,198
Hooray! Hooray!

18
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:34,880
Ah, Mio. Good morrow.

19
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,333
No, this is all wrong!

20
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:53,040
You're supposed to say something like,

21
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:55,868
"Huh? Uh. The heck is that?"

22
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:57,361
Be surprised!

23
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,992
Aw, you're not still mad at me, are you?

24
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:04,101
Can't you just admit it was kinda funny?

25
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,246
I made your mont blanc a Knight.

26
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:10,076
Nah, I still could've eaten it
if I took that chess piece out,

27
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:11,966
so it really wasn't that big of a deal.

28
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:16,460
Yeah, right!

29
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:18,013
Sis! Why?!

30
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,592
How could you do that to me?!

31
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,117
I was so looking forward to my dessert, and you knew it!

32
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:24,494
Why did you have to stick a knight on the top?!

33
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,338
I guess... I thought it'd look cool.

34
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:28,833
Head!

35
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:35,052
You'd think she'd be used to
my practical jokes at this point.

36
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:50,389
Gah, she's so annoying.

37
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:53,820
They only make ten of those mont blancs a day.

38
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,387
Not that it matters.

39
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:58,278
Cause even if she knew that,

40
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,583
she's always pulling stuff like this.

41
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:02,561
I thought now that she's in college,

42
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:04,777
she'd finally understand when to stop.

43
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:07,017
But whatever, it's fine.

44
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:13,738
I can let it slide for today, because I've got
better things to do. And she has absolutely no idea!

45
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:16,184
I knew she'd be up to something, so I was ready.

46
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:19,158
I disguised my shortcake, so it's safe and sound.

47
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:20,031
Ahh!

48
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:25,593
Checkmate! She got me!

49
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:28,158
I can't believe she freakin' got me!

50
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,788
The strawberry!

51
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:36,038
She stole the crown jewel of my rare,
only-five-made-per-day gourmet shortcake!

52
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:38,940
Don't you worry, Strawberry! I'm coming for you!

53
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:40,043
Hold on!

54
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:42,610
Where is it?

55
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:47,773
What did you do to my precious, delicious, sweet...?!

56
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,126
Namaste.

57
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:55,280
Gut!

58
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,695
Why are you so mean to me?

59
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:05,529
A shortcake without the strawberry isn't special anymore!

60
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:12,695
Now it's just a stupid, normal piece of shortcake!

61
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:30,625
♪ Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me ♪

62
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:35,882
♪ Happy birthday dear Yoshino ♪

Sis...

65
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:48,394
Mio.

66
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,693
Today isn't even your birthday!

67
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:26,117
I've been wanting to try this place for forever!

68
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:28,226
And didn't you see it in a magazine?

69
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:29,186
Sure did.

70
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:31,535
And it came with a coupon!

71
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:32,934
No point in showing it to me.

72
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:34,527
I'm having the Herring Soba.

73
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,127
Ah, hot dish in this weather? You connoisseur.

74
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:38,326
With no herring.

75
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:42,521
Then that's just noodles in water!

76
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:43,809
Ah...

77
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,580
Ah-hem. And what're you going to get, Mio?

78
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:48,521
I think I'm gonna get the Zaru Soba.

79
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:52,263
Ah, the classic pick for a non-foodie That's a safe one.

80
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,543
It's good enough for me. What're you getting?

81
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,077
I think I'm gonna have myself

82
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:57,944
the Summer Veggie Tempura Special.

83
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,125
It's pretty bold to go with a rice dish at a noodle place.

84
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:01,765
Right?

85
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,165
Yeah, if you say so.

86
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:06,634
You get it! It's a seasonal item, too.

87
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,451
This kind of dish is special, so
you never know when it'll be back.

88
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,833
Probably next summer.

89
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:13,395
Maybe you don't get it.

90
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:16,431
Haven't you ever heard of living in the moment, Mio?

91
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,870
What matters most is the here and now!

92
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:19,886
Oh, really?

93
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:23,271
I'm sure you'll understand what I mean one day.

94
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:24,335
Yeah, okay.

95
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,136
Excuse me!

96
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:34,378
What would you like to order?

97
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,684
One Herring Soba, a Zaru Soba,

98
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,141
and... the seasonal... special dish...

99
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:48,352
Herring Soba, Zaru Soba, and a Summer Veggie
Tempura Special. I'll be back with your order soon.

100
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:56,187
I heard they make all of their
soba noodles by hand at this place.

101
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,944
Can't get any more authentic than that!

102
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,193
Oh, I wonder what this buckwheat dumpling thing is.

103
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,965
It's the squishy stuff they make using the soba flour!

104
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:06,872
Wow, for real?

105
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:08,504
Thank you for waiting.

106
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:11,837
This is the Herring Soba here,

107
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:14,601
and the order of the Zaru Soba for you.

108
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:19,767
I don't mind if you guys start
eating your food without me!

109
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:20,892
If you're sure...

110
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:22,062
Before it gets cold.

111
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,530
But mine's supposed to be cold.

112
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:26,827
It must be because my order is from the seasonal menu.

113
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,901
I bet they're taking extra time and care to make it!

114
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:51,240
Your food is taking a while.

115
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:54,548
Guess they need extra time to fry all those vegetables.

116
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,040
Or maybe they went out to pick 'em, so they're fresh!

117
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,998
That's it! No wonder they're slow!

118
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:17,872
I think you could order your food a la carte here too.

119
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:19,332
Hm, really?

120
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:26,707
Finally!

121
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,274
Another table's.

122
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:31,131
Too bad.

123
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:37,668
God Dammit!

124
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:39,267
Hey! Just settle down, Yuuko!

125
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:41,919
How can I?! This is taking freakin' forever!

126
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:45,019
I don't care if they're famous, even if they
capture the flavors, they'll never capture my feelings!

127
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,409
You're not making any sense!

128
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:47,625
They're gonna feel my wrath!

129
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,102
Thank you for waiting.

130
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,463
'Bout time! Do you know how long I...

131
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:57,468
Uh, thanks.

132
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:10,457
You guys can like, read a book or something.

133
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,790
This might take a little bit.

134
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,676
Things we think are freakin' cool!

135
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:25,573
Uh.

136
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:31,367
Young chess players!

137
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:50,127
I've got my mosquito repellent going,

138
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:52,190
but I thought it'd be doing more than it is.

139
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,273
They won't leave in the late night.

140
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:56,432
Mogami River.

141
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:57,742
Ha!

142
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:12,568
Ha! Huh! H'ya!

143
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:22,810
Well, it looks like you're just
minding your own business anyway.

144
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:25,845
Guess I'll go crawl back into bed then.

145
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:26,995
Sneak attack!

146
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:37,164
Victory!

147
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:39,000
Bug off!

148
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,826
I have taken a precious life.

149
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:54,287
I'll do it again!

150
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:03,322
I hit! And I smack!

151
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:05,226
But they never learn their lesson!

152
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,570
But what else can I do? I'm running out of options!

153
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:11,702
Listen, Mom!

154
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:14,069
We can't live in this infested house anymore!

155
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:16,374
We just have to move! Now!

156
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,855
Do you have any idea what time it is?!

157
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,453
Now shut up and go to sleep!

158
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:05,299
Helvetica Standard.

159
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:10,320
Chirashizushi. You try.

160
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,034
Tsurasuzusu.

161
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:16,642
No! Chi-ra-shi-zu-shi!

162
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:17,723
Go!

163
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:21,528
Tsu-ra-su-zu-su.

164
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:23,363
No, no! Chi.

165
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:24,680
Chi.

166
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,434
Ra.

167
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:26,763
Ra.

168
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:27,723
Shi.

169
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:29,168
Shi.

170
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,153
Zu.

171
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,717
Zu.

172
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:32,626
Shi.

173
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:34,006
Shi.

174
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:37,799
Yes! Chirashizushi. Go!

175
00:13:38,142 --> 00:13:39,721
Tsurasuzusu.

176
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:03,137
Sakamoto! Check it out!

177
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:06,544
The bottom of this popsicle says I'm a winner!

178
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:08,670
See, look at it!

179
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:10,980
You really shouldn't be eating that right now.

180
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,409
Why can't I eat it?!

181
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,524
Well because, it's gonna spoil your appetite.

182
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:17,500
Yummy!

183
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:23,737
I don't get why you got so worked up
over a popsicle stick. You're such a child.

184
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,373
It wasn't a normal stick!

185
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:27,710
I won it upside-down!

186
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:33,296
Doesn't matter which way the stick is going when the
outcome's the same. So, you found out two bites earlier.

187
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:34,328
Big deal.

188
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:37,157
Seriously. You kids can be so easy to please.

189
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:39,492
You get excited over the smallest things.

190
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:41,940
It's a crab!

191
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:45,052
They never show up! It's like one in a million!

192
00:14:45,226 --> 00:14:48,016
I'm gonna save you for last, little guy!

193
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:52,729
Thank you very much for the meal.

194
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,351
What's this?

195
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:56,636
You've barely eaten any your food, Hakase.

196
00:14:57,417 --> 00:15:00,434
Let me guess, you had snacks this afternoon, didn't you?

197
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:01,863
I'm not proud of it.

198
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:05,454
How many times have I told you not to snack before meals?!

199
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:11,296
All gone.

200
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:12,446
All gone?!

201
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,719
You ate a whole month's worth of snacks?!

202
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,794
That wasn't a compliment!

203
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:19,403
What am I gonna do with you.

204
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:21,576
I only did it because Sakamoto told me to!

205
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:22,984
Is that true?!

206
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:38,486
Sakamoto said food gets yucky
faster in the summer so I had to do it.

207
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:40,093
I didn't mean you had to eat all of them.

208
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,976
Snacks go in the tummy. Where else would I put them?

209
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:43,606
What kind of argument is that?

210
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:44,642
Sakamoto!

211
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,702
Why are you even considering her side?

212
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:50,125
If you look at it objectively, the
situation's pretty black-and-white!

213
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:51,909
But you only have black fur.

214
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:52,860
That's true.

215
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,630
Uh, what does that have to do with anything?

216
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:55,877
That's enough.

217
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,134
There's no point in arguing anymore.

218
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,312
I've decided...

219
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,981
Hakase won't be getting her strawberry juice.

220
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:05,912
Uh. I won't eat anymore snacks!

221
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:07,093
I said no.

222
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:09,114
I'll give you my winning popsicle stick!

223
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:10,249
I don't want it!

224
00:16:10,274 --> 00:16:12,537
I'll eat all of my vegetables!

225
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:13,412
You better!

226
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:18,560
Hmph.

227
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:22,929
I'll take the key off your back!

228
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,501
I'll let it slide this one time.

229
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,550
But next time, no snacks for a month. I mean it.

230
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:33,630
Okay!

231
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,307
So...

232
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:38,772
Wait, if I give it to her now,

233
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,799
I feel like our deal is gonna fall through.

234
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:44,653
You can have your juice after
you take the key off my back.

235
00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:45,067
Ahh!

236
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:49,124
Fine then. Gimme a sec.

237
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,640
Huh? 'Kay!

238
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:03,596
Hakase!

239
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,309
Your right hand's a loser.

240
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:11,274
How did you even come up with this?!

241
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,729
Not a compliment!

242
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,400
I'd appreciate it if you stopped messing with me.

243
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:17,971
Could you please consider my feelings for a change...

244
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,212
You're not listening!

245
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:39,422
Rock, paper, scissors!

246
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:45,482
Mine!

247
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:01,652
If you look hard enough,

248
00:18:01,802 --> 00:18:03,622
you can find anything.

249
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,544
Oh, Mio! I'm glad you're here.

250
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,434
What do you want, Yoshino?

251
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,366
Something came up, and I was wondering...

252
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:20,242
I said I'd help out the neighborhood association.

253
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,434
Would you please take my place?

254
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:25,115
Huh? Why don't you ask Mom instead of me?

255
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:31,382
Oh, she's busy playing kick volleyball with her
friends. To say thanks, I'll pay you 10,000 yen.

256
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:33,636
I'm counting on you!

257
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,951
I guess I could use the money.

258
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,692
Not like I'm doing anything anyway.

259
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:44,633
Think I should try a Mohawk fade with some dreads?

260
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:46,729
Check it out! That's so cute!

261
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:50,045
I've been bamboozled!

262
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,826
This whole thing sucks! What am I even doing?!

263
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:55,573
How did this happen? Why did I agree to this?

264
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:56,541
Come and get your delicious...

265
00:18:56,566 --> 00:19:00,675
The neighborhood association's big
plan was to sell <i>daifuku</i> on the street?

266
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,128
And with just two people?

267
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:03,209
Nah, I'll pass.

268
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:04,804
It's embarrassing!

269
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:05,526
No wait...

270
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:07,926
It's too embarrassing!

271
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,315
Everyone's staring at me like I'm an idiot!

272
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:15,125
How am I supposed to draw people in when I'm
dressed like their weird Daifuku-Dude mascot?

273
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,351
There aren't even any facial features.
It's just a plain, white ball for a head!

274
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:22,001
What even makes this mascot a dude, anyway?

275
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:23,568
It's just a big <i>daifuku</i> !

276
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,105
Come to think of it, this Daifuku Fair...

277
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:29,362
...doesn't seem fair to me!

278
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,496
Uh. I'm sorry...

279
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:42,591
Sweetie! It's okay! This is the absolute worst.

280
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,934
Whoa! What's that thing?

281
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,351
It looks gross!

282
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,409
Take this, gross thingy!

283
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:52,356
Stop it, please! That kinda hurts, so cut it out!

284
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:55,978
Seriously! I mean it! There's no padding in this costume!

285
00:19:56,054 --> 00:19:58,769
Okay, it's starting to really hurt, so please!

286
00:19:58,904 --> 00:19:59,654
Could you just...

287
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,054
Cut it out!

288
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:03,206
Ah! She's mad! Run for it!

289
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:04,059
Yeah! Let's get outta here!

290
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:05,346
What a freaky freak!

291
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,316
Could this get any worse?

292
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:09,611
Huh?

293
00:20:11,976 --> 00:20:12,733
Yuuko!

294
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:30,223
Stop tarnishing the Daifuku reputation.

295
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:35,304
I can't watch. Hand it over.

296
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,760
I'll show you!

297
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:38,309
Useless part-timers!

298
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,400
Don't just stand there.

299
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:43,140
Go and work behind the counter.

300
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:44,132
'Kay?

301
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:45,634
Yeah...

302
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:48,732
I swear. This 10,000 yen better be worth it.

303
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:58,378
♪ Tokachi! Azuki beans! ♪

304
00:20:58,403 --> 00:20:59,198
Can I leave?

305
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:00,493
♪ Wasanbon sugar! ♪

306
00:21:02,353 --> 00:21:03,997
I just wanna go home.

307
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:09,462
Well, I guess these <i>daifuku</i> look
pretty nice, but are they even gonna sell?

308
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:11,105
Excuse me.

309
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:12,902
How much for one of these?

310
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:13,925
A customer!

311
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,450
It's, uh...

312
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,927
I have no idea.

313
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:19,838
Uh, sir! How much does one <i>daifuku</i>...

314
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,976
Maybe this was a bad idea.

315
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:26,248
I couldn't run even if I tried! I'm strawberry filled!

316
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,793
Uh, yeah.

317
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:32,043
You could just take it for free.

318
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:33,987
Cool! Lucky me!

319
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:14,133
Ha!

320
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:25,756
It's another peaceful day at the Shinonome household.

321
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,892
Greetings! I'm the King!

322
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,246
Check me out! Looks like I'm pretty isolated.

323
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,911
I better find my chess mates soon!

324
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:34,636
The set is missing a major piece!

325
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,074
Hope it doesn't get pawned off!

326
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:39,150
The next episode of <i>My Ordinary Life</i> is Episode 10!

327
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,142
Look forward to it!
