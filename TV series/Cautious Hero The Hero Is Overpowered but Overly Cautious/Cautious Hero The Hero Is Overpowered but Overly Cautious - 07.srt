1
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,765
We are the Roseguard
Imperial Knights.

2
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,809
We heard a hero was headed
into this cave and hurried here.

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,269
Oh, that so?

4
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,605
[KNIGHT 06A] The knights under
the command of Captain Rosalie

5
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,983
are engaging the Demon Lord's
forces at Olga Fortress.

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,069
We ask that you come with us!

7
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,488
Okay.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,074
We did come here to
save the world, after all.

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,492
So let's get going.

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,451
[SOLDIERS gasp, chattering]

11
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,577
[SOLDIER 07C]
The rumors are true!

12
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,412
[SOLDIER 07A] It's like
having a hundred more men!

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,332
Is there anybody in this
world who doesn't need my help?

14
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,919
I was hoping for, like,
five seconds of down time.

15
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,128
[KNIGHT 06A]
We will gladly lead you

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,380
all the way to Olga Fortress.

17
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,839
[SEIYA]
I'd rather you didn't.

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,925
Just tell me what
direction it's in.

19
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,135
[KNIGHT 06A]
North by northwest.

20
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,596
[SOLDIER 07D]
Whoa! He really can fly!

21
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,557
[SOLDIER 07F]
No ordinary mortal can do that!

22
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,517
[SOLDIER 07G] That's why
heroes are better than us.

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,852
I believe he can
bring down Beel Bub!

24
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,896
Who's this Beel Bub
you're talking about?

25
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,399
[KNIGHT 06A] A demon
that looks like giant fly.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,360
A swarm of those disgusting
creatures led by Beel Bub

27
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,321
is causing massive
casualties at Olga Fortress.

28
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:15,242
So we're in for midair combat.
We'll do a little recon first.

29

Tater tots, on me.

other one, would ya?

00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,414
No problem.

[MASH gasps]
Oh, wow!

34
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,504
Being able to fly with
you is incredible, Master!

35
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,590
Something doesn't
look right up ahead.

[RISTA] That's a huge
swarm of flies! Gross!

39
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,230
[SEIYA]
Hm.

40
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,733
Three to four hundred of
those flying poop‐eaters,

41
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,737
all over level 30.
So the Phoenix is out.

42
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,655
Let's stay back
and see what happens.

43
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,365
[RISTA]
Yeah, I'm good with that plan.

44
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,950
[BEEL BUB]
Bow down before us, humans!

[BEEL BUB] Tremble at
the overwhelming might

of the Demon Lord's
airborne shock troops,

the Aerial Assault Flies!

49
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,418
I'm thinking that
must be the boss bug.

50
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,672
His ability stats kinda suck,
so he's not a Heavenly King.

51
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,301
[RISTA gasps] That speed rating
is kinda outta control though!

52
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,260
[SEIYA]
He disgusts me.

53
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,094
Huh?

54
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,929
[SEIYA] I mean, like,
how can he talk with that mouth?

55
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,681
I don't even wanna know.

56
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,434
[RISTA yells]
How does that help us

57
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,102
counteract his
stupid fast speed?

58
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,228
[ELULU]
Look over there!

59
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,856
Those Roseguard soldiers
are being targeted!

[ARCHERY CAPTAIN 07A]
Release!

61
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,156
It looks like even
the minion flies

62
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,076
all have pretty decent
evasive skills as well.

[ROSALIE grunting]

64
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,625
[BEEL BUB]
Now, it's time for something

65
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,503
I like to call
Reverse Fireworks.

66
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,338
Say what now? I don't get it.

70
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,642
[BEEL BUB] I was thinking
about calling them

71
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,895
Beel Bub's Blood Bombs,
but that seems corny.

72
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,731
Hmm. There's no fire,
but you get the idea.

73
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,108
Now, where's that hero?

74
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,152
Is this not enough to draw
him out? I can kill more.

75
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,655
I can do this
all day, am I right?

76
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,200
I wondered why the
fortress hadn't fallen,

77
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,120
but he basically just told us
what was up, so that's helpful.

78
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,288
I love it when they
just tell us like that.

79
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,499
Master, are we gonna
stand around here and watch,

80
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,251
or are we gonna
swat these flies?

81
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,627
Slow your roll, turbo.

82
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,838
Normal flies move faster
than the blink of an eye,

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,548
and these are some
kind of demon flies,

84
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,842
so they probably move
unbelievably quickly.

Captain Rosalie,
please calm yourself!

First, we need to regroup
and let the men rest!

We can rest only after

we've avenged our fallen
brothers in arms!

[CARLO] I know the thirst
for blood vengeance well.

But you must realize
the situation we're in.

Our remaining soldiers
are beyond exhausted.

I suppose you
have a point, Carlo.

Let's head back to the fortress.

108
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,321
There, we can discuss a strategy

to finally defeat these

[ROSALIE] However,
once that meeting is done,

we're heading back out!

In addition to strong walls,

Heh. Well, those flies

122
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,519
could definitely break
through if they wanted.

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,188
[CARLO] Clearly, their
objective was to lure you here.

124
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,649
They wouldn't go any
farther than the fortress.

But even if they did,

He's the greatest living
warrior in Gaeabrande.

[SEIYA]
Yeah, if that were true,

131
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,912
he could be saving
the world instead of me.

132
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,872
I don't buy the hype.

133
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,834
[CARLO] Forgive me,
but present company excluded.

134
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,086
The Warmaster's absolutely,
without a doubt,

135
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,421
the mightiest man
to ever walk this land.

136
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,424
However, he can't
leave the capital.

137
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,677
[BAHT] Captain Rosalie!
Must you be on the battlefront?

138
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,513
You are next in line to the
imperial throne, after all!

139
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,807
Which is why I should
be in harm's way.

I'm my father's daughter.

[CARLO]
Um, excuse me. They're here.

142
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,607

party have now arrived.

[BAHT]
So without further ado,

147
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,621
we must formulate a strategy at
once to eliminate these flies.

148

[SEIYA]
Slow down, big guy.

I would like to
guarantee our safety first.

One of the Demon Lord's henchmen

151
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,920
could be right here
with us in disguise.

‐‐Wait! Do you think so?
‐‐[OFFICERS gasp]

All I'm saying is
the possibility exists.

00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,219
Well, I suppose there's
a remote chance.

155
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,597
Besides, even if
the enemy's not here,

156
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,099
they could've planted a
bomb to blow us all to hell.

‐‐There's a bomb in here?!
‐‐[OFFICERS gasp]

158
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,061
All I'm saying is
the possibility exists.

159
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,439
Yes. I suppose it does.

160
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,065
But even if there's not,

161
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,611
I'm almost positive someone's
listening in on this meeting.

162
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,404
[OFFICERS gasp]

163
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,324
[ROSALIE gasps] Carlo!
Search the ceiling now!

164
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,366
Right!

165
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,953
[SOLDIER 07L] Sir, 23 soldiers
have searched high and low,

166
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,664
but the entire area above
this room is not only empty,

167
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,874
but remarkably clean!

168
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,626
There's no sign
of an intruder, sir.

169
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,628
Huh?

170
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,838
All I said was
the possibility exists.

171
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,715
[ROSALIE]
I've had enough of this!

172
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,258
What's more than
just a possibility

173
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,135
is we are not getting
any fighting done!

174
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,012
We don't even
need to strategize!

175
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,430
The hero and I will
stand at the fore

176
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,058
and charge into the
creatures' lair! That's that!

177
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,018
But Captain Rosalie,
we can't be‐‐

178
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,061
[SEIYA]
She's right.

179
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,062
Huh?

180
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,564
Oh! So you agree
we should charge in?

181
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,024
[SEIYA]
Don't put words in my mouth.

182
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,361
What I agree with is this
meeting is totally pointless.

183
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,197
I know what my next course
of action needs to be.

184
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,407
So what do you plan to do?

185
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,410
To leave.

186
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,662
[OFFICERS, ROSALIE]
Huh?

187
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,081
[ROSALIE]
Huh?!

188
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,457
[SEIYA] I'm gonna go
back to the Divine Realm...

189
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,792
'Course that's it.

190
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,002
A classic Seiya move.

191
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,004
[RISTA sighs]
And here I was getting excited

192
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,214
to start an adventure.

193
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,966
[ROSALIE]
This is utterly ridiculous!

194
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,133
You're kidding, right?

195
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,135
[SEIYA] I'm never kidding.
It's not my style.

196
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,929
You're seriously
going to abandon us?

197
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,597
[SEIYA] Cut the drama,
I'm just leaving.

198
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,099
‐‐But why?
‐‐Makes no sense.

199
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,100
He's chicken?

200
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,601
[OFFICER 07A]
Well, he's not a hero.

201
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,645
Everyone, relax, I speak Seiya.

202
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,897
He doesn't mean going
off to train for long.

203
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,649
Probably no more
than three days.

204
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,733
What the hell?

205
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,944
But the fortress will
be destroyed in that time!

206
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,821
No, listen, in the Divine Realm

207
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,280
three days is,
like, an hour or so.

208
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,865
‐‐[ROSALIE growls]
‐‐That's not too unreasonable.

209
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,410
But why would you even
need to train for this fight?

210
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,204
I saw the goddess's wings
with my own two eyes.

211
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,081
If you can already fly,
you're ready!

212
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,124
Huh? Who, me?

213
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,042
Goddesses don't fight.
They only support.

214
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,127
[RISTA]
Hm?

215
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,796
[RISTA] Whoa, is he
actually sticking up for me?

216
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,090
[SEIYA] But don't get me wrong,
she's completely useless.

217
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,758
She just kinda
floats like a balloon.

218
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,845
Now that I think about it,
a balloon would be more capable.

219
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,930
[RISTA] Ugh! Hey, I oughta
punch your balloons!

220
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,057
Flying's no big deal.
I can do that.

221
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,350
Oh, is that so?

222
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,060
[SEIYA] That doesn't
make us less screwed.

223
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,813
Look, I was watching
the battle earlier.

224
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,898
[ROSALIE]
Wait, what did you say?

225
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,608
You were watching?

226
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,235
While my soldiers
were being slaughtered,

227
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,029
you stood there
and watched them die?

228
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,363
No, that's not true!

229
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,407
We wanted to help, but at
the time, it was just too late!

230
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,241
[thud]

231
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,325
[ROSALIE]
It's not about timing,

232
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,119
it's about helping
or not helping!

233
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,038
I want to know if the
hero saw what happened

234
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,289
and did nothing to help!

235
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,374
[SEIYA] That's a dumb
question if you ask me.

236
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,585
If nothing will help,
why would I do anything?

237
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,587
My men were murdered by demons!

238
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,672
You're a hero,
doesn't that affect you?!

239
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,257
[SEIYA]
What would change if it did?

240
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,342
Best thing to do was
not get freaked out.

241
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,304
Stay calm and keep my guard up.

242
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,972
This "hero" is hopeless.

243
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,892
By definition a hero
is supposed to be brave!

244
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,602
But you are not a hero!

245
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,353
You're just a mopey coward!

246
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,024
Rosalie, I know Seiya can
come off as an unfeeling jerk

247
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,984
who's afraid to
get his hands dirty,

248
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,028
but that's how
we've made it this far.

249
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,237
He'll kill those demon flies,

250
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,323
but only when he
knows he's ready.

251
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,492
So would you please
just be patient?

252
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,578
This training will
only take an hour.

253
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,913
And why should I?

Ugh, valid question...

my men were popped like grapes.

thing to go through, but‐‐

[ROSALIE] You can't know
how precious life truly is

261
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,636
because you don't
have to fear death!

262
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,472
Since you're a goddess, it will
literally never happen to you!

263
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,015
[RISTA]
Ya kinda got me there.

264
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,559
So don't speak to me on
matters of life and death!

some kind of moral
high ground, lady.

Say what?!

[SEIYA] Your men didn't
get killed by accident.

All that stuff is on you.

If you had been able to
come up with a strategy

272

that didn't suck,
they'd still be alive right now.

take that back!

00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,531
I'll go take care
of them myself!

313
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,493
[RISTA] You do have incredibly
high strength, for a human.

314
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,995
[SEIYA] The Warmaster
may be your father,

315
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,164
but I guess ability
ratings aren't genetic.

316
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,874
You're just gonna
get yourself killed.

317
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,877
[growls]

318
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,254
[ELULU gasps] She's starting
to growl like a dog.

319
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,215
I oughta chew your face off.

320
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,550
[SEIYA] I think she's
rabid, so leave her alone.

321
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,345
[MASH] Hey, Master, are you
sure you shouldn't apologize?

322
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,472
I'm sorry, but
I don't do apologies.

323
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,474
Open a portal. Let's go.

324
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,893
[RISTA]
Ah, uh, sure?

325
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,564
[ROSALIE growling]
Yeah...

326
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,024
[RISTA]
Jeez, that growling.

327
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,108
Is she a dog?

328
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,069
Okay, find our happy place.

329
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,029
We're leaving, but we'll
be back in an hour.

330
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,907
Try not to bite anyone
while we're gone.

331
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,826
[growling]

332
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,708
[RISTA]
I know you, um, have your ways,

333
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,877
but don't ever do
anything like that again!

334
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,254
There's no excuse.

335
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,089
[ELULU] I was scared you
were gonna kill each other.

336
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,383
[MASH] All that slapping
was pretty intense.

337
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,426
[SEIYA]
I couldn't stop myself.

338
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,303
It's like all of that
crap that she was spewing

339
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,972
triggered my slap button.

340
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,306
Don't care.

341
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,225
[SEIYA]
The way she thinks is BS‐‐

342
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,476
hell‐bent on moving forward

343
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,061
when there's no
chance of winning.

344
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,314
Besides the casualties,
it makes you look like an idiot.

345
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,485
[RISTA] Hm. Yeah, it's pretty
much the exact opposite approach

346
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,696
from how you like
to do everything.

347
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,448
So, uh, you feel like
taking a little breather?

348
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,741
[SEIYA]
Great, another dumb question.

349
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,867
[gasps]

350
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,870
I figured out how to deal
with that demon bug infestation.

351
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,622
Well, if you need one
of the gods around here

352
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,666
to help you with something,
I can hook you up.

353
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,127
Like the god of Patriot
surface‐to‐air missiles?

354
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,004
What? There's no god for that!

355
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,630
How about the god of guns?

356
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,966
We might actually have
one of those somewhere.

357
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,218
But although Gaeabrande
has a lot of ways to kill,

358
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,594
there are no guns.

359
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,139
If we're the only ones
with guns, we win.

360
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,433
[RISTA] Listen, Seiya,
it's just not gonna happen!

361
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,977
Guns literally
do not exist there!

362
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,063
Well, if the guns and
Patriot missiles are out,

363
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,149
that leaves us with bows.

364
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,401
[RISTA] Great, because
I know the Goddess of Archery.

365
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,610
She's in the Verdant Forest,

366
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,404
which is a little
ways from here.

367
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,864
[SEIYA]
Cool, let's go.

368
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,158
Maybe she can
teach me something.

369
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,497
[RISTA] Mm. She's
practicing right up ahead.

370
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,217
[RISTA] Please pardon
the interruption, Mitis.

371
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,928
Oh, Ristarte. I don't
see you here often.

372
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,056
Is there something
I can help you with today?

373
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,932
Well, I was telling
my hero friend here

374
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,642
about your amazing
skill as an archer,

375
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,769
and we were hoping
you wouldn't mind

376
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,937
sharing a few tips
with him to up his game.

377
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,397
You're supposed to be the best,

378
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,024
so how many arrows
can you shoot at once?

379
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,901
Ever heard of buttering
someone up first?!

380
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,361
It isn't really
possible to shoot

381
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,945
more than one arrow at a time,

382
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,572
but I can shoot
in quick succession

383
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,741
to mimic simultaneous fire.

384
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,127
Shining Arrow!

385
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,512
That was so fast, I bet the
tree never even saw it coming!

386
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,015
After centuries of training,
seven quick shots is my limit.

387
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,225
Just seven shots?

388
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,976
How 'bout hitting something
that actually moves,

389
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,353
do you think you'd miss?

390
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,730
[MITIS]
Um, no, that would never happen.

391
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,564
[SEIYA]
Really?

392
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,650
I wouldn't be the Goddess
of Archery if I missed.

393
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,985
Unfortunately, that kind
of speed and precision

394
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,779
is impossible for
humans like you.

395
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,072
Yeah, we'll see.

396
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,241
Why don'tcha teach me
a thing or two first?

397
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,325
[MITIS]
Before we begin,

398
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,661
you need to be able
to use a magic bow.

399
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,246
If that proves to be too much,

400
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,082
there are other types of
lessons I'd love to teach you,

401
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,583
personally.

402
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,918
[RISTA] Does that mean
what I think it means?

403
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,046
I just wanna learn
how to use the bow.

404
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,675
Elulu, you know how to use Fire
Arrow, don'tcha? Teach it to me.

405
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,218
You're good at
a lot of things, Seiya,

406
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,887
but I don't know if you can
just pick it up just like that.

407
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,056
[SEIYA]
Just do it, okay?

408
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,267
The first step is to
stretch out your left hand

409
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,686
and visualize a
flaming magic bow in it.

410
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,229
‐‐Like this?
‐‐Now picture an arrow

411
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,439
in your right‐‐ [gasps]

412
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,232
You're going too fast!

413
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,109
But the next step is
really the toughest part

414
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,402
of the whole process.

415
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,488
Hitting the target is where all
of the skill starts to come in.

416
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,240
[ELULU whines]

417
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,451
[SEIYA]
Huh. That was easy.

418
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,828
[ELULU]
Well, for you, maybe.

419
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,914
[MITIS] My word, you are
surprisingly quick to catch on.

420
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,749
I understand why she chose you.

421
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,043
I'd be happy to start
training you right away.

422
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,675
[ELULU groans]
Well, there goes my dignity.

423
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:08,968
[RISTA]
Don't let it bother you.

424
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,136
That guy's a freak of nature.

425
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,804
Well, since we're
waiting on him,

426
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,764
how do you suggest
we pass the time?

427
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,849
[RISTA]
What did Seiya tell you?

428
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,143
"You kids can go to the
cafeteria and eat candy

429
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,353
or whatever the hell you do."

430
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,230
[RISTA]
Sounds like him.

431
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,815
I don't wanna just sit around,

432
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,985
so could you introduce me to a
god who'll help me get stronger?

433
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,112
Yeah, I don't mind
finding someone for you.

434
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,822
Do you want one, too?

435
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,449
[ELULU]
Nah, not today.

436
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,493
I'm gonna do the candy plan.

437
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,287
I'll join you, whaddaya
say we eat some macarons?

438
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,121
That sound good?

439
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,332
[MASH]
Hey, look, it's Cerceus!

440
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,166
[gasps]

441
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,126
Hey there, big fella!

442
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,337
[CERCEUS] Oh, no,
if you're here, that means

443
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,339
that psychopath's
here, too, isn't he?!

444
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,883
[RISTA] Seiya's training in
the Divine Forest right now.

445
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,968
Did something happen?

446
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,969
[CERCEUS]
Are you kidding me,

447
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,221
or did you forget
about all the stuff

448
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,139
that went down with him
and Adenela last time?

449
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,226
She's a wreck to begin with
and now she's ten times worse!

450
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,270
[RISTA]
Totally slipped my mind.

451
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,648
So what has she
been doing, exactly?

452
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,735
"S‐S‐Seiya. I‐I‐I'm
gonna k‐k‐kill you."

453
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,403
She skulks around
like that all day.

454
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,406
It's like hearing the
worst hip‐hop DJ ever.

455
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,449
[RISTA]
It's that bad, huh?

456
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,493
It is! It's really
not funny anymore.

457
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,494
If she sees him around,

458
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,080
she's definitely gonna
gut him like a fish!

459
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,831
[RISTA whimpers]

460
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,042
[ARIA]
I'd heard she was upset.

461
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,460
I tried to cheer her up a bit,

462
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,170
but she didn't
want to listen to me.

463
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,922
I wonder if Ishtar
could talk to her

464
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,174
and try to smooth
things out a little.

465
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,676
[ARIA]
I'd keep her out of this.

466
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,011
I'm just afraid Seiya's
gonna get shanked!

467
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,056
[ARIA] Adenela's strange,
but she'd never do that.

468
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,933
And in the
unlikely case she did,

469
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,477
knowing that hero,
he wouldn't even be fazed.

470
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,854
Well, I don't really
wanna test that theory.

471
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,481
Not to mention, go through
all of this with him

472
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,691
just to have him
get killed by some

473
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,651
side‐eyeing goth
goddess with a grudge!

474
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,319
I'm guessing she's
not the best goddess

475
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,196
to ask to help with
my training, huh?

476
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,198
But what should I do instead?

477
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,617
If you stay here,
it's all you can eat candy.

478
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,535
[ARIA]
Young man.

479
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,912
I can sense that you
have some dormant powers.

480
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,540
[MASH gasps] You mean the
Dragon God Metamorphosis?

481
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,458
They say, if I can
work hard enough,

482
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,252
I'll be able to
turn into a dragon.

483
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,962
[ARIA]
Sounds like you have a seal.

484
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,464
If you want my help,
I can release it for you.

485
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,008
[MASH]
For real?! You can do that?!

486
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,426
I'm all for learning new things,

487
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,219
but that sounds
like cheating to me!

488
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,804
[ARIA] I'm just teaching
him the proper way

489
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,181
to unlock a power
he already possesses.

490
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,850
It's another form of training.

491
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,020
[RISTA] Okay, if you say it's
fine, then knock yourself out.

492
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,855
Don't worry about me, Rista.

493
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,356
I'll just keep doing
what I'm best at,

494
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,108
which is shoveling candy.

495
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,860
[ARIA]
Oh! I can see that you have

496
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,403
some hidden talents as well.

497
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,655
I would be able to draw them
out for you, if you'd like.

498
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,656
Uh, really?

499
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,200
If you think I can do
something cool, then teach me!

500
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,745
Draw it out, drag it out, rip it
out, whatever you need to do!

501
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,122
[RISTA] Aria's always the
best for a good pick‐me‐up.

502
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,459
She even sees potential
in Elulu. Hmm.

503
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm sure she's
right that Adenela's

504
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,963
just a harmless whack‐a‐doodle.

505
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,299
But still, I think
it's best for me to go

506
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,634
and talk her down a little.

507
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,054
Hey, sweetie, it's your old
friend Rista checking in!

508
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,974
[RISTA]
Are you home?

509
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,435
[gasps]

510
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,855
I guess she's out.

511
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,231
[screams]

512
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,404
[RISTA]
Oh, she's out, out of her mind!

[RISTA screams]

515
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,494
R‐Ristarte, if you're
b‐b‐back here,

516
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,162
then that means one thing.

517
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:27,083
Y‐Your tight bodied friend
is b‐back here, too, huh?

518
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,418
N‐No, I came all
by myself this time.

519
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,878
I don't know where he is!

520
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,464
[ADENELA]
Oh, oh. Is that true? R‐Really?

521
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,383
Oh, yeah! I haven't
seen him in a while!

522
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,510
So what do you need, anyway?

523
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,553
It's nothing,
don't even worry about it!

524
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,389
Then why did you come in?

525
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,556
[RISTA]
Oh, well, I was just

526
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,016
looking for some
decorating inspirations.

527
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,768
You've got such a unique style.

528
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,270
But I'm not sure I could
pull this off as well.

529
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,313
Ah, hah, hah...

530
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,232
Yeah? Really?

531
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,693
[RISTA whimpering]

532
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,530
[RISTA]
Seiya!

533
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,989
So, how's it going?

534
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,700
[SEIYA] She's done training me,
but I should have it

535
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,868
totally mastered by
tomorrow, maybe sooner.

536
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,245
[RISTA]
That's awesome! Anyway!

537
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,579
Just make sure you
don't set foot outside

538
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,707
this forest and run
into Adenela, got it?

539
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,166
And why should I be
worried about that?

540
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,794
[RISTA] Just do what I'm asking
you to do for once, okay?!

541
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,338
I'll bring the shorties back
here tomorrow and we'll leave.

542
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,716
[SEIYA] You're way more
annoying than usual today.

543
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,175
So what crawled up your butt?

544
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,969
Please, I'm just asking
that you stay here

545
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,138
and try not to run into Adenela.

546
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,141
Do you really not know that
she's standing right behind you?

547
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,351
[RISTA]
Uh...

548
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,353

‐‐[ADENELA] R‐R‐Rista,

550
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,191
I had a feeling
you were lying to me.

551
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,485
So I d‐decided
to follow you here

552
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:37,737
and f‐find out the truth!

553
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,280
Hold on there,
just take it easy.

554
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,240
I can explain everything,
just calm down!

555
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,408
It's okay!

556
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,786
Now, I'll kill him. Yes. I will.

557
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,830
He's gonna pay!

558
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,541
[RISTA] Oh, no! That's
the Eternal Sword stance!

559
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,543
She did not come here to play!

560
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,086
Go on and draw your blade

561
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,297
if you're m‐m‐man enough
to fight against a woman

562
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,799
who's t‐ten times
the warrior you are!

563
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,677
[SEIYA]
Hey, I know you're fine,

564
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,387
but how you doin'?
Long time no see.

565
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,473
[ADENELA]
Wh‐What're you talking about?

566
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,933
You‐‐ You can't t‐t‐treat
me like you did the other day

567
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,644
and just expect me to act
like n‐n‐nothing happened!

568
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,645
You gotta pay.

569
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,315
Ah, what is up with your hair?

570
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,151
S‐Something the matter with it?

571
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,614
She's gonna pierce
your spleen, you idiot!

572
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,449
You do own a comb, don't you?

573
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,034
S‐S‐Stop t‐t‐touching me

574

with your warm m‐manly
hands like that.

575
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,454
Now, isn't that better?

00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,790
[RISTA] Hey! C'mon,
Captain Boundary Issues!

[RISTA]
Eh?

580
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,841
What happened to
all that psycho rage?!

581
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,676
Did he pet it out of you?!

I‐I just can't help myself.

It's clichÃ©d, but I can't
stay mad at someone so hot!

584
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,810
[SEIYA] Adenela, I need
to get back to my training.

585
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,479
You being here is distracting
and it brings me down.

586
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,523
So hurry on outta here now.

Wow, that's horrible.

[RISTA] Yeah,
she really called that one.

593
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,164
Maybe I get carried away.
