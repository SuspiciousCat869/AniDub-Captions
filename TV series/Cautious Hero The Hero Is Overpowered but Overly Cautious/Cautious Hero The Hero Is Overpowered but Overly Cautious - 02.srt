time's up, pops!

160
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,557
[NINA]
No!

161
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,143
[MACHINA]
Blame it on your no‐show hero!

162
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,853
‐‐[rustling]
‐‐Huh?

163
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,359
[SEIYA]
Wind... Blade!

164
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,736
[SEIYA grunts]

165
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,949
[RISTA]
Huh? When'd he get that move?

166
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,243
[giggles]

167
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,121
Yes, I had a feeling
you'd come back eventually.

168
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,706
Way to leave a girl hanging.

169
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,709
I guess this hero's not
just short on chivalry.

170
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,669
Oh, that's a little
rich, don't you think?

171
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,921
You're a bully who takes
advantage of the helpless!

172
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,506
So say the sneaky creeps

173
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,135
who tried to ambush me
while I was distracted.

174
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,387
[SEIYA] Who said that you were
the one I was trying to hit?

175
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,014
[MACHINA]
Hmm?

176
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,599
[NINA]
Papa!

177
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,185
Thank goodness!
I'm glad you're okay!

178
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,688
Thank you for saving my life!
I owe you one, sir!

179
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,773
[SEIYA grunts]

180
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,316
[TOYA gasps]

181
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,362
So that's how it is.
I see now, I see.

182
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,282
You guys played me
and I totally fell for it.

183
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,912
[MACHINA gasps]

184
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,165
[MACHINA] What is this? It's
like he's a different person!

185
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,334
His ability level outranks mine!

186
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,629
[RISTA] I see. So you
can scan targets, too.

187
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,465
Whatcha think?
Nice stats, am I right?

188
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,551
If you want to throw in
the towel, now's your chance.

189
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,348
All right then.

190
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,643
Seems like I'm gonna have to
take this a bit more seriously.

191
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,853
‐‐Ha?
‐‐Release!

192
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,567
[MACHINA chuckles]

193
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,653
Oh, you thought
you'd won already?

194
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,613
Well, I've got some bad news.

195
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,740
Real fighters who
play on expert mode

196
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,827
always have a little something
extra hiding up their sleeves.

197
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,621
Um, Seiya, watch out.

198
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,915
All of her numbers skyrocketed.

199
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,001
C'mon, just when I thought
we'd finally caught up!

200
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,880
Okay, time to show me what
you're made of, big boy!

201
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,006
[MACHINA grunts]

202
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,927
Ready or not, here I come, hero!

203
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,972
[MACHINA grunting]

204
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,931
She's fast!

205
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,767
Swingin' that sword
like a bad metaphor.

206
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,563
[MACHINA] So you can still
keep up with my moves, eh?

207
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,815
I wonder if you're
one of those guys‐‐

208
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,234
the type with a sharp intuition.

209
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,777
[RISTA]
Yeah, that's right!

210
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,613
Having greater stats
doesn't guarantee a big win!

211
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,576
You can't underestimate
battle instinct and strategy!

212
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,286
[MACHINA]
Tch. How troubling.

213
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,705
A troublesome hero, indeed!

214
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,125
I'm sure I'll beat you, but I
would prefer to be double sure.

215
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,836
Get ready, here comes
my special technique.

216
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,963
I call it "Demonic Curse."

217
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,466
Did ya hear that? Be careful!

218
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,676
Here's a secret.

219
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,137
A real, real fighter
who plays on expert mode

220
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,847
always has a little
something extra

221
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,600
hiding under the
little something extra.

222
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,060
She doesn't sound like
she's messing around.

223
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,021
What could she be up to?

224
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,153
Hey, what the realm
are you doing?!

225
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,696
[MACHINA]
Oh, you'll see.

226
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,949
It's the Demonic Curse,
of course! [chuckles]

227
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,202
With this overwhelming power,

228
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,495
I shall deliver
death to the hero!

229
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,705
[MACHINA grunts]

230
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,042
[gasps]

231
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,127
[RISTA]
I'm so confused.

232
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,389
[RISTA groaning]

233
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,864
Uh, hold on.

234
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,368
Micro bikini demon
isn't her true form?

235
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,954
[MACHINA yells]

236
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,207
[RISTA whimpers]
You gotta be kidding me!

237
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,126
It's stronger than
a D‐Class Demon Lord!

238
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,421
Even with Seiya's combat
smarts, this looks bad!

239
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,591
Do you now understand
the difference in our power?

240
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:42,262
Surely even you agree that
you've no chance of victory.

241
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,888
Just one blow!

242
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,431
One blow is all it'll take

243
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,017
to separate your
head from your body!

244
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,023
[RISTA screams]

245
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:00,446
[RISTA] I had no idea Gaeabrande
would be such a terrible world!

246
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,740
[MACHINA chuckles]

247
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,242
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,493
Please forgive‐‐

249
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,786
[gasps]

250
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,998
What? Impossible!

251
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,874
How could this be?

252
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,959
[RISTA]
Hold on a second.

253
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,878
Seiya's stats are
too low to survive that!

254
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,714
Did I misread something?

255
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,300
No. Then it must be...

256
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,510
...the Fake Out skill!

257
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,305
Time for me to give
him a quick scan.

258
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,558
[RISTA]
A lock?

259
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,977
He's definitely using Fake Out.

260
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,521
That sneaky little meathead!

261
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,816
[RISTA]
Again?!

262
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,819
How rude! Why, you!

263
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,530
It's not like I'm
perving on you!

264
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,658
Now I'm really
gonna keep looking!

265
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,244
Megamic Power!

266
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,456
Come on. [groans]

267
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,333
Oh, goddess, my eyes
are about to pop out!

268
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,126
Gotta dig deep, Ristarte!

269
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,421
You can do it,
put your mind into it!

270
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:04,260
[pants] You did it girl,
you finally got the goodies!

271
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,138
[RISTA gasps]
What is all this?

272
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,308
These figures are almost
five‐‐no, ten times higher!

273
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,769
He's got more skills, too!

274
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,813
Wait, there wasn't enough
time for that to happen.

275
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,939
So then...

276
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,691
...he must've
started using Fake Out

277
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,985
after his first
round of training.

278
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,530
He was already stronger than
Chaos Machina from the get‐go!

279
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,617
He was just grinding
this whole time!

280
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,327
This guy is unhinged!

281
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,954
I mean, he's a complete
and utter nutjob!

282
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,958
Huh. Guess you're
tougher than I expected.

283
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,211
[MACHINA]
Whatever.

284
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,755
[MACHINA]
I'll summon all my magic

285
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,757
into my fist using this ability!

286
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,051
The Demonic Delete!

287
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:49,347
Turning you and this whole
pathetic little town into‐‐huh?

288
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,598
Where'd you go?

289
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,475
[MACHINA gasps]

290
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,060
When did you learn
the Flight skill?

291
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,104
How is that even possible?

292
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,816
[RISTA] She's one of
the Four Heavenly Kings.

293
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,526
Very powerful...

294
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,194
...but she's careful, too.

295
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,948
She would've defeated any
normal hero by this point.

296
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,535
However, she picked
the wrong one this time.

297
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,162
'Cause now... this hero?

298
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,208
Wha... Not the
Magic Sword technique!

299
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,627
Isn't that an upper‐tier skill?

300
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,878
[SEIYA]
It is!

301
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,131
It's called Phoenix Drive!

302
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,475
[MACHINA groans]

303
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,481
[RISTA]
Oh, yeah, this hero...

304
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,568
...is unbelievably cautious!

305
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,414
[RISTA giggling]
Seiya!

306
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,083
What are you doing?
Don't make me get the hose.

307
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,585
I'm celebrating!

308
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,503
I thought we were
done for back there!

309
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,172
[RISTA]
Man, oh, man!

310
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,549
He smells good enough
to eat! [snorts]

311
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,676
[SEIYA] Get off. You'll
give me a disease.

312
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,054
I am not gonna get you sick!
Come on, just let me have this!

313
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,348
I swear, I'm perfectly healthy!

314
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,770
[RISTA] Honestly, though?
I'm a little upset with you now.

315
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,231
Why have you been hiding
your Fake Out skill?

316
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,692
[SEIYA] I figured if you
had the ability to scan me,

317
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,861
then any enemies might
be able to do the same,

318
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,989
so I made sure to gain
that skill before any others.

319
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,949
[RISTA]
So you had it from the start?

320
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,994
I get keeping your true
level away from baddies,

321
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,747
but don't you think you
could have at least told me?

322
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,374
I mean, I am your
partner after all, right?

323
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,376
Even if you kept
your big mouth shut,

324
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,212
there could be a brain monster.

325
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,464
One peek into your head
and we'd be screwed.

326
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,051
Oh, no, a brain monster?
That sounds really scary.

327
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,428
But I know that you
would protect me!

328
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,181
You're supposed to be a goddess.
Aren't you immortal?

329
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,724
You don't need protection.

330
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,267
[RISTA]
Not the point!

331
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,478
Cut it out or I'll cut you.

332
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,314
Go right ahead!
Tear me to pieces!

333
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,232
[SEIYA]
Hey.

334
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,651
Uh?

[TOWNSMAN 02B]
Hey there, Mister Hero!

336
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,112
[TOWNSWOMAN 02A] We're so
glad you saved our town!

337
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,989
[TOWNSWOMAN 02B] I can't
believe you beat that beast!

[TOWNSMAN 02C]
You have our eternal thanks!

He's got the face of a nobleman!

00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,620
Yes, and he's so tall
and handsome, too!

341
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,331
Hello, I'm Jamie, and
I run the fruit stand!

342
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,542
Please, go and help yourself!

343
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,794
Oh, thank you, Jamie!

344
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,088
Greetings, I am
the mayor of Edona!

345
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,006
It would be my absolute
pleasure to throw

346
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,009
a banquet in your honor,
so please join me at my manor.

347
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,096
A welcoming party sure
does sound nice. Wanna go?

348
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,182
No, I still have things to take
care of, thank you very much.

349
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,601
[RISTA] I bet he's heading
straight to the next town.

350
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,061
How gallant!

351
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,522
No wonder I'm falling for him!

Being safe.

Aren't those the charred remains

Enough with the fireworks!

She's a Heavenly King.

366
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,849
If a single cell remains,
she might regenerate.

367
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,183
I must obliterate her!

Stop it already!

Please,

I humbly beg...
leave our town at once!

387
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,294
How did things end up like this?

388
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,047
You were more like
a Demon Lord than a hero.

389
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,467
One kid threw a rock at me, but
I bet you didn't even notice.

390
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,135
[SEIYA]
We saved them from certain doom,

391
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,471
and yet they treat us
so heartlessly. Lame.

You're one to talk, buddy!

Poor, sweet Jamie didn't
burn himself, ya know!

394
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,810
Not my fault.

Oh, wow, you really
are the worst.

[TOYA]
I'm sorry.

00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,568
We shouldn't have made you leave
after you rescued everyone.

399
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,446
Oh, no, there's no need
to apologize, I mean,

400
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:02,243
your town did burn, along
with... a few people, so...

It's not much, but here!

[SEIYA]
Ooh, money.

403
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,039
You shouldn't be
so greedy, Seiya.

404
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,082
Try to show some restraint.

405
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,167
What gives? This isn't
very much at all.

If you got any more,
then cough it up!

you're a real good guy!

You're sort of right,
and sort of wrong.

He's not a good guy,
just super weird.

[SEIYA] You... You do
realize I'm right here?

416
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,650
You burned down their
town and robbed them!

Let's not address
people like that.

423
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,042
Listen, don't you
think you should

424
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,128
start acting a bit more heroic?

425
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,130
[RISTA]
Oh.

426
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,257
Look, you still have
that pressed flower.

427
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,968
Didn't you say it was
a cursed item or something?

428
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,012
Well, that might not
be such a bad thing,

429
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,346
given our circumstance.

430
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,140
If it attracts enemies,
then it might be

431
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,933
more convenient for
me to hold onto it.

432
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,976
[RISTA]
Huh.

433

‐‐[SEIYA] What?
‐‐Oh, it's nothing.

Yeesh. I really don't get him.

435
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,357
He's so weird.

436
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,027
[RISTA] Okey‐doke! Our adventure
is just getting started.

437
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,653
Off to the next town!

438
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,530
No, we're going
back to the Realm.

439
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,783
More training?
Are you kidding me?!

440
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,327
When the enemy learns that
we beat a Heavenly King,

441
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,496
they'll send stronger
forces our way.

442
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,581
Okay, but if we don't
go to the next town,

443
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,958
then we won't be able
to score any good weapons.

444
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,003
Yeah, I would like to
buy some new armor, too.

445
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,838
Could you make some for me?

446
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,673
You can make beds and stuff.

447
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,384
[RISTA] I can only create
things in the Divine Realm.

448
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,470
Bringing anything from
there is forbidden.

449
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:48,474
And excessive assistance to
human is against divine law.

450
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,934
So you're useless.

451
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,103
[RISTA] Wow! I healed Jamie's
burns, in case you forgot!

452
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,314
Medicinal herbs
could've done the same.

453
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,274
In other words,
your value to society

454
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,485
is no greater
than that of a leaf.

455
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,862
Are you comparing me
to stuff on a tree?!

456
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,532
In any case, I'm due
for some more training.

457
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,159
Hurry up and open
a portal, plant‐lady.

458
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,370
[RISTA] All right,
all right, I hear you.

459
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,206
Wait, what did you call me?!

460
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,041
Good. Let's go.

461
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,168
We've just taken
a few steps forward

462
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,838
and then a dozen steps back
for the second time.

[SEIYA grunts]

How is this gonna work?
