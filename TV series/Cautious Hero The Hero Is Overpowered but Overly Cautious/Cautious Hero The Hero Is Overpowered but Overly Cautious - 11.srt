[RISTA humming]

2
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,860
Wow. I can hardly
believe Master said

3
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,778
that we should go out
and have some fun for once.

4
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,822
Yeah. I was super surprised.

5
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,490
[MASH]
Let's hit the casino, you guys!

6
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,036
[RISTA] Not just yet.
The casino is a nighttime spot.

7
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,996
Besides, we should
save the main course

8
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,372
till after the snack joins us.

9
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,041
[ELULU]
So what now?

10
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,709
We've gotta get
you guys looking fresh,

11
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,170
and the first step is
ditching those filthy outfits.

12
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,963
But this is the only
thing I have to wear.

13
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,632
Ain't nothing money can't fix.

14
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,841
‐‐[ELULU] Yeah?
‐‐[MASH] Really?

15
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,886
Come on. It's time
for some retail therapy!

16
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,388
[ELULU, MASH]
All right!

17
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,183
[ELULU]
This is so cute!

18
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,352
Although, I'm kinda
feeling this one, too.

19
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,354
Hey, look!
Cool leather jacket, huh?

20
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,898
I spy a bathing suit section.

21
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,817
Lots of pool parties here?
The beach is pretty far.

22
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,277
The hot springs are close.

23
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,111
Really?

24
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,072
[SHOPKEEPER 11A] They're
a big attraction in OrphÃ©e,

25
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,991
especially the mixed male
and female bathing pools.

26
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,910
Yeah?

27
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,788
[RISTA] Which means Seiya and I
can share a hot bath together.

28
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,040
Oh, man, I think my brain
really is turning into jelly!

29
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,167
Hey, Rista, you feelin' okay?

30
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,001
[RISTA gasps]

31
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,253
Yeah, just checking
out these bathing suits!

32
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,755
Pick out some
for the hot springs!

33
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,716
‐‐[MASH] You mean it?
‐‐[ELULU] Sounds fun!

34
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,009
[chuckles]

35
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,595
[RISTA]
Hmm, these are all so tacky.

36
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,764
I guess I've gotten spoiled
by the high fashion options

37
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,641
we have in the Divine Realm.

38
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,727
Well, this is a more of a
"sword and sorcery" type world,

39
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,022
so... I'll just grab
the best option.

40
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,899
[RISTA grunts]

41
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,567
[RISTA]
She definitely heard that.

42
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,528
This little two‐piece
is in your size.

43
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,947
I think it's gonna look
unbelievably cute on you!

44
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,408
Oh, thank you.
It's totes adorbs!

45
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,201
[RISTA]
I suppose it could be worse,

46
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,119
and when you look around,

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,162
it seems like they
may actually be trying.

48
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,414
[SHOPKEEPER 11A]
I think this one will suit

49
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,082
you perfectly, miss.

50
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,585
[RISTA]
Uh, well... It's nice.

51
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,753
Where's the top?

52
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,755
Nowhere. This is a topless model

53
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,882
for the girl who wants
to let it all hang out.

54
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,926
I'm sure it'd look
simply wonderful on you.

55
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,177
[RISTA]
She did overhear me earlier

56
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,596
and now she's trying to make
me look like a complete idiot.

57
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,724
This doesn't qualify
as a bathing suit!

58
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,350
It doesn't even cover the boobs!

59
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,979
Just a little much for you, huh?
It does take a certain type.

60
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,148
What do you think of this?

61
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,150
Our new single‐breasted model.

62
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,152
It's just perfect!

63
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,778
I'm not some trollop!
I'm classy!

64
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,239
I'm sorry,
but it's the new style.

65
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,324
Just try to think of it
like wearing an eye patch

66
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,243
when you've actually
got two good eyes!

67
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,537
It's simply a fun,
carefree little piece.

68
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,373
It's a far cry from
a cosplay eye patch, lady!

69
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,958
Have you ever
actually seen anybody

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,252
just chillin' with one
of the girls hangin' out?!

71
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,587
Calm down, Rista.

72
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,256
Surely a goddess can handle
a little swimsuit shopping.

73
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,716
Yeah, but all this
chick is showing me is

74
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,468
the crazy,
super racy‐type stuff!

75
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,594
If these aren't your style,

76
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,971
I have bottomless suits
in stock. Wanna try one?

77
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,223
If you're suggesting suits
without a top or bottom,

78
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,725
why not just say "go nude"?

79
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,477
I'll find one
on my own, thank you.

80
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,937
And Mash, do you mind
grabbing one for Seiya? Ugh!

81
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,940
Oh. Sorry to pry,
but does this Seiya person

82
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,484
happen to be your
boyfriend, by any chance?

83
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,735
Damn right he is!

84
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,694
[MASH, ELULU]
Uhh...

85
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,780
Uh, Rista. That's not true.

86
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,364
[SHOPKEEPER 11A]
Then you might want this.

87
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,325
It's a brand new
open front concept

88
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,910
that some find flattering.

89

‐‐[ELULU gasps]

90
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,204
I'll take it!

00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,830
[MASH, ELULU gasp]
Say wha‐‐?

92
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,958
[RISTA] Seiya's no elephant, but
I'd sure love to see that trunk!

93
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,253
I'll take one of
these, too, matey!

94
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,507
Yeah, I can slip into this
on a long, steamy night.

95
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,925
‐‐[MASH] I don't get it.
‐‐[ELULU] Why at night?

96
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,135
[RISTA] It's best if you kids
don't think about it too hard.

97
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,930
I was completely hammered off
my ass when I sewed those two.

98
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,766
I never thought anyone
would actually buy them.

99
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,476
I guess I was wrong.

100
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,437
In honor of your
daring fashion choices,

101
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,564
you get a great deal!

102
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,857
Thanks, sister!

103
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,691
[SHOPKEEPER 11A, RISTA]
Hm.

104
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,568
[MAN 11A] Great stuff
at unbelievable prices!

Ohh... The food looks so good!

106
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,489
I'm so hungry.

Hey, how much longer till we're
supposed to meet up with Master?

108
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,411
Oh, he said that we won't see
him until later on tonight.

109
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,456
So I guess we'll have to
wait for him at the castle.

110
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,041
Let's pig out in our
room till he shows up

111
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,501
and then we'll hit the casino!

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,968
[RISTA] So after the casino
we'll stop by the bar,

116
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,179
get a little loose, and then
it's time for the hot spring.

117
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,472
We'll put the rugrats to bed,

118
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,016
so Seiya and I can
have a little fun.

00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,235
Uh...

124
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,320
[MASH] Guess he's still
out running errands.

125
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,407
[RISTA] But... it's gonna
be dark pretty soon.

126
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,783
He was pretty clear.

127
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,537
He did say sundown and he's
not really the type to be late.

128
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,498
Well, maybe he's having a hard
time picking something out.

129
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,875
[MASH]
He is a perfectionist, ya know?

130
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,502
Oh, yeah, he sure is.

131
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,338
[RISTA] An hour went by,
and then another.

132
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,967
We waited patiently,
but our hero did not return.

133
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,135
You haven't seen him?!

134
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,304
[ITEM SHOP OWNER 10A] Mm.
Oh, that guy with you earlier?

135
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,599
I haven't seen him since you got
creamed by my medicinal herbs.

136
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,017
Don't bring that up!

137
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,312
But Seiya told us he was gonna
get some stuff to synthesize.

138
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,647
Maybe he went to
someone else's shop.

139
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,026
Hey, are there many other
item or weapon shops in town?

140
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,236
Yeah, I can think
of a few of 'em.

141
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,989
Have I seen a handsome man?
Sad to say, I haven't.

142
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,033
Nobody like that in my shop.

143
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,410
I haven't had a single customer!

144
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,331
[ELULU] Doesn't look like
he's been back here yet.

145
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,083
[MASH] And nobody in the
castle has seen him either.

146
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,960
I have no idea
where he could've gone.

147
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,086
Hey, Rista.

148
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,714
You don't think he went to fight
the Demon Lord alone, do you?

149
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,548
[RISTA]
Huh?

150
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,467
No, Seiya wouldn't do that.

151
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,345
It's completely the opposite
of something he would do.

152
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,972
He barely got through
that Warmaster fight alive,

153
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:11,973
and he needed time to think.

154
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,309
He mentioned something
about training, too.

155
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,395
And the Demon Lord has that
scary Chain Destruction thing.

156
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,273
So if Seiya loses, he's dead.

157
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,816
I'll bet he's just
over preparing,

158
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,777
since he's overly cautious.

159
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,237
If he's training,
where's he doing that?

160
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,989
‐‐[thud]
‐‐[BOTH gasp]

161
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,410
No clue. I just don't know!

162
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,914
[RISTA] I didn't wanna
do this, but here goes!

163
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,248
Hello?

164
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,378
[RISTA] Huh? Aria,
what are you doing here?

165
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,545
Where is Ishtar?

166
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:46,675
Seiya's run off somewhere
and I need to find him ASAP.

167
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,843
Oh, what's wrong?

168
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,807
Come with me.
Ishtar is expecting us.

169
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,648
This is the room where
time stands still.

170
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,109
[ISHTAR]
Rista, I'm so glad to see you

171
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,153
and your two young
Dragonkin friends as well.

172
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,699
[ISHTAR]
Under normal circumstances

173
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,909
you would be forbidden
to enter this chamber,

174
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,245
but this is an exception.

175
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,041
Is this the place where the true
souls of all the gods are kept?

176
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,461
[ISHTAR] Rista, I know why
you've sought me out today.

177
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,422
I'll get straight to the point.

178
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,591
The very moment our hero
left the company of your party

179
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,719
he headed to the
Demon Lord's castle, alone.

180
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,553
[BOTH gasp]

181
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,931
But that doesn't seem like him.
He'd never take on that fight

182
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,100
without obsessively
training first.

183
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,893
The stakes are way too high.

184
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,771
This Chain Destruction thing
could destroy his soul!

185
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:42,605
Not only that...

186
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,190
Yes, such a powerful weapon

187
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,484
could eliminate
your soul as well.

188
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,612
Seiya is very aware
of that particular risk.

189
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,408
In fact, that is precisely
why he chose to go without you.

190
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,286
Huh? Do you mean Seiya
went to slay the Demon Lord

191
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,997
because he was worried about me?

192
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,459
[RISTA chuckles]
That can't be the reason.

193
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,252
I mean, he's always
putting me down

194
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,004
and saying things like
I'm not a real goddess.

195
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,255
He doesn't even like me.

196
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,091
[ISHTAR] It's true he's
ill‐mannered and sharp‐tongued.

197
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,969
But in his heart,
Seiya's a caring young man.

198
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,430
Since he began
his hero's journey,

199
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,891
protecting the people
he truly cherishes

200
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,351
has always been at the
forefront of his mind.

201
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,936
[RISTA]
That's not true.

202
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,354
No, that can't be‐‐

203
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,774
Seriously? He really
cares about us?

204
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,858
[ISHTAR]
Indeed.

205
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,319
You may remember that
Seiya initially resisted

206
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,987
the two of you
joining his party,

207
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,074
but that was because he didn't
want to lose any comrades.

208
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,992
He treated you with
cold detachment,

209
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,577
and always tried
to keep you away

210
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,370
from battle for the same reason.

211
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,915
He struggled to balance
his concern for your safety

212
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,000
with his mission
to protect Gaeabrande.

213
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,252
That's why he rescued you, Mash,

214
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,880
it's why he saved Elulu
in Dragon Village,

215
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,882
and it's why he
risked his own soul

216
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,719
being destroyed by the Warmaster
to get Rista out of harm's way.

217
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,887
I still don't get it!

218
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,764
If his main motivation
has really been

219
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,557
to protect me and
the kids all along,

220
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,267
he could have taken us
back here and trained‐‐

221
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,728
That would be pointless. He
doesn't need further training.

222
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,981
Because the strongest goddess
here has already trained him?

223
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,359
But couldn't he have worked to
raise his level a little more?

224
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,903
[ISHTAR] Look, due to his
Extreme Fake Out skill,

225
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,115
you were never able to
perceive his actual stats.

226
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,408
But I can show you
what he's been hiding.

227
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,785
Wait a second.

228
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:19,953
He's already maxed out?

229
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,164
[ISHTAR] Correct.
He cannot progress any further.

230
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,250
Incidentally,
these are the same stats

231
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,503
he possessed in Dragon Village,
which means his overall ratings

232
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,672
have not increased
at all since that time.

233
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,257
It's been that long?

234
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,634
Seiya has attempted to
compensate for these stats

235
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,885
by learning new skills,

236
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,596
such as Shining Arrow
and the various Valkyrjas.

237
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,516
This stands as more
evidence of his concern.

238
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,060
But still, he never
said anything about it.

239
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,521
Because that wouldn't
change the situation.

240
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,274
All that would lead to
is unnecessary worrying.

241
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,985
He felt there was more
than enough of that already.

242
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,486
[BOTH gasp]

243
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,572
[RISTA]
No. He can't!

244
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,990
With those numbers
there's no way

245
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,075
he can beat an
S‐class Demon Lord!

246
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,952
[MASH]
But Master has Igzasion.

247
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,997
I‐If he can use that with
the Valkyrjas he's learned...

248
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,875
[RISTA] That sacred sword
he has is just a fake.

249
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,959
Say what?

250
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,212
But he synthesized it with
Elulu and Leviae's blood!

251
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,382
[RISTA] The sword he got
back then was not Igzasion,

252
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,551
it was just a fake to
keep you from worrying.

253
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,052
‐‐[MASH] You're kidding.
‐‐[ELULU] Oh, no.

254
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,513
His skill level has
stopped rising, too.

255
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,308
He has neither the sword
nor sacred armor.

256
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,809
That's exactly why he learned

257
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,103
Valkyrie's most
advanced technique.

258
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,815
It can strike down the enemy,
but the cost is one's own life.

259
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,027
The inescapable Valkyrja:
Gate of Valhalla.

260
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,196
No! Valkyrie told
us that she would never

261
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,614
teach him how to do that move!

262
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,532
[ISHTAR] You witnessed
their destruction aura

263
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,618
investiture
ceremony, didn't you?

264
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,077
[RISTA gasps]

265
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,746
That's how she
gave him the ability

266
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,247
to pull off the
Gate of Valhalla?

267
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,166
Seiya's willingness
to risk his life

268
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,669
to save a world that wasn't his
was enough to convince Valkyrie

269
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,339
to trust him with her
sacred Omega Valkyrja.

270
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,091
But if Seiya actually decides
to use the Gate of Valhalla,

271
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,927
there's no way he'll
be able to survive

272
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,386
what it's gonna do to him!

273
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,556
[ISHTAR] He's determined to
succeed where he failed before.

274
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,558
To protect those dear to him

275
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,769
and to rid himself of
the specter of the past

276
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,896
that has haunted
his subconscious.

277
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,231
To seek redemption.

278
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,523
[RISTA]
I don't understand.

279
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,192
You're telling me all this stuff

280
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,152
and it doesn't
make any sense to me!

281
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,572
Why are we so important, and why
would he need to redeem himself?

282
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,574
[ISHTAR] I can answer
your question, but first,

283
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,244
there is something
that I must ask you.

284
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,620
Tell me, Ristarte,

285
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,123
do you possess a goddesses'
courage to learn the truth?

286
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,464
[TIANA] Does he ever listen
to a single thing we tell him?

287
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,882
I can't deal with this!

288
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,177
[COLT laughs] This is how he
handles everything, isn't it?

289
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,304
Do you actually think
this is funny, Colt?

290
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,474
[ARIA] Relax, Tiana. I'm sure
it'll work out in the end.

291
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,725
It always does, right?

292
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,394
Whose side are you on, Aria?

293
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,397
I just don't think we should
encourage his reckless behavior.

294
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,066
[ARIA] Oh, try not to
let it get under your skin.

295
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,111
[RISTA]
Whoa, Aria, is that you?

296
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,196
[ARIA]
Yes, it is indeed.

297
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,907
And what we're watching
right now is the B level mission

298
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,410
to save a world called Ixphoria.

299
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,287
Ixphoria?

300
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,206
[gasps] Is that Seiya?

301
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,959
[SEIYA] All right, guys,
let's go wipe out the Chimera.

302
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,086
[TIANA]
Hold on, Seiya, we're not ready.

303
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,547
The Chimera's level
is way higher than ours.

304
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,008
We should probably take
some more time to train.

305
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,344
We don't have time.
Sooner we fight, sooner we win.

306
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,014
Besides, I've got a strategy.

307
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,391
Well, could you please
share it with the rest of us?

308
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:32,228
[SEIYA] Yeah. Let's do
our best. We're fine, relax.

309
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,772
[TIANA gasps] That's the
dumbest thing I've ever heard!

310
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,232
That is not a strategy!

311
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,360
We need to be 100 percent
ready to win no matter what!

312
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,363
[SEIYA] It's gonna be okay.
Everything will work out.

313
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,491
What? We have to take
this battle seriously!

314
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,327
Wait. Seiya,
where are you going?

315
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,370
We're not ready! Seiya!

316
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,622
I don't think
this is a good idea!

317
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,959
[ARIA] Way back then,
Seiya Ryuuguuin was the hero

318
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,128
I'd summoned to take
control of Ixphoria.

319
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,715
What? Then why haven't I
heard about this before now?

320
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,676
Our mage, dressed in
the robes, was named Colt.

321
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,096
The girl‐‐that was
Princess Tiana of Ixphoria.

322
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,432
She was our party's healer.

323
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,641
She joined up with Seiya

324
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,269
along the way to help
defeat the Demon Lord.

325
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,938
[RISTA]
Huh?

326
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:24,947
[CHIMERA snarls]

327
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,158
[roars]

328
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,701
Colt, use your wind magic!

329
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,745
On it! Here goes!

330
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,999
I'll find an opening
and finish this in no time!

331
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,876
[COLT groans]

332
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,795
‐‐Oh, no!
‐‐Tiana, I need heals!

333
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,088
Okay, just hold still!

334
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,507
[ARIA] Wait, Tiana!
You need to heal Seiya first!

335
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,634
He's down to his last two HP!

336
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,677
What?! Only two? [yelps]

337
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,888
There's a huge
hole in his chest!

338
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,473
Oh, I'll be okay.

339
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,558
I know this looks pretty
bad, but weirdly enough,

340
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,560
it doesn't really
hurt that much.

341
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,814
I'm starting to feel like
this is all just a crazy dream.

342
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,690
You feel that way
because you're about to die!

343
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,192
It's so hard to believe.

344
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,778
He doesn't seem like
the Seiya that I know at all.

345
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,863
No. Although things
were looking grim,

346
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,532
we still made it through.

347
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,618
[roars]

348
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,373
[panting]

349
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,375
Look at that, we won!

350
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,127
You should look at us instead!

351
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,711
We're all in horrible
shape right now!

352
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,339
Yeah, we have been better,
but it's good we beat him.

353
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,882
You think this is good?

354
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,051
Poor Colt had
his leg ripped off!

355
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,096
Tiana, please,
hurry up and heal me.

356
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,474
All right, you guys,
the Golem is our next target,

357
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,892
so we'd better get moving.

358
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,394
[TIANA]
Hey! Did you hear me?!

359
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,688
Colt's got a bloody stump
where his leg used to be!

360
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,027
So weird. Are you
sure that's even Master?

361
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,904
He reminds me of Rosalie.

362
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,615
[ARIA] This is how
Seiya used to behave.

363
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,576
He hated waiting to level up.

364
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,412
All he wanted to do
was keep moving forward.

365
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,956
He foolishly believed that
his innate fighting ability

366
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,374
would be enough.

367
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,209
Even though his rating was low,

368
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,503
and despite the fact
that he was never prepared,

369
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,881
he always managed
to defeat the enemy.

370
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,884
So none of us really
worried all that much.

371
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,094
[RISTA] Sounds to me
like he was more fun then.

372
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,429
Maybe that old Seiya actually

373
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,556
celebrated with his
friends after a victory,

374
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:17,435
instead of freaking out
about the next fight.

375
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,104
[ARIA] We all relied
on Seiya in those times,

376
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,190
and he relied on us.

377
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,780
‐‐[TIANA] Seiya.
‐‐[SEIYA gasps]

378
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,033
All we gotta do is
beat the Demon Lord.

379
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,077
Yeah, and we're headed
out first thing tomorrow.

380
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,330
You should make sure to
get a good night's sleep.

381
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,791
[TIANA] Oh, I'm way
too nervous to sleep.

382
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,504
Hey, are you sure we don't need
to go to the Sage's village?

383
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,465
[SEIYA] We already have
the weapon we need to win.

384
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,926
So let's not go out
of our way for anything.

385
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,845
But we can get some information
about the Demon Lord there,

386
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:53,888
according to Aria.

387
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,264
I just wanna beat the Demon Lord

388
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,558
and save the world
as soon as I possibly can.

389
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,560
[TIANA gasps]

390
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,438
You're always in such
a massive hurry, aren't you?

391
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,525
You never make time to
train or anything like that.

392
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,193
Are you ever gonna
tell me why it is

393
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,487
you're in such a crazy rush?

394
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,447
It's not that complicated.

395
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,698
No special reason.

396
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,576
Jeez, every time I bring
it up that's all you say.

397
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,454
This quest ends tomorrow,
so I gotta know why!

398
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,332
What's the real
reason? Just tell me!

399
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,673
[SEIYA sighs] The longer
the Demon Lord is alive,

400
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,133
the longer the people
of this world will suffer.

401
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,261
That's all there is to it.

402
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,721
That's why we
have to end this now.

403
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,349
Okay, it's actually
a good point.

404
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,644
I would have never made it this
far without your healing magic.

405
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,688
Sorry to keep putting you out.

406
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,856
I know that I ask
a lot sometimes.

407
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,108
It's fine, really.

408
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,152
I'm sure things'll
all work out in the end.

409
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,446
So go on and say
what you always say.

410
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,074
I always feel better
after hearing it.

411
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,622
It's gonna be okay.
Everything will work out.

Is he dead?

take things down to the wire.

00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,632
coming from this woman's belly.

463
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,466
[gasps]

464
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,219
That's your seed growing
inside her, isn't it?

465
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,596
I think I'll have it
for one last appetizer

466
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,306
before the main course.

467
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,433
This mother and child

468
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,562
will be the perfect sacrifice
to usher in the new world!

469
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,064
Please, no!

470
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,692
Stop! I beg you!

471
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,402
Don't do this!

472
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:40,906
No!

473
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,700
I believe that
we've seen enough.

474
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,286
It wasn't Seiya's fault.

475
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,662
It's mine.

476
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:50,249
If only we'd gone to the Sage's
village and learned that secret.

477
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,461
As the goddess, I should've
made that happen.

478
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,795
Hey, are you okay?

479
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:55,629
[ELULU]
Rista!

480
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,464
[RISTA gasps]

481
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,799
[ISHTAR] Have the memories
that once lay dormant

482
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,594
in your soul
re‐emerged, Ristarte?

483
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,055
The poor Princess whose life
the hero was unable to save‐‐

484
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,099
that was you,
before your rebirth

485
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,601
as a goddess of
the Divine Realm.

486
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,229
[gasps, cries]

487
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,232
[ISHTAR] Thanks to Aria's wish,
as well as the good deeds

488
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,651
Princess Tiana
performed during her life,

489
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,905
you were reincarnated as
the goddess you are today.

490
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,407
It was no mere coincidence
that you chose Seiya

491
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,076
to bring salvation
to Gaeabrande.

492
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,163
Fate drew your souls
back together again.

493
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,248
Of course, as with you,

494
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,043
Seiya has no memory
of your shared past life.

495
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,044
But regardless,

496
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,880
the extreme guilt and
regret he felt on that day

497
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,924
has been etched deep
within his soul.

498
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,218
When he was once again
summoned as a hero,

499
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,011
those impressions resurfaced.

500
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,806
They were revealed
in a single word.

501
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,681
What do you mean?

502
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,766
[ISHTAR]
Do you remember when you were

503
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,644
first getting acquainted he
used the word "Properties"?

504
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,520
[gasps]

505
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,813
Properties.

506
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,981
Yeah, I thought he was
just being difficult.

507
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,484
I imagine it was
largely subconscious,

508
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:01,695
but this‐‐ This was
the image in his mind's eye.

509
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:03,989
[RISTA]
So that means.

510
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,449
Seiya is quite sharp,

511
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,576
and from this small
passage recorded here,

512
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,579
it seems he was aware he'd
been summoned once before

513
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,498
and of the tragic end
he'd suffered.

514
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,958
[RISTA]
I have to go.

515
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,251
Why would you leave right now?

516
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,837
Obviously, because
I need to help Seiya!

517
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,422
Hold on, please don't go!

518
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,134
Rista, I can't stomach the
thought of losing you again.

519
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,056
Although, I'm thankful for
everything you've done for me,

520
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,891
I can't stay here.

521
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:31,892
But, Rista.

522
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,563
I can't sit back while Seiya
puts himself in harm's way.

523
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,940
[ARIA gasps]

524
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,985
At this point, the Demon Lord
has the power to destroy gods,

525
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,029
so I would not fault you
for staying behind with us.

526
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,532
In fact, I recommend
you do stay behind.

527
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:50,244
Seiya took measures to ensure
your safety. That was his wish.

528
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,871
Will you defy him?

529
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,582
[RISTA]
Yeah, you're damn right I will!

530
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,252
[ISHTAR gasps]
This portal that you've opened

531
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,964
leads to the Demon Lord's castle
where the final battle awaits.

532
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,424
You realize that by entering,

533
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,926
you overstep your role
of support goddess.

534
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,430
I know that.
I'll face those consequences.

535
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,515
‐‐[MASH] Rista!
‐‐[ELULU] Wait up!

536
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,767
There's no reason for
you to risk your lives.

537
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,020
So if you really want
to go back to Gaeabrande,

538
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,355
get Ishtar to send you
when this is over.

539
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,065
[MASH]
Don't be stupid! We're going!

540
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,650
The only reason that
we're still alive

541
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,652
is because Seiya helped us out!

542
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,613
So we're gonna help him!

543
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,614
Really?

544
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,742
I realize there's no point
in trying to stop you.

545
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,910
[RISTA]
Yeah.

546
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,496
All I ask is
that you be careful.

547
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,582
I'll do my best.

548
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,793
[RISTA]
Hold on, Seiya, I'm coming.

549
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,087
I'm not sure I'll
be able to save you.

550
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,424
But I'm your friend,
so I have to try!

551
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,011
The least I can do
is not let you die alone!
