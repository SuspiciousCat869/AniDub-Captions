00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,771
So... what now?

2
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,772
[KILKAPUL]
Hero.

3
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,482
You are not like most mortals,

4
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,818
and I believe you may even
have stood a slim chance

5
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,154
of defeating the Demon Lord.

6
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,699
But we'll never know because
your journey ends here.

7
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,745
Wait. Are you gonna fight him
without your monster buddy?

8
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,079
You misunderstand me.

9
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,291
This old body would be
no match for the hero.

10
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,709
Which is why...

11
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,627
[RISTA grunts]

12
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,212
...I would like to
show you something.

13

[RISTA]
Ew! It's horrible!

16
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,429
[KILKAPUL] You may recognize
them from a previous encounter.

17
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:21,725
These are, in fact, the heads
of my wife and young son.

18
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,562
A sad, but necessary measure
to ensure your defeat.

19
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,898
My next step
requires their deaths,

20
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,567
the entire village, and my own.

21
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,694
The ultimate
sacrifice must be made

22
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,948
to invoke the most powerful
summoning magic in the world.

23
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,409
I call on the
hyper‐conceptual reaper,

24
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,329
Krosde Thanatus, to manifest!

25
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,166
Uh... I don't think
he's gonna make it.

26
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,710
Rista, open up a portal
to the Divine Realm.

27
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,879
What? You want me
to do that now?

28
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,547
[SEIYA]
I don't see a portal opening!

29
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,341
[RISTA whimpers]

30
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,013
[RISTA]
So it's hyper‐conceptual

31
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,265
because you can't
read the stats or what?

32
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,851
Like, it's just a
bunch of gobbledygook!

33
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,896
[SEIYA] Hm, I can't make any
sense out of his stats either.

34
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,773
Do you think
it's using Fake Out?

35
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,400
No, doesn't seem like it.

36
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,861
I'm pretty sure those
are just its regular stats.

37
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,238
[RISTA]
I don't know what that means!

38
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,782
[SEIYA] It means that
thing's gonna kick our ass.

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,206
Have a taste of my
Double Wind Blade!

40
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,875
Got 'em!

41
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,252
[SEIYA]
Where's the damn portal?

42
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,170
Why? You just slashed it up.

43
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,422
[RISTA gasps]

44
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,469
Whoa, now there's
two of those things?

45
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,555
How is that possible?

46
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:45,934
[SEIYA groans]

47
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,520
[RISTA]
It just landed a hit on Seiya?

48
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,862
Maximum Inferno!

49
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,742
[SEIYA] Rista move your
ass and open the portal!

[RISTA groans]

57
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,640
Did you really have to kick me
through the portal like that?

58
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,517
Oh, no! Are you okay?

59
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,270
I think I'll survive.
But I'm hurt pretty badly.

60
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,064
I can fix you up.
Show me where it hurts.

61
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,357
[SEIYA]
Fine.

62
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,777
[RISTA]
Uhh...

63
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,362
Is it one of those things
that feels worse than it looks?

64
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,365
Earlier, I was at 300,000 HP‐‐

65
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,576
this wound took me
down another hundred.

You're such a baby!

67
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,663
I won't fight unless
I start out at max HP,

68
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,624
so heal me!

69
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,293
[RISTA] Jeez, do you
need a diaper change, too?

70
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,545
So what was the deal
with that thing back there?

71
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,297
That was crazy, wasn't it?

72
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,049
It goes against the
rules of living things

73
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,884
and magic and all the things.

74
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,552
[RISTA] We need to
come up with a strategy.

00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,637

It's breaking through
the dimensional barrier?

That freakin' thing
is unstoppable!

There's gotta be some kinda
way to take it down, right?

All right, Seiya,

82
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,277
I'm sure you've already
figured out its weakness,

83
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,570
so you wanna share
that info with us?

00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,925
she'll agree to do it
if we just go up and ask her.

159
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:29,801
Therefore...

160
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,011
[gasps]

161
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,767
[VALKYRIE gasps]

162
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,271
All right. Just what I wanted.

163
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,981
Well, it's on...

164
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,984
[VALKYRIE]
No freaking way.

165
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,779
I've been working on that piece
forever, and I was almost done!

166
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,239
Are you ready?!

167
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,908
I'm gonna paint my next
picture with your blood!

168
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,576
You should get back.

169
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,327
How'd you know‐‐ Urgh!

170
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,621
[RISTA]
Holy...

171
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,124
Or maybe I'll smash you
into a million little pieces

172
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,460
and use 'em to
make a mosaic instead.

173
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,754
Feel my Shattered Break!

174
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,134
[gasps]

175
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,888
[VALKYRIE]
The hell? Is it a ghost?

176
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,892
Well, that's fine by me.

177
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,978
Try this. It's my
Fourth Valkyrja.

178
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,189
Eat my Astral Break!

179
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,576
[RISTA]
Uh‐oh.

180
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,829
Even the strongest goddess in
the Divine Realm can't stop him?

181
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:45,794
[VALKYRIE laughing]

182
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,255
By Ishtar! Grant this order!

183
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,718
She just unleashed her
suppressed divine power,

184
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,304
so it's about to
get real ugly up in here.

185
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,848
She's totally maxed out!

186
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,393
Huh, the other gods all seem
pretty weak compared to her.

187
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,187
But, to be perfectly honest,

188
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,774
I've been really unimpressed
with everyone here up until now.

189
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,323
Time for Omega Valkyrja.

190
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,495
Gate of Valhalla!

191
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,918
Huh? What'd she do?

192
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,211
I have no idea.

193
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,548
Well, that's a
super creepy move.

194
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,591
[laughs]

195
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,677
[RISTA]
Nightmare fuel!

196
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,394
It's not every day that I use
an inescapable, destructive

197
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,148
technique that transcends
the very fabric of reality.

198
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,150
But sometimes you
gotta kick it up a notch.

199
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,985
Whoa, are you okay?

200
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,111
[VALKYRIE]
Don't come near me, Rista!

201
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,487
[gasps]

202
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,823
[VALKYRIE]
It's happening... Here goes.

203
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,242
[RISTA]
What's happening?

204
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,786
[screams] She's
got splatterreah!

205
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,121
Gate of Valhalla uses

206
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,915
the caster's life
force as a catalyst.

207
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:06,958
That kinda boss move

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,128
would definitely rip
a human into bloody ribbons.

209
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,339
How can I help you?

210
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:13,965
Uh‐‐

211
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,385
That's the stuff, baby.
I could get used to this.

212
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,304
Oh, yeah! Right there.

213
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,556
Um, is your team S or M?

214
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,559
So the Order you activated
wasn't to use your technique.

215
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,686
It was to deal with
the recoil afterwards.

216
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,772
[VALKYRIE]
Yep, to make sure I bounce back!

217
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,940
Fine now? Great.

218
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,984
Since you're the one who
brought that monster up here

219
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,611
and ruined my painting,

220
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,321
you're the one who's
gonna have to pay the toll,

221
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,032
which is gonna cost ya one
handful of bare boobage.

222
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,533
[RISTA]
You're own bare boobage.

223
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,368
Boob pro quo. Awkward.

224
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,912
Pick one!

225
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,788
Wow. Thank you!

226
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,498
[RISTA] Maybe under
that cold, prickly shell,

227
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,459
you're a man who'll
fight for my honor.

228
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,668
Or maybe he can't
stand the thought

229
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,045
of someone else
having extra fine,

230
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,505
divine, dirty,
touchy‐feely time.

231
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,299
[RISTA groans]

232
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,384
That's not how you
get to second base!

233
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,595
All this time,
you were the one for me.

234
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,223
Take me back to your place right
now and train my brains out.

235
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,682
You want more training?

236
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,643
I mean, I know you like
to be ready for anything,

237
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,894
but we still have a job to do!

238
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,437
And we're gonna do it.

239
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,773
But the foes keep getting
stronger, so I should, too.

240
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,691
You can't pull off
the kinds of crazy things

241
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,609
that Valkyrie can.

242
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,319
If you even tried that
Gate of Valhalla move,

243
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,695
it'd turn you into spaghetti!

244
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,656
[gasps, groans]

245
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,783
Little Miss
Firm Cheeks is right.

246
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,243
There's no way a regular human

247
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,411
could learn a Valkyrja
in the first place.

248
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,747
Well, I'm not a regular human.

249
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,499
You don't give up, do you?

250
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,459
I know you don't think
about anything but training,

251
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,588
but you can't even imagine the
kind of spanking I'd give you‐‐

252
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,423
If you whip that out,
you'd better use it.

253
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,217
Uh, please stop.

254
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,469
[SEIYA]
I can take what you got.

255
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,013
[VALKYRIE]
Oh, so you like it rough?

256
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,431
[SEIYA]
Yeah, 'cause I need someone

257
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,809
who's gonna make me work for it.

258
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,726
[VALKYRIE]
All right then.

259
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,353
If you think you can take it.

260
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,523
But listen closely,

261
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,818
there's no way I'm teaching
you how to do Gate of Valhalla.

262
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,404
Teach me something else.

263
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,156
[VALKYRIE]
Be at my place in ten minutes.

264
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,826
Uh, they're talking
about training, right?

265
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,662
Is it okay with you
if we go back to Aria's?

266
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,164
[ELULU] I really want
to pick up where I left off!

267
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,417
Fine with me. Go and have fun.

268
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,960
[MASH, ELULU]
Thank you!

269
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:14,877
[RISTA sighs]

270
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,588
I guess you do need to learn
some new destruction moves.

271
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,507
Not like we have
much choice now.

272
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,509
I mean, the ultimate sword
and legendary armor

273
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,386
are outta the picture.

274
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,804
Like they say
back in your world,

275
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,723
this is really some
hardcore kinda sitch

276
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,266
we've stepped in, isn't it?

277
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,102
Whining about it
isn't going to help.

278
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,771
So I picked up a piece
of the legendary armor.

279
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,231
Is that a chunk of adamantite

280
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,400
the terrible turtle
thing was snacking on?

281
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,529
It's not enough for armor,
but I can use it to synthesize.

282
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,866
[SEIYA]
I'll call it Adamantitor,

283
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,451
the indestructible sword.

284
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,286
It may not work
against the final boss,

285
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,954
but it's the best sword
there is right now.

286
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,124
Amazing work, Seiya!
Way to make that lemonade!

287
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,292
You're the best!

288
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,585
Get off me, Rista.

289
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,545
[RISTA]
Aw, you don't have to be shy.

290
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,172
I said get off of me.

291
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,798
You're carrying around my hair,

292
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,760
so I know you're a little
sweet on me. [giggles]

293
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,136
[SEIYA]
Listen.

294
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,220
Hm? I'm right, yeah?

295
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,222
You're ripe.
You're really stinky.

296
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,265
Seriously?

297
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,352
What do you mean, like, what
kind of smell is it, anyway?

298
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,186
Hot garbage.

299
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,938
I have to go and take a bath
right this minute before I die

300
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,441
and then come back
because I can't die.

301
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,942
Just go bathe.

302
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,445
I'm going over to Valkyrie's.

303
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,412
[RISTA] Hey, Cerceus.
Bath time for you, too?

304
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,331
Couldn't just walk
around the rest of the day

305
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,000
covered in cake, could I?

306
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,169
The whole idea was
for it to go in my face,

307
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,046
not get smeared all over it.

308
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,590
[RISTA]
That's fair. Was it any good?

309
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,718
No, of course it wasn't any
damn good, it was way too salty!

310
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,387
It tasted like tears!

311
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,138
[RISTA]
Oh, right. Sorry...

312
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,225
[CERCEUS sighs]
Hey, that reminds me.

313
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,644
Ishtar was looking
for you earlier.

314
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,854
Do you know what she
wanted to talk about?

315
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,441
If I had to guess, I'd say it
was about that demon you let in.

316
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,902
Like, I'm 99 percent sure.

317
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,072
[RISTA] Ugh, I'm gonna have
to see her, smellin' all funky.

318
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,825
Well, Rista.
I'm glad you stopped by.

319
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,828
Hey, look. I'm sorry about
that whole reaper drama.

320
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,454
[ISHTAR]
Oh, don't be silly.

321
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,456
That was not your fault, dear.

322
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,418
Besides, Valkyrie took
care of it, didn't she?

323
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,628
It's not even an issue.

324
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,464
Then why were
you looking for me?

325
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,883
[ISHTAR] It appears that the
last of the Four Heavenly Kings

326
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,177
is making a move
down on Gaeabrande.

327
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,930
He's leading a demon army
to overthrow the capital.

328
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,349
No. Rosalie's in trouble!

329
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,852
There is simply
no time left to spare,

330
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,479
so you must return
to Gaeabrande at once.

331
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,940
Yes, ma'am. I'll go right now!

332
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,400
[ISHTAR]
Uh, I mean...

333
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,987
Hurry, but you still have
time to take a bath, I'm sure.

334
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:50,700
Perhaps it's your long journey,
but you smell a touch gamey.

335
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,618
[whimpers]

336
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,579
[ARIA]
Whoa, Rista.

337
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,456
What's going on with your skin?

338
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,041
Oh, a sunburn.
I'm just a delicate,

339
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,252
sweet‐smelling
little flower, after all.

340
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,338
[RISTA] I don't stink! I can't
stink! I will never stink again!

341
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,090
Well, enough about me.

342
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,885
How did Mash and
Elulu's training go?

343
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,888
Excellent! You're in
for a big surprise!

344
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:20,938
[RISTA gasps]

345
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,316
He has mastered
his metamorphosis,

346
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,943
and she was able to upgrade
her Haste spell to Quick.

347
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,528
I'm very proud of both of them.

348
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,697
We have been working
our tails off here!

349
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,158
We want to help Seiya
as much as we can.

350
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,911
Wow. That's awesome.
You guys are great!

351
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,413
[ELULU] We couldn't have done
it without Aria to teach us!

352
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,916
[MASH]
Yeah! Thank you so much!

353
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,958
[RISTA]
All righty then.

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,961
I gotta get my butt in gear so
these rug rats don't show me up!

355
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,006
I'll prove to Seiya I'm
more than just a pretty face!

356
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,509
[RISTA]
Excuse me! Coming in!

357
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,428
Agh!

358
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,640
[RISTA]
Wait, wait, wait!

359
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,475
I knew you two were
playing around earlier,

360
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,602
but you're really not
supposed to be doing this!

361
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,729
Put some underpants on, now!

362
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,481
Once again, you don't get it.

363
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,857
We're just training in here.

364
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,400
Oh, can you blame me?

365
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,194
What's the point of
having a beefcake around

366
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,862
if you can't grab
yourself a slice?

367
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,156
But still!
Hot sweaty, sweet relations

368
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,992
between a goddess and
a mortal is forbidden!

369
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,204
Ugh. You have no clue
how things work around here.

370
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,498
This is why
I can't stand novices.

371
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,791
I may not have much,

372
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,502
but I am trying as
hard as I possibly can!

373
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,045
I've been working
like crazy all day

374
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,214
to make this
so I can help Seiya!

375
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,757
What is that thing?

376
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,593
Some kind of gross doll?
Was it in the trash?

377
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,888
Looks like it was woven out
of oily golden thread.

378
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,807
Wait. You gotta be kidding me.

379
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,766
Did you‐‐

380
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,268
[RISTA]
I sure did!

381
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,769
I made this doll out of hair

382
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,521
that I pulled out
of my own head!

383
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,981
And I've dubbed her Lil' Rista.

384
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,774
[VALKYRIE]
You're outta your damn mind!

385
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,025
[RISTA]
I figured it would come in handy

386
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,152
for Seiya's synthesis skill.

387
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,488
So I yanked them out
in little clumps.

388
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,199
It hurt so bad, but worth it!

389
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,785
The level of psychotic
just doesn't work for me.

390
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,829
I won't squeeze
your boobs again.

391
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,498
Hey, Rista, you feelin' okay?

392
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,210
I don't really think this
is a great look for you.

393
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,837
[RISTA] I just thought
this would help Seiya

394
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,088
when he needs it.

395
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,923
But now that
I stop and look at it,

396
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,759
this is restraining
order level crazy.

397
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,595
[RISTA cries]
I'm sorry!

398
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,347
Stop it. It's disgusting.
Don't leak it on me.

399
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,433
I just want you to like me!

400
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,977
Seiya, how can I
make you like me?

401
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,312
[SEIYA] Cleaning up
your snot would help.

402
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,480
But why, out of all
the goddesses here,

403
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,733
would you choose that old,
ugly pain freak over me?

404
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,193
That was just Valkyrja training.

405
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,195
Remember, I told you
that you didn't understand

406
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,071
what was going on.

407
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,449
You cross your heart and
swear to God you mean that?

408
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,952
That is so stupid.
You are a god.

409
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,245
Okay then.

410
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,499
It's pretty unbelievable,
but still, I trust you.

Mash, put this in my item bag.

Uhh... sure. If you say so.

413
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,302
Well, anyway,
did you get enough training?

414
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,429
Oh, yeah,
what about you, Master?

415
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,013
[SEIYA]
Mm‐hm.

416
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,058
That's great news, 'cause we
gotta get back to Gaeabrande!

417
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,062
Apparently, the last Heavenly
King is attacking the capital!

418
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,939
[SEIYA]
Okay, let's get going.

419
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,901
[RISTA] Looking back, I was
just too worked up to notice.

420
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,153
But Seiya never
said his catchphrase:

421
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,280
"I'm perfectly prepared."

Remember, what we're
all fighting for today

425
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,334
is the future of Roseguard!

426

into an all‐out war.

awaiting your arrival, hero.

towards our city walls.

The men who met them
on the battlefront

432
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,849
have been made to
retreat in terror.

come to our doorstep.

I had asked for a fight,
not a sacrifice.

[RISTA] Seiya, you need
to go and help him!

468
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,503
Fair goddess, it is an honor
to meet you at last.

469
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,838
If this old man has stolen
your hero's thunder,

470
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,131
I humbly ask forgiveness.

471
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,467
Oh, there's no
need to apologize.

472
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,135
I'm actually extremely grateful

473
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,179
to you for defeating
that Heavenly King.

474
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,681
That old dude is like a
walking force of nature.

475
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,600
He took out that big,
six‐armed monster thing

476
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,060
like it was nothing!

477
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,813
If you can wield this kind
of power, why aren't you

478
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,524
joining the battle to
take down the Demon Lord?

479
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,150
Long story.

480
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,401
[RISTA]
Okay...

481
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,069
[WARMASTER groans]

482
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,611
[SOLDIERS, RISTA gasp]

483
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,113
This can't be.
It's starting to happen again.

484
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,491
Please, clear the area, now!

485
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,617
Get moving!

486
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,286
[RISTA] This guy is looking
like death eating a cracker.

487
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,080
Maybe he's sick and
can't leave the capital.

488
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,748
This is his condition.

489
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,460
Our brave Warmaster
is infantilizing!

490
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:17,670
Huh?

491
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,548
Uh?

492
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,760
Mommy, I made boom‐boom
in my diapey again.

493
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,262
[GROUP]
Uhh...
