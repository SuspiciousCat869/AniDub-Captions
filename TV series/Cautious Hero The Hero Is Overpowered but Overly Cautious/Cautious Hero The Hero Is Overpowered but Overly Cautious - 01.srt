00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,936
[HOST GOD] Now!
Assembled gods and goddesses,

3
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,063
may I have your
attention, please!

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,981
The difficulty level
for this next salvation

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,775
will be the dreaded S‐Class!

6
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,819
And doing the honors
this time will be...

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,658
[HOST GOD]
...The Goddess Ristarte!

8
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,409
[GODDESS 01A]
I'm so glad it's you, Rista!

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,953
[GOD 01A] You have some
big tasks ahead of you.

10
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,079
[GODDESS 01B]
Once you finish this,

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,456
you'll be a full‐fledged,
legitimate goddess!

12
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,918
Thank you, all. I vow to use
this endeavor to better myself

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,919
and gain experience

14
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,380
so I can one day become
a high‐ranking goddess!

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,550
Are you freakin' kidding me?!

16
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,762
[panting]

17
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,766
Ugh, I can't believe they
gave me an S‐Class job!

18
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,185
[RISTA] I'm Ristarte,
or "Rista," for short.

19
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,604
I was born into the
Unified Divine Realm,

20
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,232
let's just say, 100 years ago.

21
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,150
I've summoned heroes
from the human realm

22
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,571
to save worlds on the brink
of collapse five times so far.

23
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,533
[RISTA] But compared to the
higher level gods and goddesses,

24
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,577
five times is
nothing to brag about.

25
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,830
The average is about ten,
and some of the big deal deities

26
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,000
have saved hundreds of worlds.

27
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,293
And in case you're wondering,

28
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,421
S‐Class means that the world
is so messed up and dangerous,

29
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,174
that even the most experienced
gods don't wanna go near it.

30
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,678
[RISTA whimpering]

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,766
[RISTA]
The last few times,

32
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,311
I've chosen a young man from
Japan to summon as the hero.

33
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,187
They seem the easiest to train.

34
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,897
Japan has a lot of
stories about people

35
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,734
being taken to another
world for various reasons,

36
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,694
so they get the idea
pretty quickly.

37
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,738
And though the public is on
the verge of being completely

38
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,531
oversaturated with
this kind of story,

39
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,992
the sheer number of them can
only mean it's still popular.

40
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,702
Wait, why am I narrating?

41
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,745
[groans]

42
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,497
I'm so stressed,
I'm losing my mind.

43
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,793
I can only summon one hero,
so I have to choose carefully.

44
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,545
Suzuki...

45
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,005
Sasaki...

46
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,466
Suzuki, Yamada.

47
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,217
Sasaki, Sato.

48
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,137
Suzuki, Tanaka, Sasaki,
Yamada, Sasaki, Suzuki,

49
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,181
Yamada, Yamada, Tanaka,
Yamada, Sasaki, Suzuki.

[RISTA yells]
Jeez! They all look alike to me!

51
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,646
[RISTA yells]

52
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,190
I need to make some
kind of decision here!

53
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,108
[gasps, yelps]

54

56
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,288
Stupid paperwork!

57
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,249
Uh... Huh? Huh? Huh?!

58
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,710
Hold on just a minute!
This guy is a level one,

59
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,213
but his stats are
unbelievably high!

60
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,011
Wow. I've never seen a human
with numbers like these before!

61
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:58,929
Oh, yes!

62
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,306
Whoever this is,
he's a total phenom!

63
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,517
A one in a million
find for sure!

64
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,646
No, he's more like a one
in a hundred million find!

65
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,022
[RISTA]
He'll be able get Gaeabrande

66
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,565
back in order in no time!

67
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,150
And I'll be that
much closer to being

68
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,152
a super high‐ranking goddess!

69
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,696
Heh! Yeah!

70
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,740
I'm the luckiest
goddess there ever was!

71
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,242
[RISTA chuckles]

72
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,875
[RISTA]
Hmm.

73
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,883
By the power of
the goddess Ristarte,

74
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,053
I now summon a hero
to this sacred chamber.

75
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,560
Come forth, Seiya Ryuuguuin!

76
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,278
[gasps]

77
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,498
[RISTA]
Wow, he's dreamy!

78
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,499
He's six feet tall,

79
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,210
with noble features under
that luscious dark hair.

80
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,879
And he gives off
an aura that's as heavenly

81
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,965
as the Great Gods in
the Unified Divine Realm.

82
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,049
Oh, I could lose myself

83
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,010
in passionate love
with a man like this!

84
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,971
Wait! A goddess getting
involved in a steamy romance

85
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,140
with a human is uber forbidden!

86
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,476
Ehem.

87
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,187
Greetings, I am the goddess
known as Ristarte.

88
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,897
I know this must
be quite shocking,

89
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,648
but it is out of
urgent necessity that

90
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,526
I have summoned you from the
human world into our dimension.

91
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,279
Hearken to my words
carefully, Seiya Ryuuguuin,

92
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,406
for you are the hero
chosen to save the world

93
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,242
of Gaeabrande
from the Demon Lord.

94
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,410
[RISTA chuckles]

95
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,871
[RISTA] He's so enchanted by
me that he can't even speak.

96
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,207
But I mean, who could blame him?
I am a goddess after all.

97
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,250
And not to be vain, but I
know I've got it goin' on‐‐

98
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,503
What kinda freak drops a bomb
like this on a stranger?

99
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,880
Who's a freak?!
Are you talking about me?!

100
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,965
[RISTA gasps]
Whoops! Calm down, Rista!

101
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,801
A goddess must always
maintain her composure.

102
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,471
Ehem! I'm sure that you
must be mystified by me.

103
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,473
You've likely never been
in the presence of a goddess

104
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,308
such as me or summoned
to a higher plane

105
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,601
for a task such as this.

106
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,478
If you're really a goddess,
couldn't you just save

107
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,897
whatever‐the‐hell world
it was by yourself?

108
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,525
Well, there are rules in place.

109
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,777
The gods have created
countless worlds

110
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,321
where the humans are
to prosper by their own efforts.

111
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,573
This also means that these
worlds where humans dwell

112
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,576
must be saved by
humans themselves.

113
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,828
What if I refuse?

114
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,204
This is a sacred duty.

115
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,414
‐‐I can't do as I please?
‐‐Not really.

116
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,958
Can I ask you to
change the rules?

117
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,626
No, you cannot!

118
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,711
In other words, you're
just using me. Lame.

119
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,630
This is gonna get old.

120
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,507
[RISTA]
Now, now, he's overwhelmed,

121
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,217
so take it easy on him.

122
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,635
It seems like most
of these guys perk up

123
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,970
when I start the next part.

124
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,973
Hey, how about you try
calling out "Status"?

125
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,224
‐‐Why?
‐‐Sorry.

126
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,853
I suppose I just assumed that
you were a gamer. I'll explain.

127
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,646
When you call out
"Status," your abilities

128
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,649
will magically appear before
you in glowing numeric form.

129
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,984
Go on, give it a whirl!

130
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,527
[SEIYA sighs]

131
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,653
Properties.

132
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,988
"Properties"?!

133
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,990
No, we need you to
say "Status," please!

134
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,408
Why would you say
something else?

135
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,201
Does that actually
have meaning, or...?

136
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,246
[SEIYA] Sure enough, I see
some data only I'd know about.

137
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,206
Which means that
your ridiculous story

138
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,749
may have a tiny
shred of credibility.

139
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,752
Ugh! You shouldn't be so
rude to a goddess, ya know?

140
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,171
"Status"! Just say
"Status" already!

141
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,425
Oh, please don't make
me beg you to do it!

142
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,926
All right, Status.

143
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,220
You see all that?

144
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,599
Your stat numbers are above and
beyond any run‐of‐the‐mill hero.

145
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,393
You're a one in a hundred
million phenomenon!

146
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,436
There's only one hero

147
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,730
who can defeat the
Demon Lord of Gaeabrande!

148
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,442
And that hero is you, Seiya!

149
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,528
Ya wanna tell me what happens
if I die in this world?

150
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,905
[RISTA]
What a wet blanket.

151
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,949
Not to worry! You won't be
able to return to Gaeabrande.

152
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,743
You'll just be taken
back to your world.

153
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,202
Huh. Not sold yet.

154
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,997
[RISTA] Ugh. He sure is
a tough nut to crack.

155
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,041
Maybe he has to see it
for it to sink in.

156
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,542
In that case...

157
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,629
[RISTA] Seiya, I'll explain
everything in due time.

158
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,048
Open doorway to the other world!

159
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,427
[RISTA] Come, Seiya Ryuuguuin!
Take my hand and follow me.

160
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,095
The fate of Gaeabrande hinges

161
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,931
on your spectacular
heroic abilities!

162
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,599
‐‐No, thanks.
‐‐This will be an exciting

163
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,393
journey, full of wonders
and feats of‐‐ Uh, wha...?

164
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,311
Did you say no?

165
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,520
[SEIYA]
Of course I said no.

166
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,732
You expect me to just rush
into a fight with a demon?

167
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,608
[RISTA]
Hold on a second!

168
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,902
I would've never chosen you
if you didn't have a chance,

169
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,571
and I can provide backup
whenever you need me to.

170
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,489
So you needn't worry.

171
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,616
I don't believe I can
depend on your backup.

172
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,035
Have you totally forgotten
you're talking to a goddess?

173
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,954
I assure you that I will
not let you die and

174
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,871
if you were to get injured,

175
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,665
I can use my healing
magic on you.

176
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,250
That's not backup and it's
obvious you called me here

177
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,211
because you can't
pull it off yourself.

178
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,338
[RISTA growls]
What is his deal?

179
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,382
I should bash in his
beautiful, brooding face!

180
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,341
[yelps]

181
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,968
[SEIYA]
Listen up. If I can't refuse,

182
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,178
I gotta insist on one condition.

183
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,264
Well, what is it?
What do you want in return?

184
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,518
[gasps]

185
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,270
You mean...? Ah, we mustn't!

186
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,397
[RISTA squeals]

187
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,148
I truly hate to
break your heart,

188
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,859
but love between gods
and mortals is‐‐uh?

189
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,862
If I'm gonna do this, at least
let me get prepared for it.

190
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,032
I need to be 100 percent ready.

191
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,576
Ugh, what kind of hero is he?

192
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,080
[RISTA gasps] Then, like a
bolt of lightning, it hit me.

193
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,291
I had overlooked
a crucial personality trait.

194
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,882
[SEIYA grunting]

195
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,228
I never imagined that
someone like this existed!

196
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,314
Well, how were things
resolved in the end?

197
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,151
[RISTA] He's still training for
it in an empty room at my place.

198
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,736
A normal person
would wanna rush over

199
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,447
and at least see
another world, right?

200
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,617
Rista, your goal is to take
control of Gaeabrande,

201
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,369
which is an S‐Class mission.

202
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,454
Perhaps a cautious attitude
is most appropriate here.

203
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,124
[RISTA groans] But it's
such a colossal waste of time

204
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,668
compared to going there and
fighting some low‐tier monsters

205
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,962
so he can start to
get his XP level up.

206
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,463
I promise it's okay.

207
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,465
You don't need to
be in such a rush.

208
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,634
The flow of time
is considerably slower

209
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,470
in the Divine Realm than it
is in the terrestrial worlds.

210
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,306
I know, but it's just that
I want this adventure

211
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,267
to work the way
that it's supposed to.

212
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,478
No matter your expectations,
he still needs your support.

213
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,647
Which in this case means
if he's busy training,

214
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,649
you need to be
looking after him.

215
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,817
[RISTA]
What do you mean by that?

216
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,944
Like, how are his
living conditions?

217
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,238
Does he have a toilet
and place to shower?

218
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,114
Does he have a bed?

219
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,407
[RISTA grunts]

220
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,117
[ARIA]
What have you given him to eat?

221
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,702
[gasps]

222
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,453
[RISTA]
Now that you mention it...

223
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,955
And be sure to keep in mind‐‐

224
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,332
if you're giving him orders and
reminding him you're a goddess,

225
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,959
he may not respond that well.

226
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,212
He might be more agreeable
if you treated him as a friend.

227
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,089
You're right, as always, Aria!

228
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,133
I knew I could count on you!

229
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,803
Another pep talk
right on schedule.

230
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,602
[RISTA] Hey! I'm so sorry for
leaving you here all by your‐‐

231
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,395
[RISTA]
Holy six‐pack!

232
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,523
[SEIYA] Yo, does the concept of
knocking not exist here or what?

233
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,108
Oh, whoops.

234
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,861
[RISTA] Wait a minute,
this is my place after all.

235
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,237
[RISTA]
I bet you're hungry!

236
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,238
What's that?

237
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,489
[RISTA]
Well, since you're Japanese,

238
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,158
I brought you some rice balls.

239
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,827
This one is pickled plum and
this one has some yummy salmon!

240
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,329
[SEIYA]
Hmm. I was raised to never

241
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,372
accept food from
weird strangers.

242
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,250
I am not a stranger,
so would ya stop being so rude?

243
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,919
‐‐You should eat it first.
‐‐Why?!

244
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,046
I need to be sure that
it's not poisoned.

245
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,216
What reason would
I have to poison you?

246
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,176
You see? It's just fine.

247
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,053
Why in the realm would
I try to kill you?

248
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,264
Okay, so there's no fast‐acting
poison in them. Huh.

249
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,683
No slow‐acting poison, either!

250
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,397
[RISTA]
Oh, and FYI,

251
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,024
push‐ups, pull‐ups, and sit‐ups

252
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,360
don't do anything
to increase your stats.

253
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,320
I'll leave three meals
a day outside your door,

254
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,446
but I won't bother you.

255
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,990
When you're finally ready,
you can call me with this!

256
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:21,991
Until you call me,

257
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,994
I promise to leave you in
complete solitude, okay?

258
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,413
What? Is that not
enough for you?

259
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,874
How do I know that this
won't trigger an explosive?

260
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,126
‐‐Say wha...?
‐‐[door closes]

261
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,337
Well, he can do whatever
he pleases in there!

262
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,507
I give it three days tops
before he buzzes me!

263
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:41,427
Still no buzz. Is it broken?

264
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,763
Or did something else happen?

265
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,015
It could be bad.

266
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,350
He's dead?!

267
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,062
But he is eating
the food I leave him.

268
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,983
I guess I'll just
keep on waiting.

269
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,403
[RISTA groans]
It's never gonna ring.

270
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,697
I'll have to wait forever.

271
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,783
[RISTA DOLL ringing]

272
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,577
[RISTA]
You rang? Oh!

273
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,750
[RISTA]
Sexy... So fresh and so clean.

274
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,752
I remember telling
you to knock first.

275
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,296
Yeah, I'm the rude one here.

276
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,047
So how's the training going?

277
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,215
[SEIYA]
Status.

278
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,260
[RISTA]
Hmm.

279
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,303
[RISTA gasps]

280
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,264
[RISTA] You leveled up like
crazy just from working out?!

281
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,142
You do have that unique
"XP boost" skill, after all.

282
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,768
And now you have
other special skills?

283
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,186
If it were completely up to me,

284
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,230
I'd like to max out
my levels first.

285
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,441
You'd spend the rest
of your life in here!

286
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,942
Time passes slowly
in this realm,

287
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,360
but we don't have forever!

288
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,863
We have to get going.

289
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,489
On to Gaeabrande!

290
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,824
[SEIYA]
Yeah, okay.

291
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,078
I am perfectly prepared.

292
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,205
I am 100 percent ready for this.

293
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,665
[RISTA]
What is he doing?

294
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,709
Trying to work in some
cool little catchphrase?

295
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,711
[RISTA] Great! But you
don't have to say that.

296
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,338
Let's just go, already!

297
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,138
The Great Goddess
Ishtar determined

298
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,058
this was the perfect place
for us to enter this world.

299
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,268
Now, we need to go
into the Town of Edona

300
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,770
and get your equipment.

301
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,368
Hello. You just passing through?

302
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,036
Hello! Yes, we are.

303
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,372
Are you sure it's safe
to be casually walking

304
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,249
around this strange village when
you're dressed like a stripper?

305
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,834
Watch your mouth, pal!

306
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,336
And I used my goddess power

307
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,755
to make it look like
I'm wearing normal clothes!

308
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,131
I'm not nearly as concerned

309
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,759
about your outfit as
I am about that man.

310
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,844
He could well be
a monster in disguise.

311
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,013
Jeez, he's just a regular guy.

312
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,681
I don't like the look of him.

313
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,433
It's possible he's
a shapeshifter.

314
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,976
[RISTA]
No, it's not.

315
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,645
[SEIYA] Even if he's
not literally a monster,

316
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,814
he could be a thief,
or a mass murderer.

317
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,067
I may need to take him
out before he kills us.

318
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,945
You're the one who sounds like
a murderer, you paranoid weirdo!

319
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,281
Oh, wow, you sure look super
pretty in that outfit, lady!

320
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,534
You're like a goddess
or somethin'!

321
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,661
How sweet.

322
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,539
Innocent little children can
always recognize true beauty.

323
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,166
[NINA giggles] Mister,
you got some funny clothes,

324
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,085
but you seem really cool anyway!

325
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:22,088
My, are you gonna let some
childish remark upset you?

326
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,507
I bet they call you Mister Cool!

327
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,134
What's your real name?

328
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,219
It's Seiya.

329
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,180
Ooh, my name's Nina!
Nice to meet you!

330
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,141
I'd love to watch this
interaction go on,

331
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,767
but we have a job to do.

332
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,310
Oh, tell me, Nina.

333
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,646
Is there a blacksmith
or weapons shop nearby?

334
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,898
Yeah, there's a place
like that real close.

335
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,693
Just a little bit down
the road that way.

336
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,070
[RISTA]
Thanks, Nina. I appreciate it!

337
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,867
Here's a little
present from me to you.

338
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,243
This should be more
than enough money

339
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,579
to buy whatever you
think you're gonna need.

340
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,498
[WEAPONS SHOP OWNER]
Welcome.

341
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,336
Definitely gonna take this
steel armor right here.

342
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,005
[RISTA]
Nice, excellent choice!

343
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:04,964
Three sets.

344
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,507
Not so fast!

345
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,509
You don't need that much armor!

346
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,511
[SEIYA]
I do because I need one to wear,

347
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,306
one for spare, and one more
in case the spare needs a spare.

348
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,224
[RISTA]
Do you have an armor fetish?

349
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,851
What kind of
ridiculous hero spends

350
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,270
all his money on three
identical sets of armor?

351
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,856
I'll choose one for you,
so just stay put, okay?

352
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,357
You're not the boss of me.

353
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,944
[RISTA] He's not just
cautious, he's pathological.

354
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,910
[RISTA]
Mm, that's way better.

355
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,704
You really look like
the ideal hero to me!

356
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,498
[bell chimes]

357
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,790
[SEIYA]
I need 30 smoke bombs,

358
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,002
50 medicinal herbs,
and 50 antidotal herbs.

359
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,004
[ITEM SHOP OWNER]
Oh, yes, coming right up, sir.

360
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,214
Thank you!

361
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,257
[RISTA] At least they're
not that expensive.

362
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,593
But still, you bought so many!

363
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,095
[SEIYA] There's no telling
what we might encounter,

364
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,472
so I need to be prepared.

365
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,767
I may not look it, but I am
a veteran at this stuff.

366
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,187
Therefore, I located the
perfect starting place for you.

367
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,564
There's nothing but
weak monsters around here.

368
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,565
I'm not so sure,

369
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,943
and I highly doubt you're
a veteran, like you claim.

370
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,694
[RISTA]
Why would I be lying?!

371
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,488
[NINA]
She's right!

372
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,531
It's true!

373
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,493
Even I can walk over to the next
town with no problem at all!

374
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,702
Only things we gotta deal with

375
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,746
are wibbly, wobbly
little slimes!

376
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,749
If a cute little girl can
handle it, then so can you!

377
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,584
Does that put your mind at ease?

378
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,127
You look pretty
strong, Mr. Seiya.

379
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,255
Are you really afraid
of going outside of town?

380
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,673
Yeah, underneath all that armor,

381
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,050
he's actually just a big,
strong, fraidy‐cat!

382
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,010
Well, then, take this!

383
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,055
This charm will
ward off any evil.

384
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,976
You didn't put a curse
on this, did you?

385
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,769
[RISTA]
Jeez! Just stop it!

386
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,645
What'd you say?

387
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,565
Don't pay any attention to him,
he's just a little sick!

388
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,275
Nina, what've you got into?

389
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,235
Hey! Papa!

390
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,736
[TOYA]
I apologize.

391
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,363
My daughter can
be a little nosy.

392
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,614
I'm sorry if she bothered you.

393
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,741
[RISTA]
No, no, not at all!

394
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,826
Right?

395
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,161
No, not very much, at least.

396
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:03,165
[RISTA] Hmm. So he's not
completely disagreeable.

397
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,168
[RISTA] Okay, it's finally
monster fight o'clock!

398
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,587
I don't see any good reason

399
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,672
why we need to go out
looking for trouble.

400
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,507
[RISTA]
Don't be such a diaper baby.

401
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,010
You have enough gear
to take on an army!

402
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,430
There's a little monster!

403
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,557
I've never seen
anything like that before.

404
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,475
Are they genetically engineered?

405
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,102
Don't you know what a slime is?

406
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,770
These things are
in like every game!

407
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,605
[SEIYA]
Nope.

408
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,565
You are really Japanese, right?

409
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,859
Slimes jump at you when they
attack, but they're so weak

410
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,653
that practically anyone can
kill them with just a stick!

411
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,738
So...

You mean you know more than
two special attacks already?

How about another
Atomic Split Slash attack?

428

Why use the same attack
twice in a row like that?!

I mean you do already have
the Scan ability, right?

00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,818
Use that to check
the slime's stats.

00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,903
I did check them, 'kay?

were both in the single digits.

Then why did you
throw everything at it?

444

There could be more to it
than just the visible data.

445

Try to have some more
faith in your skills!

Welcome.

I'm one of Four Heavenly Kings
serving the Demon Lord.

459
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,444
I am known as Chaos Machina!

460

What? No way, you can't be!

461

We're not supposed to be
facing a powerful enemy yet!

You sound quite surprised.

463
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,204
Our wise Demon Lord detected
the signs of a hero summoning

464
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,165
before it even happened.

465
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,292
So comically predictable.

466
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,335
Every time a new
hero is summoned,

467
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,671
they head to an area full
of the weakest monsters

468
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,089
to boost their skills,

469
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,176
and when I thought about
where that might be...

470
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,970
...I knew this was the
perfect spot to end you.

471
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,639
Now I see why this is
an S‐Class mission.

472
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,975
I can't use any of
my normal strategies.

473
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,101
[MACHINA]
The Demon Lord has been

474
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:12,021
vigilantly waiting
for a hero to appear!

475
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,316
I didn't think we needed
to worry, but here we are.

476
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,486
And now that I look at you...

477
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,946
...I can tell you're
something special.

478
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,656
Deep within you
lies the potential

479
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,534
to be an incredibly
powerful foe.

480
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,203
It's too bad.

481
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,579
That won't do.

482
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,247
No, no, no, no, no.

483
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,166
It just won't do at all!

484
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,169
I'll have to end you right now!

485
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,173
[RISTA] Oh, no! I need
to scan her right away!

486
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,425
[RISTA grunts, gasps]

487
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,718
[RISTA] Why are we
going up against someone

488
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,054
this powerful in
the first stage?

489
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,849
How do we get out of this?

490
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,520
I guess we should try to run as
fast as we can, but then what?

491
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,313
What do you think, Seiya?

492
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,231
‐‐[RISTA] Huh?
‐‐[SEIYA] Later!

493
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,525
He left me?!

494
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,820
[SEIYA panting]

495
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,864
[RISTA] Hey, speedy,
what's the big idea?!

496
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,115
[giggles]

497
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,325
[MACHINA]
Running away without thinking

498
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,035
is the smart thing to do.

499
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:12,248
Most humans wouldn't be so
decisive when faced with danger.

500
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,667
Well, how fascinating!

501
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,711
Yes. What a fascinating hero!

502
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,382
Wait for me!

503
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:26,929
You'd run away and
leave a goddess behind?!
