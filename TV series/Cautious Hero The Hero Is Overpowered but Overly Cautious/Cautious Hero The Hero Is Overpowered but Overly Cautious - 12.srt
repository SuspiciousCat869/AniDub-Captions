Hold on, Seiya, I'm coming.

I'm not sure I'll
be able to save you.

3
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,603
But I'm your friend,
so I have to try!

4
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,898
The least I can do is
not let you die alone!

[RISTA gasps]
The air feels so weird.

It's like I can sense
that Chain Destruction thing.

7
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,412
[ELULU] Uh, guys,
I don't like this place.

8
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,790
[MASH]
Is this the Demon Lord's castle?

9
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,000
[RISTA] Yeah, we're
right in the heart of it.

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,504
And that means what's next
will be the final showdown.

11
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,338
There's no doubt.

Oh, no.
Please don't do it, Seiya!

Omega Valkyrja.

18
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,945
If you use that move,
it's gonna kill you!

[SEIYA]
A Valkyrja's not magic.

26
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:39,433
So whatever little barrier you
put up was destined to fail.

27

[XENOS LORD]
A Valkyrja?

28
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,606
This can't be. [groans]

29

But how?!

30
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,152
The only thing that can cause
me bodily harm is Igzasion!

31
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,070
This must be some
kind of illusion,

me believe‐‐ [groaning]

Whoa!

I thought we had him!

37
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,713
He's clawing his
way out of the gate!

38
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,507
No, this is not good.

39
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,512
[XENOS LORD] You shouldn't
trifle with me, human! [yells]

40
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,680
[SEIYA]
I'd never trifle with

Seiya really does
need the sacred sword.

[XENOS LORD] You claim
to take the fight seriously,

47

with this needle?

[XENOS LORD] I told you
your attacks won't work on me,

52
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,846
but you foolishly
refuse to listen!

[XENOS LORD]
No!

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,312
This isn't the sacred sword,
so how can it cut my flesh?

56
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,731
Wait. What is that?

57
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,565
[SEIYA]
Heh.

58
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,901
No way! It's the doll
I made from my hair.

59

This is so embarrassing!

I get it now! Master used
his Synthesis technique!

61

[SEIYA]
Rista.

74
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,452
You used some kinda shortcut
to get here, didn't you?

75
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,455
Whatever happened to following
the rules of the Divine Realm?

76
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,999
[RISTA] What?! Why the hell
would you bring that up now?

77

If you die here, you won't
be able to go back home,

don't you remember?

That's true, but I still
beat the Demon Lord.

[RISTA] You're the most
cautious person in the world.

How could you not
have figured out

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,262
how to beat him without
dying in the process?

You're not getting away
with this, understand me?

You already stood us up!

We were supposed to
go out and have some fun!

90

All I wanted was
to have a few drinks,

play around, hang out at a hot
springs in our bathing suits,

and actually enjoy a little
time together for once!

the healing power

Ristarte, right now!

95
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,667
[ISHTAR] Ristarte,
you have violated the rules

96
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,836
of the Divine Realm
by using a gateway

97
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,713
to move to your final location.

98
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,298
It's possible our tribunal will

99
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,134
strip you of your goddess
ranking, and I cannot shield you

100
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,094
from this punishment
if you go further.

101

I don't care.
That doesn't scare me.

102

I've made my peace.

103
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,309
Plus, I'm pretty
sure this is why

104
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,727
I became a goddess
in the first place,

105
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,980
so I'll deal with
the consequences!

00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,023
[ISHTAR]
Very well.

As long as you understand
what's at stake,

[RISTA] I may have
failed you in my past life,

00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,658
[SEIYA]
Then again...

158
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,911
...it's pretty impressive
that you were able to heal me.

159
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,745
All right.

160
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,040
I'll admit you're slightly more
useful than a medicinal herb.

161
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,792
Abusive and a jerk, too!

162
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,085
[ELULU]
Wait.

163
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,170
Hey, Rista.

164
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:46,633
Do you know why the Gate of
Valhalla hasn't disappeared?

165
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:56,393
[GATE OF VALHALLA 12A groaning]

166
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,607
[XENOS LORD]
I'll take you all down with me!

167
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,944
Annihilate you and this
entire world in one fell swoop!

168
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,989
Judgment Zero!

169
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,075
[RISTA]
What was I thinking?

170
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,536
I should've known it
wouldn't be this easy.

171
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,829
And that ball of black light

172
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,165
has the power to destroy
the world twice over!

173
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,585
Everything on this planet
will be turned to dust.

174
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,337
That means us, too.

175
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,171
This is it.

176
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,007
Not on my watch.

177
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:27,841

Gate of Valhalla!

180
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,680
Don't do it, Seiya!

181
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,390
Once more!

182
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,600
[RISTA gasps]

[GATE OF VALHALLA 12B]

184

[XENOS LORD] Damn you!
Beaten by a lowly human?

185
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,778
You'll pay for this!

186
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,576
[XENOS LORD yelling]

[MASH, ELULU gasp]

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,546
So is it over this time?
Ya know, for good?

190
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,256
Now don't get
yourself all worked up‐‐

191
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,884
both he and the first gate
have been swallowed.

192
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,469
That thing's talking to us!

193
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,722
[laughs] The Demon Lord has
been taken from this world

194
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,265
and thrown into the void.

195
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,225
Time to collect my payment‐‐

196
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,602
the life of the caster.

197
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,229
That is the cost
of summoning me!

198
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,732
No way! Don't worry, Seiya!

199
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,735
I swear I'll save you again.

200
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,946
[gasps] What's happening to you?

201
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,449
This is different
from last time.

202
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,118
‐‐[ELULU] Seiya!
‐‐[MASH] Master!

203
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,787
[RISTA]
Seiya!

204
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,166
[RISTA]
Oh, no!

205
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,668
He's falling apart faster
than I can heal him!

206
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,378
You were far too naive.

207
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,798
It's extremely foolish to
believe that a mere human

208
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,425
could ever escape the Gate of
Valhalla's toll more than once.

209
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,219
Shut up, Gate Face!

210
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,263
Hang in there, Seiya!

211
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,556
[RISTA]
I need to concentrate

212
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,601
and focus all my
energy into healing him!

213
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,274
[RISTA]
Why is this happening?

214
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,276
Seiya just saved this world!

215
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,778
Don't kill him!

216
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,948
[GATE OF VALHALLA 12B cackles]
I don't care what he's done!

217
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,658
I'm just a servant
of the underworld,

218
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,910
here to collect payment.

219
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,747
Chain Destruction doesn't
exist in the Divine Realm,

220
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,000
so if we go back there,
maybe Seiya won't die for real!

221
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,127
He should be able to go back

222
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,004
to his original world if
he dies, so open up a portal!

223
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,005
[RISTA]
can't.

224
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,425
Look, if I take my focus off
healing him for even a second,

225
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,094
he's gonna fall apart.

226
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,178
[MASH]
No!

227
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,974
Hey, squirt, thanks for helping
me out with the Warmaster.

228
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,308
Save your strength.

229
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,644
If it weren't for
your support magic,

230
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,230
I probably would've
been killed in that fight.

231
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,941
But now... you're dying.

232
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,069
If I had turned into
that sword, you'd be fine.

233
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,738
You wouldn't have to give up
your own life for this!

234
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,782
I'm sorry.

235
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,409
Well, bro,

236
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,120
now that the Four Heavenly Kings
and Demon Lord are history,

237
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,664
there's no one in this
world that you can't beat.

238
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,374
You're gonna need
to work with Rosalie

239
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,251
and keep things
safe around here.

240
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,587
You can't just leave us, Master.

241
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,796
Please stay.

242
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,382
I never even got the chance
to properly thank you!

243
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,260
Stop it! Stop talking like that!

244
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,847
I said I would save you,
so that's what I'm gonna do!

245
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,932
[SEIYA groans]

246
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,643
But why? You should be healing!

247
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,270
Why is this happening?

248
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,355
It's over for me, Rista.

249
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:33,401
You can't give up!
Don't let it end like this!

250
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,863
I failed you in my past life,
but I'm a goddess now!

251
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,072
This isn't right.

252
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,908
It's okay.

253
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,076
You did the best that you could.

254
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,622
[RISTA]
But it wasn't enough.

255
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,626
A goddess should be able to
save her friend's life, right?

256
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,337
[RISTA]
I'm useless.

257
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,173
I can't help you when
you need it the most.

258
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,382
I'm so sorry.

259
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,761
[SEIYA] It's weird.
This feels familiar...

260
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,347
...like it's all
happened before.

261
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,182
I get it now.

262
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,516
It's you.

263
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,645
You're why‐‐
You're why I'm here.

264
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,522
[RISTA gasps]

265
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:16,402
I'm so glad that I was actually
able to save you this time.

266
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,154
[RISTA gasps]

267
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,818
So you're really leaving?

268
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,111
[RISTA]
Mm.

269
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,530
Thanks to all your work
in defeating the Demon Lord,

270
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,615
Gaeabrande's been saved.

271
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,117
We should throw
a parade of honor

272
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,119
and give you a huge
reward at least.

273
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,870
Don't worry about that,

274
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,665
and besides, the one who
really deserves the praise

275
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,376
gave up his life for this world.

276
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,504
Oh, yeah, you're right.

277
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,423
But let me say one thing.

278
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,257
Huh?

279
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,466
[ROSALIE]
He may not have cared about

280
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,509
what others thought of him,

281
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,219
and he could come off
as somewhat harsh,

282
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,180
but Seiya always stuck to
what he truly believed in.

283
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,057
And the way I see it,

284
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,977
that's the defining quality
of a bona fide hero.

285
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:31,894
It's true.

286
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,105
And everything he
accomplished on Gaeabrande

287
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,732
was something no ordinary hero

288
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,818
could've ever dreamed
of pulling off.

289
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,070
[RISTA] For their part in
defeating the Demon Lord,

290
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,698
Mash and Elulu, our
little Dragonkin friends,

291
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,408
were both knighted by Rosalie.

292
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,452
I know you're gonna
do great things.

293
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,246
Thank you.
Master saved this world,

294
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:55,543
so I have to do everything
I can to keep it safe. [gasps]

295
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:56,878
[ELULU laughs]
Don't worry,

296
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,796
'cause I'll be
watching over him.

297
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,718
[RISTA] Hmm. Well, that
does ease my mind a little.

298
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,970
You really gonna
go back home, Rista?

299
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,474
I am. I can't stay
here forever, ya know?

300
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,725
[ELULU]
I'll miss you!

301
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,018
I'll miss you, too.

302
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,811
[ELULU]
Come back and see us sometime.

303
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,229
We can go to the hot springs!

304
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,023
We still need to hit the casino!

305
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,484
You're right.
Sounds like fun to me.

306
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,653
You promise?
You'll really visit?

307
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,614
Yeah, of course I will.

308
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,326
[RISTA]
All right, this is it.

309
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,827
[ROSALIE]
Goddess Ristarte.

310
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,745
[RISTA]
Huh?

311
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,081
I'm having trouble
with Father's death.

312
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,332
But the strength and courage

313
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,542
you've shown is a
real inspiration to me.

314

take down a Demon Lord

470
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,707
and save a world on
the brink of destruction.

471
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,919
A trait that kept me alive
despite all the danger.

472
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,171
And a mindset that
can only be granted

473
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,341
through reflection
on one's past mistakes.
