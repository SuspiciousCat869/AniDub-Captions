1
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,231
[ARIA]
See? It all worked out.

2
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,109
Yeah. Maybe I
overreacted just a bit.

3
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,111
Well, Adenela is a goddess.

4
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,822
She knows better than to
take a human life like that.

5
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:57,576
And Seiya is capable of handling
just about anything by himself.

6
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,246
[RISTA] Hm. I wish I could be
as levelheaded as you, Aria.

7
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,205
It's so weird.

8
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,833
You'd think I'd know Seiya
better by now, but I don't.

9
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,461
Uh, well, I could only
make an informed guess

10
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,212
because you talk
about him non‐stop.

11
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,882
Speaking of which,
let's change the subject.

12
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,801
Hey, there, Mash.

13
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,346
You mind showing Rista
what you've been up to?

14
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,264
[MASH]
Um, sure.

15
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,476
Oh. What did you do?

16
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,062
[ARIA] I released one of his
Dragon Metamorphosis seals.

17
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,438
By gaining a dragon appendage,

18
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,523
his attack power has
jumped several levels.

19
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,525
Yeah! Ya like that?
Pretty cool, right?

20
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,402
Uh, well, you say cool,

21
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,155
I say kinda creepy,
but it's your arm, so...

22
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,531
What's so creepy
about it, Rista?

23
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,866
I know, right?

24
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,409
By itself, it's awesome!

25
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,287
But with the rest of him,
meh, not so much.

26
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,830
What's wrong with
the rest of me?!

27
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,040
Tell me how you really feel!

28
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,042
That's not very nice, you two.

29
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,920
Mash has worked very hard
to achieve his special skill:

30
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,589
The Comically
Colossal Dragon Claw!

31
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,757
What is this,
Bust Mash's Balls Day?

32
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,801
Mash, you really
need to slow your roll.

33
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,678
Eh, heh, heh.

34
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,138
Why, you...

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,934
‐‐Uh, okay. Also pretty creepy.
‐‐[MASH] ...little goober!

36
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:08,105
You're so dead! I never...

37
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,148
Wait, I recognize this spell.

38
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,402
Yes. It's support magic
that slows an opponent down‐‐

39
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,236
Delay.

40
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,570
No way.

41
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,199
The dormant power you sensed
in Elulu was support magic?

42
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,325
[ARIA]
Correct.

43
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,828
‐‐[yelps]
‐‐Fix this!

44
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,621
Speed me up!

45
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,999
[ELULU] Okay, fine!
Let's turn things up a notch.

46
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,834
Eh, heh, heh.

47
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,293
[MASH]
Uhh...

48
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,337
You knew damn well what I meant,
Elulu, and this was not it!

49
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,922
You've had your fun,
so change me back already!

50
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:34,756
Enough is enough...

51
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,675
She can also cast Haste?

52
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,010
When did she learn one spell,
much less its counter?

53
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,097
She acquired these new
talents fairly recently.

54
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,974
I suspect your
desire to help others

55
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,351
was the cause of this
exciting development.

56
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,519
[giggles]

57
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,229
[MASH] Do you understand the
words coming out of my mouth?

58
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,064
No, because I'm faster
than the speed of sound!

59
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,859
[crash]

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,861
Yes! I think Delay and Haste

61
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,946
are just what Seiya
needs for support!

62
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,489
Good work, both of you!

63
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,700
Why does the sadist
get all the damn praise?

64
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,286
I expect to see both
of you again sometime.

65
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,997
By then, Elulu will
know more magic, and, Mash,

66
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,124
you'll have mastered
your Dragon Metamorphosis.

67
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,793
‐‐Right!
‐‐Yep! I can hardly wait!

68
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,879
Oh. I would've
come to you sooner

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,298
if I'd known you could help
boost their strength like this.

70
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,426
[ARIA] Mm‐mm. Everything
you've done has had a purpose.

71
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,762
Thanks to the experience
these two had gained,

72
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,097
their talents were able
to blossom beautifully.

73
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:24,931
[ELULU, MASH]
Hmm.

74
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,850
Yeah! We're gonna
be tough to beat.

75
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,769
Especially with Seiya's
new bow abilities.

76
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,188
Did you just say bow?
Please don't tell me.

77
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,774
Mitis isn't the one teaching
him this time around, is she?

78
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,692
Yes. Only the best for Seiya.

79
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,320
That and I'm pretty sure
she's the only archery goddess.

80
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,905
[ARIA]
How could you be so stupid?

81
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,364
That woman is
utterly terrifying!

82
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,659
What? Uh, you mean like even
more terrifying than Adenela?

83
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,119
The two don't compare
in the slightest,

84
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,496
and that's putting it mildly!

85
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,873
Do you know why she was banished
to live in the Divine Forest?

86
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,249
[RISTA]
Mm‐mm.

87
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,835
[ARIA]
She's a nymphomaniacal goddess

88
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,754
that will prey on
any hero summoned.

89
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,713
If they cross her path,

90
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,840
she abducts and
sexually devours them!

91
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,842
‐‐Guhh!
‐‐Sexually?

92
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,887
It's the reason Ishtar drove
her out into the forest!

93
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:07,182
Allowing men anywhere near
her is absolutely forbidden!

94
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,141
[RISTA]
But they're just training!

95
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,268
I swear. I saw it myself!

96
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,062
[ARIA] Mitis must be
savoring her quarry

97
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:16,733
and waiting till the last day.
I bet she's ready to explode!

98
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,401
Oh, no, no, oh!

99
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,945
[ARIA] Sexual relations
between a goddess

100
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,948
and a human are forbidden.
He won't come back from this.

101
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,658
It's a one and done situation!

102
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,784
One and done?

103
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,244
For a stupid hookup?

104
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,205
What are you still doing here?
Go find Seiya this instant!

105
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,873
And step on it!

106
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,334
[RISTA] I refuse to allow my
one in a hundred million hero

107
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,671
to get booted for divine booty,
unless it's my divine booty!

108
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,381
I take it back!
I take that back!

109
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,801
If I twist my ankle running
in wedges, he is gonna pay!

110
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,223
Seiya!

111
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,599
[gasps]

112
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,021
[RISTA] Uh, so... You guys
just hangin' out, or...?

113
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,481
[SEIYA]
I mean she is.

114
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,816
She asked me to
give her ten minutes

115
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,150
to get ready for something.

116
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,152
Apparently, it's Bondage 101.

117
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,613
[MITIS chuckles]
Think of this exercise

118
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,490
as one last test, Seiya.

119
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,450
Use a volley of
three light arrows

120
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,244
to score hits on these ropes.

121
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,163
That shouldn't be too
challenging for you.

122
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,792
Oh. So this is like a final
exam for all of your training!

123
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,460
But freaky!

124
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,338
[MITIS] If you succeed,
my naked body will be released.

125
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,884
You will then catch me and learn
from my vast carnal knowledge.

126
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,386
Vast, huh? That's a weird flex.

127
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,554
[MITIS]
I've been patient.

128
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,181
These past three days have
been nothing but torture!

129
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,685
Especially with a man as
handsome as you are. Hit me!

130
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,728
Do it, Seiya!

131
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,021
Release me from these ropes

132
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,481
and then release me
again with your body!

133
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,524
[RISTA]
Sounds messy.

134
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,985
Seiya, step away
from the nympho!

135
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,112
[SEIYA]
Don't nympho boss me.

136
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,616
[RISTA]
Your call, but remember,

137
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,410
succeeding means letting
her sloppy bits go free!

138
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,870
[SEIYA]
I'm not worried.

139
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,125
Seiya! You just discharged
right in her face!

140
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,044
[MITIS groans]

141
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,795
I realize she's
immortal and all,

142
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,840
but you just don't go
for the head like that!

Oh, Seiya.

145
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,180
That's not the kind of
foreplay I had in mind.

146
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:16,061
[MITIS grunting]

147
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,648
[MITIS chuckles]
Here's a bondage tip:

148
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,900
Never put yourself in
a position you cannot escape.

149
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,734

150

No, sir! Eyes off.

151
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,364
[MITIS] If I were to give a
grade for that last shot,

152
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,199
it would be a failing one.

[grunts]

154
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,411
[MITIS] I hope you're
ready for your retest.

155
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,205
[RISTA]
Seiya, pull out!

156
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,875
Now then, prepare yourself,
because I'm going to attack.

157
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,920
Try to stop me. I dare you.

158
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,505
Think of this as
a more intensive

159
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,090
and hands‐on part
of your training!

160
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,258
[RISTA] Naked training
is not a thing, please stop!

161
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,385
[MITIS]
Ready...

162
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,636
...go!

163
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,848
[MITIS screaming]

164
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,893
[MITIS groaning]

165
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,982
[SEIYA]
Three Shot Shining Arrow.

166
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,693
[RISTA]
Ugh. I threw up in my mouth.

167
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,612
[MITIS chuckles]

168
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,323
Goddesses do not die!

169
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,701
You can't stop me
no matter how hard you are!

170
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,328
Uh, do all goddesses
have a side like this?

171
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,956
Pretty sure she's
a demon in disguise!

172
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:18,790
[yelps]

173
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,958
[RISTA]
Get your lust eyes off Mash!

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,503
An appetizer before the
main course sounds divine!

175
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:27,215
I like 'em when they're young.
Age is just a number after all!

176
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,843
Run, Mash, she's
gone full pervert!

177
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,970
[MASH whimpering]

178
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,056
[MITIS yelling]

179
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,641
[MITIS]
First, I'll strip you down!

180
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,184
Then I'll lay you down!

181
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,769
And finally, I'll wear you down

182
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,479
until you're too
exhausted to move!

183
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,606
[screams]

184
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,692
I knew Taters would
be your next target.

185
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,361
Someone as thirsty as you
will drink just about anything.

186
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,446
[MITIS groans]

187
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,535
Five Shot Shining Arrow,
for her pleasure.

188
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,788
[MITIS panting]

189
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,291
To be penetrated
so many times...

190
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,792
I don't know what
any of her words mean.

191
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,878
It's weird. What pain
makes you happy?

192
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,212
Huh‐uh! Not appropriate!

193
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,548
Oh, yeah. That was amazing.

194
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,050
I'm completely spent.

195
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,511
Seeing you shoot five shots in a
row unmade me in a glorious way.

196
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,389
You're the best
I've ever had, Seiya.

197
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,478
I am perfectly prepared.

198
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,938
I am 100 percent ready for this.

199
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,072
Ugh. If I never see
that vulgar goddess again

200
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,698
it will still be too soon.

201
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,076
Wait. Why is it so quiet?

202
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,037
[CARLO]
Ah! So you've returned.

203
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,872
Captain Rosalie
decided to head off

204
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,957
toward the flies'
lair by herself.

205
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,292
What? Why'd she do that?

206
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,960
I mean, we said
we'd be right back!

207
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,838
Bhat and the others are going
after the captain on horseback.

208
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,465
We should follow
them immediately.

209
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,218
[SEIYA] So predictable.
It's only been an hour.

210
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,428
I highly doubt she's
run into trash breath yet.

211
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,638
It's possible.

212
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,972
‐‐[SEIYA] Chill, bro.
‐‐Huh?!

213
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,682
[SEIYA]
We'll catch up to her.

214
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,773
[SEIYA]
Hm. We'll keep a lookout here.

215
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,149
[RISTA]
Perfect location!

216
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,194
We can see them and their
lair, but they can't see us!

217
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,029
[RISTA gasps]

218
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,865
[RISTA]
It's her! She's an idiot.

219
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:19,452
A brave idiot,
but still an idiot.

220
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,038
That's Light's Blessing,
which must be one of her skills.

221
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,249
It's protecting her
from those mob attacks.

222
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,959
She just became
the perfect decoy.

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,293
[RISTA gasps]

224
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,464
Cool. Now I can
snipe Beetle Face.

225
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,465
You predicted this?

226
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,510
That's why we came here instead
of going straight for Rosalie!

227
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,388
You know you can swat more
flies with honey and what not.

228
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,640
Aw, crap. Way to go, Rista.

229
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,809
[RISTA]
Huh? What did I do?

230
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,686
[SEIYA] Flies have an
exceptional sense of smell.

231
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,895
They came over 'cause
you're stinking up

232
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,272
our lookout with
your goddess stink.

233
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,731
What stink would that be?!

234
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,817
You're joking, right, Seiya?

235
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,485
Hey, you guys smell anything?

236
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,029
Uh, you don't smell
that strong today.

237
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,115
Not enough to be
super concerned about.

238
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,116
So I do stink?!

239
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,660
[ELULU] Uh... It's like
an old lady's laundry?

240
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,162
[SEIYA]
All of you shut up!

241
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,290
It's all or nothing.
I'm going for a headshot.

242
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,499
[RISTA]
Can you do it?

243
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,585
That was the lamest
question ever. Uh‐‐

244
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,044
Oh, look! We found the hero!

245
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,963
We were wondering if
you would ever show up!

246
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,383
Mister! Please, will you be
quiet? The flies will hear us!

247
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,427
Ahh! I offer you
my sincerest apology!

248
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,137
Now you're you being
even louder, dude!

249
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,221
Hate to break it to you, Master,

250
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,599
but those flies are
gunning straight for us!

251
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,434
Stay calm. I'm still on it.

252
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,477
I was ready for something
like this to happen.

253
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,480
I'm Rosalie Roseguard,
the Warmaster's daughter!

254
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,026
Hey, Beel Bub!
Come and give me a fair fight!

255
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,068
[RISTA screaming]

256
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,528
What's she thinking?! Stop!

257
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,114
Not a problem.
Saw that coming, too.

258
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,282
[RISTA]
I'm starting to wonder

259
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,867
if there's anything
you didn't see coming!

260
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,368
‐‐[ROSALIE grunts]
‐‐[SEIYA sighs]

261
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,996
[ROSALIE]
You stupid fly‐jerk! Let me go!

262
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,623
[RISTA]
Did your psychic powers tell you

263
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,959
the Warmaster's daughter
would get taken hostage?!

264
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,128
[RISTA shrieks]
My boob! Sweet charity!

265
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,214
I get you're frustrated, but
don't take it out on the ladies!

266
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,048
I'm not.

267
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,300
I just lost my decoy
and I need another one.

268
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,093
Go be useful for once.

269
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,429
Um... you want me to be a decoy?

270
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,972
I got a plan.

271
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,224
You have to buy me
some time, though.

272
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,059
[RISTA] You're really
putting me on the spot here!

273
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,977
How am I supposed
to distract them?

274
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,647
You could say, "Nice
weather we're having, huh?"

275
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,522
Just like that.

276
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,441
Nice weather we're having, huh?

277
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:16,569
Remember, don't take your
eyes off What's‐her‐face.

278
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,820
If you can do that,
we'll be good.

279
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,530
[RISTA]
Okay, fine!

280
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,907
[RISTA grunts]

281
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,621
[SEIYA]
I'll clear a pathway for you.

282
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,581
Don't worry, stinky. Just fly.

283
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,125
Oh, right.
Thanks for the backup!

284
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,379
And would you please
stop calling me stinky?!

285
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,672
Stop right there!

286
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,506
[BEEL BUB]
Ah?

287
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,634
Judging from those wings,
you must be a goddess.

288
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,885
If you're on Gaeabrande,

289
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,347
that means you have
that meathead hero with you.

290
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,518
[RISTA] Yeah, well he wanted me
to relay a message: Let her go!

291
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,644
[BEEL BUB]
Not to worry.

292
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,855
I was just using this girl
as bait to lure the hero out.

293
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,275
[RISTA] Wait! You're
seriously gonna release her?

294
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,361
[BEEL BUB] Yes, but only
once I'm considerably higher.

295
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,113
In honor of your
hero's downfall,

296
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,699
I'm preparing
a Reverse Firework!

297
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,493
[BEEL BUB]
Any thoughts?

298
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,953
Is this not an excellent height

299
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,997
for you to make
a beautiful firework?

300
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,331
[ROSALIE grunts]

301
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,169
I'm gonna make you
apologize for the men

302
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,338
you killed if it's
the last thing I do!

303
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,715
[gasps]

304
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,717
[BEEL BUB] Considering
you're about to join those men,

305
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,886
I'd say you're in no
position to demand apologies.

306
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,388
‐‐You bastard!
‐‐[RISTA] That's enough!

307
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,098
Your hero said he
would be back by now!

308
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,516
Is he still training?

309
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,310
Not in front of the bug!

310
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,020
[BEEL BUB]
Huh? Training?

311
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,732
That means he's planning to
attack me with a bow and arrow?

312
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,443
[RISTA] Oh, well that's just
great! He's a psychic, too!

313
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,194
[BEEL BUB] Guess I'll
have to gain more altitude

314
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,529
to really set this one off!

315
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,573
[ROSALIE grunting]

316
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,537
[RISTA grunts]

317
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,414
[RISTA] He's flying
higher so magic arrows

318
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,166
have no chance of hitting him!

319
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,127
Way to be the worst
distraction ever, Rista.

320
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,004
[ROSALIE grunts]

321
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,090
[BEEL BUB chuckles] Now, to
treat myself to the sight of you

322
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,843
exploding into tiny
red and pink pieces!

323
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,721
Hmm. I'll have to fling you
to the ground as hard as I can

324
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,014
so she can't catch you.

325
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,724
[RISTA] If he throws
her with all his strength,

326
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,893
I'll never catch her!

327
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,227
Hey, coward!

328
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,189
Get back on the ground
and fight me like a man!

329
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,358
[BEEL BUB] I'm not a man,
I just dress like one.

330
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,777
The only thing you'll
be fighting is gravity!

331
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,821
[RISTA]
Ah! I'm out of options!

332
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,073
[RISTA shrieks]

333
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,240
[BEEL BUB]
Uhh?

334
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,494
So, nice weather
we're having, huh?

335
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,996
Life above the
clouds, am I right?

336
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,831
[BEEL BUB]
Um, what are you talking about?

337
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,169
[RISTA] Hngh! I have no idea!
Any time now, Seiya!

338
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,091
[BEEL BUB grunts]

339
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,343
[yells]

340
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,345
Gotcha! [gasps]

341
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,597
[RISTA] Whoa. Didn't factor
in the weight of your armor.

342
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,516
It's pretty heavy, but I
think we're gonna be okay.

343
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,226
Sorry about that.

344
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,685
[RISTA]
That was Shining Arrow.

345
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,772
Somehow, Seiya managed
to reach him, but...

346
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,232
[BEEL BUB]
Doesn't make any sense!

347
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,651
Even magic arrows
don't have that range!

348
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,320
I've done my research,
and it's not possible.

349
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,280
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

350
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,157
[BEEL BUB] I factored in
the effective trajectory

351
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,575
when I flew this high up.

352
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,452
I don't care what
magic arrows he's using,

353
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,830
there's no way they
could span such distance.

354
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,374
[RISTA] My hero is one
in a hundred million, Bub!

355
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,459
Get used to disappointment!

356
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,504
[BEEL BUB] However gifted
he is, it's still unlikely.

357
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,839
He doubtlessly flew after us

358
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,550
until he was close enough
to fire off a shot.

359
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,093
Like a stalker outside a window,

360
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:31,097
he's hiding somewhere
in the clouds as we speak.

361
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,807
[RISTA]
His brain may be fly‐sized,

362
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,851
but he's just as
perceptive as Seiya.

363
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,310
[BEEL BUB]
I am the fastest of all

364
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,271
the Demon Lord's
forces in the air!

365
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,606
You may call me
the Lord of the Skies!

366
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,442
[RISTA] I have no clue
where you are, Seiya,

367
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,152
but you better not
miss him again!

368
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,236
[BEEL BUB]
Oh, hero,

369
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,697
I would exceedingly like
to see your bow skills!

370
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,116
I won't even hide from you!

371
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,619
Scale of one to ten‐‐

372
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,414
how confident are you in
your stupid hero right now?

373
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,874
Um, I'd say a ten?

374
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,959
I mean, he said
that cheesy line.

375
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,169
[RISTA gasps]

376
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,299
[RISTA]
Seven lights?

377
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,426
Is that a Seven
Shot Shining Arrow?

378
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,304
He's trying to one‐up the
goddess of freaking archery!

379
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,639
It can't be avoided!

380
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,812
[BEEL BUB chuckles]
Rolling Dodge!

381
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,565
‐‐[RISTA gasping]
‐‐He evaded all seven!

382
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,443
No! Is this when we lose? Seiya!

383
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,488
[RISTA] Geabrande is basically
the ultimate difficulty level.

384
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,323
[BEEL BUB]
There you are.

385
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,991
I'm coming, hero!

386
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,453
Seiya, watch out! You're
no match for him in the air!

387
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,415
[BEEL BUB chuckles]

388
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,917
‐‐[thud]
‐‐[BEEL BUB groans]

389
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,796
[BEEL BUB]
That hurts.

390
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,174
Holy hole.

391
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,675
[BEEL BUB]
This bites!

392
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:54,096
Huh? Are those magic
lights or magic birds?

393
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,807
[RISTA] That kind of technique
definitely belongs to Seiya!

394
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,226
But when did he use it?

395
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,185
‐‐[ROSALIE] I get it!
‐‐[gasps]

396
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,229
Once Beel Bub dodged the arrows,

397
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,689
they became birds and
flew back like a boomerang.

398
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,149
I think you're right!

399
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,859
I bet it has
a ridiculous name like

400
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,653
Transform Automatic Garuda!

401
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,862
That's my Seiya!

402
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,656
[BEEL BUB]
Damn you!

403
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,617
I'm gonna be the firework now!

404
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,869
[BEEL BUB screams]

405
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,288
[RISTA] What goes on in
that beautiful head of his?

406
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,332
Even though he outdid
Mitis by two arrows,

407
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,252
he made a backup attack
just in case they missed!

408
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,836
Seiya Ryuuguuin‐‐

409
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,506
the only guy tough
enough to save Gaeabrande,

410
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,967
while staying cautious
every step of the way

411
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,386
and lookin' damn fine doin' it!

412
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,848
[BHAT] Thank goodness
you're safe, Captain Rosalie!

413
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,725
Yeah.

414
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,352
[MASH]
Master!

415
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,271
That was fan‐freakin'‐tastic!

416
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,313
[ELULU]
It really was!

417
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,566
That bug‐brain
didn't stand a chance!

418
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,901
Hey, hotshot! Pretty slick move.

419
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,736
The Transform Automatic Garuda!

420
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,446
What are you
babbling about now?

421
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,533
Ah, sorry. That's just
a silly name I came up with.

422
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,617
So what's it called?

423
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,119
You know, that move
when your light arrows

424
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,662
turn into birds
and ricochet back?

425
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,373
Oh. You're referring to
Boomerang Birdie Boom Boom.

426
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,751
What?! That's awful. You
can't seriously call it that.

427
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,753
I didn't think of it
until just this second.

428
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,798
Ah. Great! Feel free
to use my name, if you want.

429
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,674
[SEIYA]
I don't want to.

430
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,426
It's way too long and
stinks as bad as you do.

431
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,262
You're so mean!
Nothing about me stinks!

432
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,597
Uh‐‐

433
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,974
The title of hero
doesn't suit you.

434
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,685
Your victory was
anything but chivalrous.

435
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,853
A true hero is someone

436
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,355
who strikes down his
foe without trickery‐‐

437
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,274
just like my father does.

438
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,317
[RISTA]
Now, look.

439
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,444
Rosalie, the only reason
you're standing here right now

440
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,572
is because of Seiya!
You could at least thank him!

441
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,824
A little help here?
Just try not to be offensive!

442
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,618
Nothing I say will make a
difference, so let's drop it.

443
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,785
Yeah, but... [muttering]

444
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,454
Barky just likes the
sound of her own woof.

445
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,538
[ROSALIE]
What was that?!

446
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,789
[growling]

447
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,125
Ah! She's losing it again!

448
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,003
[RISTA] Whether it's shooting
arrows or slinging insults,

449
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,547
Seiya's lethal in
everything he does!

450
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,636
[ROSALIE]
Gah!

451
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,434
Okay. Time to take out
the remaining flies.

452
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,521
Tater Tot, Short Stack,
let's see what you're made of.

453
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,397
‐‐[MASH gasps]
‐‐[ELULU] Really?

454
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,650
You're letting the kids take the
reins? That's so sweet of you.

455
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,319
Sure. It's not like I'm
not blind or anything.

456
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,738
I can tell they've been training
and have not only leveled up,

457
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,573
but also gained abilities.

458
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,075
Yeah! We have!

459
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,284
It's true!

460
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,787
[SEIYA] Hop to it. I wanna
see maximum effort out there.

461
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,996
I'll make you proud,
wait 'n see!

462
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,082
Yeah! Wait 'n see!

463
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,970
[MASH, ELULU]
Uhh....

464
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,891
Nice.

465
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:44,975
[MASH]
Master...

466
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,436
[ELULU] I feel betrayed.
So very betrayed.

467
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,604
You're up, Short Stack.

468
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,981
Speed Taters up
with your haste magic.

469
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,525
Oh, sure.

470
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,652
Uh, oh...

471
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,571
[SEIYA] Perfect. Now use dragon
hands to collect fly corpses.

472
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,198
Okay. Cool.

473
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,286
[MASH grunting]

474
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,456
Nice. This method is
much more efficient.

475
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,875
It's also really
entertaining me.

476
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,340
[SEIYA] Hmm. Good enough.
I'll take it from here.

477
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,425
[MASH, ELULU]
Huh?

478
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,468
Cast Hell's Fire!

479
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,641
Am I a dragon or a maid?

480
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,561
[RISTA]
I don't even know what to say

481
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,938
to them in this situation.

482
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,981
[ROSALIE]
Eliminating the stragglers?

483
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,065
[RISTA gasps]

484
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,484
Isn't that beneath you, hero?

485
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,194
I'm not the biggest
fan of your attitude,

486
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,821
so you can take it
with you when you leave.

487
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:39,989
Captain Rosalie,

488
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,533
we need to tell them about the
you‐know‐what before we go.

489
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,785
[ROSALIE] I was getting
to that, okay? Gah!

490
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,120
We may not see eye‐to‐eye,

491
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,289
but there's something
you should know.

492
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,290
Listen up.

493
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,668
In a shrine near the village of
Izale, there is a suit of armor.

494
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,421
This legendary armor will
help you defeat the Demon Lord.

495
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,381
I'm sorry, it's legendary?

496
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,341
Not just legendary. Ultimate.

497
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,926
It was crafted
by an ancient sage

498
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,928
who foresaw our current crisis.

499
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,639
Our plan was to inform the
hero as soon as he appeared,

500
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,266
but the flies sidetracked us.

501
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,643
The knights of Roseguard
have kept watch over the years,

502
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,729
justly protecting
the sacred treasure.

503
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,690
You all must be grateful,
and I really can't blame you.

504
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,067
[SEIYA]
Sounds sketchy. Real sketchy.

505
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,361
Are you positive
it's not cursed armor?

506
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,031
How could anyone curse it
if it was always being watched?

507
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,240
It wouldn't be sacred anymore!

508
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,159
Never know. The armor
could be cursed,

509
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,411
sacred, and legendary
at the same time.

510
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,746
[ROSALIE]
Yes, there is!

511
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,665
How can someone as irritating
as you be dubbed a hero?

512
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,043
That armor should be worn
by a gallant and noble man

513
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,545
who's proven himself,
like my father.

514
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,882
‐‐Yah!
‐‐[BHAT gasps]

515
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,801
[BHAT]
Please excuse us, Mr. Hero!

516
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:51,852
[RISTA]
Before anything else,

517
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,522
I say we go to that
village and snag this armor!

518
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,565
And maybe get some
rest while we're at it?

519
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,318
I could use a break from naked
goddesses and fly monsters.

520
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,862
Yeah. A nap sounds
pretty good to me.

521
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:05,199
Whatevs. I used some
MP for my magic bow.

522
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,827
I say we stop at the
inn so we can recharge.

523
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,246
[RISTA]
Oh, joy!

524
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,790
No. But we were just here.

525
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,005
Whoa. They leveled
an entire village.

526
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,675
Hey, look! Over there!

527
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,593
[MASH]
That's the item shop!

528
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,097
We have to help!

529
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,939
[KILKAPUL]
Well, well, we meet again, hero.

530
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,482
You can sheath your sword since

531
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,401
I'm the one who
summoned this creature.

532
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,777
[RISTA]
Huh?

533
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,821
[KILKAPUL]
It's an Adamantoise‐‐

534
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:48,450
a gargantuan demon I brought
forth from a whole other world.

535
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,161
Hey, pee pants.

536
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,830
[KILKAPUL] If you're
going to call me a name,

537
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,748
I prefer you use...

538
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,710
...Summoner Kilkapul,
one of the Four Heavenly Kings.

539
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,838
We bought supplies from one
of the Four Heavenly Kings?

540
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,298
[KILKAPUL]
Thanks to my crystal ball,

541
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,300
I've been observing you
and your motley crew,

542
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,719
bearing witness
to your adventures.

543
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,761
You've had your fun,

544
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,222
but I think you've meddled
in Gaeabrande long enough.

545
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,640
[RISTA]
That humungous turtle.

546
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,727
That's why you summoned it!
You're trying to take out Seiya!

547
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,438
You assume much, though
you were right in one regard.

548
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,274
Adamantoise is
here for a reason.

549
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,986
[RISTA]
And that's the reason?

550
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:24,820
[KILKAPUL]
Yes.

551
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:28,407
The sacred armor is now nothing
more than a pile of scraps.

552
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:32,703
It was made from adamantite‐‐the
strongest metal in Gaeabrande.

553
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,664
Ordinarily, no one
would be able to break it.

554
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,958
No! Come on!

555
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,251
[KILKAPUL]
I destroyed the armor

556
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,962
before you could get your
filthy human hands on it.

557
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,172
[RISTA]
Just our luck!

558
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,008
We're oh‐for‐two in the
legendary equipment department.

559
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,595
Hero, unlike most mortals,
you had a slim chance

560
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,640
of defeating the Demon Lord,
but I guess we'll never know

561
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,101
for certain since
your journey ends here.
