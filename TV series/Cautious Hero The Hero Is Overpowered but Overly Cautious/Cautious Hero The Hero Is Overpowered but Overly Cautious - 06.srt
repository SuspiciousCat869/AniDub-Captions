Yeah, mind running
that by me once more?

00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,645
Elulu will fulfill her
destiny of becoming Igzasion

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,772
by offering up her life.

4
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,690
Wait! Igzasion is
some kind of weapon.

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,234
What's that gotta do with her?

6
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,735
[LEVIAE]
Everything.

7
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,613
This weapon will
defeat the Demon Lord.

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:34,326
The blade shall only manifest
when a Dragonkin girl born human

9
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,496
sacrifices her life in exchange.

10
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,082
Screw the legend!
Elulu shouldn't have to die!

[LEVIAE] Seventy percent
of the world is already

while evil Demonkin
burn down entire towns.

16

Giants have been destroying
one castle after another.

Some small villages remain,

but almost every kingdom
has been overthrown.

The one surviving stronghold
is Roseguard Castle.

20

Any safe locations you've
seen recently will fall soon,

if they haven't already.

With all the back and
forth to the Divine Realm,

23
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,574
we haven't really had a chance

before the whole world
is under their control.

00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:25,335
If the Demon Lord is not slain,
Gaebrande will be doomed.

Elulu.

29
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,215
I must admit, I envy you.

30
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,343
You are the power that
will save us from this evil.

31
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,722
The sacred sword to
strike down the Demon Lord.

32
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,766
One of the highest honors
among the Dragonkin!

Thank you. It's my pleasure?

[LEVIAE]
The sacred sword ceremony

35
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,862
shall take place tonight.

36
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,156
Feel free to spend the
remaining time you have

37
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,824
among your friends.

38
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,702
Are you sure about all this?

39
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,246
All this? You mean...?

40
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,040
[MASH] It would be
awesome to save the world,

41
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,082
don't get me wrong.

42
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,377
But... do you have
to die for that to happen?

43
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,839
If that's my destiny,
then what choice do I have?

44
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,216
She said that it was
a pretty big honor, too.

45
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,093
[MASH]
Maybe so, but still.

46
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,055
[ELULU] All I've ever
wanted was to be helpful.

47
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,850
This may not be how I pictured
it, but my wish is coming true.

Elulu...

Hey, Rista!

50
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,981
The only reason you came here
is to save our world, right?

51
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,068
That means my sacrifice
will be for a goddess, too!

52
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,195
Kinda.

53
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,114
[RISTA] I didn't realize
how bad things were until now.

54
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,200
I know my mission is
to defeat the Demon Lord

55
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,578
and save this world,
but at what cost?

56
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,956
Hey, Seiya?

57
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,752
[ITEM VENDOR 06A] Yes, sir!
We call these speed seeds!

58
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,880
Won't find a product like
this in any human market.

59
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,048
For every seed you consume,

60
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,717
your speed increases
for a solid ten minutes.

61
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,804
[SEIYA] You better not be lying.
If so, you'll regret it.

62

I'll sue your scaly ass.

00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,515
[RISTA]
You're so selfish!

64
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,767
Maybe try considering
someone else for once?

65
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,561
You know,
take Elulu for example?

66
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,105
[SEIYA]
What's to consider?

67
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,648
She's gotta do

have to say anything about it?

00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,012
Of course!

161
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,557
I swear to you, we will still
find a way to rescue this world!

162
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,017
But we refuse to sacrifice

163
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,977
the life of our friend
in the process!

164
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,730
There's some way to defeat
the Demon Lord without Igzasion.

165
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,524
And if anyone can
do it, Seiya can!

166
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,026
Such a shame.

167
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,779
You are as daft as
the hero you champion.

168
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,907
You think nothing of our
plight and only of yourselves.

169
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,742
Our world may already be lost.

170
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,202
Screw you, you hag!

171
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,454
The real selfish
one here is you!

[MASH grunting]

Elulu, just hang
in there‐‐ [groans]

[RISTA]
No!

175
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,586
Mash, are you okay?

176
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,338
Huh? This is weird.

177
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,008
[LEVIAE chuckles] Thankfully,
I am rather cautious.

178
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,427
I had a hunch
this might transpire,

179
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,054
which is why the
food you ate earlier

180
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,015
was laced with a paralytic!

181
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,518
[DRAGONEWT BOY 06A laughs]
Those cookies we made you

182
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,853
had that paralysis
stuff baked into them, too!

183
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,648
No spell or antidote
can counter this.

184
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,650
Why, even the goddess
has been affected!

185

[RISTA gasps]

[RISTA]
None of us can move?

187
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,197
[LEVIAE] Now then, let us
proceed with the ceremony.

188
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,074
Will someone take the initiative

189
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,910
and cast Elulu into
the Abyss, please?

[DRAGONEWT GUARDS chuckling]

No! Stop! Get your

What? He can move?!

00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,713
Impossible!

197
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,965
How are you even
standing at all?

198
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,676
Your special ingredient
can't work if I never ate it.

[DRAGONEWT GIRL 06A]
Liar! I saw you eat a cookie!

200
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,848
Yeah, but did you see me hurl it
back up like five seconds later?

201
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,141
[BOTH gasp]

202
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,559
[SEIYA]
The thought of some slimy lizard

203
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,311
making my food was grody
enough to make me barf.

204
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,730
[DRAGONEWT BOY 06A]
Hey, that's rude!

205
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,441
[SEIYA] Says the twerp
who just tried to poison me.

206
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,068
I was onto you long
before now though.

207
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,737
Besides, as a rule,

208
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,365
I only eat food made by that
indecent immortal over there.

209
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,034
[RISTA]
I have so many feelings!

210
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,452
I mean, not actual feelings,

211
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,995
what with the
poison and everything,

212
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,205
but paralysis can't
freeze the heat between us!

00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,708
[RISTA cackling]

214
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,710
[RISTA] Seiya, I'll make
you a million snacks

215
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,253
if you keep lookin' like one!

216
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,088
[LEVIAE]
You leave me no other choice.

217
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,715
I have no wish to get violent

218
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,550
with he who shall
bear the sacred sword,

219
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,427
but I will do what I must.

220
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,805
Seems I must knock some
sense into your unoccupied head.

221
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,640
Fine. Come at me, bro.

222
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,184
So confident.

223
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,853
However, you should
not underestimate me!

224
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,690
Behold the magnificence
of the Chosen Dragonkin.

225

[RISTA] Bleh! That HP hurts!
She's too strong!

231

[laughs] The scales of a dragon

232
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,392
are tougher than any
metal known to man.

233
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,521
Ordinary swords don't "cut it"
in any sense of the phrase.

234
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,939
You may have fought monsters,

Inconceivable!

How does someone like you
have a Dragon Killer sword?

241
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,579
I would have to be
pretty freaking stupid

242
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,790
to willingly walk
into a dragon's den

243
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,501
without some sort of
dragon slaying weapon.

244
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,753
[RISTA laughs] I don't
think I've ever been so happy

to have such a paranoid hero!

[MASH]
That's awesome, Master,

247

but where'd you
even get that thing?

[SEIYA]
Synthesis, duh.

249
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,679
I used a platinum sword,

250
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,180
a strand of hair
from you and Elulu

251
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,807
since you're both Dragonkin,

252
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,643
and then I helped myself to
a hundred of Rista's hairs.

[RISTA shouts]
A hundred?

How did you get your hands on
that many of my precious hairs?

By plucking them from you while
you were sleeping, of course.

[RISTA gasps]
Run that by me again!

while I was sleeping?

[RISTA]
Oh, that jerk!

259
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,492
He's lucky he's hot
while he's ignoring me.

00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,910
Get it together, Rista.

261
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,247
He needs to concentrate
on fighting. Calm down.

262
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,457
Remember, after
all this is over,

you're gonna make
him spill his guts!

[LEVIAE groans]
I did not expect so much damage,

266
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,429
even from a Dragon
Killer! And yet!

267

[RISTA]
Hey, be careful!

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,812
You wouldn't wanna
crush the main ingredient

for your super sword!

274

Really? Nothing says
the girl must be alive

when she enters the Abyss.

276
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,613
All that is needed is her
flesh and blood, nothing more.

You suck!

278
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,907
Yes, I see.

279
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,367
You will protect the girl
no matter what the cost.

280
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,036
What a shame.

281

What's your scaly
butt up to now?!

285
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,923
[LEVIAE chuckles] I triggered
the Death Sentence Necklace.

286
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,842
The instant its black
light encircles her neck,

287
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,677
Elulu's life will
be snuffed out!

minutes amongst the living.

A cursed item?

00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,267
Curses aren't cautious at all!

Listen, Lamezilla.

You're not with the Demon Lord,

298
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,740
so I'm giving you
one fair warning.

299
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,700
Lift the curse you
put on her or else.

300
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,577
Oh, you fascinate me.

301
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,623
Issuing such threats even
though I hold all the power.

302
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,541
The sword ceremony is fate!

303
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,754
To lift the curse and defy fate,
you will have to kill me!

304
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,964
Sounds good.

305
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,341
Then I guess I can
stop holding back.

306
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,510

Snap dragon!

311
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,271
He's nearly got her
down to half her HP!

312
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,689
[LEVIAE laughs]

313
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,692
[LEVIAE] There is no denying
how strong you are, hero.

314
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,153
But it will take more than brute
strength to reverse a curse!

315
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,328
[LEVIAE] I have activated
my Ultimate Wall

316
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,414
and assumed this glorious form!

317
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,165
Your attacks will now
have the same effect

318
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,126
as a light, passing breeze.

319
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,087
[SEIYA] Then I'll just
have tear that wall down.

320
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,255
[gasps]

321
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,174
[LEVIAE]
Wh‐‐

322
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,224
Aw, he looks like
a lil' hamster, but sexy.

323
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,729
[SEIYA]
Speed seeds, baby.

324
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,357
[RISTA] A second Dragon
Killer? Seriously?

325
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,817
This is my spare one.

326
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,736
I like to have a
backup just in case,

327
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,654
but I can also use it for this.

328
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,407
Go! Double Eternal Sword mode!

329
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,493
[RISTA] He's combining
the Eternal Sword technique

330
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,706
with a bag full of speed seeds
and dual Dragon Killers?

331
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,500
[LEVIAE chuckles] If you
believe yourself ready, hero,

332
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,960
then come on!

333
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,712
[SEIYA]
Sure thing.

334
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,005
[LEVIAE gasps]

335
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,513
[RISTA]
Go, Seiya! You're doin' great!

336
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,057
[RISTA gasps]
I don't get it!

337
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,725
He's barely even fazing her!

338
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,726
[LEVIAE chuckles]

339
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,771
[LEVIAE] My Ultimate Wall is
the supreme hardening technique.

340
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,814
Take pride in the
insignificant damage

341
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,232
you have managed to cause.

342
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,610
Speaking of futile...

343
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,987
The child has nearly
succumbed to the curse.

344
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,530
There is no saving her.

345
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,366
Why not cease this
senseless struggle

346
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,493
and accept the inevitable?

347
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,330
Seiya. That's enough, okay?

348
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,373
[RISTA]
Elulu!

349
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,874
I appreciate it.

350
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,960
I can see how hard you're
fighting to save my life.

351
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,797
But you can stop
it now‐‐ [gasps]

352
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,092
[RISTA] Oh, no. Maybe she
is destined to be a sword.

353
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,218
It just doesn't make sense

354
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,929
that we'd have to go so
far to save this world.

355
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,181
[LEVIAE] It is time
you admit defeat, hero,

356
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,433
just as it is time Elulu dies!

357
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,310
Justice will prevail!

358
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,774
[SEIYA] You're right.
Justice will prevail.

359
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,693
[LEVIAE] And just what
do you mean by that, hero?

360
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,572
[LEVIAE gasps]

361
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,282
[SEIYA]
And you call yourself cautious.

362
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,867
Gimme a break.

363
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,411
[DRAGONEWTS gasping]

364
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,122
[LEVIAE] Stop this at once!
Cease your advance!

365
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,500
Lift the curse, and he'll stop!
It's not rocket science!

366
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,876
[LEVIAE]
How perplexing!

367
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,379
Why go so far to protect
such a useless whelp?

368
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,006
The only worthwhile contribution
she could ever hope to make

369
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,800
would be in the form
of the sacred sword!

370
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,969
Otherwise, she is
nothing but scum!

371
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,137
She's not scum.

372
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,680
[RISTA, MASH, ELULU gasp]

373
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,808
She hauls bags.
Scum can't do that.

374
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,644
It's true.

375
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,188
[RISTA] Well, that may not have
been sweet or even very nice,

376
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,441
but at least it was genuine.

377
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,319
I guess I'll
speak my piece, too.

378
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,279
Release her!

379
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,656
Or kiss your
dragon butt goodbye!

380
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,949
[LEVIAE groans]

381
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,254
[LEVIAE]
All right! I forfeit!

382
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,048
The curse has been lifted,
so halt your attack!

383
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,385
[ELULU groaning]

384
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,179
[LEVIAE]
Fool! The only thing I lifted

385
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,640
was my Ultimate Wall!
You shall die, too!

386
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,767
Dragon Breath!

387
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,020
Double Wind Blade!

388
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,522
[LEVIAE gasps, groans]

389
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,984
[LEVIAE] True, I may
have lost my footing,

390
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,195
but I still have my wings!

391
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:29,947
[LEVIAE gasps]

392
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,991
[LEVIAE]
No! My wings!

393
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,242
But‐‐ But how?

394
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,871
[yells]

395
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,919
[ELULU grunts, gasps]

396
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,842
Yeah, that went well!

397
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,846
That nosedive must've ended
both Leviae and her curse!

398
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,431
[MASH]
Elulu!

399
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,477
You're okay!

400
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,561
[MASH gasps]

401
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,773
‐‐Sorry!
‐‐No, don't worry about it.

402
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,024
[MASH]
I think I'm still paralyzed.

403
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,359
[ELULU]
It's fine.

404
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,443
[MASH] How long before
this stupid drug...

405
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,861
Just curious.

406
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,531
When exactly did you
damage Leviae's wings?

407
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,201
It was before she activated
her Ultimate Wall ability.

408
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,371
I had a feeling she'd switch
to defense pretty early on.

409
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,874
My normal strategy would've been
to take her out hard and fast.

410
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,543
But her HP was almost god tier,

411
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,920
so I had no choice
but to improvise.

412
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,797
I focused on backing
her into a corner

413
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,674
and cutting off
any means of escape.

414
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,175
This forced me
to deal with her wall,

415
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,135
but it also supplied
me with a distraction

416
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,179
she couldn't help but fall for.

417
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,974
And here I was thinking you
couldn't get any more cautious.

418
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,684
Well, I had a source monster.

419
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,560
Uh?

420
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,019
Helped shape my strategy.

421
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,064
That dragon lady sure
was a lot like a Nurikabe.

422
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:49,443
You're clueless about slimes,
but a bro‐it‐all about Nurikabe?

423
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,404
Yeah, that and Hyosube.

424
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,989
I can't believe
that crusty lizard lady

425
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,407
thought she was cautious.

426
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,158
If it were me, I would've
had my Ultimate Wall up

427
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,618
back during the feast.

428
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,452
[RISTA]
Right,

429
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,746
because that wouldn't have
been suspicious at all.

430
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,082
[DRAGONEWT 06A]
Leviae. How can this be?

431
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,750
What are we going to do?

432
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,918
[ALL gasp]

433
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,129
[LAGOS gasps]
What is that?

434
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,464
[RISTA]
Oh, look!

435
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,924
The magic circle in the Abyss

436
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,635
must've turned
Leviae into a sword!

437
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,222
[SEIYA] She did say that
Igzasion required the flesh,

438
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,809
blood, and life of a female who
bore the blood of the dragons.

439
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,021
As bogus as it sounds,
she's become a sword.

440
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,063
Which would mean...

441
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,607
[ELULU gasps]

442
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,483
[SEIYA]
Get Rista to heal you.

443
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,737
Elulu's flesh and blood
are part of the sword now.

444
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,156
[DRAGONEWTS gasp]

445
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,158
[DRAGONEWT 06A]
How positively divine!

446
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,160
[DRAGONEWT 06B]
No doubt about it! Just look!

447
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,538
That's it. Igzasion!

448
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,041
The blade that will
defeat the Demon Lord.

449
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,208
Pretty sweet accomplishment

450
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,753
you Dragonkin just
nabbed for yourselves.

451
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,546
There's nothin' like a win‐win.

452
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,841
But Leviae just tragically
met her demise. [gasps]

453
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,760
She would have wanted
to offer her life

454
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,762
if it meant saving the world.

455
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,514
She even said so herself
when she was alive.

456
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,642
Well, I suppose that's true.

457
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,186
So it's a win‐win.
No one is sad.

458
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,147
Really? Because I feel sad.

459
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,358
You guys got what
you wanted, right?

460
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,403
So if you have Igzasion and
you know it, clap your hands.

461
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,494
[RISTA sighs] And we're
right back where we started.

462
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,037
Thank you so much, Seiya!

463
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,289
I've never been that
scared in my whole life!

464
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,749
Knock it off, short stack.

465
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,792
[ELULU gasps]

466
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,251
You good?

467
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,380
You know something?

468
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,925
Please don't laugh, but when
they told me I was going to die,

469
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,844
I was most sad about not being
able to talk to you ever again.

470
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,222
Whoa. I felt the same!

471
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,890
[RISTA] Is it just me
or is there some serious

472
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,642
chemistry in the air?

473
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,104
Love and adventure do
tend to go hand‐in‐hand.

474
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,522
Hey, guys, I have an idea!

475
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,356
[ELULU, MASH]
Huh?

476
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,316
[RISTA] Why don't you
two go on ahead of us?

477
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,984
'Kay, but why would we do that?

478
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,445
You just said you like
talking to each other.

479
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,115
Besides, Seiya and I need
to have a little chat also.

480
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,658
[MASH]
Oh, okay.

481
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,035
Right. We'll wait
over by the entrance.

482
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,541
Aww! Isn't that the cutest?

483
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,750
Not my thing.

484
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,584
Whatever!

485
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,337
We really do need to have
a little chat though.

486
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,256
It's about your Dragon Killers.

487
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,717
So, uh, you plucked
out 100 of my hairs?

488
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,510
[SEIYA]
So? What if I did?

489
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,886
I swear, if you make me go bald

490
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,389
because of your stupid sticky
fingers, you will regret it!

491
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,100
You didn't do anything else
while I was asleep, right?

492
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,226
What do mean by that?

493
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,519
[RISTA gasps]

494
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,354
Well, you know, there
are all sorts of things

495
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,982
that can happen while a lady
is unconscious and vulnerable.

496
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,984
I'm not like that
and you're not a lady.

497
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,027
[RISTA grunts]
That doesn't make it okay!

498
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,321
You can't just steal
someone's hair, you freak!

499
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,948
You're lucky I'm
not pressing charges!

500
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,700
What do you think
would've happened to Elulu

501
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,368
without those two swords?

502
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,036
Quit being so dramatic.

503
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,913
Hold up! We are not done here!

504
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,373
I think we are.

505
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,541
That sword.

506
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,669
It's not really Igzasion, huh?

507
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,587
[SEIYA]
What?

508
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,464
Did you forget I'm a goddess?

509
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,673
I can sense that weapon

510
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,301
is severely lacking
in sacred power.

511
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,472
You just might be smarter
than you look, blondie.

512
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,806
Because you're right.

513
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,808
This thing isn't Igzasion.

514
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,436
It's a Platinum Sword
Plus I made myself.

515
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,189
You lied to an entire
village about that sword.

516
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,274
Wanted to put
their minds at ease?

517
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,110
You know this is gonna have to
stay our little secret, right?

518
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,155
[RISTA] I know. I'm just
wondering if Leviae was right.

519
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,865
What if Igzasion
is the only weapon

520
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,992
that can defeat the Demon Lord?

521
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,787
Then we'll just have to
kick his ass some other way.

522
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,997
I mean, you said so
yourself, didn't you?

523
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,541
I was kinda caught
up in the moment.

524
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,127
It's gonna be okay. Have faith.

525
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,504
[gasps]

526
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,379
[SEIYA]
Let's go.

527
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,799
The dragon brats are waiting.

528
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,342
[RISTA] All right,
that was definitely

529
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,969
the most un‐Seiya‐like
thing I've ever heard.

530
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,680
Maybe he's tired and
not thinking straight.

531
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,267
Once we get back to the village,
we'll catch up on some sleep.

532
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,602
Hey, we got company.

533
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,103
Like a lot!

534
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:09,119
[KAIZEL] All is in readiness,
precisely as you commanded.

535
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,039
The hero will be of no
significance to you now.

536
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,666
[XENOS LORD]
Good.

537
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:19,004
We will now have the ability to
destroy even the gods of heaven.
