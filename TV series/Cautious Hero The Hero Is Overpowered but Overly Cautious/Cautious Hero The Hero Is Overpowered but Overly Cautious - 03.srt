1
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,569
[ARIA] Hmm, sounds like
a bit of a predicament.

2
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,528
Yup.

3
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,904
He's got the strength and stats

4
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,449
to take out a Heavenly
King pretty quickly.

5
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,159
But all he does...

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,746
Blast the pecs, crunch the abs,
and wail on the glutes.

7
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,624
That sexy meathead probably
has muscles for brains, too.

8
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,125
I understand your frustration,

9
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,169
but he can't keep
that up forever.

10
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,504
So you mustn't worry yourself.

11
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,505
[gasps]

12
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,841
[RISTA]
Holy G cups, how is anybody

13
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,052
supposed to concentrate
around those things?

14
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,804
I mean, I know I'm not
sporting salad plates,

15
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,682
but she's got me beat
in looks and experience.

16
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:24,853
[RISTA sighs] Being a wannabe
big shot is getting old.

17
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,815
I just wanna take control of
Gaeabrande and be more like you.

18
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,485
I may have a high rank,
but you shouldn't want to be me.

19
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,570
[RISTA] Don't be so
modest, you're perfect!

20
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,529
You're Ariadoa,

21
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,531
the super‐veteran,
saver‐extraordinaire!

22
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,701
You've summoned heroes to, like,
300 worlds and saved them all!

23
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,788
Not quite. Unfortunately,
there was one I couldn't save.

24
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,374
Well, one out of 300
is still incredible.

25
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,417
I could totally
live with that ratio.

26
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,419
[ARIA]
But they can't, Rista.

27
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,632
The people who lived on that
world‐‐many lost their lives.

28
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,468
We can't afford
that kind of mistake.

29
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,262
Yeah. You're right about that,
but you know what I mean.

30
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,099
It was just a difficulty
level B world.

31
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,811
So the mission should've been
very easy for me to complete.

32
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,146
And yet, I still
made a crucial error.

33
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,648
You tried, and uh...

34
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,275
Oh, forgive me for
bringing the mood down.

35
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,820
I'm going to fetch us more tea.
Would you like some?

36
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,655
Yes, please. That sounds good.

‐‐[door opens]
‐‐[BOTH gasp]

38
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,616
So this is where
you've been hiding.

39
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,450
[RISTA]
Hey!

40
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,662
So I can't walk in on you
but, uh, you can do it to me?

41
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,330
[clattering]

42
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,958
Look! You see what you've
done by startling poor Aria!

43
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,126
He's fine.

44
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,377
I mean, I'm fine.

45
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,545
[RISTA gasps]

46
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,797
[RISTA] Is she a chump
for his looks, too?

47
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,842
Stupid womanizer‐‐
no worse, goddessizer!

48
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,554
Hello. You must be the hero
that Rista summoned here.

49
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,556
[SEIYA]
And you are?

50
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:47,060
My name is Aria. I'm the
Goddess of the Seal, Ariadoa.

51
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,937
You appear to be
in quite a hurry.

52
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,689
Is something the matter?

53
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,150
I've been exercising
to boost my level.

54
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,569
But as hard as I try,
I can't get it up.

55
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,570
Yes!

56
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,405
[RISTA] He's hit a
wall on working out.

57
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,656
You shouldn't worry.

58
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,784
That kind of thing actually
happens to a lot of guys, Seiya.

59
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,661
Its time you stopped
beating on yourself

60
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,246
and start beating the monsters.

61
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,248
Combat? I don't know.

62
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,292
It sounds awfully
risky if you ask me.

63
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,544
It's like a hero's entire
job description, so...

64
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,879
Ya know, instead of all that,

65
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,714
how about you make me
some dumbbells and stuff

66
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,631
to help me get swole?

67
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,134
You've gotta be kidding me,
Seiya! That is not the problem!

68
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,094
You need to go out
and get some experience

69
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,679
or you're gonna
hit the wall again.

70
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,723
Well, what do you suggest I do?

71
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,141
[RISTA]
First, clean out your ears

72
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,809
and then go fight
some creepy crawlies!

73
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,519
[ARIA]
Oh, I have an idea.

74
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,521
What do you think about
having one of the gods

75
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,773
in the Unified Divine Realm

76
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,691
help you out with some
training exercises?

77
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,778
No disrespect, Aria, but
that sounds like a crazy idea!

78
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,029
[ARIA]
If he's going up against gods,

79
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,697
there's no risk
of getting killed.

80
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:44,701
And he'll gain more XP than
from fighting small monsters.

81
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,995
It's my backdoor loophole.

82
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,706
I do like the aspect
of minimizing the risk.

83
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,416
[RISTA]
Aria, come here a sec!

84
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,043
Are you sure you
can promise him that?

85
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,586
I didn't know that
gods were even allowed

86
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,921
to take part in training.

87
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,130
[ARIA]
It doesn't bother me,

88
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,965
and I'll also double
check with Ishtar

89
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,217
to make sure there's no problem.

90
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,345
[RISTA] That's great, but who's
gonna do the actual work?

91
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,347
Neither of us knows
a thing about fighting.

92
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,432
I'm a healing goddess and
you're a goddess of the seal.

93
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,017
We're both clueless.

94
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,519
It just so happens
that I'm looking at

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,854
a god training his heart
out right over there.

96
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,105
[RISTA]
Huh?

97
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,530
[RISTA]
Him?

98
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,572
[CERCEUS grunting]

99
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,450
[RISTA] He kinda disrupts
the whole "serenity" vibe.

100
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,912
But he refuses to go and swing
that thing somewhere else.

101
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,080
[CERCEUS grunting]

102
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,874
[RISTA] He's stubborn
Divine Blade Cerceus.

103
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,753
Yes, but perhaps he'll
be persuaded to help us.

104
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:41,508
[RISTA sighs] This isn't
adventure or saving a world.

105
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,010
[ARIA] You're working
hard as ever, Cerceus.

106
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,762
Well, well, well,

107
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:50,392
if it isn't Ariadoa and
Ristarte, and good ol', uh...

108
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,561
I'm guessing that
you're a human?

109
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,980
You must be a hero
they've summoned.

110
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,231
Look here.

111
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,608
It's not a good idea for
a human to go walking around

112
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,528
the Unified Divine Realm,
even if you've been invited.

113
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,613
[ARIA]
Cerceus, we've come to ask you

114
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,699
if you would train
this hero for us.

115
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,576
Since you're such
a high‐ranking goddess,

116
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,371
I suppose I have no choice
but to honor your request.

117
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,831
But still...

118
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,124
Listen up, human.

119
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,751
I need to warn you that
my training is very intense.

120
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,503
I have serious doubts anyone

121
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,130
but a god would be
able to handle it.

122
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,131
Yeah?

123
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,676
We'll just see if you're still
this cocky after we spar, bro.

124
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,971
You'll be too busy crying like
a little girl to talk smack.

125
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,639
What? You're gonna
eat those words,

126
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,266
you emo‐looking
piece of diaper bait.

127
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,268
[SEIYA] Just shut up
so we can get going.

128
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,979
Huh? Uh... yeah, with pleasure.

129
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:36,813
What the realm's his problem?

130
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,774
[RISTA] Whoa, Seiya's already
got him on the defensive.

131
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,234
I just hope his mouth
hasn't written a check

132
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,737
his butt can't cash.

133
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,449
Cerceus the Divine Blade
isn't some low‐level nobody.

134
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,285
This training sesh may
be a lesson in humility.

135
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,121
Not necessarily
a bad thing for a hero.

136
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,917
First off, why don't you
show me what you can do?

137

[CERCEUS]
Ah.

141
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,347
So you can keep up with me
for a few seconds at least.

142
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:19,564
[CROWD chattering]

143
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,066
[RISTA]
I'm worried about Seiya,

144
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,776
but I if I go over
there and check on him,

145
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,195
I know that he's just
gonna moan about it.

146
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,696
[RISTA gasps]

147
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,448
[RISTA]
Oh, Cerceus!

148
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,908
So, uh... how's he doing?

149
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,244
[CERCEUS] Hmm. For someone
who gives so much lip,

150
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,497
he can actually back
it up for the most part.

151
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,665
It's impressive.

152
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,791
Ya don't say!

153
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,419
But he still can't hold
a candle to my skills!

154
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,091
[RISTA] Wow, some encouraging
news, for a change.

155
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,801

[ISHTAR chuckles]
Not too surprising.

Cerceus used to be quite
a fainthearted man.

[RISTA]
Huh? Hold on.

Are you telling me that
he's a reincarnated human?

280
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,714
I mean, I always just
kinda took it for granted

281
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,132
that he was born a god.

282
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,969
No, in fact, he was
once a human swordsman.

283
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,512
Of course, when he was reborn,

284
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,139
he lost all memories
of his former life.

285
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,226
But those feelings etched
deeply into the soul‐‐

286
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,853
they do have a habit
of being persistent.

287
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,606
After having such harsh
demands wear him down,

288
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,402
it seems that the weaker part of
his soul was exposed somewhat.

289
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,070
In that regard, one could argue

290
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,822
that the experience
has been good for him.

291
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,449
Things can have a strange
way of working out.

292
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,535
Seiya wasn't the one
being trained, after all.

293
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,954
[chuckles] Enough about them,

294
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,207
let's get to the real reason
I asked you to come here.

295
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,502
I need you to travel on to
the next town immediately.

296
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,755
The next town? Has something
else happened on Gaeabrande?

297
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,466
The village I chose for
you as a starting point

298
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,136
was a relatively
safe place at the time.

299
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,930
However, the Demon Lord
was aware of our plans

300
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,725
and sent a powerful
enemy to greet you.

301
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,227
And now I can sense
that the next village

302
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,980
is in imminent danger
of attack as well.

303
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,315

it's something bad?

305
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,986
There will be some
very important allies

306
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,323
anxiously waiting on your hero's
arrival in the town of Seimul.

307
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,908
Really? I wasn't expecting that.

308
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,203
It's true. So I ask that you
hurry to meet up with them.

do that for me, Rista?

Yes, of course!
I'll get right on it!

Okay, no matter what

You need to cut
that crap out right now!

I didn't ask for your
opinion on my technique.

It's part of the

This is what you guys do?

So, what are the undead?

347
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,175
Obviously, they're dead things
that can move and attack,

348
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,261
like zombies, for instance.

349
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,304
They're pretty hard
to beat with just swords.

Well, then how do
you kill them, Rista?

351
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,310
Fire spells and splashing them
with holy water is good, too.

Ah, holy water.

Holy water.

If you're dealing

yourself some of that.

Hey, buddy, I know you said
you don't wanna run out,

but this is overkill.

364

I mean, you just gotta splash
a little bit on each one of 'em.

carry that many on ya.

able to tell he was one?

to be so cunning.

Look at that. Even

you don't bleed. You just
sound constipated.

see you draw your sword!

[RISTA] I never saw him
use his sword, either.

438
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,897
Maybe whatever he was doing with
Cerceus was actually training.

439
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,232
But what I really don't get...

440
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,026
[RISTA]
Hey, how could you tell

441
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,736
he was one of those
undeads anyway?

442
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:14,820
[SEIYA]
I used my brain.

443
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,615
[RISTA] Duh. So, like,
how did you use it?

444
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,741
[SEIYA]
The priest was the oldest

445
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,368
and most feeble person here.

446
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,452
He'd be dead soonest,

447
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,829
which means he'd
also be undead soonest,

448
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,831
so I gave him a little shower.

449
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,418
You're saying you used logic
and reasoning to destroy him.

450
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,338
I don't get it!
That wasn't logical at all!

Oh, isn't our little hero
so damned clever?

army is gonna come put an end

462
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,072
I'm going to need
to clean this mess up.

463
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,949
Since cutting you up
didn't shut you up,

464
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,992
I'll have to be extra thorough.

465
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,619
[gasps] Everyone, run!

466
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,829
Huh, but why?

467
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,956
[SEIYA grunting]

468
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,790
[ELULU]
What's he doing?

469
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,709
[RISTA]
Just run! Trust me!

470
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,963
[SEIYA yelling]

471
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,091
[SEIYA]
Maximum Inferno!

472
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,804
[RISTA]
And there he goes!

473
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:22,972
[RISTA groans]

474
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,898
[RISTA] He always goes
overboard on the cleanup,

475
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,735
but the fight is like
an afterthought. [gasps]

476
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,195
Is "cleanup" even
the right word?

477
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,164
He just blew it up.

478
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,959
The historic church of Seimul
has been reduced to rubble.

479
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,129
You're welcome, Sister.

480
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,214
I single‐handedly saved
all of you for free.

481
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,341
[RISTA] Yeah, 'cause you
wiped out the whole church!

482
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,719
And the poor nun probably
just died from the shock!

483
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,556
That's one way to do it.
This guy's pretty weird, huh?

484
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,184
But lucky for us,
he's super strong.

485
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,227
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hero.

486
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:14,148
My name's Mash. I'm a warrior
with Dragonkin blood.

487
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,526
And I'm Elulu. I've known Mash
since we were both little kids.

488
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,821
I'm a mage, and I also
have Dragonkin blood in me.

489
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,865
How about we all
work together, okay?

490
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,159
What's your name, Mr. Hero?

491
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,827
Seiya. Seiya Ryuuguuin.

492
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,537
Uh?

493
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,371
[ELULU gasps]

494
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,165
[SEIYA]
Hmm, this one's human.

495
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,000
Uh...

496
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:34,835
What're you doing?!

497
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,086
Him, too.

498
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,631
[SEIYA]
Cool. Human.

499
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,342
Probably not a good idea
while she's unconscious.

500
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,635
Uh!

501
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,970
Hey! What did you
pour it on me for?

502
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,515
I had to be sure you hadn't
turned undead at some point.

503
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,725
‐‐[RISTA] Yeah? Like when?
‐‐This guy's got a trust issue.

504
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,644
Uh‐huh, more like a problem.

505
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,020
Huh?

506
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,064
Hey, wh‐why are you
staring like that?

507
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,440
[ELULU]
Yeah, what's the deal?

508
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,443
You're being super
creepy all of a sudden!

509
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,278
[RISTA] If these two are
supposed to be our allies

510
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,739
on this adventure,
we gotta see those stats.

511
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,033
This isn't what
goddesses and heroes do!

512
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,743
[ELULU]
You're really scaring me!

513
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,787
[RISTA] Not all that
impressive, to be honest.

514
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,081
They don't have a fraction
of what Seiya's packin',

515
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,916
but I guess they
have room to grow?

516
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,710
It'll be nice to have these guys
on the team, don't ya think?

517
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,753
Urgh.

518
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,171
No way.

519
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,133
But they have Dragonkin blood,
so once they go through all

520
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,302
the steps and learn Dragon
Metamorphosis, they'll be fine‐‐

521
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,846
No way.
