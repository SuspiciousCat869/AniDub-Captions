00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,704
‐‐[ELULU] Oh! Mash!
‐‐[MASH] Hello!

5
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,165
[ELULU] Thank goodness!
I was so worried about you!

6
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,083
[MASH]
Uh, where am I?

7
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,960
Safe and sound at Seimul's inn.

8
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,546
To recap, you went
unconscious on our way out.

9
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,506
That's really all
there is to the recap.

10
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,467
‐‐[door opens]
‐‐[ALL] Huh?

11
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,261
Well, look who
decided to wake up.

12
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,639
Thanks. You didn't
have to save me,

13
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,515
but I'm glad that you did.

14
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:24,353
Dry your tears, little diaper
baby. We're moving out now.

15
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,604
You get to carry my stuff.

16
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,480
[BOTH]
Huh?

17
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,065
[RISTA] They're supposed
to be his allies,

18
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,483
not his personal sherpas.

19
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,278
Yay! I love toting things!
This'll be fun, Mash, right?

20
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,447
You know, this whole
ordeal's taught me

21
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,823
a very valuable lesson.

22
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,700
Our levels are leagues apart.

23
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,869
Anyone with eyes could see that.

24
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,245
That's why...

25
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,207
[MASH] ...I want to be
your part‐time apprentice!

26
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,126
While remaining a full‐time
bag boy, of course. Please!

27
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,127
[SEIYA]
Just carry my things

28
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,505
and don't embarrass
me, or yourself.

29
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,549
[MASH] Your benevolence
knows no bounds!

30
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,301
[ELULU] Thank you for
all your help, Seiya.

31
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,262
[MASH] You idiot!
You refer to him as Master!

32
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,098
[RISTA]
Not my ideal kind of party,

33
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,934
but I guess things could've
turned out a lot worse.

34
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,310
This might seem
kinda out of the blue,

35
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,896
but there's a place I'd really
like to take you to, Master!

36
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,191
Oh! I bet you're talking about
Dragons' Den, aren't you?

37
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,818
Why would we go there?

38
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,530
According to Nakashi
Village lore, 16 years ago,

39
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,616
a dragon descended from the
heavens, carrying two babies:

40
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,827
Elulu and myself.

41
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,121
[ELULU] Legend says we're
to team up with a hero,

42
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,124
and defend Gaebrande
from a terrible evil.

43
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,085
It's said we need to break
the seal in the Dragons' Den.

44
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,753
Only then will we be granted

45
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,630
a mighty weapon
to aid in our quest!

46
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,756
[gasps]

47
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,883
Oh, Seiya loves a mighty weapon!

48
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,011
Yeah. But I'm already packin'
three enhanced platinum swords

49
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,139
thanks to your premature
balding issues.

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,433
We can discuss your
hair hoarding later.

51
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,476
Besides, just when you think
you have the very best,

52
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,228
something even
better comes along!

53
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,522
I think we should check
this thing out for ourselves.

54
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,107
‐‐Forget it.
‐‐[OTHERS] Uh!

55
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,861
We need to make a major pit
stop before we go anywhere.

56
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,989
You're kidding me. Seriously?

57
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,576
[ELULU] Wow! We're really
in the world where gods live?

58
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,537
Whoa! This is insane! [gasps]

59
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,664
They have rings
floating over their heads!

60
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,249
Are they angels?

61
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,209
Would it be okay
if we go exploring?

62
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,379
Don't be dumb.
We came here to train.

63
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,423
[RISTA]
I don't see him anywhere.

64
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,094
You'd think someone
so big and bulky

65
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,263
would be a lot easier to spot.

66
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,723
[CERCEUS gasps]

67
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,891
[yelps]

68
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,809
Whoa, what's with the apron?

69
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,145
[SEIYA] Care to tell us
what the hell you're doing?

70
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,938
Oh, hey there, Seiya!

71
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,815
Not sure what business
you could possibly have

72
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,193
with a retired swordsman
such as myself. Heh.

73
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,694
I mean, blades are dangerous.

74
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,863
There's a good chance
I'd bleed out if I got cut!

75
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,574
[RISTA] The Divine Blade
is afraid of swords now?

76
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,950
Great work, Seiya.

77
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,285
[CERCEUS]
But! Not to worry!

78
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,662
I've been keeping busy
by learning how to bake.

79
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,081
Here's a cake I just
finished! You want a bite?

80
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,042
Nah, bro. That's gross.

81
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,960
How can you know
without tasting?

82
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,379
I worked so hard on this.

83
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,839
I'll bet you'll have a bite!

84
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,341
Uh, hard pass.

85
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,134
It looks like it tastes
like sweat and sad.

86
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,219
[CERCEUS]
How would I even bake that?

87
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,179
I'm gonna need you to focus.

88
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,890
Look, I didn't come here to
dump on your lame hobbies.

89
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:07,724
Tell me.

90
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,518
You still have your
day job, don't you?

91
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,685
That should come first.

92
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,271
What's my day job?

93
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,023
[SEIYA]
This, obviously.

94
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,776
[CERCEUS] That's not my
day job‐‐it's a nightmare!

95
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,820
[MASH] This guy seems
a little unstable.

96
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,238
[SEIYA]
Relax, pee pants.

97
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,490
I won't be the one you
train this time around.

98
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,699
He will.

99
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,867
[RISTA]
Look at that.

100
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,745
Seiya's almost being what
some would call considerate.

101
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,248
[SEIYA] I can't entrust
my bags to a weakling.

102
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,999
My equipment would
be ganked for sure.

103
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,960
[CERCEUS] Got yourself
an apprentice, did ya?

104
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,420
Uh, mind if I see
your abilities?

105
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,381
Sure, knock yourself out.

106
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,885
You weren't using that
pesky Fake Out skill

107
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:44,928
just now, were you?

108
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,472
I'm afraid I wasn't. [gasps]

109
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,225
Kid! You're in for
some intense training!

110
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,811
I'll run you so hard your
muscles will have muscles,

111
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,937
little guy! [laughing]

112
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,021
What is your deal, man?

113
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,107
I think the chains on your
mood swing just snapped!

114
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,901
[RISTA] Back to normal after
he see's he outclasses Mash?

115
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,654
Man on the outside and
fragile flower on the inside.

116
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,990
Sweet if it wasn't so sad.

117
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,576
[HESTIACA] So. You're asking
me to teach this young one

118
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,452
in the art of
flame magic, correct?

119
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,746
I'd greatly appreciate it,
if you could.

120
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,915
[HESTIACA] It's our divine
duty to support humans

121
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,709
attempting to save their worlds.

122
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,544
I'd be delighted to help you.

123
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,087
Um, thank you.

124
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,672
My name is Elulu.

125
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,008
It's an honor to make
your acquaintance!

126
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,344
[HESTIACA] Such pretty
red hair. Much like mine.

127
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,262
[ELULU gasps]

128
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:31,349
Let's try and calm
those nerves down, yes?

129
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,894
[SEIYA] Okay. That takes
care of those two.

130
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,022
All that's left to do now is to
find someone who can train me.

131
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,857
[RISTA] I was wondering
how long it'd take

132
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,568
to bring it around back to him.

133
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,320
[RISTA gasps]
Oh, I'm so sorry‐‐

134
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,821
[VALKYRIE]
Hey, blondie!

135
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,489
Ya need to watch
where you're walkin'.

136
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,618
Even a scrub goddess like you
should be able to manage that.

137
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,411
Valkyrie! Please forgive me!

138
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,915
It won't ever happen
again, you have my word!

139
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,292
That reminds me.
You got stuck bailing out

140
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,502
a world with an S Class
rank, didn't you?

141
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,004
That's pretty
ambitious for someone

142
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,214
who can't even put one foot
in front of the other.

143
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,008
[RISTA]
Well, you might have a point.

144
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,176
I mean... [yelps]

145
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,886
Good thing your bouncy plumpers

146
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,554
more than makes up
for your faults.

147
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,556
And you've got some big faults!

148
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,641
[RISTA]
Please stop.

149
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,517
I'm not a piece
of fruit, you know.

150
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,352
‐‐All right.
‐‐[RISTA grunting]

151
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,103
I guess I'll let
you off the hook.

152
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,314
But be more careful from now on.

153
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,523
[VALKYRIE laughing]

154
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,151
I feel violated.

155
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,778
[SEIYA] You get picked
on in this world, huh?

156
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,779
I do not!

157
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,906
Valkyrie just treats
everyone like that!

158
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,407
[SEIYA]
I gotta say,

159
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,410
I sensed some serious power
coming from that exhibitionist.

160
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,870
[RISTA]
Please don't even think it.

161
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,998
That was Valkyrie,
the Goddess of Destruction.

162
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,251
She's the most fearsome goddess
in the Unified Divine Realm.

163
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,128
There's no way she'd train you.

164
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,797
For a human,
talking to her is enough

165
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,298
to risk instant annihilation!

166
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,676
[SEIYA]
Hey, chain‐kini. Train me.

167
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,094
[screams]

168
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,429
I know you're not talkin'
to me in that tone!

169
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,139
The fact that you're
a hero won't stop me

170
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,557
from tearing you apart!

171
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,101
Yeah? I wish you would.

172
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,352
[RISTA]
Please lock it up, Seiya!

173
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,980
How 'bout you apologize
and we can be on our way!

174
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,857
Apology? But what would
be the point of that?

175
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,860
Since I'm gonna scatter his
remains across the entire realm!

176
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,737
No! Have mercy!

177
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,613
[ARIA]
Oh, pardon me!

178
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,739
[gasps]

179
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,658
[RISTA]
Aria!

180
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,909
Valkyrie, please.

181
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,161
I bid you stand down
and refrain from fighting.

182
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,413
As if I would!

183
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,956
This level of insolence deserves

184
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,291
a punishment equal
to a thousand deaths!

185
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,377
The mortal you keep
threatening is a special hero

186
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,171
who was summoned to save an S
Class world in the utmost peril.

187
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,216
Please put your anger
aside and let this man be.

188
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,678
In deference to myself, the
high‐ranking goddess, Ariadoa,

189
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,722
please, unhand him.

190
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,184
[VALKYRIE] If you're gonna
make a big scene about it,

191
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,562
I'll let 'im go,
but in return...

192
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,147
...I get to give
those chest moo‐moos

193
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,274
a nice massage sometime.

194
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,401
Uh! Okay.

195
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,157
That was a whole new level
of senseless, even for you!

196
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,908
Seiya, you really
are something else.

197
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,368
Hey, I got a question.

198
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,121
Do you talk smack to
everyone or am I special?

199
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,665
[gasps] I meant no offense.

200
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,420
So, rumor has it, you're on the
hunt for a new divine trainer.

201
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,714
I may know of a candidate,
if you're interested.

202
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,762
Meet the Goddess
of War, Adenela.

203
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,929
In terms of combat,

204
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,682
she's a little more
advanced than Cerceus is.

205
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,810
[RISTA] Ah. It's nice
to meet you, Adenela.

206
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,770
[ARIA, RISTA]
Uhh...

207
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,645
Well, then...

208
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,441
If you're not too busy, would
you mind training up this hero?

209
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,401
[ADENELA]
T‐Train?

210
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,111
[laughing]

211
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,198
You want me to train a human?

212
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,325
You're kidding. [chuckles]

213
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,785
[RISTA] I'm gonna need
to see some goddess ID,

214
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,203
because this girl is...

215
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,621
Disgusting.

216
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,663
Disgusting as hell.

217
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,165
[RISTA] You're not
supposed to say it out loud

218
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,792
even if we're all thinking it!

219
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:48,004
Hey, you know, I find some
small joy in training.

220
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,090
Sure. I'll train the human.

221
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,091
[RISTA, ARIA gasp]

222
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,217
[ADENELA giggles]

223
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,053
I see you were able to
follow my movements just now.

224
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,556
I wonder if your mind
is as sharp as your sight.

225
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,767
Will you be able to learn
what I have to teach

226
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,354
and master the divine speed
skill, Eternal Sword?

227
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,855
Or will your body give out

228
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,358
and leave you sobbing
like a spanked baby?

229
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,609
[cackles]

230
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,694
[RISTA] I did not sign up
for this nightmare fuel!

231
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,779
Maybe we should look
at other options!

232
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:13,822
Let's give it a shot.

233
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,948
[RISTA]
Give it a what?

234
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,283
How is this the one thing
he's not cautious about?

235
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,161
You made this Internal Sword
move sound pretty legit.

236
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,123
[ADEMELA giggles]
It's Eternal Sword, actually.

237
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,375
[SEIYA]
Blah, blah, blah, let's do this.

238
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,502
[ADENELA]
I‐I like your style.

239
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,838
[ADENELA giggles]

240
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,923
[RISTA sighs]
Thanks, Aria.

241
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:32,882
I'm in your debt again!

242
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,927
It's fine. I'm happy
I could be of some help.

243
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,847
[CERCEUS]
That's it! Now one more time!

244
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,681
[MASH]
Okay!

245
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,808
[MASH grunting]

246
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,936
They're getting along
better than I expected.

247
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,021
[RISTA] And I know I don't
have to worry about Elulu

248
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,065
since she's with Hestiaca.

249
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,734
My only concern is
getting this food to Seiya!

250
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,735
Huh?

251
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,863
Shouldn't you be
somewhere training a hero?

252
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,448
[ADENELA]
I'm taking a break right now.

253
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,161
Seiya is still practicing
on his own though.

254
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,788
How's he handling all
that Eternal Sword stuff?

255
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,790
He's truly amazing.

256
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,877
Unlike any hero I've
ever encountered before.

257
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,587
And I think that...

258
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,546
You think what?

259
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,755
[giggling]

260
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,258
Yikes! Let's dial
back the freak face!

261
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,178
I just remembered something
that happened in training.

262
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,722
Seiya. He really amused me.

263
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,182
Hey, grunge bucket.

264
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,184
Break's over. Let's go.

265
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,519
Right. I'm on my way.

266
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,189
[ADENELA giggling]

267
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,523
[RISTA]
Uhh...

268
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,901
I forgot to give him his food!

269
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,487
[RISTA] I hope everyone's
staying productive!

270
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,864
[gasps]

271
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,992
It's rare to see the pair of you
share a meal in the cafeteria!

272
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,994
Shroomy here
wanted some bro time.

273
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,580
I thought the least we could
do was spend lunch together.

274
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,915
He's been teaching me all about

275
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,958
the kind of mindset he
has when he's in a fight.

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,377
Yeah? I'm kind
of curious myself.

277
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,420
[SEIYA]
Not now.

278
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,922
Dark‐and‐Dingy's waitin' on me.

279
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,174
Good talk! Thanks, Master!

280
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,217
[RISTA]
Don't forget we're heading back

281
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,636
to Gaeabrande tomorrow!

282
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,514
[RISTA]
So!

283
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,600
What were you going to say
about that fighting mindset

284
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,435
stuff or whatever it was?

285
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,104
Uh... It more or
less boiled down to

286
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,649
doubt everyone and
everything at all times.

287
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,525
Even your close friends
and family members

288
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,236
may be trying to kill you.

289
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,613
What a hysterical, paranoid,
and delusional thing

290
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,698
to fill an
impressionable mind with.

291
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,408
[MASH] Oh, there was
another thing he said!

292
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,660
"Remember, Mushroom.

293
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,913
I suspect you just as
much as everyone else."

294
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,498
Man, how cool is that?

295
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,752
Great, now the universe has
one more disciple of Cautionism.

296
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,340
[ADENELA giggling]

297
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,550
[RISTA]
Is that you, Adenela?

298
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,427
It is! I don't believe it!

299
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,638
Kudos to whoever
did your makeover.

300
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,931
Well, truth is,

301
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,475
I was embarrassed by
how I looked before.

302
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,686
I want to look nice for Seiya.

303
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,772
[RISTA groans] Another
enamored deity bites the dust!

304
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,316
If he'd slay demon lords like
he slays goddesses, we'd be set!

305
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,693
[ADENELA giggling]

306
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,111
[RISTA]
I hate to be a bother,

307
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,238
but we're kind of
on a time crunch.

308
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,699
Could my hero pick up your
special skill at a later date?

309
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,952
The Eternal Sword? He mastered
that technique already.

310
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,745
[RISTA gasps]
He what?

311
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,622
That human has a gift.

312
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,333
Yes. The size of which

00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,304
We'll need 500, minimum.

471
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,890
He meant to say five!

472
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,600
She doesn't have any
risk management skills.

473
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,352
[ELULU gasps]

474
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,896
[ELULU]
Hey! Reese.

475
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,606
Look! Look!

476
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,442
[MASH]
Mine, too! Must be close.

477
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,779
There!

478
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,249
[RISTA]
That's it?

479
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,044
Good thing we didn't
buy 499 more torches!

480
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,463
[SEIYA]
Forget that. Check this.

481
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,589
[BOTH gasp]

482
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,800
Okay, Elulu! Let's do this!

483
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,093
Yeah!

484
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,177
[BOTH]
Uh?

485
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,262
[SEIYA grunts]

486
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,639
Uh, you good?

487
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,975
[SEIYA yelling]

488
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,730
I'm lost. What the
crap are you doing?

489
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,066
By making my joints the
paragon of flexibility,

490
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,401
I'm able to repeat the actions

491
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,027
of slicing, thrusting,
and sweeping

492
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,487
at incredibly high speed.

493
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,741
This is the Eternal Sword!
The chained‐attack blade!

494
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,874
Whoa. That attack
demolished the seal.

495
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,293
I guess we really
are useless after all.

496
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,962
No! You shouldn't feel that way!

497
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:13,796
Without you two,

498
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,674
we would've never even
found a seal to decimate!

499
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,389
‐‐Huh?
‐‐[RISTA] Okay!

500
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,517
[RISTA] So where's this big,
bad ultimate weapon hiding?

501
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,351
[ELULU yelps]

502
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,895
[LAGOS] You've done
well to come this far.

503
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,439
Welcome fellow
descendants of the dragons.

504
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,857
[MASH]
Whoa. What the‐‐

505
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,277
[LAGOS] Brave heroes,
step into the magic circle.

506
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,654
It shall transport
you to Dragon Village,

507
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,865
where you will
be given Igzasion.

508
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,283
Igzasion?

509
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,076
Is that how we're saying it?

510
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,870
Time to hop a ride
on the glowy platform

511
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,496
and get this adventure going!

512
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,040
It's kind of like a
homecoming, isn't it, Elulu?

513
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,293
I might just die
from the excitement!

514
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,587
Let's not do that, okay?

515
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,385
Okay. We're in the circle now.

516
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,219
[RISTA grunts]

517
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,931
[LAGOS] Excellent!
Dragon Village awaits.

518
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,107
[ALL gasp]

519
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,402
[LAGOS] Uh, I think there were
some technical difficulties.

520
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,154
We received a lizard.

521
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,990
Cool. Nothing abnormal
to make note of.

522
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,534
I am confident
this is not a trap.

523
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,250
[LAGOS]
Welcome to Dragon Village.

524
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,126
Huh?!

525
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,504
[LAGOS] Your shocked
response is only natural.

526
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,088
My people's dragonewt appearance

527
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,925
is drastically different
from that of the human race.

528
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,968
I am referred to as Lagos.

529
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,054
If you would be so
kind as to follow me,

530
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,182
I shall take you to
our leader, Leviae.

531
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,227
The village you see before you

532
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,314
is a continent located
far across the western sea.

533
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:58,108
Magic circles are the only
means humans can travel here.

534
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,778
It seems young Mash
and Elulu have returned!

535
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,197
Mash looks so dashing
now that he's older.

536
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,825
[DRAGONEWT 05A] Yes!
And Elulu is simply adorable!

537
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,827
Say, if we're
originally from here,

538
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,037
why do we look so different
from everyone else?

539
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,081
We dragonewts
came into existence

540
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,375
as children of both
dragons and humans.

541
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,669
However the more
reptilian‐seeming among us

542
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,255
have more dragon
blood in their veins.

543
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,297
[SEIYA]
So these guys look human

544
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,258
'cause they got the weaker
end of the DNA strand?

545
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,092
[ELULU, MASH gasp]

546
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,637
[LAGOS] No. Mash and Elulu
are choice individuals.

547
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:31,350
They are Dragonkin who
shoulder a tremendous destiny.

548
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,726
[LEVIAE]
I'm pleased that both of you

549
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,895
have safely returned to us.

550
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,439
Your companions
are also welcome.

551
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,691
I am Leviae,

552
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,403
the reigning monarch and
mother of Dragon Village.

553
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,612
Listen well.

554
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:47,491
The Demon Lord's conquest
continues even as we speak.

555
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,035
Although the threat is
imminent, you needn't worry.

556
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,497
You Dragonkin have chosen
the correct place to prepare.

557
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,624
Please step forward, young Mash.

558
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,085
Huh? Me? For real?

559
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,549
I will show you how to
transform into a dragon.

560
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,051
[MASH gasps]

561
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:10,764
[MASH groaning]

562
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,682
[chuckles]

563
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,851
There, by becoming a dragonewt,

564
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,186
your abilities have
improved considerably.

565
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,229
Huh?

566
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,689
You look cool!

567
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:21,692
[RISTA]
That's amazing!

568
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,236
Your ability ratings
literally went up tenfold!

569
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,697
Yeah, but you better
keep your distance.

570
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,658
I can't promise I won't attack,
since you look like a monster.

571
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,868
[MASH]
That's so messed up!

572
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,579
On the plus side, now you can
carry more of my equipment.

573
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,122
[MASH]
Ugh...

574
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,124
With proper training,

575
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,794
you may one day transform from
a dragonewt to a Dragon God.

576
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,380
Then your skills will
reach unparalleled heights.

577
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,382
Yeah! That sounds good to me!

578
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,009
[ELULU]
Um, Your Majesty.

579
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,803
Could you maybe show me
how to transform, too?

580
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,014
But why? It serves
you no purpose.

581
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,140
[gasps]

582
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,808
Oh. If you say so.

583
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,185
[LEVIAE]
Worry not, child.

584
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,145
Your role in this
endeavor will prove

585
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,189
even greater than
that of young Mash.

586
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,149
Wow! Do you really mean it?

587
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,567
Yes, my dear.

588
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,694
You are fated to
become Igzasion,

589
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,571
the most powerful of weapons.

590
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,324
You will fulfill this destiny
by offering up your life.

591
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,533
Huh?

592
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,452
Like... a sacrifice?

593
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,371
That's not okay!
