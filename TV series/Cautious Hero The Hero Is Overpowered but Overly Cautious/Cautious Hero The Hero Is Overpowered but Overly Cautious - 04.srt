1
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,139
Hard pass.

2
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,683
[MASH]
Eh? Whaddaya mean, "hard pass"?

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,268
Your stats are way too low.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,979
I'm not interested in
babysitting a couple of noobs.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,814
Hey! What did you just call me?

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,900
We're both still
working hard to level up.

7
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,402
Once we get stronger,
we can help you out!

8
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,531
And yet you couldn't even tell
that Father Zombie was undead.

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,324
That's, like, basic awareness.

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,076
You guys are pretty useless.

11
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,410
‐‐[MASH growls]
‐‐[ELULU whimpers]

12
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,329
I don't need dead
weight tagging along.

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,998
[MASH groans] Then I'd better
show you what I'm made of!

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,710
They call me "Mash the Hero"
back in my hometown of Nakashi!

15
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,255
Whatevs. Sounds
like a crock o' shi.

16
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,090
[MASH]
That's Nakashi, jerk!

17
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:48,924
[gasps]

18
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,175
[ELULU]
Don't try to fight him, Mash!

19
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,010
[KNIGHT CAPTAIN 04A]
Hey! What's going on over here?

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,972
Who would dare to desecrate
this holy church into ruin?

21
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,515
[KNIGHT 04A]
No, Sister, are you hurt?

22
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,559
[KNIGHT CAPTAIN 04A]
You! Explain yourselves!

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,810
If I sense deception,
I'll haul you in...

24
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,562
This is a misunderstanding.

25
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,481
I can tell you how it all
broke down. Oh, wait, too soon?

26
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,858
[SISTER] The truth is,
there was a horrible creature

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,111
that disguised
itself as a priest.

28
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,613
Were they responsible
for this sinful misdeed?

29
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,948
[SISTER]
I'm still rather shaken,

30
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,576
so the exact details
are vague, but yes.

31
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,580
I'm positive it was that undead
brute who destroyed the chapel.

32
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,790
One thing I do
remember clearly‐‐

33
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,208
it said 10,000 more

34
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,711
of its ungodly ilk
would come to join it.

35
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,422
They've already overtaken
Krain Castle heading south.

36
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,048
Who could've
imagined such numbers?

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,967
[SISTER]
Hold fast to your faith, sir.

38
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,720
You see, God has
not forsaken us yet.

39
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,762
Don't you worry.

40
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:39,141
After all, the heavens have
sent us a divine goddess,

41
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,685
as well as a blessed
hero with great strength.

42
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,771
And two allies with
Dragonkin blood in their veins.

43
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,649
[gasps] Please,
forgive my rudeness!

44
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,734
Let's start over.

45
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,320
We're knights of the empire,
sent to defend Seimul,

46
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,488
sworn to defeat
the Undead Horde!

47
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,659
Sir Hero, we humbly request
that you fight alongside us!

48
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,077
[SEIYA]
How much you got?

49
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,579
How much? Of what?

50
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,205
Duh. How much money?

51
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,833
Hold on, Seiya! You think now
is the best time for this?

52
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,669
Pipe down. I learned
a new move recently.

53
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,464
It's one that requires a
fairly hefty amount of capital.

54
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,258
Capital? What kinda scammy
technique are we talkin' here?

55
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,553
Of course. You'll be compensated
with a handsome reward.

56
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,096
At least a thousand gold coins.

57
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,931
[SEIYA] Cool, bro.
I'll just need that in writing.

58
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,517
Uh, one moment!

59
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,645
There's 200 knights
on their way here.

60
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,396
Don't you want our help?
We're the imperial‐‐

61
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,230
[SEIYA]
Hard pass.

62
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,274
Wait, whaddaya
mean "hard pass"?

63
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,152
[SEIYA] I'll bet this town has
a few stragglers lurking around.

64
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,030
You guys should stay
here and protect 'em.

65
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,699
Yo. Are you paying
attention, Mashed Potato?

66
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,244
Hey, my name is Mash the Hero!
Stop mispronouncing everything!

67
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,871
[SEIYA] If you're not
going back to crock o' shi,

68
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,707
then help out the knights,
or whatever isn't around me.

69
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,167
Well, what do we do now?

70
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,379
Ha! Definitely not
whatever that jerk says!

71
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,922
Ahh!

72
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,217
[ELULU]
Where ya goin'? Slow down!

73
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,551
[RISTA]
Guys, don't go!

74
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,220
Mash! Elulu?

75
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,846
Hoo boy. I hope
they aren't planning

76
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,765
to bum‐rush a horde
of brain‐eaters.

77
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,517
[SEIYA]
I doubt they're that stupid,

78
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,895
but even so, I'll have wiped
out those dead gas‐bags first.

79
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,648
Okay, so you may be
ridiculously strong,

80
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,526
but seriously! Shouldn't we
all just work together?

81
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,319
[SEIYA]
No way. That's dumb.

82
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,363
Oh, excuse me for
thinking a little teamwork

83
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,948
might be a good idea.

84
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,449
[SEIYA]
There are 10,000 zombies.

85
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,076
Having another one
or two hundred people

86
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,703
with us is pointless.

87
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,663
No need for anyone else to die,

88
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,083
including those annoying
kids from Favabean.

89
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,584
[RISTA]
This is new.

90
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,504
Is he showing concern
for the children?

91
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,964
Seiya! Ah!

92
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,925
Wha‐‐! When'd you get up there?

93
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,136
I'm heading off.
Go wait at the inn.

94
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,887
Ahh? What did you say?

95
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,223
And in case you think
I need your help,

96
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,599
the answer's still hard pass.

97
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,726
[RISTA]
Whoa!

98
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,730
H‐Hold up. Did he reject me
when I'm a literal goddess?

99
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,065
Like, is this a dream?
"Hard pass"?

100
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,026
That lousy, ungrateful,
selfish, glory‐hogging meathead!

101
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,695
You're done‐zo!

102
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,656
Ooh! I'm gonna hard pass you!

103
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,491
[yells]

104
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,035
Order! Grant unto
the Goddess Ristarte

105
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,330
the gift of Flight
she should already have!

106
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,545
[RISTA] This is the privilege
to unlock sublime abilities

107
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,381
in desperate times when
heroes need our support.

108
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,382
An Order!

109
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,510
A Special Measure
of the Divine Realm!

110
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,309
[RISTA] Hmm. Lookin' good,
if I do say so myself.

111
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,311
I'll get you and
your little abs, too.

112
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,270
[chuckles]

113
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,564
Rista Wing!

114
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,609
Never underestimate a goddess!

115
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,403
[SEIYA] Hmm. This is
starting to get old.

116
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,071
Time to go full throttle.

117
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,949
Ugh! Hey, no fair!

118
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,868
[groans]

119
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,953
Bursting forth, Megamic Power!

120
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,207
I gotta direct all
my mojo into my wings!

121
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,835
Ow! Oh my goddess, the pain!

122
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,920
My poor flappers!

123
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,297
C'mon, Ristarte,
ya gotta dig deep!

124
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,383
You can do it!
Put your wings into it!

125
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,221
[RISTA sighs] Looks like Special
Measures of the Divine Realm

126
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,431
aren't so special, huh?

127
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,770
Such a princess. Honestly.

128
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,189
Come on. Let's go.

129
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,315
[RISTA gasps]

130
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,447
[RISTA]
Wow, he's such a gentleman.

131
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,367
He's even holding my hand!
It feels like we're on a date!

132
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,201
[SEIYA]
Hey, Rista.

133
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,036
Uh, yes, what is it?

134
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,748
[RISTA] My name? Not the
usual "hey" or "hey, you"?

135
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,124
Oh, you rascal.

136
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,918
Inter‐celestial
love is forbidden!

137
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,294
But I won't tell if you won't!

138
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,881
[RISTA gasps] Wait, we could
totally be making out right now.

139
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,967
What the crap,
I'm just gonna go for it.

140
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,510
I think we need
to speed it up.

141
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,553
[RISTA gasps]

142
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,513
[RISTA shrieks]

143
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,515
[RISTA]
Wh‐What the hell‐‐

144
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,892
My goddess globes are loose!

145
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,228
[RISTA yelling]

146
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,028
[RISTA panting]

147
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,655
I thought I was a goner!

148
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,740
You always forget
that you're immortal.

149
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,201
Funny though.
You sure look dead to me.

150
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,120
And whose fault do
you think that is?

151
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,163
I've got bald spots
on my beautiful wings!

152
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,415
I look like I've been molting!

153
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,543
Can't you fix them with your
fancy‐pants healing magic?

154
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,503
Anyway, shut your face‐hole.

155
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,422
We don't want any
unexpected company.

156
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,339
Ugh!

[UNDEAD groaning]

158
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:25,844
[RISTA gasps]

159
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,930
So they're marching as one
to show the Demon Lord's power.

160
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,015
It's kind of impressive.

161
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,266
So to be on the safe side,

162
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,685
I'll break them up
before they get too far.

163
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,729
They won't survive
my bombardment.

164
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,022
From what bombs though?

165
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,858
Rockets and missiles
don't exist in Gaeabrande.

166
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,027
Good thing I've learned
a skill to replace them.

167
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,446
Huh? With what exactly?

168
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,781
Hush and I'll show you.

169
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,453
What the‐‐ You're kidding me!

170
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,164
Who‐‐who hurt you?!

171
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,999
The Meteor Strike.

172
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,167
It's on the smaller side,

173
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,169
but if it falls at a
sufficiently high speed,

174
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,379
the collision will
be catastrophic.

175
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,298
Pure annihilation.

176
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,305
Oh, okay.

177
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,599
I kicked up the
energy towards the end.

178
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,059
The moment it made impact,

179
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,102
it became superheated
and vaporized,

180
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,854
resulting in an explosion.

181
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,105
Of course, yeah.

182
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,232
Oh. Although it's very powerful,

183
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,652
it's still a technique
with considerable limits.

184
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,321
I can only use it in the open
and it takes a while to cast.

185
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,825
So at what point did I miss
you learning to apocalypse?

186
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,577
[SEIYA]
When I was in the Divine Realm,

187
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,121
while making poop skirt cry.

188
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,831
Of course, how could I forget?

189
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,583
You were supposed to
be studying sword moves,

190
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,793
not torturing the guy.

191
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,836
[SEIYA] Well, I think
that took out most of them.

192
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,129
But I'm not done‐‐

193
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,423
not until I launch
another meteor first.

[RISTA]
Awesome. Talk about gains!

195
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,761
That's strong enough to
take out a Heavenly King

196
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,972
like Deathmagla for sure!

197
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,391
Nothing against Mash and Elulu,

198
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,060
but this boy can do
bad all by himself!

199
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,812
All he has to do is
make that happen

200
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,690
at the Demon Lord's castle
and then our job is done!

201
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,899
Piece of cake!

202
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,778
[RISTA chuckling]

‐‐[RISTA] Hmm?

Are you all right?

205
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,409
[SEIYA]
I may have gone too hardcore.

206
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,703
I need to recover for a while.

207
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,954
I gotcha, hero.

208
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,665
Let's head back to town and
get you to the inn right away.

209
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,419
[RISTA] He fired off two
of those spells in a row.

210
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,255
That must've eaten
up most of his MP.

211
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:29,175
[groans] I started
out with 15,000 MP.

212
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,094
There's just 13,000 left!

used any of it, you hoarder!

00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,741
Mash disappeared on you?

216
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,575
Yes.

217
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,578
He went missing two days ago and
I still can't find him anywhere.

218
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,580
Maybe he went back
home to your village.

219
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,832
That's what worries me.
He would've told me first.

220
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,375
I'm sure he's doing fine.

221
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,626
The chances are slim to none

222
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,336
that he'll run into
any real trouble.

223
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,089
Especially now that the
undead baddies are gone.

224
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,759
It's because of that
hero! Isn't he cool?

225
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,385
I wouldn't go that far.

226

He won't stop nerding out
over this new Synthesis skill.

227
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,141
He spent his reward on
new weapons and armor,

228
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,267
and now he's a shut‐in.

away in his quarters.

Huh. That's amazing!

What'd you do to
make this thing?

239
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,873
[SEIYA]
Combining swords on their own

240
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,792
didn't improve their
strength by much.

241
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,878
To forge a mighty weapon,
I needed something unique.

242
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,590
And then, I found
a special catalyst.

243
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,258
So what did you use?

244

'cause you shed like
an old dying dog.

a little synthesizing it

But I'm glad you found
some part of me so useful.

253
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,112
[SEIYA]
Hold onto that for me.

254
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,364
Also, I need more
hair. Like a lot.

255
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,698
You can borrow my razor.

256
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,950
Do not use the sword.

[SEIYA]
What is that? Who sent it here?

261
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,835
A strange man wearing
a hood brought it over.

262
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,670
He said something about
wanting to give that

263

"meathead hero" a gift?

264
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,467
That sounds fishy.
Could be an explosive.

You open it.

Just because I can't die,

267

Well, I can see you all
perfectly from here.

[DEATHMAGLA]
A peculiar mirror, is it not?

It can reveal
images from far away

Oops, I've yet to
introduce myself!

My name is Deathmagla. I'm one

is necromancy, of course.

Whoa. That's the undead general?

[DEATHMAGLA]
I must admit,

290
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,288
I didn't expect you to
dispatch my minions so easily.

291
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,666
Luckily, I was able to
command them remotely.

292
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,794
Speaking of that, do you
know how long it takes

293
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,297
to build a legion
of undead soldiers?

294
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,842
Obviously, I thought I'd
offset my losses with revenge

No. Stop it! Leave him alone!

297
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,767
[DEATHMAGLA]
Working with corpses is tedious,

298
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,269
but playing with
a life is so much fun.

299
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,314

there's always murder.

314
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,516
Fortunately, we won't
have to endure any

315
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,018
of your baby blabbering
for much longer.

316
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,436
Somebody do something!

317
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,231
I'm begging you
to save him! Please!

318
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,025
[cackles] Beg all you want!

319
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,027
Your hero can't save him!

320
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,948
All you can do is watch as
I slice through his neck!

321
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,076
Rista, open a portal
to the Divine Realm.

322
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,496
But even if time is faster
there compared to Gaeabrande,

323
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,372
what could we possibly do‐‐

324
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,873
Just open it, now.

325
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,209
If you say so.

326
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,920
I have to say, Mash.
You don't totally suck.

327
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,588
Once we get you out of there,

328
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,716
I'm gonna let you
carry my gear for me.

329
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,009
[DEATHMAGLA]
Huh?

330
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,845
[SEIYA] Ya see, I've
already been here before.

331
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,098
[SEIYA] Since then,
I've been running simulations

332
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,349
again and again.

333
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,561
What if I had less time?
What would I do then?

334
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:35,356
Ha! Do you not understand
we aren't even in the same room?

335
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,443
You stupid meathead!
You can't touch me!

336
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,945
Stop it!

337
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,075
[yells]

338
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,911
[DEATHMAGLA]
No! B‐B‐But how?

339
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,748
Photon swords can cut
the fabric of space, bro.

340
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,207
Meet my dimension blade.

341
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,377
Wh‐‐ According to what laws?
That thing is excessive‐‐

342
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,050
Hurry up. The real
battle's just begun.

343
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,801
[RISTA]
Huh? Care to explain?

344
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,887
We managed to confuse
him momentarily.

345
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,848
But once he loses it,
he's gonna kill Mash.

346
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,350
Right! So what's the plan?

347
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,019
As you know, time flows much
faster in the Divine Realm

348
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,520
than it does back there.

349
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,606
It won't take tri‐clops
more than ten seconds

350
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,609
to find a weapon and
shank dragonboy with it.

351
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,362
Therefore, we have
less than 15 minutes

352
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,199
to figure out how to get to
them first and rescue our guy.

353
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,451
'Kay, I think I got it.

354
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,828
I might know someone
who can help, but...

355
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,123
...let me lead.
You just need to stay quiet!

356
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,292
[SEIYA] Granny, are you
the head goddess around here?

357
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,503
Hey! Didn't I tell
you to shut your mouth?

358
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,922
Sorry! Ishtar! So sorry!
I really mean it...

359
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,549
I'm looking for Shrooms on
Gaeabrande and it's urgent.

360
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,509
Bust out a portal.

361
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,303
[RISTA] That is not how you
speak to a Great Goddess!

362
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,597
And no more fungus puns!
His name is Mash!

363
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,849
[chuckles] So in other words,

364
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,936
you're saying you'd like me to
help you find your companion.

365
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,105
But divine law forbids goddesses

366
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,941
from granting any excessive
support to humankind.

367
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,901
All you'd be doing
is making a hole‐‐

368
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,071
a door in a specific spot, like
this chick does all the time.

369
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,073
Totes no big.

370
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,449
True, true.

371
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,327
I do believe you might
just have a point there.

372
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,870
Very well, then.

373
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,458
Ah. There it is.

374
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,544
They're in the forest
near Krain Castle.

375
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,338
Your friend is being held
captive in a vast dungeon.

376
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,757
Thanks. You're always
incredible, Ishtar!

377
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,634
[SEIYA]
Good. Now, drop us in.

378
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,219
Right in front of
the Mashed Potato.

379
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,178
Okay.

380
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,889
Great, now we're doing potatoes.

381
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,893
Thank you for helping us.
We'd be lost without your aid!

382
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,145
C'mon, say something!

383
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,021
Hey, good job. Thanks, mee‐maw.

384
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,274
Can you not be smug
for five seconds?! Ugh!

385
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,234
Do you even know what
you're walking us into?

386
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,361
Duh, what do you take me for?

387
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,238
As soon as we exit the portal,

388
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,282
I'm hitting him
with Hell's Fire.

389
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,702
While he's distracted, you can
use the moment to scoop up Mash.

390
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,538
‐‐[SEIYA] Let's go.
‐‐Uh, roger that.

391
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,878
It's impressive how much you've
grown, Mister Seiya Ryuuguuin.

392
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,504
I bid you good hunting.

393
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,633
[DEATHMAGLA]
Ah! It hurts!

394
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,137
My hand! But how?!

395
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:15,766
[DEATHMAGLA groaning]

396
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,893
Huh?

397
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,270
Miss me? Hell's Fire!

398
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,065
[DEATHMAGLA yelps]

399
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,901
Hey, it's Rista! You okay?

400
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,612
I... think so.

401
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,989
[RISTA gasps]
Oh, how heartless!

402
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,240
Let's get you patched up!

403
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,117
[MASH groans]

404
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,787
[RISTA]
How's he doing?

405
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,997
[gasps]

406
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,294
[RISTA]
Black flames?

407
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,796
It looks like the fire
is protecting him!

408
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,347
Whoa. What kind of
monster is that?

409
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,224
[MASH gasps]
It's...

410
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,475
It's a‐‐

411
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,521
Was that all it took to
take down Chaos Machina?

412
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,606
Because it won't work
on this Heavenly King.

413
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,149
Your weakness is insulting!

414
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,317
[SEIYA grunts]

415
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,615
Is that a ghost monster?
Seiya, holy water!

416
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,992
I already tried that
stuff. It didn't work.

417
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,161
Oh, right. I bet that
was your first move.

418
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,080
Hold up. So it's not a ghost?

419
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,582
[DEATHMAGLA]
This one's name is Dark Firus‐‐

420
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,167
the mightiest, fieriest creature

421
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,212
I've ever created out of
my hundreds of experiments.

422
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,674
A fire‐type? I thought
you only created the undead!

423
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,759
Modifying all manner of monsters

424
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,680
just so happens to be my special
skill, you basic simpleton!

425
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,181
Who ya callin' basic?!

426
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,892
We need to exploit
his weaknesses!

427
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,436
D‐Defense is over
a hundred thousand?

428
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,689
He's immune to
all weapon attacks?

429
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,399
Only weak against ice magic?

430
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,651
Yes, you blonde idiot!

431
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,821
You fight it by disrupting
its molecular structure

432
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,074
with the Oscillatory Wave skill.

433
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,703
Cold attacks will convert its
affiliation from fire to ice,

434
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,622
making its ghostly
body materialize.

435
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,500
If you can hit Dark Firus with
a power that's greater than

436
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,045
its defense, only then
can you defeat it!

437
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,549
[SEIYA] Huh. Thanks for
the boss walkthrough, pops.

438
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,883
[RISTA]
Hold on.

439
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,886
Oscillatory Wave is
a melee‐only technique.

440
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,390
And ice spells are the complete
opposite of Seiya's fire magic!

441
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,891
There's no way to beat him!

442
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,268
[DEATHMAGLA]
I fed you bits of hope

443
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,354
so I could savor every
moment of your despair!

444
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:28,107
I have hypothesized
every contingency

445
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,233
and planned accordingly,

446
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,820
for that's the genius
of a true tactician!

447
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,573
[SEIYA]
Is this really happening?

448
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,074
[RISTA]
Pretty much.

449
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,492
How surprising.

450
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,286
I'm kinda shocked, honestly.

451
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,912
[RISTA gasps]

452
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,040
[SEIYA] You say you've done
a lot of hypothesizing

453
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,750
and planning? Nah.

454
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,003
You act so pretentious, but I
can read you like an open book.

455
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,339
Are you implying you've
somehow anticipated

456
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,341
this exact situation?

457
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,301
[SEIYA]
I'm implying you're a huge tool

458
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,637
and you've already
lost and don't know it.

459
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,806
Nice talk, sugar lips,
but you won't defeat him!

460
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:05,061
He's invincible and you're a sad
excuse for an unprepared hero!

461
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,438
[cackles]

462
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,397
[SEIYA]
That's not my style.

463
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,523
Huh?

464
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,611
I am perfectly prepared.

465
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,364
I'm 100 percent
ready for this fight!

466
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:21,202
Ha! I'm ready to wipe that smug
look off your dumb emo face!

467
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,245
[DARK FIRUS growls]

468
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,288
[DARK FIRUS yells]

469
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,749
[RISTA gasps]
Wait, what?

470
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,625
[DEATHMAGLA]
Behold!

471
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,628
A fire that won't burn
out till it consumes you!

472
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,964
Dodge if you wish, but everyone
behind you will perish instead!

473
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,175
Ahh, that means us...

474
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:40,221
Don't need to dodge you.
Go ahead and do your worst.

475
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,390
You still dare to attack me?

476
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,432
Dark‐‐

477
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,852
[DARK FIRUS groans]

478
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,270
[RISTA]
The Oscillatory Wave!

479
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,690
[DEATHMAGLA] That's impossible!
You're a swordsman.

480
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,150
How do you have a melee skill?

481
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,319
[SEIYA] I don't believe
in limiting myself.

482
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,862
If I couldn't use my blade,

483
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,657
then I'd have to use my fists.

484
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,159
Some enemies are
resistant to sword attacks.

485
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,121
And there's no telling when
it might break during combat.

486
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,206
What if it got
stolen by my opponents?

487
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,499
Or what if it got rusted?

488
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,001
Or dissolved?
Or got eaten by moths?

489
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,170
It's a good thing I learned
hand‐to‐hand combat.

490
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,340
Okay, that is
unbelievably cautious.

491
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,885
Doesn't matter, because you're
still no match for Dark Firus

492
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,388
and his burning fists
of fiery death!

493
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,014
[DARK FIRUS yelling]

494
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,307
[DEATHMAGLA]
You think you can counter

495
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,268
with your puny human hands?

496
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,854
Your whole arm will explode!

497
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,607
Wait! What is happening?

498
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,068
Fire and ice magic
are incompatible!

499
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,989
There's no way you should
be able to use both!

500
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,323
[gasps] That amulet!

501
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,785
An item that grants
the properties of ice?

502
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:45,953
[RISTA]
That's it!

503
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,580
Even if he can't
produce it on his own,

504
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,373
he can achieve the same effect!

505
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,876
Wait, where'd he find something
like that to begin with?

506
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,668
[RISTA gasps]

507
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,588
Synthesis! You made
that bracelet yourself!

508
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,797
Yeah.

509
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,342
Nice! But what did you
synthesize to make that?

510
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:04,096
I just used an ordinary bangle,
a few ice cubes, and your hair.

511
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,599
‐‐[RISTA] Uh... Huh?
‐‐Yeah, your hair made it work.

512
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,851
Oh. There's more
where that came from.

513
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,685
[RISTA]
Huh?

514
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,104
Some for lightning,
some for light, some for dark,

515
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,774
and of course the list
goes on. I made spares, too.

516
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,817
And yes all of them
synthesized from hairs

517
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,319
that were scattered
around your bedroom.

518
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,737
[RISTA]
That's a lot of hair.

519
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,864
Oh my gosh, I'm not
going bald, am I?

520
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,824
Only his body materialized.

521
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,701
You and your stupid hairs

522
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,162
still can't overcome
Dark Firus's defenses!

523
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,164
You're right.
Unfortunately, I don't.

524
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,874
But it's no problem.

525
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,958
You know what's
effective against

526
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,920
a vulnerable,
glistening body of ice?

527
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,129
A flame attack.

528
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,923
Whoopsie! Didn't think of that!

529
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,467
Dark Firus, close in
and stop his attack!

530
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,177
It's too late.

531
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,308
[SEIYA]
A white‐hot, fixed‐point strike!

532
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,185
Phoenix Thrust!

533
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,070
[RISTA]
Thrusted it!

534
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,363
Is he for real?

535
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,824
He just demolished that
behemoth like it was nothing!

536
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,075
Eat it, sucker!

537
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,661
That's a one in a hundred
million phenomenon over there!

538
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,996
No, no, no! There's no way!

539
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,375
[RISTA] That's what you get for
monologuing yourself, you loser!

540
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,585
Well, if he hadn't
told us how to win,

541
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,712
I'm sure I would've
found out soon enough.

542
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,256
Yeah! I believe you!

543
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,967
Because you're the smartest
and strongest hero ever!

544
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,884
Now then.

545
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,303
It's time for me to finish
taking out the trash.

546
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,888
[DEATHMAGLA gasps]

547
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,395
[SEIYA] After that,
this room needs a deep clean.

548
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,773
[whimpering]

549
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,191
You go right ahead.

550
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,944
Take all the time
you need, okay?

551
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,657
