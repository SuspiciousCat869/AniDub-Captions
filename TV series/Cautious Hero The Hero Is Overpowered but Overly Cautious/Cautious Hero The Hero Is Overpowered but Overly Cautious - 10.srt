1
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,947
[WARMASTER] Ahh...
I made boom‐boom in my diapey.

2
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,616
[FLASHIKA]
And some wee‐wee.

3
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,910
Aww... Thank you.
Are you going to change me, too?

4
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,079
Not now. We'll have to wait.

5
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,165
Take another look
at his special skills.

6
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,126
Okay.

7
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:09,254
Those aren't special.
They're ridiculous!

8
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,506
[SEIYA] This explains why
he couldn't leave the capital.

9
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,341
[RISTA]
Uh?

10
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,677
Father! Father, I'm here!

11
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,511
Father!

12
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,348
[WARMASTER]
Rosalie! I missed you so much!

13
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,476
Can you change me? [cries]

14
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,061
Stop staring, you fools!

15
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,481
Kill any remaining enemies!
Or tend to our wounded!

16
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,900
[SOLDIERS]
Ma'am! Yes, ma'am!

17
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,152
[WARMASTER] I beat 'em,
but now I'm itty‐bitty!

18
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,987
Please try to calm down, Father.

19
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,366
If you're a naughty boy,
the monsters will come back.

20
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,368
[WARMASTER]
Monsters are scary.

21
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,202
[RISTA]
Uhh...

22
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,620
[ROSALIE]
What are you gawking at?!

23
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,081
Your dad is just the
cutest little baby is all.

24
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,999
This is a curse
from the Demon Lord!

25
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,376
It's in no way cute!

26
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,086
‐‐[RISTA] A curse?
‐‐[WARMASTER] I'm scared!

27
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,379
[WARMASTER]
Pick me up!

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,005
[RISTA] What else can
you tell me about the curse?

29
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,633
[ROSALIE sighs] Listen.
I've got my hands full now,

30
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,510
but meet me at the
castle in two hours!

31
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,804
Sure, guess we'll see ya then.

32
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,348
Let's investigate
the town in the meantime.

33
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,433
I'm sure someone else would
know more than this idiot.

34
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,352
[ROSALIE]
Ugh! What'd you say?

35
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,229
Yeah, I think
we'd better go, Seiya.

36
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,065
[ROSALIE growls]

37
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,858
[SHOPKEEPER 10A]
Landlocked fish, right here!

38
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,235
[SHOPKEEPER 10D]
We got deals, deep and cheap!

39
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,820
[SHOPKEEPER 10B] Warmaster's
special! Five percent off!

40
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,904
Here's to our man,
the Warmaster!

41
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,155
[RISTA]
I'm guessing they don't know

42
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,825
about the whole babyfication
thing goin' on.

43
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,076
I wouldn't think so.

44
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,869
He's a lot cuter this way.

45
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,414
All they know is he took
out that last Heavenly King,

46
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,500
which just leaves the
Demon Lord to contend with.

47
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,752
It just doesn't seem
real to me, though.

48
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,754
[gasps] Look, a bar!

49
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,798
Seiya, why don't
we pop in for a bit?

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,299
You think we should
dull our senses

51
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,719
right before the
biggest fight of our lives?

52
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,929
I just thought we could
take in the festive ambiance.

53
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,806
Like hearing and
smelling drunks?

54
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,182
Besides, there could be a brawl

55
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,435
where someone gets stabbed
to death with a broken bottle.

56
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,978
So... hard pass.

57
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,064
I've never met such a
pathological worrywart.

58
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,859
[BUNNY GIRL] Come up
and see me, why don'tcha?

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,776
[MASH]
A bunny girl!

60
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,737
[ELULU]
Is her mom or dad a bunny?

61
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,196
[RISTA]
What about going in there?

62
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,657
Casinos are always fun,
so whaddaya say?

63
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,950
I don't gamble.

64
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,536
And frankly, I'm surprised
you'd assume any differently.

65
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,204
[RISTA grunts]
It could be worth it!

66
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,748
There's actually a
pretty good chance of getting

67
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,500
some kind of awesome weapon
or piece of gear if we win!

68
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,626
[SEIYA]
Rista.

69
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,171
If you truly think we can get a
weapon that'll be effective

70
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,798
against the Demon Lord
as a prize in a casino,

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,175
then your brain
must be the size of

72
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,343
the little ball
in a roulette wheel.

73
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,137
You're one to talk about balls!

74
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,889
[ELULU] The casino
sounds pretty cool to me!

75
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,848
Come on, Seiya,

76
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,350
having a tiny bit of fun
isn't gonna hurt, ya know.

77
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,228
Plus, I think it would make
Mash and Elulu really happy.

78
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,815
[SEIYA] Our time would be
better spent at a weapon shop.

79
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,358
You're supposed to be a goddess,

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,527
so why don't you think
about the world a little more?

81
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,529
[RISTA] Ugh! I'm always
thinking about it!

82
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,656
Which is exactly why we
need to take a breather!

83
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,701
Oh, please. It's really
no wonder why Valkyrie told me

84
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,328
that you were
a third‐rate goddess.

85
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,080
Why are you bringing
Valkyrie into this right now?

86
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,541
It's not like I don't already
know that she's better than me‐‐

87
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,002
she's stronger, higher ranked,
and even sexier!

88
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,045
Let's calm down, Rista.

89
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,464
I am extremely calm!
And I'm cool!

90
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,759
Hello, sir. Are you interested
in some Greater Medicinal Herbs?

91
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,719
They have triple the
effect and healing power

92
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,845
of the regular kind.

93
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,055
[SEIYA]
If you're lying about that,

94
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,473
I'll burn your shop down, okay?

95
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,226
It's the truth! But I don't
appreciate the threat,

96
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,936
so do you wanna
buy some or not?

97
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,813
[SEIYA]
Hm... I'll take a thousand.

98
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,064
[RISTA]
You don't need those!

99
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,274
I mean, I am a goddess
with healing magic, Seiya!

100
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,318
[ITEM SHOP OWNER 10A] Hey!
My greater medicinal herbs

101
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,278
are way better than any
ol' restoration magic!

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,112
No way!

103
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,573
My magic's a billion times
stronger than your dumb herbs!

104
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,991
We'll see about that!

105
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,452
Hey, come here, man!
You look pretty beat up.

106
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,829
I am‐‐had a run in with

107
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,747
the Demon Lord's
monsters earlier today.

108
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,999
Scrapes on his arms
look about the same.

109
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,501
So why don't you
and I have a race

110
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,669
to see who can heal him quicker.

111
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,462
Eat my healing dust!

112
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,547
[ITEM SHOP OWNER 10A]
Let's go!

113
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,673
[RISTA growls]

114
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,424
[RISTA] Take flame
to this man's wounds

115
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,928
and cleanse him
with my Megamic Power!

116
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,762
[WOUNDED MAN 10A]
Wow.

117
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,640
Those GMH healed me
up insanely fast.

118
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,433
[RISTA]
Fine, I lost.

119
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,727
Great job Goddess of Healing.

120
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,980
Hey, I'll take some of that GMH.

121
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,940
Actually give me all
that you have in there.

122
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,358
[ITEM SHOP OWNER 10A]
All right, thank you!

123
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,569
[RISTA] This is bull! My magic
is awesome! I want a rematch!

124
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,320
[MASH]
It's okay, Rista. Try to relax.

125
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,030
You still have your
little doll thing, right?

126
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,699
[RISTA] Oh, shut up,
you stupid mushroom,

127
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,741
mashed tater, whatever you are!

128
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,577
[MASH] Hey. It's not my
fault you suck as a goddess!

129
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,120
[ELULU]
Mash, that's too far!

130
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,288
You need to apologize to Rista.

131
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,039
[SEIYA]
Cut it out. Let's get going.

132
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,752
[ROSALIE] Before we
go in and see my father,

133
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,838
there's something
I need to talk to you about.

134
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,258
But first, I want to know what
happened to the legendary armor.

135
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,051
It was eaten by
a massive turtle.

136
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,053
Say what?!
It's not time for jokes!

137
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,722
Look, I don't do jokes.

138
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,057
But the point is, the thing
doesn't exist anymore.

139
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,517
But how could that've happened?

140
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,562
I'll spare you the details.
What's done is done.

141
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,856
Anyway, what did you
need to talk about?

142
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,983
Well, it's about my father.

143
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,360
The Warmaster, Wohlks Roseguard,

144
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,573
has been fighting off demons
for over 30 years.

145
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,783
Earlier this year,
as he was turning 80,

146
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,578
he headed off to
defeat the Demon Lord.

147
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,289
But along the way,
and for unknown reasons,

148
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,291
he was turned into an infant.

149
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,959
My men and I had to rescue him.

150
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,210
[SEIYA]
Okay.

151
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,505
Is there some other
point you're getting at?

152
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,300
[ROSALIE] My father...
doesn't have very long.

153
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,134
[MASH, ELULU]
Hm?

154
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,305
The Warmaster... is very
respected throughout the land.

155
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,974
I just want this
time to be peaceful.

156
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,938
Whenever he returned
from battle

157
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,522
he'd be tired,

158
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,026
but he'd always pick me up
and give me a pat on the head.

159
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,445
He'd be so warm and loving.

160
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,699
[ROSALIE]
All I'm asking is if Father says

161
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,202
he wants to fight the
Demon Lord alongside you,

162
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,121
please tell me that
you'll persuade him not to.

163
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,957
You don't need to ask me.

164
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,876
Last thing I want is an
old geezer slowing me down.

165
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,128
Okay. I see.

166
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,923
But please...

167
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,883
...don't call him that!

168
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,470
You have my thanks,
Goddess and Hero.

169
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,555
I appreciate you coming here.

170
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,309
After killing the Heavenly King,
I don't remember what happened.

171
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,896
But that aside, now that the
Four Heavenly Kings are gone,

172
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,273
are you planning to attack
the Demon Lord's castle?

173
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,900
I am.

174
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,111
But I don't really need
your help with that, okay?

I suppose that you don't.

178
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,327
Why would you seek
assistance from an old man?

179
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,161
Father.

180
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:15,996
Huh?

181
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,540
[ROSALIE] You've done more
than your fair share already.

182
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,583
The hero will finish
what you've started.

183
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,460
[WARMASTER]
Hmm... Indeed.

184
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,046
Perhaps I could stay here
and show the fair goddess

185
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,881
around our legendary cathedral

186
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,718
instead of trying to
fight a young man's battle.

187

[MESSENGER 10A] Survivors

191
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,808
I must go stop them at once!

‐‐[ROSALIE] Father!

Don't sweat it, pops.

Just show the goddess your
awesome cathedral or whatever.

00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,654
[RISTA]
What the heck?

199

203

[WARMASTER]
Many years ago,

204
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,460
I heard a legend
about a goddess appearing

205
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,879
to someone who'd save the world.

206
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,715
I was so taken by it
that I built this cathedral.

207
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,468
I suppose I thought
of myself as that hero.

208
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,429
But now it seems that
my role won't be so grand.

209
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,890
[RISTA] Your people
definitely see you as a hero,

210
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,602
and you're much more heroic
than a certain someone. [sighs]

211
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,063
Are you and your hero not
getting along very well?

212
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,355
That's putting it mildly!

213
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,232
"You're so useless!
You suck, bro."

214
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,609
Ugh! He's always
putting me down,

215
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,861
and it makes me wanna
punch his perfect face in!

216
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,945
Oh, I see.

217
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,198
Sometimes the more
talented a person is,

218
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,658
the more twisted
their personality can be.

219
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,118
But let me ask you something.

220
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,788
As a goddess,
are you aware of the reason

221
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,415
why the gods are
able to live eternally?

222
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,876
No, all I really
know is we can't die.

223
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,378
[WARMASTER] The soul
currently in your body is‐‐

224
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,798
let's call it a virtual soul.

225
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,841
Your real soul
is stored in a room

226
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,887
within the Divine Realm
where time stands still.

227
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,931
If you were to
die in this world,

228
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,017
only your virtual soul
would be affected.

229
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,270
As long as a goddess's real
soul is in the Divine Realm,

230
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,439
she will continue
to live on forever.

231
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,484
By the same principle,
if a summoned hero were to die,

232
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,278
he would simply return
to his original world

233
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,032
where his real soul remains,
safe from harm.

234
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,700
You know a lot about this, huh?

235
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,328
[WARMASTER] Well, I've learned
many things in this long life.

236
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,039
In fact, I've
recently discovered...

237
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,834
...there's a magical item
that relates to this subject.

238
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,836
Oh, really? There is?

239
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:33,007
[WARMASTER] Yes.
It is called Chain Destruction.

240
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,217
[RISTA]
Uh...

241
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,427
[WARMASTER] A powerful
and frightening thing.

242
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,055
If it's used to
destroy a virtual soul,

243
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,890
it causes a chain reaction

244
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,060
that eliminates
the real soul as well.

245
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,521
So if this item
really does exist,

246
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,399
then both Seiya and I
could actually die for good?

247
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,441
[WARMASTER]
Correct.

248
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,318
I happen to know
that the Demon Lord

249
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,155
has already created
a Chain Destruction.

250
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,281
[gasps]

251
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,366
[WARMASTER] Not only that,
he's successfully produced

252
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,161
the ultimate weapon
with which to apply it.

253
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,539
[WARMASTER]
A weapon that can shatter

254
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,959
the soul of a hero
and kill a goddess.

255
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,545
I give you God Eater‐‐

256
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,506
a deity‐slaying sword!

257
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,008
[RISTA gasps]

258
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,554
[WARMASTER] You are
going to die, dear goddess.

259
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,181
As long as you're in this world,

260
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,475
the hero can escape to
the Divine Realm at any time.

261
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,603
I must block his retreat.

262
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:30,356
[RISTA] But I don't understand.
Why are you doing all this?

263
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,483
Obvs, because old age sucks.

264
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,944
When I went on my journey
to end the Demon Lord,

265
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,947
I thought it would bring
about my end as well.

266
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,618
However, the experience
left me a changed man.

267
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,370
The Demon Lord had
seen through everything.

268
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,373
He knew that my failure
to realize my life's dream

269
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,585
had cultivated a darkness
deep inside my heart.

270
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,004
His power was
absolutely overwhelming.

271
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,631
I found myself in complete awe,

272
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,717
like a newborn babe seeing
the world for the first time.

273
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,929
He had given me this rebirth.

274
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,473
And now I worship
the Demon Lord.

275
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,934
The one who brings
death as well as life.

276
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,687
But since I once venerated you,
I will show you mercy

277
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,523
and make your death
swift and painless!

278

This can't be happening.

[WARMASTER]
Hm? Are you afraid to die?

288
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,217
Even though you're a goddess,

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,594
I suppose you're
still a young girl.

No, please! Help me, Seiya!

00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,725
He can't.

293
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,353
Now, return to
nothingness. Begone!

294
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,273
Come on, Seiya!

Aw, man.

Honestly,

I kinda hate that we were mad

00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,893
I...

311
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,854
I wouldn't be able to go home.

[RISTA]
What're you guys doing here?

317
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,613
Seiya said he was
worried about you

318
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,532
and made us come back to check.

‐‐[gasps]
‐‐[WARMASTER] Is that so?

320
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,037
Do you have some sort of
precognitive ability, Hero?

321
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,748
All I can do is explore
every last possibility.

322
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,458
The hell does that mean?

323
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,501
[SEIYA] What if that
Heavenly King, Eraser whatever,

324
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,462
was faking his death?

325
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,921
Or what if he really did die,

326
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,549
but then he came
back as an angry ghost?

327
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,302
What if the Demon Lord has
some weapon that can kill gods?

328
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,720
What if when you
went to kill him,

329
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,139
he gave you the hypothetical
god‐killing weapon.

330
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,350
And what if you had
decided to use that weapon

331
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,186
to kill the goddess so you
could trap and kill me, too?

332
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:18,149
Now, what if you, the Warmaster,
are my real enemy?

333
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,068
[RISTA] Whoa. If that's
his internal monologue,

334
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,486
then how does he sleep at night?

335
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,071
Oh, well, that's my Seiya.

336
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,615
And what if that goddess
is some kind of imposter?

337
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,076
[RISTA]
No! No! I'm the real deal!

338
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,829
[WARMASTER laughs] So all
this wasn't the result of logic,

339
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,581
or cunning, or even intuition.

340
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,584
You came back just because
you're pathologically cautious.

341
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,669
[ROSALIE]
Father! Please stop this!

[WARMASTER]
Don't interfere, Rosalie.

343

If you do, I will not
hesitate to cut you down.

345
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,886
[WARMASTER]
It has been my lifelong dream,

346
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:47,970
but the fact is,

347
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,265
I was never destined to become
the hero that saves the world.

348
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,768
So I will simply have
to take joy in being the one

349
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,852
who slays that hero!

350
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,728
Watch out!

351
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,523
That sword will kill you and
destroy your soul back on Earth!

You'll be dead‐dead!

to kill him, then.

It seems that my frail, old body

is on the brink
of withering away.

If I can reclaim
my former glory,

I'll offer everything
I have to the Demon Lord.

Along with the God Eater sword,

363
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,217
he gave me this this
Demon Spirit Orb as well.

Wait, so now he's a Demonkin?

I must say this
Double Eternal Sword of yours

is quite the
formidable technique.

[WARMASTER chuckles]

378
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,898
The Demon Lord
told me something.

379
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,441
He said that the
world you come from

380
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,903
is relatively peaceful and you
don't know what war really is.

he should be hella fast.
This'll be a breeze.

00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,796
you made me heal you so fast.

466
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:17,174
You got all whiny then.
I thought you were soft as tofu.

467
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,093
You're missing the point, Rista.

468
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,303
Getting healed just means I
have a better chance of winning.

469
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,680
[RISTA giggles]

470
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,223
[WARMASTER cries]

471
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:28,227
Oh my god, this feels like a
million bees stung my shoulder!

472
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,063
Hear that? Your old man's
crying like a baby.

473
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,650
He doesn't deserve
to be called my father!

474
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,278
Rista, go and heal
the geezer's wound.

475
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,029
[ROSALIE gasps]

476
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,031
I guess I can do that.

477
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,369
Oh. My most humble
thanks, fair goddess.

478
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,081
[RISTA]
Okay. He's all healed up.

479
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:49,999
But, uh...

480
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,084
[SEIYA]
Great. That's it for us.

481
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,378
Rosalie's gotta
take it from here.

482
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,465
He is not my responsibility!

483
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,968
He sold his soul to the
Demon Lord, and I won't‐‐

484
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,970
He's the shame of the kingdom.

485
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,557
He tried to kill the goddess,
and destroy the world‐‐

486
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,435
‐‐[thudding]
‐‐[ROSALIE groans]

487
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,688
[SEIYA] If there's something
you need him to know...

488
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,191
...you're running out
of time to tell him.

489
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,612
[WARMASTER]
Sweet Rosalie.

490
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,738
[ROSALIE gasps]

491
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,948
Daddy still loves you.

492
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,494
[WARMASTER]
I'm so sorry.

493
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,081
Father, I‐I forgive you!

494
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,959
So, please, just this last time,

495
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,004
pat my head like you used to.

496
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,881
Father.

497
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,677
[WARMASTER]
My darling Rosalie.

498
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,472
I love you very much.

499
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,605
[ROSALIE crying]

500
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,284
[RISTA] Three days later it was
announced that Wohlks Roseguard,

501
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,247
the mighty Warmaster,
had passed away from old age.

502
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,332
The throne now
belongs to Rosalie,

503
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,709
who should make
a pretty decent leader‐‐

504
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,546
as long as she keeps
the barking to a minimum.

505
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,928
[RISTA] Hm. Thanks
for everything, Seiya.

506
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,012
[MASH]
He okay?

507
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,181
[ELULU] Yeah, he's been
asleep for a few days now.

508
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,684
He's fine. His wounds
are totally healed.

509
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,977
[ELULU, MASH]
Hm...

510
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,311
You guys should stop worrying

511
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,771
and go have some
fun in the city.

512
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:36,939
[ELULU]
Huh? Are you sure?

513
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,732
Yeah, check out the casino.

514
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,110
You know this weirdo
will just wanna train.

515
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:41,944
[BOTH]
Rista...

516
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,988
I told you two to stop worrying!

517
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,990
I think we can agree
this guy who walks around

518
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,701
like he's got a stick up his
butt does enough of that for us.

519
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,202
When he wakes up
from his lil' nap,

520
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,829
I'll make sure he
doesn't throw a fit.

521
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,706
After all, he is my lackey.

522
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,957
[MASH]
Look behind you.

523
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,125
[RISTA]
Hmm?

524
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,088
‐‐[SEIYA] I'm your what now?
‐‐[RISTA yelps]

525
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,965
Anyway, we need
to talk about our plan

526
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,800
before we go fight
the Demon Lord.

527
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,135
Okay, everyone listen carefully

528
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,095
as our wise leader
makes his big speech!

529
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,138
[MASH]
What about the casino?

530
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,098
Have you got mashed
potatoes for brains, kid?

531
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,142
This is the worst time
for fartin' around like that!

532
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,393
[MASH, ELULU groan]

533
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,646
I barely made it out alive
from that Warmaster fight.

534
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,648
That means I'm gonna
have to train even harder

535
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,609
if I really wanna take
down the Demon Lord.

536
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,235
[RISTA]
Yeah, that's a great idea.

537
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,570
You train your little heart out.

538
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,738
[MASH, ELULU]
Ugh...

539
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,489
[SEIYA]
But before I start training,

540
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,783
let's take a little
time for some RnR.

541
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,035
[MASH, ELULU gasp]

542
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,703
Hold on a sec.
What did you just say?

543
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,788
I said rest and relaxation.

544
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,458
It won't be any big deal
to take a couple days off.

545
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,709
You're saying we
could go play around

546
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,961
at the casino
or something? Seriously?

547
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,087
[SEIYA]
Knock yourselves out.

548
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,672
That sounds amazing!

549
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,215
You gotta come with us, Seiya!

550
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,717
[SEIYA]
Yeah, I've earned some fun.

551
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,135
Seiya...

552
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,763
[SEIYA] First, I'd like to look
for some synthesis materials.

553
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,474
But we can head out for
some laughs later tonight.

554
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,518
[RISTA] Finally! I've been
wanting to blow off some steam!

555
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,354
I mean we were due
for an amusement park,

556
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,773
or beach or hot springs and just
let our brains turn to jelly!

557
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,899
[ELULU]
That sounds scary!

558
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,901
[RISTA] Ya know, we're always
training, training, training,

559
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,486
or fighting, fighting, fighting!

560
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,904
But not today!

561
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,948
We're gonna party
ourselves stupid!

562
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,200
[MASH, ELULU]
Oh, yeah!
