1
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,916
Excuse me.

2
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,416
Are you a member of
the Host Club?

3
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,416
Could you ask 3rd-year
student Mitsukuni Haninozuka

4
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,541
to meet me out here?

5
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,500
Who? Honey-senpai? You sure?

6
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:39,875
Yes.

7
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,666
Oh, look! It's Chika-chan!

8
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,750
So what's up? You rarely
come over to the high school

9
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,291
like this to see me.

10
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,375
Prepare yourself, Mitskuni!

11
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:00,708
Hey! C'mon, cut it out
you guys! Mori-senpai!

12
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,000
Whaddya mean, "hm"?!

13
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,666
Whoa! Did you see that?!

14
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,791
Honey-senpai dodged Chika's
preliminary attack!

15
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,666
This is gonna be good!

16
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,208
What's going on?

17
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,458
Honey-senpai is able to fly
through the air with such grace!

18
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,333
He's like a modern-day
Ushiwakamaru! Whoa!

19
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,708
Chika attacks again without
even giving him a chance

20
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,458
to regain his balance!

21
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,958
Incredible! He dodged his
attack and tripped him!

22
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,416
Neither of them is gonna give!

23
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,791
They keep lashing out with
ferocious techniques!

24
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,000
So they're at it again?

25
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,583
I wish they would've chosen a
better location to do this.

26
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,458
Wait, why are
you guys so calm?!

27
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,791
Things're getting serious
now! Chika's got a weapon!

28
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,791
Hey! No way! The use a weapon
should be against the rules!

29
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,208
Whoa! He knocked him
out of the park!

30
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,916
This may be his first win!

31
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,208
I gotcha!

32
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,208
Sorry.

33
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,541
But I don't think so.

34
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,625
The winner of this fight
is Honey-senpai!

35
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,291
Renge's right about that.

36
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,750
See? He got you.

37
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,333
How the hell did he do that?!

38
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,541
In the heat of battle,
Honey-senpai was able to attack

39
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,083
with his shuriken before
Chika noticed!

40
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,125
He uses shuriken?

41
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,583
His attack has left Chika
utterly defenseless!

42
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,166
What a great fight!
Can't wait for the next one!

43
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,833
Until then, see ya!

44
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,250
Hey, guys.

45
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,208
I'm completely lost- you wanna
tell me what's going on here?

46
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,666
Who's that kid and why'd
he attack Honey-senpai?

47
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,791
What? You mean you can't tell
just by looking at his face?

48
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,708
He's Honey-senpai's
younger brother.

49
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,500
Chika's 'Down With
Honey' Declaration!

50
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,375
The Haninozukas
are a noble family.

51
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,291
We excel at martial arts.

52
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,458
We've combined styles
over the years,

53
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,250
to create our very own
method of fighting.

54
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,000
When we're away,
we study karate and judo,

55
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,083
but when we're home,
we work hard to master

56
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,041
the Haninozuka technique.
So to make sure that

57
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,083
we always stay alert,
we have been taught that

58
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,791
whenever two family members
come face-to-face,

59
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,208
they must engage
each other in battle.

60
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,250
I get it now. They were
fighting because their family

61
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,583
makes them.

62
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,916
Go on, Yasuchika.
We saved you a piece of cake!

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,083
Thank you, but I don't
care for sweets.

64
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,083
Besides a basic principle
of the Haninozuka technique

65
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,375
is refraining from selfishness.
So to let myself

66
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,541
indulge in sweets would
be out of the question.

67
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,625
But one little piece of cake
isn't really going to hurt you.

68
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,833
Hold on- I happen to know
of a sweets-loving,

69
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,541
overly-pampered little
loli boy who happens to be-

70
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,916
- the next head
of the Haninozukas-

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,791
-and he's sitting
right over there.

72
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,833
Let me just say,
there's no way I'm ever going

73
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,041
to recognize a dimwit
like Mitskuni as the

74
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,958
next head of our family.

75
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,583
There's no doubt my
older brother is strong,

76
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,375
but he lives a decadent
lifestyle and has failed to show

77
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,708
any self-restraint.
He no longer has the right

78
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,916
to be called a Haninozuka.

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,125
I can't allow someone
who arbitrarily quit

80
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,541
the Karate Club only
to become hooked,

81
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,791
on cake and stuffed
animals; to be the head

82
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:55,583
of the Haninozuka family,
even if he is my older brother.

83
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,333
I've been meaning to make
that clear for a while.

84
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,208
And another thing, Mitskuni.

85
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,541
I've said it before and
I'll say it again stay away

86
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,416
from me at school, got it?

87
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,041
Senpai. Are you doin' okay?

88
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:28,041
Honey-senpai, so what should
we do with this cake?

89
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,625
I'll eat it!

90
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,041
Yay!

91
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,833
I guess everyone has their
own strange family issues

92
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,125
to deal with.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,208
So, you used to be in the
Karate Club Honey-senpai?

94
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,541
I had no idea.
What made you decide to quit

95
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,875
and join the Host Club?

96
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,166
Why did you just say
the Host Club like that?

97
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,416
What're you getting at, huh?

98
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,208
Well, no matter how you
cut it, the Karate Club

99
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,291
is a much more reputable
club than ours, senpai.

100
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,958
If you really wanna know-

101
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,458
-we'll have to take a little
trip down memory lane.

102
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,583
It was long before the Host
Club had been established.

103
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,083
Listen up and we'll tell you
the legend of Honey-senpai,

104
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,958
the captain of the Karate Club.

105
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:26,041
Oh, so the eldest son
is in high school now?

106
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,083
I heard he's already been made
captain of the Karate Club

107
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,250
and he's only a 1st-Year.

108
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,208
That is outstanding.

109
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,791
I know he's a growing boy
but doesn't he seem small

110
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,208
for his age? He may not
be respected as head

111
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,833
of the family
if he stays that small.

112
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,291
Mitsukuni, you are aware
of what the others are

113
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,291
saying about you, right?

114
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,833
Yes.

115
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,208
You must work even harder to
maintain your self-discipline.

116
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,833
Completely cast aside all
weakness and leniency

117
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,375
and take hold of your
true strength.

118
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,875
Right!

119
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,291
From that day forward,
Honey-senpai

120
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,125
tried his very best.

121
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,416
It was difficult,
but he worked hard.

122
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,125
So he spent more time
working on martial arts moves?

123
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,541
Wrong!

124
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,750
Well aware of what the others
were saying about him,

125
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,000
Honey-senpai worked hard to
follow his father's orders.

126
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,375
He sealed away all
of his cute possessions,

127
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,541
so as to not seem weak.

128
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:37,458
Then, he decided to take on a
hard and fearless disposition,

129
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,666
that of a manly-man.

130
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,333
However, it was obvious to
everyone around him that

131
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,708
his efforts were failing.

132
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,958
Excuse me Haninozuka,
would you like me to get you

133
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:52,833
a piece of cake?

134
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,875
What're you doing?! He can't!

135
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,041
No thank you,
I don't like sweets.

136
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,208
He's upset! See what you did?
He was exercising self-control!

137
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,875
I totally forgot; I'm so sorry.

138
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,166
He's trying so hard to resist!

139
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,083
You can tell he's
really struggling!

140
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,166
Oh wow, it's so touching!

141
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,000
And so, the girls were so
touched by seeing him resist

142
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,208
the things he loved that their
Moe senses went into overdrive.

143
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,875
Not long after that the
Haninozuka fan club was born.

144
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,041
I don't understand what
any of that has to do with

145
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,166
the legend of the Karate Club.

146
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,083
Let us explain.

147
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,750
Okay guys, take
a ten minute break!

148
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,166
Sir!

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,541
Hey. You know Captain
Haninozuka is such a strict

150
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,708
and manly captain!
His technique is awesome

151
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,291
and he always keeps us in line!

152
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,458
No joke! He's the
best captain ever!

153
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,291
For real, though!
He's a super manly-man!

154
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,041
That story's such a
tear-jerker!

155
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,500
You gotta be kidding?
How is that a tear-jerker?

156
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,416
Never mind, just tell me
what happens, would ya?

157
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,666
Why, hello there,
Haninozuka-senpai.

158
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,750
I know this is kind of
sudden but I was wondering

159
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,375
if you'd join a new club
I'm starting.

160
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,958
Aren't you Suou? Tamaki, right?
You're from the middle school.

161
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,833
What kind of club
are you starting?

162
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:49,291
I can't tell you how happy I am
you asked Haninozuka-senpai!

163
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,458
Come on senpai, don't you
think it's about time that

164
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,458
you start using your
charming, good looks to get

165
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,291
more out of life?

166
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,208
Why waste your time
fighting when you could use

167
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,416
your cuteness to give solace
to young girls

168
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,291
with too much time on
their hands.

169
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,458
With tons of stuffed animals
and all the cake you could want!

170
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,625
I promise that if you join
we'll always have plenty

171
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,500
of sweets on hand.

172
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,375
Really? I mean- No. I don't like
sweets so you can forget it,

173
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,916
and for the record, I don't
like cutesy things either.

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,083
No way. Not into cutesy
stuff. Don't like it, at all.

175
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:30,291
I don't know much about martial
arts so please forgive me,

176
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,500
but I was wondering. Do you
think you could tell me

177
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,125
what true strength is?

178
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,708
I may be out of line but
hiding your true self and

179
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,750
putting on airs doesn't seem
any different than

180
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,875
running away to me.
I would think that embracing

181
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,666
the things you truly like and
being able to enjoy them-

182
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,500
Is worth more than anything.
To just be yourself.

183
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,666
I believe that's what
true strength really is.

184
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,583
I'll be back to ask you again.
Please consider it, senpai.

185
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,875
What is it that you wanted
to talk to me about?

186
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,416
Well. There's something
that I've been

187
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,916
a little confused
about, father.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,541
Can you please tell me
what true strength is?

189
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:26,333
I will show you my son, so you
can experience it directly.

190
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,166
Come with me to the dojo!

191
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,791
It has been said, that
Honey-senpai's father

192
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,083
is the most talented fighter

193
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,541
in the Haninozuka
family's history.

194
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,750
And... begin!

195
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,791
If I remember correctly,
Honey-senpai had already

196
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,458
attained his current level
of martial arts prowess.

197
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,625
Which is quite extraordinary.
Well, am I right?

198
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,708
Uh-huh!

199
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,250
Rumor has it, the referee that
happened to be officiating

200
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,000
was Japan's Secretary
of Defense at the time,

201
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,291
and he begged Honey-senpai to
never fight in public again;

202
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,250
at least not at his
full potential.

203
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,166
Why would he do that?

204
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,625
If the world ever saw
Honey-senpai's true abilities

205
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,541
they'd suspect Japan
of possessing a weapon

206
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,458
of mass destruction. The
Secretary was afraid it might

207
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,625
upset the U.N. and then
they would take it out

208
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,250
on all of Japan.

209
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,000
How awful!

210
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,333
So, Honey-senpai
quit the Karate Club-

211
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,333
-and decided to become a
member of the Host Club.

212
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,041
All things considered, Honey
senpai's behavior is too

213
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,208
unconventional for even the
Haninozuka's to contain.

214
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,625
So because of that, his younger
brother had a more strict

215
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,333
upbringing- one more in
keeping with the

216
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,750
Haninozuka standard.

217
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,166
Sometimes I think
Chika-chan hates me because

218
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,500
I'm not following
the family rules.

219
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,208
All right, gentlemen!

220
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:59,291
Time for Operation Haninozuka
Brothers Reconciliation!

221
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,958
I knew he was gonna say that.

222
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,083
Alright, ten minute break!

223
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,708
Sir!

224
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,750
Y' know, Captain Haninozuka
sure is a strict captain.

225
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,458
No matter how hard we try it's
like he's never satisfied.

226
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,041
I really don't
think I can take it.

227
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,500
Tell me about it.

228
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,916
He's a tough captain. But
he's nowhere near as skilled

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,500
at martial arts as his
older brother, Mitskuni.

230
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,458
You will not talk about
my brother in my presence

231
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,583
do you understand?

232
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:40,208
Look! It's Chika,
he's sooo adorable!

233
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh wow, he's so
totally cute!

234
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,125
Yeah, Chika's not bad but he's
no match for his older brother,

235
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,458
Honey. He's the cutest
thing we've ever seen!

236
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,083
What are you idiots
looking at?!

237
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,000
Get started with
the next drill!

238
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,833
But, we're still on
our break, sir!

239
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,833
You've barely broken a sweat.
You bums don't need a break.

240
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,083
Start working harder
before you're all out!

241
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,625
Sir!

242
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,250
Well, so far it looks like a
simple inferiority complex.

243
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,750
He's always being compared to
Honey-senpai so that's why

244
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,000
he feels such animosity towards
him. His older brother is

245
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,833
more attractive, more popular
and a better martial artist

246
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,166
than he is. I think he's
just letting his jealousy

247
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,708
get the best of him.

248
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,875
It's totally normal
and way boring.

249
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,958
We're gonna go find
something more entertaining.

250
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,750
Hold on!
Come back here you two!

251
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,083
Why are you suddenly
being so uncooperative?

252
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,958
Well, we thought
there'd be an interesting,

253
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,250
secret reason they're
fighting. This is just lame.

254
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,791
So Honey-senpai and
Chika's feelings

255
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,041
aren't exciting enough?!

256
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,750
It's okay Tama-chan, really.

257
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,208
But, Honey-senpai.

258
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,916
It's alright;
don't worry about me.

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,375
So what if
Chika-chan hates me.

260
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,958
I would be happy just seeing
him grow up to be strong

261
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,583
and healthy; he is
my brother after all.

262
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,291
Um, he's already a lot taller
than you Honey-senpai.

263
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,500
Yeah, he's pretty "grown up"
and plenty "healthy".

264
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,666
'Scuse me, could you guys
please keep it down?

265
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,541
What're you doing here?! I
thought I had told you to

266
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,000
stay away from me at
school Mitskuni!

267
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,500
You alien.

268
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,041
Just leave me alone!

269
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,666
But Chika-chan.

270
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,166
What's he mean "alien"?

271
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,291
Why would you call him that?
Just because your brother

272
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,166
is stronger than you are
doesn't give you the right to

273
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,666
call him an alien!

274
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,458
Yeah, why are you so upset
about cake and stuffed animals?

275
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,583
Well If it was just about
the cake and stuffed animals

276
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,583
I would never have
said anything.

277
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:39,000
Let's get this straight, I
didn't call my brother an alien

278
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,875
because he's stronger than me.

279
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,416
Have any of you ever seen
him devour an entire cake?!

280
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,541
Don't tell me that you guys
think that's perfectly normal!

281
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,208
He has 3 whole cakes after
dinner every night for dessert!

282
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:55,083
Seriously- three cakes a night!
And he never gains weight!

283
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,500
I humbly accept
this yummy dessert!

284
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,541
That was delicious!

285
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,958
So Honey-senpai eats
that way at home, too?

286
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,416
And then something crazy
occurred last week.

287
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,250
I happened to wake up in
the middle of the night.

288
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,125
And I noticed that the light
was on in the dining room.

289
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,583
What's going on? It's the
middle of the night, you know.

290
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,333
Hey, Chika-chan.

291
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,291
No way! He's eating cake-
at this hour??!

292
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,750
I'm glad you're here. Once a
week I have a special cake

293
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,958
night where I eat all the cake I
want. Usa-chan here helped me

294
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,208
to come up with the idea.

295
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,083
Would you like to join us?

296
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,000
C'mon, be honest.

297
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,083
You know there's no way
a regular human being

298
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,708
can eat that much cake!
Aren't you terrified?!

299
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,041
I bet he gets signals from his
home planet through that weird

300
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,208
bunny of his! Why can't you
see that he's an alien?!

301
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,791
When you think about it-

302
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,791
-everything Chika
just said to us-

303
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,291
-suddenly makes perfect
sense, doesn't it?

304
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,791
I don't know though.
There was a time when Mitskuni

305
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,666
and I got along really well.

306
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,083
While it's true that my
brother's always had a fondness

307
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,916
for cute things and more
of a sweet tooth

308
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,333
than I have. I still respected
his ability to avoid

309
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,250
that stuff even though
he loved it.

310
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,958
And then this idiot came
along and brainwashed him

311
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,291
with some ridiculous nonsense.

312
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,500
Something about acknowledging
who you really are

313
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:28,583
and just being yourself.
That that's true strength!

314
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,541
Not long after that he fell
apart and became the alien

315
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,541
he is today.

316
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,750
Oh, I see, so all
of Chika's troubles-

317
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,541
-can be traced right back to
you, isn't that true boss?

318
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,208
What are you talking about?!
I didn't mean to!

319
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,916
There's gotta be some way
we can fix this!

320
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,708
Come on, you guys!

321
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,833
There is a way
to solve this, you know.

322
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,125
You've got it figured out?!

323
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,125
So Mitsukuni,
you know what to do.

324
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,458
Listen, Chika-chan,
I never meant to upset you.

325
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,791
I didn't know that you
hated sweets that much

326
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,166
and I'm very sorry.

327
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,291
Oh no, it looks like he
completely missed the point.

328
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,500
Nobody can make me
change who I am.

329
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,750
I'm really grateful
to Tama-chan and all

330
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,458
of the Host Club because
they've shown me that.

331
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,583
So.

332
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,041
Let's settle this like men,
in the Haninozuka style.

333
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,666
Yasuchika.

334
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,250
Since when does Ouran have
a field like this?

335
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:35,666
And don't forget Chika-chan,
this is a one-point match.

336
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,000
So what happens if I win?

337
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,041
If you win I'll
stop eating cake

338
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,791
in the middle of the night.

339
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,250
All right.

340
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:51,375
Are you ready for battle,
men? Then, you may begin.

341
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,583
Is it just me? Or is this
fight turning out exactly like

342
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,875
the one they had earlier?

343
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,500
Yes, but this time
their roles are reversed.

344
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,583
Mitsukuni's already planned
how this entire fight

345
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,458
will pan out.

346
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,708
Yasuchika will attack with
his shuriken any moment now.

347
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,083
Whoa, he called it!

348
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,958
Uh, Mori-senpai, where do
they hide these shuriken?

349
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,916
I have been watching these two
brothers spar for many years.

350
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,833
And it didn't take long
before I noticed that

351
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,250
in every match Yasuchika
incorporates moves

352
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,375
that Mitsukuni used
in the previous match.

353
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,291
Mitsukuni realized it as well,
and he always tries to give

354
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,125
his brother the opportunity
to practice

355
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,416
those new techniques.

356
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,125
He may call him an alien,
but as far as martial arts

357
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,625
are concerned, Yasuchika
has a deep respect for

358
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,166
Mitsukuni and his abilities.
I think all he really

359
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,291
wants is to be like his
older brother. They are

360
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,125
connected just as two
siblings ought to be.

361
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,708
And personally, I think
a little sibling rivalry

362
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,375
is perfectly normal.

363
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,916
There's no need to worry about
the outcome of this match.

364
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,125
I can already tell you that
Mitsukuni's planning to

365
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,208
throw the fight and let
Yasuchika beat him.

366
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,500
Trust me, I know everything
there is to know about him.

367
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,166
Defend yourself!

368
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:23,416
Yay! I'm the winner!
Cake! Cake! Cake!

369
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,125
I have an idea! Since I won,
I think we should

370
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,208
start having special cake
night three times a week!

371
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,958
Don't let it get you
down, Mori-senpai.

372
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,166
So Honey-senpai's
love of cake exceeds

373
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,458
his love for his brother.

374
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,375
Man, he's a horrible person.

375
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,375
I would think that embracing
the things you truly like and

376
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:53,333
being able to enjoy them is
worth more than anything.

377
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,958
To just be yourself.
I believe that's

378
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,250
what true strength really is.

379
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,000
I love you!

380
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,500
What?! The Zuka Club
from Lobelia Academy has

381
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:18,083
kidnapped Haruhi?!
Don't you worry, Haruhi!

382
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,250
I'm on my way to save you
right this minute!

383
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,875
Next time, "Lobelia Girls'
Academy Strikes Back"!

384
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,416
Until then, the Ouran Host
Club will be waiting for you!

385
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,541
We'll see you then!
