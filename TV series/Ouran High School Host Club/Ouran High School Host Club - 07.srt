1
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:40,250
Wait a minute. Am I dreaming?
We're in Japan, right?

2
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,791
And Japan's not really known
for its tropical locales.

3
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:49,500
Behold, Haruhi! Bask in
the beauty of tropical birds!

4
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:53,291
Aren't they breathtaking?
I wonder what they're called.

5
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,791
Um, where was the exit, again?

6
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,791
Try to make the most of this
downtime and just relax.

7
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:02,291
We're so worried about keeping
our good looks day and night.

8
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,208
We deserve a little vacation.

9
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,791
Personally, I think this is
pointless and a waste of time,

10
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,666
so can I go home?

11
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,041
I should really be studying
and I've got a ton of laundry

12
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,625
to do today.

13
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,458
Hey senpai,
where are we, anyway?

14
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,125
Target.

15
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:33,958
Captured!

16
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,291
Wait! What the?!

17
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,250
Good work.
Now take her with you.

18
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,250
Roger!

19
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,875
Hold on. Where are we going?!

20
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,583
This place is a brand new
theme park that my family,

21
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,416
the Otori Group,
runs. It's called

22
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,375
the "Tropical Aqua Garden".

23
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,541
I don't understand. I thought
the Otori group ran hospitals,

24
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,583
and that they're focused
on the medical business,

25
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,166
Kyoya-senpai.

26
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,625
Yes, but my family likes
to diversify and try

27
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,375
different things. Besides,
this place could be classified

28
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,125
as a healing facility.

29
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,833
It's therapeutic. Think
of all the people who are

30
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:17,041
over worked that would love a
vacation in the south tropics.

31
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,125
However, they may not
be able to get the time off

32
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,291
or they may not
be able to afford it.

33
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,541
Those people can now seek
refuge here at this theme park

34
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,916
and reduce their stress levels.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,208
The Otori group's primary
concern has always been

36
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,916
for the good health
and well-being

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,208
of the general public.

38
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,500
It sounds suspicious to me.

39
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,333
The park doesn't officially
open until next month,

40
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,500
but the Host Club was given
a special advance invitation.

41
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,375
This is so relaxing.
We don't have to worry about

42
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,000
keeping all of our guests
entertained for once.

43
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,333
It's truly like a holiday
for handsome young soldiers.

44
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,541
I guess that's
what you'd call it.

45
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,750
Jungle Pool SOS!

46
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,083
Haru-chan! Wanna share
some coconut juice with me?

47
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,708
Or do you wanna try
a piece of the mango cake?

48
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,583
Yeah, sure. I'll have
some coconut juice with you.

49
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,416
Hah!

50
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,666
Haruhi. You wanna go
check out the water slide?

51
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,458
Hang on. What's the deal
with that pullover

52
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,291
you're wearing?

53
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,375
Oh, this thing?

54
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,875
Here. Do what
you've got to do.

55
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,625
Okay We'll do what we can.

56
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,916
Miss Fujioka, just follow me.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,791
But why?

58
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,166
Hold on! What're you doing?!
Hey! Stop that!

59
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,083
We've been asked to help
you choose a swimsuit!

60
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,125
We've brought all of our
mother's latest designs for you

61
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,000
to choose from.

62
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,666
Just pick whichever
one you want.

63
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,250
Are you ready, Miss Fujioka?
It's time to pick one!

64
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,583
Thanks, but I don't
need a swimsuit.

65
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,541
Why don't you let me
select one for you?

66
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,833
No, not that one.
I don't want a bikini.

67
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,875
But you would look
so good in this one.

68
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:25,208
No, wait! I bet
this one would be cute!

69
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,583
But that's nothing more
than a couple of strings!

70
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,250
Senpai?

71
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,458
Just hurry up and put it on.

72
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,791
A proper young woman
should not show that much skin

73
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,791
until after she's married.

74
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,708
So, you're not going to swim?

75
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,041
Hold on, you do swim,
don't you?

76
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,708
I can swim just as good as
the next guy but this isn't

77
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,000
my idea of fun. I'm not
that big on water parks;

78
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,291
we're just gonna spend
all day goofing off.

79
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,791
Honestly, I'd
rather be at home.

80
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,583
I don't understand what's so
great about this place, anyway?

81
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,500
I mean, all you really need
to play in the water

82
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,541
is a plastic pool.

83
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,250
A plastic pool- what is that?

84
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:33,041
Let's see. I guess they're
about this big, round,

85
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,833
and to use it you have
to pump it full of air.

86
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,375
You dunce.

87
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,500
That's an inflatable
boat, dummy

88
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,333
There's no way something that
small could be used as a pool.

89
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,750
Yeah.

90
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,416
It's a small pool! Haven't
you ever seen little kids

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,958
playing in one of them?

92
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,791
You idiots! If Haruhi thinks
it's a pool then it's a pool,

93
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,958
got it? Don't go
embarrassing her.

94
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,125
She can't help that
she's an ignorant commoner.

95
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:01,458
So are we supposed to lie
to her- is that what you want?

96
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,333
I can't help but feel like
I should be offended

97
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,708
by that comment.

98
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,000
Never mind that, we've
got a question for ya.

99
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,791
Why did you make Haruhi put
on that yellow monstrosity?

100
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,583
I would've thought for sure
that'd you be all-

101
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,916
I want to see Haruhi
in a swimsuit!

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,916
-Not making her
cover-up like that.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,166
It was surprising.

104
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,041
I know what he's up to.
He made Haruhi cover-up

105
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,958
because he didn't want
anyone else to see her

106
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,291
in a bathing suit.

107
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,208
Do you really think that's it?

108
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,708
He must be one of those
jealous, pervert types.

109
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,250
That's pretty twisted.

110
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,125
That's not it at all!
I was just trying to protect

111
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,666
her innocence as any
father or guardian would.

112
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,958
After all, even if she is
wearing a swimsuit, it is not

113
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,708
decent for a lady to walk around
half-naked in front of boys.

114
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:51,250
Haru-chan! Let's play!
You wanna go swimming

115
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,041
in the current pool with me?

116
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,041
Nah. I'm not gonna
swim today. Hold on.

117
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,083
You know how to swim;
you still need that float?

118
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,458
Just looks cuter this way,
you know?

119
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,541
You're right. Those bunnies
are pretty cute.

120
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,333
He's so innocent.

121
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,708
No way! You've
got it all wrong!

122
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,458
Is that Renge?

123
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,000
How does she do that?
It's like the rig follows us.

124
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,125
That outfit's pretty
impressive.

125
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,541
What's with the tattoo
on your stomach?

126
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,541
Oh that? You don't recognize it?
I'm cosplaying.

127
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,708
Yeah? As who?

128
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,625
La-la.

129
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,750
LaLa? Like the
manga magazine?

130
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,041
Her petite and slender frame,
her blue eyes that light up

131
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:50,333
young men's faces,
her singing voice!

132
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,291
I am Quon Kisaragi!

133
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,583
I wouldn't have guessed.

134
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,791
I had no idea who
you were supposed to be.

135
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,708
Hey boss, are you sure it's
okay for Renge to be dressed-

136
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,000
-like that.

137
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,916
Well yeah, that's okay.

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,458
And why is that?

139
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,500
Because it's cosplay? I guess.

140
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,541
Listen up, boys!

141
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,666
You obviously need help
understanding Haninozuka's

142
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,958
hidden motives! Look!

143
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,833
Takashi!

144
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,166
What are you talking about?

145
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,541
Think about what
he said to you earlier.

146
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,541
Just looks cuter
this way, you know?

147
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,333
He's not being as sweet
and innocent as you think.

148
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,208
I agree. Try putting the
word 'I' at the beginning

149
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,750
of that sentence.

150
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:46,083
Just looks cuter
this way, you know?

151
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,041
I look cute!

152
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,125
He planned that?!

153
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,083
That's Haninozuka for you.
In the last episode,

154
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,166
he felt threatened by
another loli-boy type

155
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,416
so he's taken steps
to keep his rank.

156
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,750
I should give him more credit.

157
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,666
He's a lot smarter
than I thought.

158
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,833
Hey! Look at this,
everybody!

159
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,791
Check it out! Look! Even though
we're swimming really fast

160
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,875
we never go any farther
than we are now!

161
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,458
So, what's up with him?

162
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,500
Could he really be that smart?

163
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,541
I got ya!

164
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,666
C'mon, boss, let's go!
Let's have a water gun fight.

165
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,125
It'll be me and
Kaoru against you.

166
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,208
If you get it in the face,
you lose. What do you say?

167
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,208
Forget it.

168
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,583
Why would I want
to subject myself

169
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,458
to a childish game like that?

170
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,375
Haruhi, I think it's time
that we got married!

171
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,416
Then we'll honeymoon in Atami!

172
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:45,125
Do you really think I'd ever
let Haruhi marry you guys?!

173
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,916
Daddy says no!

174
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,000
Taking a break, huh?
Want something to drink?

175
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,291
Yeah, thanks.

176
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,458
I'll get you guys!
Sideways-leaping shot!

177
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,625
That's cheating!

178
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,083
Honey-senpai!

179
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,416
Mitsukuni!

180
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,208
Mori-senpai.

181
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,083
Gentlemen, we're
going after Honey-senpai!

182
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,666
That pool looks
like the quickest way!

183
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,708
Charge!

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,791
Wait! I wouldn't go-

185
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,291
There are alligators in there!

186
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:26,291
Okay. So we can't use that pool,
then let's try this way next!

187
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,333
They're here, too!

188
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,666
And here!

189
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,083
What's with all
the alligators?

190
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,666
Beats me.

191
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,833
Those alligators belong to the
park's tropical animals exhibit.

192
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,291
I guess it is kind of dangerous
to let them run wild.

193
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,833
Though, the cause of our present
situation seems to be

194
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,250
the location of the switch
for the current pool.

195
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,041
I'll have to have a little chat
with our designers.

196
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,250
Thanks a lot, you guys.
I got some great data today.

197
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,083
You what?!

198
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,500
This is a map of the
Tropical Aqua Garden.

199
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:02,125
This is our current location.
We need to get here -

200
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,875
I have a feeling that's where
Honey-senpai probably ended up.

201
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,458
It might be tough because to get
there we'll have to make it

202
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,166
through this jungle area
in the southern block.

203
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,583
Distance wise, we're
talking about 800 meters.

204
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,916
It looks like there's a lot
of undeveloped areas.

205
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,083
Any idea what might be lurking
in those parts of the jungle?

206
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,250
Since they're still
being developed,

207
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,625
I'm afraid I don't know.

208
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,875
Whatever's out there could be
even more dangerous-

209
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,333
-than alligators.

210
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,291
All right. Now, this is
a mission of survival!

211
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,291
I know we can make it
through the treacherous jungle

212
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,958
in one piece... It is our sworn
duty to save Honey-senpai!

213
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,750
Wow, this place is just
like a real jungle, huh?

214
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,958
Yeah and I keep
hearing all of these

215
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,583
really strange animal calls.

216
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,041
You don't think that
all those animal sounds-

217
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,375
-could belong to
the real thing, do you?

218
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,875
To be honest I'm not sure,
but I do know that my family

219
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,166
always strives for authenticity
whatever the cost.

220
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,583
Mori-senpai is always
so straight-faced.

221
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,375
I can never tell what he's
thinking, but even though

222
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,375
he's doing a good job of staying
calm, I'm sure he's worried-

223
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,166
Mori-senpai is-

224
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,000
-acting as clumsy
as you do, Boss.

225
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,750
Shut up!

226
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,250
Just as I thought,
he is worried.

227
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,750
Uh-oh, it's about time
for the squall.

228
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,958
Huh?

229
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,625
Hey, Mori-senpai. You seem to be
really close with Honey-senpai.

230
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,916
Are the two of you
like childhood friends?

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,250
You mean, you don't know-

232
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,458
-that they're cousins?.

233
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,750
You're kidding me?
They're related?

234
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,666
The Morinozukas have been
serving the Haninozuka family

235
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,333
for generations.

236
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,333
However, two generations ago,
the families became relatives

237
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,833
by marriage and the
master-servant relationship

238
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,958
soon became a thing
of the past.

239
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,458
But even so, Mori-senpai
has always made a point

240
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,291
to accompany
Honey-senpai.

241
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,291
It must really
get his blood going.

242
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,875
The blood of a loyal servant
flows like a mighty river

243
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,583
through Mori-senpai's veins.

244
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,083
Such a beautiful
story! I'm touched!

245
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,083
I don't know if I'd
call it a beautiful story.

246
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,666
I'm not sure I understand all
this blood and loyalty business.

247
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,666
But it's obvious that
Mori-senpai thinks an awful lot

248
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,583
of Honey-senpai.

249
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,125
Hey Mori-senpai,
it's gonna be all right.

250
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,166
I'm sure that Honey-senpai
is safe. He's a lot tougher

251
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,833
than you might think he is,
and if he gets hungry

252
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,000
the trees are full of bananas.

253
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:56,875
Bananas?

254
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,958
What's he going to say?

255
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,458
You're right.

256
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,291
Don't tell me Mori-senpai's out
for my spot as Haruhi's daddy?!

257
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,458
Nobody wants that
spot but you, boss.

258
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,375
That's kinda creepy
when you think about it.

259
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,916
What?! Who are you
calling creepy?!

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,250
Hello? It's me. Well,
we've had an incident that's

261
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,500
caused some trouble.

262
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,666
Ha! You're a big ole perv!

263
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,458
Shut up! I'm not a perv!

264
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,166
Mori-senpai, you're
going the wrong way!

265
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,333
Honey-senpai was headed
in the opposite direction!

266
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,541
You're wrong.
He went this way.

267
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,458
Hey, wait up! It's too
dangerous to go alone!

268
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,291
I'm coming with you!

269
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,541
Haruhi.

270
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,083
That's the first time he's
ever called me by name.

271
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,166
Yes, at once, please.

272
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,375
Senpai's a perv for Haruhi!

273
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,791
Would you jerks quit
calling me a perv!...

274
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,041
My family's private police
force is going to send in

275
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,083
a search and rescue team
to help us.

276
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,708
They're better equipped to
find Honey senpai than we are.

277
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,125
So let's just go back to
the gate and wait there.

278
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,541
Shut up before
I beat your faces in!

279
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,333
Hey where are Mori and Haruhi?

280
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,333
Immediate emergency
mobilization order!

281
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,208
I repeat, immediate emergency
mobilization order!

282
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,333
Master Kyoya's friend has gone
missing near the wave pool.

283
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,583
Our search target is a small
young man. Orders are to

284
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:38,041
eliminate any suspicious
figures- show them no mercy.

285
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:42,708
Repeat, eliminate any suspicious
figures- show them no mercy.

286
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,250
Target confirmed.

287
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,083
The target has been captured
by a suspicious man.

288
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,208
We'll take the target
into custody.

289
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,250
You know, I don't believe I
mentioned to them that there

290
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,291
are other visitors here

291
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,250
Huh. Oh, well.

292
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,583
You there! Put the boy
down immediately!

293
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,458
If you refuse we'll
remove him forcefully!

294
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,666
Hold on!

295
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,291
The suspect is resisting!
Prepare to fire warning shots!

296
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,208
Takashi! Haru-chan!
Outta the way!

297
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,916
Hey! What do you think
you're doing, pipsqueak?!

298
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,250
Whoa.

299
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,333
Whoa.

300
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,083
You guys should be more
careful who you mess with!

301
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:16,375
Picking on my friends
is bad! Got it?

302
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,833
Haruhi!

303
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,333
Haruhi! Are you all right?!

304
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,666
Hey! It's Tama-chan!

305
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,500
Oh Wow.

306
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,500
You okay, senpai?

307
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,458
Haruhi!

308
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,708
I was worried about you.

309
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:31,916
I'm not sure what happened here

310
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,500
but at least
they're still alive.

311
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,041
It's pretty amazing that this
is Honey-senpai's work.

312
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,375
He must have really
been holding back.

313
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,125
What do you mean
he was holding back?

314
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,000
So then-

315
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,000
-you don't know about Senpai?!

316
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,250
The Haninozukas are famous
for their martial arts.

317
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,250
Not only have they helped train
the police and SDF forces

318
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,166
but they've also worked
with several overseas

319
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,208
military forces.

320
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,875
Honey-senpai in particular
has been called

321
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,125
the dreadnaught of the
Haninozuka family.

322
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,125
By the time he was in middle
school he'd become the

323
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,291
national champion in
both karate and judo.

324
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,125
Mori-senpai's no slouch
either. He won the national

325
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,125
championship in kendo
when he was just

326
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,000
in middle school.

327
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,375
So how were you able
to find us, Honey-senpai?

328
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,666
It wasn't hard. It didn't
take me long to reach

329
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,708
the end of the current pool, so
I decided to look for you guys.

330
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,083
We humbly apologize!

331
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,791
I am a 2nd-generation student
of the Ishizuka Dojo!

332
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,541
I'm a student of
the Todoroki Dojo!

333
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,625
And I'm from the Otakeh Dojo!
We are in your debt!

334
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,291
Why? Is something wrong?

335
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,333
Yes, sir! We're so sorry, sir!

336
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,583
We were unaware that
we were searching

337
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,583
for Mitsukuni Haninozuka!
We've committed

338
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,333
a terrible offense here!

339
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,666
I apologize for this
confrontation. But my dojo

340
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,916
will be so excited to hear that
I've come face to face with

341
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,166
the great Hahninozuka!
I cherish this moment!

342
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,125
So he is smart; he's deeper
than I could have imagined!

343
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:01,625
Takashi, you did an amazing
job of protecting Haru-chan.

344
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,750
I bet you were pretty lonely
without me around, huh?

345
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,208
I don't know
if I'd say that.

346
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,916
You know, maybe we should
go to the beach next.

347
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,041
Yeah, the beach would be nice.

348
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,875
You idiots,
Haruhi's not interested

349
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,791
in anything like that.

350
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,125
Actually, I might like
to go to the beach.

351
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,625
I may not be into this silly
water park but I like the ocean.

352
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,583
It would be nice to go to the
beach, and It's so pretty.

353
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:45,208
Yeah! All right. Then that's
where we'll go next time!

354
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,541
We're all gonna go to
the beach, Tama-chan?

355
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,541
That'll be fun,
don't you think?

356
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,083
Yeah.

357
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,000
We come to the beach
like she wanted and

358
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,750
all of a sudden Haruhi
and I get into a big fight!

359
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,250
I thought you weren't gonna
talk to me anymore, senpai.

360
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,583
Haruhi!

361
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,208
Next time, "The Sun,
the Sea, and the Host Club!"

362
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,958
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

363
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,291
We'll See you then!
