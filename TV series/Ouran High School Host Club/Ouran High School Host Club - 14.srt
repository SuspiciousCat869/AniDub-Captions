1
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,291
Mr. President.

2
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,541
Our circulation has
dropped into single digits.

3
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:37,125
Just give me
the numbers, please.

4
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:40,125
How many newspapers
did we sell this week?

5
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,208
Two copies.

6
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,375
That's all?

7
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:44,875
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,291
Ukyo, did you buy
a newspaper?

9
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,291
I did, sir.

10
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,666
And Sakyo, what about you?

11
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,875
Of course.

12
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,833
So you're saying
no one outside of

13
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,291
the newspaper club bought one?

14
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:05,875
Well, yes. Unfortunately, that
does seem to be the case, sir.

15
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,791
This is quite a predicament.

16
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:11,083
Next week's edition will be our
last paper of the 1st semester.

17
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,875
If we don't come up with
better results before

18
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,208
summer vacation,
the club will be shut down

19
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,083
before the end of
the school year.

20
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,708
Oh, by the way,
how's that other club doing?

21
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,125
Well, sir.

22
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,958
The Host Club's photo
collection, "I Love, Love, Love

23
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,916
Tamaki Special", sold out
as soon as it went on sale-

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,458
all 1,000 copies!

25
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,458
"Moe- Moe Ouran Diaries Vol.
8", the doujinshi put together

26
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,833
and published by Renge
Houshakuji, also sold out

27
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:36,166
as soon as it went on sale. It's
already in its second printing.

28
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,000
I should have known.

29
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,666
They're the ones who have the
most power here at Ouran.

30
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,083
Welcome back, Ladies.

31
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,125
Covering the Famous Host Club

32
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,583
But we can't do this, Tamaki.

33
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,333
There are so many
girls who love you,

34
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,458
and if we get any closer,
I'm afraid that they're

35
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,958
all going to hate me for it.

36
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,333
Princess. These beautiful
hydrangeas will keep us hidden

37
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,833
from the others.
You don't need to worry.

38
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,500
For this moment, I belong
to no one but you. My love,

39
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,083
the spirits of the hydrangeas
will keep our rendezvous

40
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,125
a secret.

41
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,083
Oh, Tamaki! I yearn
to be with you!

42
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,375
Princess!

43
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,958
Oh, my!

44
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,666
Sorry, Kaoru!

45
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,791
No way! I lost again?

46
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:45,250
Now go easy on him, princesses.
Kaoru is quite the crybaby.

47
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,583
Hikaru! That's not true!
I am not a cry-

48
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,208
So you're gonna deny it, huh?

49
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,833
What about when
the two of us are alone

50
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,250
playing punishment games?

51
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,083
Tell us what
happens then, Kaoru.

52
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,208
But, that's because, you-

53
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,791
Then what happens?! Tell me!
I really wanna know!

54
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,708
Wow, I've never noticed
that the courtyard

55
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,958
had such a lovely stream.

56
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,666
It's called a yarimizu channel.
It is said that during

57
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,541
the Heian era, people
would better experience

58
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,916
the seasons by watching the
petals or autumn leaves

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,541
that drifted along the water.

60
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,041
I had it specially made for all
of you hoping it would express

61
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,916
my desire to spend all
four seasons with you.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,833
So then, what do you say,
ladies? This fall there's an

63
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,291
autumn leaves tea party
with a limited

64
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,083
number of invitations.

65
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,916
Sign me up!

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,416
Now watch as we
work together to eat soba

67
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,708
Oh, he's so cute!

68
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:42,375
It's so peaceful. Guess I'm
finally getting used to this.

69
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,875
Took me long enough,
it's been this way since

70
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,083
I started school here.

71
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,583
Haruhi! Duck!

72
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,083
Hikaru! You came this close
to snuffing out the light

73
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,791
of Haruhi's life!

74
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,666
So much for it
being peaceful...

75
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,166
Hey! It's your fault for
not catching the ball

76
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,500
in the first place, Boss.

77
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,708
Yeah- Who knew that
he'd be so bad at kemari.

78
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,083
So much for him being the
"Genji of Ouran Academy."

79
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,500
What?!

80
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,833
If we want the Newspaper Club
to survive, I'm afraid

81
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,916
we're going to have
to ask them for help.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,916
No, Mr. President!
It's too dangerous

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,541
to get involved
with those guys!

84
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,458
He's right! Not only would
the club get shut down

85
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,875
but you could be expelled!

86
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:30,208
You think so? Well, check
this out! Starlight Kick!

87
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,458
What?!

88
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,333
So fast!

89
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,791
Take care of yourself!

90
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,958
Calm down, there's
nothing to worry about.

91
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,041
We have no choice but
to ask them for help.

92
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,041
However that doesn't mean
I'll fall victim to their-

93
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,333
President!

94
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,625
Really. We're terribly
sorry about that.

95
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,125
Don't worry- it's no big deal.

96
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,708
Could've happened
to anyone, right?

97
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,666
Just a ball flying through
a window and hitting me

98
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,458
upside the head-

99
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,291
Please accept our apology!

100
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,083
Well, this works out perfectly.
I was just thinking about

101
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,625
approaching the Host Club
about a cover story.

102
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,041
I don't suppose you'd
be interested?

103
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,166
I didn't know we had
a Newspaper Club.

104
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,875
It's more gossip rag
than newspaper.

105
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,708
Yeah, like a trashy tabloid.

106
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,500
It's filled with stories about
scandalous love affairs,

107
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,875
family power struggles,
and junk like that.

108
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,250
It's just a lame gossip
rag that specializes

109
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,333
in stirring up scandal.

110
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,916
And everyone knows
it's all lies,

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
so nobody reads it anymore.

112
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,625
You know, I guess we have kind
of lost sight of the truth

113
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,416
because we've been so
worried about drawing in

114
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,958
more readers.

115
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,208
It's a shame we're just now
realizing our error, now that

116
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,041
the paper is at risk.

117
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,916
We've finally realized what
we should have been reporting

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,833
to the students of Ouran.

119
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,583
Help us, please.

120
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,750
For our last paper of this
semester we'd like to

121
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,958
do an up-close special edition,
revealing the charms of

122
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,291
Ouran's Host Club members.

123
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:55,291
I'm begging you, without your
help, our club will close.

124
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,916
You can count on us. On behalf
of the Host Club I accept-

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,208
We have to decline.

126
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,000
But Kyoya! He got
hurt because of me!

127
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,375
What's the big deal, huh?

128
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,625
Sorry, we have a policy
prohibiting us from sharing

129
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,166
personal information with
anyone other than our guests.

130
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,416
But we'd be more than happy
to pay any medical expenses

131
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,125
related to your injury.

132
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,041
And another thing, what makes
you think that we'd want

133
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,458
to help you spread more
rumors and gossip?

134
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,083
We've got a reputation
to uphold and you'd

135
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,625
just ruin it.

136
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,375
Besides, you guys cause a lot
of trouble for other people.

137
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,250
And who'd wanna get
mixed up with that?

138
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,333
It's scary how much they don't
realize about themselves.

139
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:31,250
I understand. Well, I guess
you really can't erase

140
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,125
the sins of the past, can you?

141
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,500
People won't even give you
the opportunity to try

142
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,166
and redeem yourself.

143
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,208
My head is killing me!

144
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,791
President!

145
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,875
I'm okay. Don't worry, you two.
Oh no- I'm getting dizzy again!

146
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,375
President!

147
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,083
No, wait, I'm fine!

148
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,166
President!

149
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,125
I guess all we can do at this
point is disband with grace.

150
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,166
No, you don't have to!

151
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,166
You can always
make a fresh start.

152
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,541
We'll help. We will rally
the power of our Host Club,

153
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,416
and we can reestablish the
Newspaper Club together!

154
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,250
Well, count us out.

155
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,833
You're way too trusting,
boss. We can't just go along

156
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,583
with everything you do forever.

157
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,166
Yeah, we've had enough.

158
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,541
We're leaving too,
Tamaki. We're holding an

159
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,458
evaluation meeting,
mostly about you.

160
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,916
Hold it!

161
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,083
How can you be so
heartless? These men are

162
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,458
about to lose their club.

163
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,291
Don't you feel sorry for them?!

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,083
Their family's breaking up!

165
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,000
As your president,
I demand you help them!

166
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,958
And that is a direct order!

167
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,125
We're not going to do it.

168
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, he's obviously
upset with us.

169
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,041
Yeah, he hasn't even
changed clothes.

170
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,541
I hate it when he
ignores us when

171
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,583
we're right in from of him.

172
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,375
He's such a child.

173
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,333
Nah, Tama-chan's just
a lonely guy, you know?

174
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,583
A club is like a family.
Their 'family's' about to be

175
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,916
broken up.

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,708
I feel sorry for them.

177
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,166
I hate to give in but would it
really be that bad to help out

178
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,166
with their newspaper?

179
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,250
What?

180
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,625
Hey, since when are you
taking his side?

181
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,833
Since never. Just listen okay?

182
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,958
I know any moment now he's
gonna look over here

183
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,583
with those puppy-dog eyes
he uses when

184
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,833
he wants something
and none of us will

185
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,083
be able to say no
and so he'll win.

186
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,791
Let me guess, you're speaking
from experience, aren't you?

187
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,041
Besides, maybe I'm wrong, but
isn't this the kinda thing

188
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,500
you guys usually go for?

189
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,625
Well, no. This seems like
more trouble than its worth.

190
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,666
What about you
Honey-senpai?

191
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,416
Count me out. I have this
cake to eat, and Takashi

192
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,166
sticks with me, right?

193
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,916
Those are the eyes.

194
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,291
Puppy-dog eyes.

195
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,250
There will be some conditions.

196
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,458
The outline for their article
will be submitted by us.

197
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,291
Interviews are
strictly prohibited.

198
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,000
And it is vital that
our client's identities

199
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,916
be kept confidential.

200
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,500
Do we agree?

201
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,833
Well, if you think its
cool, Kyoya-senpai.

202
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,375
Then we do too.

203
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,875
I'll do it since
Kyo-chan says it's okay.

204
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,125
That's the
shadow-king for you.

205
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,416
Of course! If you'll
allow us to cover you,

206
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,833
we promise to observe
your conditions.

207
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,583
Well then, you may
start tomorrow.

208
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,416
Excellent!

209
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,041
So how is that bump on
your forehead feeling?

210
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,541
Oh, that, it's no big deal-
I hardly feel it anymore.

211
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,583
I owe a lot to this bump
because without it,

212
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,291
we'd never have come
together for this article.

213
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,666
That's true, but we're still
very sorry it happened.

214
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,916
I brought you a little something
as an apology of sorts.

215
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,375
This is a first-aid kit, made
by my family's company.

216
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,500
Thank you- I appreciate it.

217
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,041
No problem. Please excuse me.

218
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,291
Oh, it just dawned on me.

219
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,833
Your family runs
the Otori Group, right?

220
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,916
they manufacture medical
equipment, don't they?

221
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,916
We mostly deal with
hospital management.

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,333
I'm so glad that we'll
be working together.

223
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,333
My father's a
president as well,

224
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,083
of the Komatsuzawa
Publishing firm.

225
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,416
Yes, I am well aware of that.

226
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,833
So being president of the
Newspaper Club is your way

227
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,083
of preparing to take over
the family company?

228
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,916
Well yes, to an extent, but
I have this younger brother;

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,333
he's a bright young man and my
father's very proud of him,

230
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,750
you see.

231
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,958
So now my father's decided
to turn future management

232
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,583
of the company over to
my younger brother.

233
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:56,708
And thereby passing over me.
The eldest son, first born.

234
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,250
However, if I'm able to finish
my third year at Ouran Academy

235
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,250
as the president of a
successful Newspaper Club,

236
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:07,250
I think he may reconsider my
candidacy as his successor.

237
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:11,333
Do you understand? I cannot
allow this club to fall apart-

238
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,291
no matter what.

239
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,291
Please excuse me.

240
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,333
Mr. President, are we to
assume you were trying

241
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,083
to win over Kyoya Otori?

242
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:26,083
But of course. My only real
enemy here is Tamaki Suou.

243
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,166
Originally I had planned to
use the power of the

244
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,583
school newspaper to become
popular here at Ouran Academy.

245
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:35,166
But then Suou showed up and
started his stupid Host Club

246
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,083
and suddenly he became the
big man on campus.

247
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,291
But President, that's not
what Sakyo and I heard.

248
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,375
Yeah, I thought the
newspaper you printed before

249
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,416
was just as unpopular
as it is now.

250
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,458
That's enough!

251
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,916
It only takes one call to
Mother and I can have

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,916
all business between
our publishing firm

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,916
and your families cut off.

254
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,083
They've obviously
got special standing.

255
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,791
They're not affiliated with
any sports or cultural clubs.

256
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,708
They don't even
have an advisor!

257
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,000
All they do in that club
is fake romance.

258
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,333
Those poor girls who visit
them are being suckered.

259
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,750
It must be Suou's way
of flaunting his power.

260
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,125
Using his parents' authority
to let he and his buddies

261
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,833
do whatever they want
with those girls.

262
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,166
All of those Host Club members,
including Kyoya Otori,

263
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,750
were supposed to be
my underlings!

264
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,250
Tamaki Suou, he's more
shrewd than you'd expect.

265
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,375
He may seem like a friendly
guy- he's got the act down.

266
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,791
But I'm positive he's
got a dark side.

267
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,291
I'll dig until I find
something scandalous.

268
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,791
That'll teach him a lesson.

269
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,083
The Daruma doll fell over!

270
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,541
The Daruma doll fell ov-er!

271
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,541
The Daruma doll fell ov-er!

272
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,250
The Daruma doll fell ov-er!

273
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,291
The Daruma doll fell over!

274
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,666
The Daruma doll fell over!

275
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,833
I saw you move
Hikaru and Kaoru!

276
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,000
President, what on earth
are we witnessing?

277
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,250
Could it be some kind
of new religion?

278
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,458
Why're you asking me? How
the hell should I know?

279
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,958
You know, I can't blame you
for being shocked.

280
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,458
I was unfamiliar with it myself,
but it's a commoner's game.

281
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,041
They have a wide variety
and none of them require

282
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,333
spending any money, all you
need is a few friends

283
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,208
to play with.

284
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,916
And what does this have to
do with our coverage

285
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,125
of the Host Club?

286
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,291
You need to learn friendliness!

287
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,291
If you want to clear the
negative reputation of

288
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,625
the Newspaper Club and
attempt to capture the hearts

289
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,583
of your readers, you must try
to be more down to earth!

290
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,583
I can just imagine the
headlines now.

291
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:37,125
"The Handsome Boys of the Host
Club Enjoy Commoners' Games!"

292
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,375
With pictures of us frolicking
in the scenery of early summer-

293
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,958
it would be the perfect
facelilft for your frontpage!

294
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,083
And it gives you the chance
to show that a certain

295
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,833
commoner is happier now
-reliving his childhood

296
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,166
here with us!

297
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,333
Great, he's looking at me.

298
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,250
I should probably start acting
like I'm happy to be here.

299
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,333
But President. I don't think I
understand what he's saying.

300
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,500
Are you sure that this guy
isn't just a complete idiot?

301
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,875
Do not let your guard down
just yet. This is all

302
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,458
part of his strategy.

303
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,791
The commoner
in question, perfect.

304
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,375
Why can't this be over?

305
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,916
You're Fujioka, right?

306
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,125
You wouldn't mind if I asked
you a few questions, would you?

307
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,541
Um, sure.

308
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,750
So why did you
join the Host Club?

309
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,666
Well, uh. Honestly, I joined
'cause I was forced to.

310
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,208
You're an honor student on
a scholarship, correct?

311
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,875
Uh-huh,
that's right.

312
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,791
So in other words, the
fact that you're a member

313
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,875
of this club is just another
example of how the Suou family

314
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,250
loves to flaunt their power.

315
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,333
Say what?

316
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,833
Now if you would,
please tell me all

317
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,416
about Tamaki's dark side...
If you can help me out here

318
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,625
I just might be able
to set you free.

319
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:49,250
Sorry but as far as I can tell
he doesn't have a dark side.

320
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,708
That can't be right. You
expect me to believe that

321
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,666
a group of high schoolers
actually enjoys

322
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,416
playing these
childish games?

323
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,500
I don't think it's that weird.

324
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,125
You've got to be kidding me!

325
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,291
Chop!

326
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,625
Now come and get us!

327
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,708
Hey wait! That's not where
you're supposed to cut,

328
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,375
you know!

329
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,125
Next we're
playing kankeri!

330
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,958
And you're "it", okay Kyoya?

331
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,375
If I must.

332
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,458
Starlight kick!!

333
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,125
If you honestly think I'm going
fall for the same trick again,

334
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,958
you've got another
thing com-

335
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,250
President!

336
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,541
Haruhi, come with me! Run!

337
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,583
I don't think he has a
dark side. Could he?

338
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,625
Now that I think about it,
I don't know anything

339
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,083
about Tamaki-senpai's family.

340
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,958
One. Two--

341
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,291
Damn it. I refuse to put up with
his shenanigans any longer.

342
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,291
Four. Five.

343
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,625
You'll pay for this,
Tamaki Suou.

344
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,125
Six.

345
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,083
Did you get us lost, senpai?

346
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,666
We are lost, aren't we?

347
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,041
Look, Haruhi! I found a great
hiding place over here!

348
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,916
Yeah, we're totally lost.

349
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,625
So we're stranded til
someone finds us?

350
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,708
Great; it's a good thing
you made Kyoya-senpai "it".

351
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,500
Are you messing with me?

352
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,791
You know, I never thought I'd
be playing these silly games

353
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,125
again once I got
into high school.

354
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,083
But don't you think
this is fun?

355
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,916
I guess. But I haven't played
any of this stuff since I was

356
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,750
an elementary student.

357
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,208
Yeah? I see.

358
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,333
It's new to me. When I was
growing up I never really had

359
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,666
any friends that were my age.

360
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,125
My mother would get sick
very easily. I was always

361
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,458
worried about her so I didn't
go out and play much.

362
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,000
Instead I would do my best
to cheer her up.

363
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,583
I'd always sit beside her
and play the piano.

364
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,000
That's probably why now I love
playing these silly games

365
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,458
with all of you.

366
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,000
It's a lot of fun!

367
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,500
We should do this
again sometime.

368
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,125
I think so, too.

369
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,083
I'm writing the article!

370
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,416
But wait, Mr. President!

371
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,916
It's too dangerous to
write gossip about Suou!

372
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,583
You don't have any
evidence, sir!

373
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,583
Who needs evidence? All I
have to do is expose him

374
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,875
and everyone will see it! If
I set my mind to it,

375
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,291
I can imagine any number of
articles that would cause

376
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,208
a commotion among the idiots
at this academy.

377
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,083
I'm going to expose Tamaki
for the twit he is.

378
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,500
Hmm.

379
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,500
So, we were right all along.

380
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,541
You two.

381
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,708
Well, I guess it was
pretty obvious.

382
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,250
The boss is the only one
who hasn't caught on yet.

383
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,375
He can be really dense when
it pertains to anything

384
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,500
about himself.

385
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,333
I should warn you,
if you threaten him

386
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,916
there will be consequences.

387
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,333
Are you ready to have the
Hitachins and every other

388
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,250
club members' family
as your enemy?

389
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,250
I knew it! You're nothing
but lackies!

390
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,125
Tamaki's holding his parents'
power over all of you-

391
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,750
That's not true.

392
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,500
We don't hang out with
Tama-chan because of

393
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,083
his parents.

394
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,750
We love him. We all like
being around him and

395
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,541
that's why we
choose to be here.

396
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,625
He may be a hopeless idiot but-

397
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,833
Even so.

398
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,875
Kyoya. Let's start
a club together!

399
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:17,041
Why, hello there.
Haninozuka-senpai.

400
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,208
I know this is sudden but I
was wondering if you'd join

401
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,833
a new club
I'm starting?

402
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,416
Morinozuka-senpai!

403
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,458
You kids seem to have a lot
of free time.

404
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,000
If you ever get bored, you
should come join our new club!

405
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,166
Well?

406
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,458
What will you do?

407
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,833
Please leave Tama-chan
alone, okay?

408
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,875
I'll get you all! It's not
just about him anymore.

409
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,708
I'll write an article
that'll ruin all of you!

410
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,125
Go ahead, be my guest.

411
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,291
Although.

412
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,833
What do you think we should
do about this little disk?

413
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,291
You see, it's been here
since yesterday.

414
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,875
And it recorded everything.

415
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,291
President!

416
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,041
Just give
up already!

417
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:11,166
Let me explain it to you in
terms you can understand.

418
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,333
You would do well to remember
that the Otori Group

419
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,625
and the Hitachiin family
alone own enough stock

420
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,416
to remove your father
from his position

421
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,750
as president of the
Komatsuzawa Publishing Firm.

422
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,416
However. We would never
do something like that-

423
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,000
we are not like you.

424
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,375
What we strive for is
fundamentally different.

425
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,250
I found you!

426
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,791
Where's the
Newspaper Club?

427
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,291
They had to cancel.
Something came up.

428
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,375
They said they're
going to focus

429
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,083
on writing
respectable articles.

430
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,333
So maybe they'll get by
without having to shut down.

431
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,958
Oh, really?
That's good news.

432
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,750
Let's hurry back to the club
room and eat some cake!

433
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:53,791
Yeah.

434
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,833
That does sound good!
Cake! Cake!

435
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,541
Kyoya-senpai,
I was wondering.

436
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,958
Is the Suou family really
that big a deal around here?

437
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,916
Well. The foundation
of their business lies

438
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,166
in corporate finance,
but they do have some

439
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,750
extensive real estate as
well. You've heard of

440
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,166
The Roy Grand Hotel and the
Outo Theatre.

441
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,708
They also have a hand in
other things,

442
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,625
like school management
for example.

443
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,125
I didn't know that.
Which school?

444
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,500
Why, Ouran Academy.

445
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,541
You've been here long enough
that you should at least

446
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,708
know what the chairman of
the school board's name is.

447
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,125
You know,
if you think about it.

448
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,958
You're able to attend
school here because of

449
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,041
the financial aid you receive
from Tamaki's family.

450
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,458
You should be grateful to them.

451
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,125
Haruhi!

452
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,125
Hurry it up or we're going
to leave you!

453
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,125
I would hate for you to end
up lost again!

454
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,208
What happened? Haruhi's
gone missing?!

455
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,750
No, I just got a summer job
in Karuizawa.

456
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,833
Then my refreshing self
will come visit you!

457
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,416
Next time, "The Refreshing
Battle in Karuizawa".

458
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,541
The Ouran Host Club will
be waiting for you!

459
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:25,958
We'll see you then!
