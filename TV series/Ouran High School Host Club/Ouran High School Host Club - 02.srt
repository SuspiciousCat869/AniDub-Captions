1
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,916
I'm never gonna hear the
end of it if I show up late.

2
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,208
What's this? Where am I?

3
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,708
Welcome!

4
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,375
When I opened the door,

5
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,791
the whole place was decked
out like a tropical paradise.

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,083
Can you see this
from Heaven, Mom?

7
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,625
This is the club
I was forced to join.

8
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,125
"The Job of
a High School Host"

9
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,791
You finally made it,
Haruhi. You're so late.

10
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,041
I could be wrong but
my calendar says it's still

11
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,541
early spring.

12
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,416
Huddling under a kotatsu
table fearing the cold

13
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,791
is nonsense!

14
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,833
And besides the heating
system we have is the best.

15
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,916
Do you have a problem
with the way we run our club,

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Haruhi? Be careful
what you say.

17
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,041
You owe us eight million
yen, remember?

18
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,625
Gentlemen don't bundle up
in bulky clothing.

19
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,166
It may be chilly, early spring
out there in the real world,

20
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,041
but here at the club
we want to surprise our

21
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,833
chilly little kittens with
a warm, tropical paradise.

22
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,666
Oh yes! We've turned
this place into nirvana.

23
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,000
A balmy, tropical island
of everlasting summer!

24
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,041
That's funny cause I feel
a massive chill right now.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,833
Only those with excellent
social standing and those

26
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,791
from filthy rich families
are lucky enough to

27
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,041
spend their time here
at the elite, private school,

28
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,250
Ouran Academy.

29
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,083
The Ouran Host Club
is where the school's

30
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,541
handsomest boys, with too
much time on their hands,

31
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,458
entertain young ladies who
also have way too much time

32
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,083
on their hands. Just think
of it as Ouran Academy's

33
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,416
elegant playground for the
super-rich and beautiful.

34
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,625
What heartlessness!
Even with my lustrous skin,

35
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,333
shining like brilliant
ivory exposed by

36
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,541
my Balinese King outfit--

37
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,166
I'm no more than
a slave before my goddess.

38
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,916
I kneel before you
and swear my loyalty.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,208
Tamaki.

40
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,416
Lucky.

41
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,750
Oh wow.

42
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,500
Oh yes, I almost forgot
to mention to you ladies.

43
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:50,208
Next week the Ouran Host Club
is sponsoring a party.

44
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,041
We're throwing a party?

45
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,458
What kind of party
is it going to be?

46
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,291
Is it going to be formal?

47
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,916
Yes, in fact, we've rented
the school's largest hall.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,583
It's the perfect place
for dancing.

49
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,958
But I really wanted to spend
some alone time with you, Kaoru.

50
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,500
Don't be upset Hikaru.
I know exactly how you feel.

51
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,041
Oh wow! They're so sexy hot!

52
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,416
I can't believe it.
Oh my gosh.

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,750
The guests seem to be
even more worked up

54
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,750
than they usually are.

55
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,416
Showing some skin proves
popular with the ladies.

56
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,750
So, are you the one
who came up with this

57
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,541
tropical paradise idea?

58
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,375
I have no decision
making authority.

59
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,125
All of the club's policies
have been laid out

60
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,958
by the club's
king, Tamaki.

61
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,000
But, I guess there's
no harm in admitting

62
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,375
to casually slipping a Bali
photo book onto his desk.

63
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,791
So, he's the real brains
behind the operation.

64
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,291
Ta-da!

65
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,458
Oh you're so cute, Honey!

66
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,041
Hi ladies. I love these
Balinese flowers.

67
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,000
We had them flown in. Takashi!

68
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,083
There! Now we match!

69
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,375
They're covered in camellias!

70
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,291
I'm still thoroughly confused
by the two of them.

71
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,833
Um, Haruhi?

72
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,583
Aren't you going to wear
a tropical outfit like

73
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,708
the other boys?

74
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,958
I'd like to see that.

75
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,708
Well, no I, I just don't
think it's appropriate

76
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,291
to wear anything but early
spring attire in early spring,

77
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,958
you know?

78
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,375
But we have one ready
for you Haruhi!

79
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,000
I think you'll like it.
You and I are a pair!

80
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:15,750
No thanks.

81
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,833
Wow Haruhi.

82
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,916
You're really faithful to the
different seasons, aren't you?

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,375
I think that's great!

84
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,458
I hope we're lucky enough
that the cherry blossoms are

85
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,000
in full bloom on
the night of the party.

86
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,583
The two of us, dancing
among the cherry blossoms.

87
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,583
It's so dreamy.

88
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,458
You really think so?

89
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,625
You know ladies,
I think it's so cute when

90
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,083
you dream like that.

91
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,833
Excuse me.

92
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,708
I hate to disturb but
I think it's time for

93
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,500
the hosts to
switch clients.

94
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,666
Oh, I'm sorry.

95
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,875
You must be my next
appointment, Miss--?

96
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,125
My name's Kanako.
Kanako Kasugazaki.

97
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,791
You're even cuter
than I expected.

98
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,375
I've decided from now
on you're going to be

99
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,583
my new favorite host, Haruhi.

100
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,166
I can't take this anymore.

101
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,958
Hey boss, why don't you stop
eating that commoner's ramen

102
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,458
and come over here to help
us with the party planning.

103
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,458
Does it really bother you
that Princess Kasuga

104
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,875
has taken a liking to Haruhi?

105
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,208
He shouldn't be surprised.

106
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,250
She's had the illness for
a while now, hasn't she?

107
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,375
What illness?

108
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,875
She's got the
host-hopping disease.

109
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,666
AKA the never-the-same-boy
-twice disease.

110
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,291
Usually our customers
choose a favorite host

111
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,375
and then see them regularly.
However, Princess Kanako

112
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,791
tends to change her favorites
on a regular basis.

113
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,125
That's right!

114
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,250
Cause before she chose you
she was with Tama-chan!

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,625
Oh, so he's upset because
I took her from him.

116
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,500
Shut up! I couldn't care less!

117
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,166
I'm running out
of patience! Haruhi.

118
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,541
It's time you started
dressing like a girl!

119
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,666
I don't understand how you
could be so popular with

120
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,333
the ladies when
you yourself are a lady!

121
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,583
No one in the entire school
knows the truth except

122
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,041
for those of us here.

123
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,333
Yeah, she opted out
of taking gym classes.

124
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,875
And the attendance numbers
are all mixed together up,

125
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,416
so no one can tell.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,125
That's enough Haruhi.
Now you listen to Daddy.

127
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,958
Daddy wants you to go back
to the way you were!

128
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,166
Don't go blowing up my photos
without asking me first!

129
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,791
The more I look at this
picture the more amazed I am.

130
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,833
How could this possibly
become that?

131
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,375
The day before school
started one of the kids

132
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,833
in my neighborhood
got some gum in my hair.

133
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,666
It's a real pain to get gum
out of long hair so

134
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,041
I decided to cut it all off.
I didn't care if I looked

135
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,375
like a dude, you know?

136
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,541
A girl should never refer
to herself as a "dude'!

137
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,916
Momma! Haruhi's using those
dirty boy words again!

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,416
I'm sorry, but who is "Momma"?

139
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,750
Based on club position,
I assume it's me.

140
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,291
Look, I don't see what
you're crying about.

141
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,875
Working as a host I can pay
back more of my debt.

142
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,500
It'll never happen if I'm
just an errand boy.

143
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,958
Hate to change the subject
but do you have

144
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,666
formal dancing experience?
You'll need it at the party.

145
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,958
No but the party doesn't
have anything to do

146
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,291
with my quota, right? I'm not
interested in going to events

147
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,333
so if I could be excused--

148
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,875
Definitely not.

149
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,666
A refined gentleman
must know how to dance.

150
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,583
If you want to live the life
of a host that badly,

151
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,083
you're going to have to
show us how far

152
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,916
you're willing to go, Haruhi.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,541
I order you to master dancing
the waltz in one week

154
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,708
and you will demonstrate it
for us at the party or

155
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,958
I'll tell the entire
school that you're a girl

156
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,750
and knock you back
down to errand boy.

157
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,750
Quick, quick, slow.
Quick, quick, slow.

158
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,208
Good work, Haruhi.

159
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,916
Now on the "slow" you should
bring your feet together.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,375
Remember the gentleman
always leads and make sure

161
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,750
to look at the lady
you're dancing with.

162
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,375
Got it.

163
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,916
I'm so sorry,
Miss Kasugazaki!

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,166
It's okay, Haruhi.

165
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,000
Can I help you up? Like this?

166
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,500
Why so gloomy, boss?

167
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,291
I bet it's because
he wanted to be the one

168
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,958
Haruhi practices with.

169
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,916
I think you may be right
but he's way too tall

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,875
to stand in as a woman.

171
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,833
Thank you so much for allowing
me to practice with you.

172
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,125
I really appreciate it.

173
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,875
Oh, no problem. I heard
that you're not seeing

174
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,166
any customers today so that
you can practice dancing.

175
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,833
I'm glad I got to spend
this time alone with you.

176
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:25,916
Oh my! This is a new tea
set, isn't it? It's Ginori.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,958
Jinori?

178
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,250
You have a keen eye,
mademoiselle.

179
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,291
In fact, we just received
them yesterday.

180
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,333
We decided that it was
about time for the club

181
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,750
to upgrade its tea sets.

182
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,833
I see. What a
pretty color. Lovely.

183
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,500
You must really be
into tableware, huh?

184
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,708
Not really. I mean,
no, of course I'm not.

185
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,500
What ever would give you
that idea?

186
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,208
She obviously knows
a lot about it.

187
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,041
Why would she lie?

188
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,166
Hello! I'm here to deliver
with the new teacups

189
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,375
you ordered.

190
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,791
Thank you very much.

191
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,666
Every item that you've
chosen for us has been

192
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,250
extremely popular with the
ladies. I'm quite impressed.

193
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,583
Well, that's good to hear.

194
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,458
So, do you sell tea sets?

195
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,791
No, I'm just a regular student.
Can't you tell by the uniform?

196
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,708
Oh, Haruhi. You're so funny.

197
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,750
I can't blame you
for not knowing.

198
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,750
After all, he doesn't
really look like an heir to

199
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,583
a first class company.

200
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,250
First class company?

201
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,416
His family's business, the
Suzushima Trading Company,

202
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,708
deals primarily in the
importing of tableware.

203
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,958
They currently have the top
market share in the country.

204
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,916
Wow.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,791
So whenever something
exceptional comes in

206
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,625
we've asked him
to send it our way.

207
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,291
He has a great eye for fine
china. Don't you, Suzushima?

208
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:51,500
You think? I've still got
a lot to learn but thank you.

209
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:55,208
Aren't you leaving next month
to study abroad in England?

210
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,375
Yes, I am. Well,
I'd better go now.

211
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,916
So are you enjoying
the Host Club?

212
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,833
I get the feeling you and
that guy are kinda close.

213
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,916
Don't be ridiculous!
We hardly know each other!

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,958
What makes you
say that, Haruhi?

215
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,083
Now if you'll please
excuse me. Take care.

216
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,583
Haru-chan! Guess what?
They do know each other!

217
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,791
Suzushima is
Kasuga-chan's fiancé.

218
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,833
Kyoya, how long have
you known about this?

219
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,583
About the two of them
being engaged?

220
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,541
Well, as you know
I conduct general searches

221
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,083
on all of our customers.

222
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,791
The two of them were
childhood friends.

223
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,000
It seems that their engagement
was arranged by their parents.

224
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,416
I didn't think the
information would benefit us

225
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,958
so I disregarded it.

226
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,458
I see.

227
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,958
Toru Suzushima: Outstanding
grades, fair social status.

228
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,458
He's ordinary looking,
but he's reliable.

229
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,958
If I had to fault him
for anything--

230
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,083
He doesn't have
much presence.

231
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,083
And he's faint hearted.

232
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,791
So in other words, he's boring.

233
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,750
I had no idea they were so
merciless toward other guys.

234
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,833
Suzushima is a good boy. Right?

235
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,083
Yeah.

236
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,291
All right, everyone.

237
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,416
We'll have to work
on our strategy.

238
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,875
Which one?

239
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,083
Men, it is our responsibility
as members of

240
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,375
the elite Ouran Host Club
to make every girl happy!

241
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,208
It is so good to see you here
tonight, my little lambs.

242
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:32,166
The Ouran Host Club
would like to bid you--

243
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,416
Welcome.

244
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,208
As always, ladies, the Host
Club Members are here

245
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,750
for your entertainment.

246
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,916
So, we invite you to dance
to your heart's content.

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,583
Based on her dancing skills,
one lucky young lady

248
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,666
will be chosen as
tonight's queen.

249
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,583
The queen's reward will be a
passionate kiss on the cheek

250
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,500
from our King.

251
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,625
Well, good luck to you,
my darlings.

252
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,958
Haruhi, show some enthusiasm.

253
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,958
Well excuse me, you guys.
Sorry, I'm not used to this

254
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,208
sort of thing. I've only
ever gone to the festivals

255
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,458
in my neighborhood park.

256
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,916
I don't know if you can really
consider that a party or not.

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,708
Well since you're already here
you might as well get yourself

258
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,958
something to eat.
We've got quite a spread.

259
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:33,000
A spread? With fancy tuna?

260
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:33,500
Fan-

261
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,000
-cy

262
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,166
Tuna?

263
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,208
Get some fancy tuna
here right now!

264
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,250
Add some deluxe sushi.

265
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,291
Damn these filthy rich jerks.

266
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,291
Uh.

267
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:08,250
Hello Haruhi, I've been
looking all over for you.

268
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,541
Do you think maybe I could
have the next dance?

269
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,791
Yeah, of course you can.

270
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,958
Kasuga-chan is here.

271
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,083
Alright men, then let us
commence with our operation.

272
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,208
Roger!

273
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,208
What? Kidnapped?

274
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,583
There she is!

275
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,791
You didn't have
to be so forceful.

276
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,791
Never mind that.
Go get changed.

277
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,458
A little "accident" towards
the end of the night would be

278
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,250
quite thrilling.

279
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,750
And remember Haruhi, there
are only 20 minutes remaining

280
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,708
before the party
reaches its climax.

281
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,125
Suzushima is already
waiting for you

282
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,041
in the classroom
across the hall.

283
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,375
You have to ask him
how he feels, okay?

284
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,708
Uh, we know this is
the boss's strategy but

285
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,416
it's kind of unsettling.

286
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,166
Gentlemen. Here you all are.
What are you doing?

287
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,916
The guests are waiting for--

288
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,166
So, what do you think?

289
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,375
Wow, you look so cute!

290
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,333
My face feels heavy and it's
hard to walk in these shoes.

291
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,791
Good luck, Haruhi!

292
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,166
I can't believe
she's so pretty.

293
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,625
You're the one
who wrote this letter?

294
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,125
You're totally different
from what I imagined.

295
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,541
Letter?

296
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,291
"I'm in love-love! From
the first time I saw you

297
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,000
I've been head over
heels in love!"

298
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,250
"It's like my heart is stuck
in a never ending typhoon.

299
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,916
All these feelings of love keep
whipping around in my heart,

300
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,916
like the breaking waves! When
the typhoon's rising waters

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,500
come I want to rendezvous with
you on Noah's Ark! I do! I do!"

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,541
Who wrote such
a stupid letter?

303
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,125
'Scuze me. Have we met
somewhere before?

304
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,958
No! This is the first time
I've ever talked to you.

305
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,250
I'm sorry.

306
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,666
I'm flattered by your letter
but I'm afraid I don't

307
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,291
feel the same way.

308
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:32,041
You see, another girl
already has my heart.

309
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,958
Oh, well I didn't know
that you had a girlfriend.

310
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,125
Unfortunately,
she's not my girlfriend.

311
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,083
In fact, I think she's
completely over me.

312
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,541
In all honesty, she'd be
happier with someone

313
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,500
more self-confident than me.

314
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:50,000
Where exactly are you
taking me, Tamaki?

315
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,541
You know.

316
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,833
You're not the kind
of girl who's good at

317
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,666
manipulating others.

318
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,083
What do you mean by that?

319
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,958
I have you figured out, Kanako.
I know you're switching

320
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,041
from host to host to get his
attention and I've noticed

321
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,083
that you always look the
happiest gazing into a tea cup.

322
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,125
Hey! Check these out, Kanako.

323
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,791
So pretty!

324
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,000
There's a Wedgewood,
a Foley, Worcester.

325
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,916
Over here's a Ginori
and a Meissen.

326
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,791
Someday you're gonna be
my wife, Kanako,

327
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,833
so I'll tell you about
all of 'em, 'kay?

328
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,125
It's pointless. It doesn't
matter how hard I try,

329
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,291
he never notices me.

330
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,833
And now he's decided
to study abroad

331
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,291
without--without even
telling me.

332
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,208
That's why I decided
I need to change.

333
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:53,750
I want to see the world and
hopefully, become a better man.

334
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,208
I know it's selfish but I
wonder if she'll wait for me.

335
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:03,083
Yeah, you're right. That
is pretty selfish of you.

336
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,458
But maybe she would wait.

337
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,500
You'll never know if you
don't tell her how you feel.

338
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,416
You obviously have strong
feelings for her so why not

339
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,208
go ahead and talk to her?

340
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,833
I think once you decide to
change then you've already

341
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,750
began your
transformation.

342
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,291
Kanako.

343
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to
interrupt you two, I just--

344
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Kanako!

345
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,583
Kanako!

346
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:45,500
Looks like we just
made matters worse.

347
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,416
But he did go
running after her.

348
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,750
It's our responsibility,
as members of

349
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,541
the elite Ouran Host Club,
to make every girl happy.

350
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,625
Ladies and gentlemen.

351
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,000
It is now time for us to
begin the final dance of

352
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,875
this evening's festivities.

353
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,875
The last waltz of the
night has been chosen by

354
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,916
the host club for this couple.

355
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,333
Princess Kasuga?

356
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,875
May I have this dance?

357
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,041
Yes.

358
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,916
I love you, Kanako.

359
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,375
I've always loved you and
I want you to be my wife.

360
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,833
Tonight marks the end
of my host hopping.

361
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,666
May this awkward couple
be forever blessed!

362
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,916
And now we'll announce
the queen of the ball.

363
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,166
Congratulations Princess
Kanako Kasugazaki!

364
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,500
And for her reward, a kiss
on the cheek from the king!

365
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,666
You ready?

366
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,833
Haruhi Fujioka will stand
in for Tamaki!

367
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,958
Kyoya did say that a little
"accident" towards the end

368
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,500
of the night might make
the evening more thrilling

369
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,791
for everyone!

370
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,833
It's just on the cheek, right?
You should accept it.

371
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:17,625
It will commemorate your
graduation from host-hopping.

372
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,333
There's no way I can kiss her.

373
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,208
If you do it we'll cut
your debt by one-third.

374
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,250
Well it is just a peck
on the cheek.

375
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,541
Hey! You don't think this
is Haru-chan's first kiss,

376
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,666
do you?

377
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,958
What?

378
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,208
Wait Haruhi!

379
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,958
I never would've
thought that I'd end up

380
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,333
giving my first kiss
to another girl.

381
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,833
But it was such
an amazing night.

382
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,833
So I guess it's just as well.

383
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,666
If word gets out that I'm
really a girl I won't be able

384
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,500
to stay in the Host Club.

385
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:17,708
Don't you worry, Haruhi.

386
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:20,041
I will protect
your secret no matter what!

387
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,500
Next time, "Beware
the Physical Exam!"

388
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,500
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!
