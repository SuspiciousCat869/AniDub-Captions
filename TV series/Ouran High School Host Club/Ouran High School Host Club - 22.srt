1
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:52,791
Young Lord, we wish
you good morning.

2
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,791
Young Lord,
please return to us safely.

3
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,916
Please return to us safely.

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,666
Young Lord,
have a good day at work today.

5
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,916
Have a good day at work today.

6
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,708
How many times have I told ya?
I'm not goin' to work

7
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,750
I'm goin' to school,
you idiots!

8
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,458
Sorry, we got it mixed up again!

9
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,083
Young Lord, what about your car?

10
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,583
Forget about it. I'm gonna
walk to school today.

11
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,750
Tetsya. You gotta be more
careful about how you

12
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,708
speak to the
Young Lord, alright?

13
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,708
Especially 'cause
his glaring power's got

14
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,125
even more scary!

15
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,250
What do you wanna bet it's
cause he's got a beef with

16
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,375
some stupid kid at school?

17
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,333
Today's the day.

18
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,083
Takashi Morinozuka.

19
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,083
Welcome to the Host Club.

20
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,875
Tamaki, you're dressed
as Riyoma Sakamoto, right?

21
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,875
He's so wild and handsome!

22
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,666
Yeah, I'm handsome,
I'm wild, and I'm gonna

23
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,583
steal your hearts,
pretty ladies.

24
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,666
We love it when you talk
like a samurai, Tamaki!

25
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,625
Why's he speaking
in the Tosa dialect?

26
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,291
You know I never would've
thought that late Edo era

27
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,041
cosplay would be this popular.

28
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,958
C'mon you can't be serious.
That's like one of the basics.

29
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,250
There are plenty of girls
that find the late Edo era

30
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,208
totally fascinating.
Particularly the Shinsengumi.

31
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,541
And most of the girls who
like it are complete maniacs

32
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:27,916
about it!

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,041
Are they popular because
of the noble nature in which

34
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,541
they sacrificed their
young lives for their country?

35
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,250
Or could it be because
of their stoic determination?

36
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,708
Their choice to live out
their lives by the Bushido code?

37
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,250
Or could it be.

38
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,375
Don't die.

39
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,583
I'm done for, brother.
Let me go.

40
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,833
That we're intrigued because
the worship of this group

41
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,791
of renegade young men
is somewhat forbidden.

42
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,125
The Ikedaya Inn may be
well-known but it's only

43
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,541
because of Hijikata.
Just imagining him after

44
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,166
the battle at Tobafushimi;
his back to the north,

45
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,750
as he sorrowfully
wandered the streets of

46
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,791
his homeland attempting
to defend the honor of

47
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,333
the Shinsengumi all by himself.

48
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,416
I could eat three
giant bowls of rice!

49
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,083
That was one hell of
a history lesson, Renge.

50
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,833
Not having us cast ourselves in
specific roles was good advice.

51
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,958
Allowing the guests
to just be free to fantasize

52
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,875
on their own was truly
a brilliant idea, Renge.

53
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,208
I'm very impressed.

54
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,708
I told you it would work.

55
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:27,041
But you know,
I think dressing Haruhi

56
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,083
as Soji Okita was perfect.

57
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,000
He's wonderful as the handsome,
evanescent young swordsman!

58
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,708
Haruhi! Please don't die!
I couldn't handle it!

59
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,541
They're having a sale on pork
at the supermarket today.

60
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,375
I hope I can make it.

61
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,666
So Mori has to be Kai Shimada,
don't you think?

62
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,791
No way. He's totally Yamazaki.

63
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,500
I think it'd be super cool
if he was Soma!

64
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,625
Mori-senpai!

65
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,750
Why the sudden lunge?

66
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,250
You not getting
enough attention?

67
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,458
Please calm down, Mori-senpai!

68
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,458
I know you're upset that you
only have one line an episode.

69
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,041
We're &gt; through the
season and you haven't

70
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,458
had your own episode,
is that it? I'm sorry!

71
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,208
No.

72
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,333
We have a trespasser.

73
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,708
Takashi Morinozuka!

74
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,250
A surprise attack?

75
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,333
Senpai! Please take me on
as your apprentice!

76
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,250
"Mori-senpai Has an
Apprentice Candidate!"

77
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,125
Ritsu Kahsanoda,
1st year, Class D.

78
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,166
Heir to the 3rd-generation head
of the Kasanoda Syndicate,

79
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,791
the most powerful gang
in the Kanto area.

80
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,333
He was admitted this year into
Ouran Academy's high school.

81
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,416
He has long red hair,
a mean-looking appearance,

82
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,708
is reserved and
has few friends.

83
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,958
It is said, if your eyes meet
his you'll have bad dreams

84
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,708
for three months.
If you bump into him you'll

85
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,083
end up in the hospital.

86
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,958
And talking back to him
sends you to an early grave.

87
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,583
He is so feared by his
classmates that they call him

88
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,166
"the walking blizzard".

89
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,375
Seriously? But why would
a human weapon like yourself

90
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,458
wanna be Mori-senpai's
apprentice?

91
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,708
Well, because--look,
I may be tough but I'm not

92
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,166
a "human weapon".

93
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,666
I was just born with
a face that makes me

94
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,500
look mean all the time.

95
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,791
Well at least you're
aware of it, Casanova.

96
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,041
It's Kasanoda!

97
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,208
Bossa Nova?

98
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,958
I said it was Kasanoda!
Do you wanna die?

99
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,000
Man, he really is mean-looking!

100
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,333
Sorry 'bout that.

101
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,166
This always happens
'cause of the way I look.

102
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,666
I've always had this mean look,
ever since I was born.

103
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,416
Even when I was just
a tyke my dad would say--

104
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,166
Just you wait, my son's
gonna be the greatest gangster

105
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,375
of all time.

106
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,333
Young Lord, you gonna rumble?

107
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,958
Young Lord, you gonna rumble?

108
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,958
And so, ever since I was kid,
I've been taught how to be

109
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,875
the godfather of a gang.

110
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,625
Don't be too friendly talkin'
to other people.

111
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,791
They'll look down on you.

112
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,000
Ah.

113
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,416
You've got it all wrong.

114
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,375
AH!

115
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,541
See? Now you give it a try.

116
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,666
AH!

117
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:25,833
Not bad. Nice and gangsterish.
Now let's try this.

118
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,000
Ma!

119
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,083
That's not a gangster!
That's from that show

120
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,333
somethin'-or-other-Robo!

121
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,666
When am I ever gonna use
that stupid catchphrase?

122
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,250
My pops was a good teacher and
he made me a true gangster.

123
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,500
That's great and
all but everyone's

124
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,083
afraid to come near me.
Even my fellas are

125
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,333
scared of me.
So I'm all alone.

126
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,375
It's like they forget I'm
young, and sometimes I just

127
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,500
wanna play.
I wanna get out with my

128
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,333
fellas n' play a game
of kick the can.

129
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,500
A good game
of kankeri is awesome.

130
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,708
But I've been livin' the life
of a gangster and I don't

131
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,250
know how to interact
with regular people.

132
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,833
Aw, that poor guy.

133
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,166
Morinozuka-senpai, that's
why I need you to show me.

134
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,250
How do you manage
to have so many friends?

135
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,458
When you're just
as mean-looking as me?

136
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,958
You're expressionless, distant,
and you hardly ever talk.

137
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,125
Plus you've got
a mug that looks like

138
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,125
a watchdog from hell.
So how come you've

139
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,208
got so many friends? What're
you doin' that I'm not?

140
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,000
Please, teach me your secrets!
I'm begging you!

141
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,708
Hey Takashi, are you okay?

142
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,500
I'm just a little lightheaded.

143
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,833
What now, boss?

144
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,708
Don't you think we should
do something about this?

145
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,208
Just leave him alone,
don't get involved.

146
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,791
Like he said, he wants to be
Mori-senpai's apprentice.

147
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,708
So that means, Mori-senpai
decides what to do.

148
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,208
This isn't something
that any of us should

149
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,875
be interfering with.

150
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,166
Tamaki.

151
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,833
Well, in that case, since
you insist Mori-senpai, I,

152
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,166
Tamaki Suou,
promise you, I will do

153
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,916
whatever I can to assist you.

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,833
Yeah, right. He wanted
to get involved so badly

155
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,791
he couldn't bear it.

156
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,625
Now lift your head,
Bossa Nova.

157
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,125
Listen, it's Kasanoda.

158
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,291
From now on you may address me
as king, okay, Bossa Nova?

159
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,375
That's not my name!

160
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,708
Are you listening
to me, Bossa Nova?

161
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah.

162
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,125
There are many differences
between you and our

163
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,250
beloved Mori-senpai,
but there is also

164
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,833
one very definitive thing
that you are lacking and

165
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:25,083
that is a lovely item!

166
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,500
A lovely item?

167
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,833
Bossa Nova, I would like
to introduce you to--

168
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,291
--a lovely item
named Mitsukuni!

169
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,458
Sure, Mori-senpai may be
kind of mean looking and

170
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,958
he may seem distant
when you first meet him

171
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,500
but what if we put
Mitsukuni on his shoulders?

172
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,666
Suddenly it's like
he's a forest teddy-bear

173
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,541
that all the
little animals adore.

174
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,000
In addition, this lovely item
also plays up Mori-senpai's

175
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,833
strong and silent character.

176
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,500
Even without saying anything,
just by placing Honey-senpai

177
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,666
next to him people begin to
have a new found admiration

178
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,000
for Mori-senpai.

179
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,541
Suddenly he's seen in a
positive light as a nice,

180
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,166
quiet, young gentleman.
That's the plan.

181
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,291
I'm not exaggerating
when I say most of

182
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,666
Mori-senpai's charm
is directly related

183
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,333
to his friend Honey-senpai.

184
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,625
Yeah, you're right!

185
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,583
Now that you mention it,
Mori-senpai--

186
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,250
--doesn't really do anything.

187
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,625
Yeah, his position's
totally a bust.

188
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,291
Takashi.

189
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,958
Have you really been
using me this entire time?

190
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,916
I'm sorry, but Honey-senpai
is on a long-term lease

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,208
to Mori-senpai right now so
I can't let you borrow him.

192
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,291
Is Tama-chan telling the truth?
Are you renting me?

193
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,041
Don't worry, I'll come up with
something to take his place.

194
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,791
So, the next thing
we need to discuss--

195
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,208
--is your disturbing
"Yankee" fashion sense.

196
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,583
Now Hitachiin Brothers.

197
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,916
Sir!

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,916
It's your job to make
this man more fashionable.

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,041
Roger!

200
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,875
Thanks for cleanin' up, Tetsuya.

201
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,041
Oh. Young Lord, welcome home.
How was your da--?

202
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,750
Welcome home, Young Lord.

203
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,708
Yeah, welcome home, Young Lord.

204
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,750
Uh-huh.

205
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,458
Young Lord, what the
hell's going on?

206
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,291
Somethin' happen
at school today?

207
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,916
Wait. Young Lord.

208
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,666
Damn it! This is
completely wrong, ain't it?

209
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,041
Those jerks lied to me!

210
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,166
You tellin' me that kid
is the 4th head of

211
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,958
the Kasanoda Syndicate?

212
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,125
So what are we gonna do now?
I mean we can't go

213
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,000
bustin' into their estate.

214
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,583
We'll get him at school
tomorrow. We gotta make sure

215
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,958
that punk pays
for what he's done.

216
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,375
It's getting' dark out here.
Looks like it's gonna rain.

217
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,833
Uh-oh. Then I hope the Young
Lord took his umbrella today.

218
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,625
Big brother, Morinozuka!

219
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,458
I just wanted
to say good mornin'.

220
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,625
Good mornin' to you,
Bossa Nova!

221
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,791
Right back at cha,
Haninozuka-senpai!

222
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,125
Back at cha.

223
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,166
Want me to carry your bag
to your classroom, senpai?

224
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,041
That's okay. I can manage.

225
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,250
What the hell are you--?

226
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,250
Mori, you're not hurt, are you?

227
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,250
You okay, Morinozuka?

228
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,083
Who would do
something like this?

229
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,000
Hey, are you okay?

230
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,416
Yeah.

231
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,750
Everybody loves him
even though he's scary lookin'.

232
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,416
Nevermind that,
I've got bigger things

233
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,916
to worry about.

234
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,083
Huh? Somebody's out
to get Mori-senpai?

235
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,416
No doubt about it. I was
there and saw everything.

236
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,291
He's obviously gotten
on somebody's bad side.

237
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,875
Nah, that's impossible.

238
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,833
There's no way Mori-senpai would
ever be on someone's bad side.

239
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,791
How can you be so sure?
You don't know that!

240
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,875
Don't you worry your pretty,
little head about that.

241
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,666
"Operation Bossa Nova's
total image make-over"

242
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,625
is in full-effect
as of right now!

243
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,875
Yes, sir!

244
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,500
Hold on! What the hell
are you talkin' about?

245
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,583
Whaddya mean you're startin' 

246
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,958
"right now"? You tryin'
to pretend that

247
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,583
yesterday never happened?

248
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,875
Thanks to yesterday's
"makeover", people were even

249
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,125
more afraid of me
than they usually are!

250
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,375
Now hold on a second.
Let me explain, Bossa Nova.

251
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,083
We all support you
and we're behind you

252
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,666
one hundred percent.

253
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,625
Yesterday, the twins were just
getting a little carried away.

254
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,375
I hope you'll forgive them.

255
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,791
They support me?

256
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,625
I'm sorry. I will follow
your lead from here on out.

257
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,458
All right, so does
anyone have any ideas?

258
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,541
What should we do
about his look?

259
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,208
Hey Casanova?

260
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,541
Just thought I'd warn you--
I wouldn't put too much faith

261
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,166
in that bunch if I were you.

262
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,583
Well thank you but
Morinozuka recommended

263
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,666
these guys to me.
Besides, I don't have

264
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,125
much of a choice,
without their help

265
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,208
I got nothin'.

266
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,083
Hey, I don't think
I've met you before.

267
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,291
What was your name?

268
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,791
I'm Haruhi Fujioka.
We're both 1st-Years.

269
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,791
Just like you, I was admitted
when I got to high school.

270
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,250
Guess we're buddies.

271
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,791
Buddies?

272
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,750
So Haruhi, do you like
to play kick the can?

273
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,625
Well, um, to be honest,
it's not my favorite thing

274
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,916
in the world.

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,583
But you know--

276
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,625
--it might be fun
once in a while.

277
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,666
What is it?

278
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,916
He reminds me of a chick.

279
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,916
Bossa Nova!

280
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,166
Yes?

281
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,250
I think we've finally
come up with something

282
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,333
that'll change
your "tough guy" image.

283
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,750
A cat-monster.

284
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,375
Well that didn't work.
I don't know what went wrong.

285
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,208
Renge said the kitty ears
were all the rage!

286
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,083
She said that they were
a perfect lovely item!

287
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,458
What could've happened?

288
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,250
Be realistic. Putting kitty
ears on him isn't going

289
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,750
to affect how people
perceive him.

290
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,333
He still looks mean.

291
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,041
No kiddin', that was
pretty lame, boss.

292
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,791
For real. If you're going
to take it that far--

293
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,458
--you might as well go
all the way and make him

294
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,666
a kitty-eared maid!

295
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,791
Are you guys making fun of me?

296
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,458
Sorry to bother you but
is the Young Lord Kasanoda

297
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,375
in here?

298
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,958
So here you are.

299
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,375
Sir, it's no big deal.
You can do whatever you want

300
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,583
in your spare time.

301
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,458
What? Do you think this
is a hobby of mine?

302
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,541
Damn it! I can't
take this anymore!

303
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,000
Young Lord? Young Lord!

304
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,416
It's like they forget
I'm young and sometimes

305
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,333
I just wanna play.

306
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,875
I wanna get out with
my fellas n' play a game

307
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,291
of kick the can.

308
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,125
Maybe an image change isn't
really what Casanova needs.

309
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,791
I think you're right.

310
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,166
I sure hope he
realizes it soon.

311
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,250
Kasanoda is always
in such a bad mood.

312
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,208
I know! He's so scary!

313
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,125
They say you can't
look him in the eye.

314
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,750
Why am I always so--?

315
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,458
Here ya go. I brought
you somethin' to eat.

316
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,541
Now let me see how that
wing of yours is doin'.

317
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,708
Hey, it's lookin' pretty good!

318
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,250
Is that a sparrow?

319
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,833
Haruhi? What're you doin' here?

320
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,041
So what happened to him?
Your sparrow?

321
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,708
I saw it fall from it's nest
the other day. I could tell

322
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,750
it was hurt so I
took it to the vet.

323
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,333
They said he'd
be fine in no time.

324
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,708
So, uh, do you mind
if I feed it?

325
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,791
Go ahead.

326
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,541
I'm Haruhi Fujioka.
We're both 1st-Years.

327
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,166
Guess we're buddies.

328
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,583
You know, this guy doesn't seem
to be afraid of me at all.

329
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:21,500
He's got such big,
dark eyes and sparkly.

330
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,416
He really is like a chick.

331
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,333
Chicks are especially afraid of
me. I've never had the chance

332
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,041
to talk to a girl
like this before.

333
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,625
Holy crap! What's gotten
into me? What the hell

334
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,125
am I thinking? Haruhi's a dude!

335
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,541
Look out!

336
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,041
It flew away.

337
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,250
It flew away.

338
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,916
Haruhi, what happened?

339
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,375
That's not blood, is it?

340
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,291
Would you calm down?
It's just a little paint.

341
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,083
Hey are you sure you're
all right, Fujioka?

342
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,500
Let go of me, you bastard!

343
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,708
Damn it! You big behemoth!

344
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,583
You're playin' dirty, Kasanoda!
First you go and kidnap

345
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,500
our gang boss's kid and then you
make us deal with your damn

346
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,333
musclebound lackies?
We know that you

347
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,750
kidnapped the kid.
Just give him back, now!

348
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,333
We've heard enough outta you!
We'll shut you up!

349
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,916
Tying tying tying tying tying!

350
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,500
What the hell is goin' on here?

351
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,958
Don't you get it?

352
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,458
See Takashi wasn't
on anyone's bad side.

353
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,750
These guys were after you.

354
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,583
Until we caught them,
we decided not to

355
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,041
say anything to you

356
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,583
Because we didn't want you
to have to mess with them.

357
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,708
I can't believe it.
So, you helped me?

358
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,583
But how come?

359
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,166
We can tell who the bad guys
are by lookin' at 'em.

360
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,250
I should probably go back
and change clothes.

361
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,083
Want us to come help you?

362
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,791
Drop dead.

363
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,250
You dumbasses!

364
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,333
Sonny!

365
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,291
Shut up! You've
said enough today.

366
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,750
Don't you get it? The reason
I left was cause I was

367
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,583
sick of hangin' out
with the likes of you.

368
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,041
Now get lost, ya hear me?

369
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,708
Tetsuya, what's goin' on?

370
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,333
I'm sorry I've kept this
from you, sir.

371
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,583
I'm Tetsuya Sendo. I am
the son of the godfather

372
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,208
of the Sendo Syndicate.

373
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,541
But I've always been opposed
to the cutthroat way

374
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,833
the Syndicate goes
about handling it's business.

375
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,625
One rainy day about a
year ago my old man and

376
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,750
I got into a fight and
I ran away from home.

377
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,041
I've never felt as anxious
as I did that day.

378
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,875
It was terrible.
I had nowhere to go and

379
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,000
the people who passed me on
the street just ignored me.

380
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,041
They pretended like I
wasn't even there.

381
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,166
And that's when I met you,
Young Lord.

382
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,416
The second I saw you
I knew exactly what kind

383
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,875
of person you were.

384
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:08,291
After that, when I decided
to join the Kasanoda Syndicate,

385
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,000
you kindly accepted me.

386
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,000
Young Lord, I know that
you're more self-conscious

387
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,250
and awkward than most people
but I also know that you're

388
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,416
more kind-hearted
than most people.

389
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,458
And it's not just me, everybody
in the whole syndicate knows it.

390
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,958
They just don't say anything
cause it would embarrass you.

391
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,500
I, Tetsuya Sendo, realized
that I wanted to become

392
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,833
more like you.
That's why I cut all ties

393
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,708
to the Sendo Syndicate
and instead joined

394
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,458
the Kasanoda Syndicate.
I hope, Young Lord,

395
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,958
that you will allow me
to remain by your side.

396
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,416
Oh, I almost forgot.

397
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,958
Your umbrella.

398
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,500
The weather was lookin' bad so
I figured you might need it.

399
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,666
We don't want our
Young Lord catchin' a cold.

400
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,250
Everyone would worry.

401
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,375
Who would've thought--

402
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,166
I'll just keep that with me.

403
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah.

404
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,750
What a great story!
It's so touching!

405
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,083
I should apologize to Fujioka.
After all, it is my fault

406
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,541
he got paint on him.

407
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,583
Haru-chan went back to the
club room to change clothes.

408
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,458
Yeah? Thanks a lot.
I'll be right back.

409
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:24,583
'K. Hey Young Lord, think we
can play kick the can later?

410
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,625
Yeah!

411
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,416
We did a good thing, guys.

412
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,625
What're you talking about?
You didn't do anything, Boss.

413
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,333
Don't any of you care that
Kasanoda went to see Haruhi

414
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,916
who is changing clothes?

415
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,083
Hey, Fujioka?

416
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,250
Aw man, maybe he's
in the prep room.

417
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,000
Fujioka?

418
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,833
Hey, you okay? I'm sorry--

419
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,166
Get out!

420
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,083
Ma--

421
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,583
Ma!

422
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,541
Bossa Nova's started visiting
the Host Club as a guest!

423
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,500
And he asks for Haruhi
every single time!

424
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,333
If Bossa Nova starts
chasing after Haruhi--

425
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:19,666
Do something, boss!

426
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,041
Next time, "Tamaki's
Unwitting Depression!"

427
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,791
Ouran High School Host Club
does not need any

428
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,125
male guests coming in
next week! Ya got that?
