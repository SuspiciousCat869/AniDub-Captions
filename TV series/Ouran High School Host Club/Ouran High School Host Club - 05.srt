1
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,958
Do you remember the first
time we played that game?

2
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,791
It was so long ago.

3
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,750
Hey! You wanna make
a snowman with me?

4
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,291
Which one of us
are you talking to?

5
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,666
To both of you, silly.

6
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,458
There's nobody here
named "Both of you".

7
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:03,750
Okay, then I'm talking
to Hikaru and Kaoru.

8
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh really?

9
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,708
Which of us is Kaoru?

10
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,958
And which of us is Hikaru?
Can you tell?

11
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,333
Let's all play the
"Which one is Hikaru" game!

12
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:26,083
So, can you tell which one
of us is Hikaru?

13
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,375
Well, it's hard to say.

14
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,375
You're identical!

15
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,375
Many ladies have tried
to tell us apart, but so far

16
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,583
none have succeeded.

17
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,625
That's the dumbest game
I've ever heard of.

18
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,791
What? Have you got
a problem with it, Haruhi?

19
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,083
Not really, I just don't
understand why the two of you

20
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,625
are so popular.

21
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,041
That's not very nice.

22
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,666
I'm disappointed.

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,791
Apparently you don't
understand the merits of

24
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,375
having a pair of twins as
members of the Host Club.

25
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,875
Listen up. Having a couple
of good-looking guys

26
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,958
with homosexual tendencies
earns the club high points.

27
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,041
It also helps if the
two struggle between

28
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,291
their attraction and
their friendship.

29
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,666
And in our case, because
we're twins, our relationship

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,708
is taboo and therefore
more intriguing.

31
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,791
And besides, who hasn't
fantasized about twins?

32
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,916
Having two loves is better
than one, don't you think?

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,125
It's a young woman's
romantic fantasy.

34
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,125
Well. Um, yeah, you're right.

35
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,166
I can't take it!

36
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,875
Hikaru! Kaoru!

37
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,375
When I gave you control
of the club's website

38
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,541
I did so on one condition-
that you'd take it seriously!

39
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,708
We take our job
very seriously, boss.

40
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,208
In fact, last night we
worked on it 'til dawn!

41
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,166
Is this what you worked
so hard to create?

42
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,375
You look great,
Haru-chan!

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,625
Tell me when!

44
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,750
When did you take
naked pictures of Haruhi?

45
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,875
Yes, that pose is perfect, and
your expression is beautiful.

46
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,458
Once we're done with this
shoot, we'll let you have all

47
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:10,625
the fancy tuna you want. Fancy
tuna, as much as you want.

48
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,250
You bribed her, didn't you?

49
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,083
You're imagining things.

50
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,875
It's obvious that the
photo's been altered.

51
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,041
It was photoshopped?

52
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,250
We did a pretty good job, huh?

53
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,000
We've got some major
photoshopping talent.

54
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,083
You idiots! That's
a waste of your skills!

55
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,041
Have you no shame?

56
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,541
But if you're going
to do it anyway,

57
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,291
can you photoshop her into
this idol photo-book? Please?

58
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,583
Don't be ridiculous,
boss. Why don't you just--

59
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,166
--ask her if she would wear
an outfit like one of those.

60
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,750
I never thought to ask her.

61
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,583
What do you think
about this, my dear?

62
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,625
What're you doing
with that dress?

63
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,208
He looks so handsome!

64
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,625
Yeah, he does but I have
to agree with Tamaki.

65
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,375
I'd love to see what
Haruhi looked like if he

66
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,208
dressed as a girl!

67
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,500
Oh, he's so cute,
I'm sure he'd look great

68
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,500
no matter what you put him in.

69
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,083
Now cut it out.

70
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,708
No more making weird
pictures of me, you got that?

71
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,208
Just what do you guys
take me for anyway?

72
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,166
Isn't that obvious?
You're our toy.

73
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,166
The Twins Fight!

74
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,458
As we were saying,
in order to entertain oneself

75
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,291
in this otherwise
boring life-

76
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,250
-one must find himself
stimulating toys.

77
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,583
I am not your toy, okay?

78
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,916
You want a toy?

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,541
Toys, toys. If you like
toys then you should

80
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,250
come and visit my
Black Magic Club.

81
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,166
We've opened
a marketplace that boasts

82
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,916
black magic items
from across the globe.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,041
We're also holding mass
around the clock.

84
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,208
If you visit right now,
I'll even throw in

85
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:58,625
a free curse doll, you can have
Belzenef as your free gift.

86
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,250
Why's he talking to us
through a crack in the door?

87
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,125
Wait a second, has that
door always been there?

88
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,916
Nekozawa-senpai likes to hide.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,875
He doesn't really care
for brightly-lit places.

90
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,166
Don't get involved
with that guy, Haruhi.

91
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,250
If you do, you'll end up
being cursed.

92
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,166
Do you have any basis for that?

93
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,041
Yes. It happened during
final exams at the end

94
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,166
of the last school year.

95
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,583
It's terrifying just
to talk about it.

96
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,708
Good morning, Tamaki.

97
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,958
Good morning!

98
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,416
On that fateful day.
I accidentally stepped on

99
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,125
that weirdo Nekozawa's
cursed doll, Belzenef.

100
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,916
Afterward, I took my exam
and the entire test

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,666
was written in some strange
lettering. I looked to the

102
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,958
others around me for help and
realized I knew none of them!

103
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,875
I was all alone in
a different dimension!

104
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,291
Scary!

105
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,041
Did that really happen to you?

106
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,625
That only happened
because you were so scared

107
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,958
you accidentally walked into
the Beginning Greek class

108
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,333
and took their exam.

109
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,958
No! It was a curse!
I know it was because

110
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,833
three days later I woke up and
my legs were as heavy as lead!

111
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,458
Just how do you explain that?

112
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,250
Your legs were heavy
because you ran a marathon

113
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,166
the day before, remember?

114
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,375
You shouldn't underestimate
the dark powers of Belzenef

115
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,458
the curse doll.

116
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,291
All you have to do is write
the name of someone

117
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,625
you hate on his back. Then
that person is certain to come

118
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:29,250
face-to-face with misfortune.

119
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,333
Wow, this guy really
is dark in more ways than one.

120
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,041
Supposedly he hates bright
lights, I wonder what

121
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,791
he'll think of this.

122
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,666
How on earth could you
do such a thing?

123
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,541
Obviously the two of you
don't know the true terror

124
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,333
of black magic!

125
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,333
Uh, I am so bored.

126
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,875
Isn't there anything fun
we can do around here?

127
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:04,250
My dignity as the club's
leader is being ignored.

128
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,791
Hey, Haruhi! We've got
a favor to ask you.

129
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,666
What is it?

130
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,416
The next time we get a day off-

131
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,541
-can we come over
to your place to hang out?

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,333
Why would you wanna do that?

133
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,208
We're curious. We want
to see where you live.

134
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:18,875
No way.

135
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,166
Aw! Pretty please?

136
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,291
No way. You guys're
just gonna make fun of me.

137
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,125
No matter how much we beg you?

138
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,333
No way.

139
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,791
I too have been thinking
that it's about time

140
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,416
I pay my respects to our
beloved Haruhi's family.

141
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,375
No way in hell, Senpai.

142
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,708
We can settle this
with a game!

143
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,125
If you can't pick out
which one of us is Hikaru,

144
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,166
then your penalty will be
the two of us coming over

145
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,333
to your house later tonight.

146
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,333
Okay, so which one
of us is Hikaru?

147
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,000
This one's Kaoru;
this one's Hikaru.

148
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,375
Uh-oh! You got it wrong!

149
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,833
No, I know I'm right.

150
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,750
You guys may look alike
but you're very different.

151
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,083
How'd you do that, Haruhi?

152
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,250
Whenever they wear those hats
to cover which way they part

153
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,833
their hair, it's practically
impossible to try and

154
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,375
figure out which twin is
Hikaru and which one is Kaoru.

155
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,041
How can you tell
them apart?

156
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:22,875
Well, how do I put it? It's
kinda difficult to explain.

157
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,333
But Hikaru's speech and
actions make him come across

158
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,666
a little more
mischievous than Kaoru.

159
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,416
I'm sorry, Hikaru!
I don't mean to laugh.

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,666
Well, I don't see
what's so funny.

161
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,625
I'm honest, I speak my mind
and I don't hold back.

162
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,375
It's sneaky people like Kaoru
who are the trouble makers.

163
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,833
Don't turn this on me, Hikaru.

164
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,083
After all, I'm the one who's
always going along with

165
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,500
all of your selfish games.

166
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,916
I may suggest them
but you're the one who

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,708
really gets into them, Kaoru.
If you hate it so much

168
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,583
then why don't you just stop?

169
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,625
Because I'd hate to see you
make an ass out of yourself

170
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,458
in front of everyone. It was
your idea to call Haruhi

171
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,458
our toy, but I noticed you were
quick to make a pass at her.

172
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,708
Admit it Hikaru. You're
actually in love with Haruhi,

173
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,208
aren't you?

174
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,875
What?

175
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,208
You've got it all wrong,
Kaoru! Man, you're such

176
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,625
a freakin' idiot!

177
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah! There are some things
in this world

178
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,250
that must never be said!

179
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,333
Why would I fall for her? I
mean she looks like a tanuki!

180
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,833
How dare you call her
a raccoon dog!

181
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,583
You're gonna
pay for that!

182
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,500
Awesome! This is just perfect!

183
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,500
Our beloved Haruhi is in
the middle of a beautiful

184
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,541
yet poignant four-sided
romantic relationship!

185
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,541
And to make it even
more exciting two of

186
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:46,375
Haruhi's admirers are
twins, torn apart by love!

187
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,166
Just the thought of it could
make me eat three bowls

188
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,750
of rice!

189
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,958
Oh butt out, otaku.

190
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,083
You guys are meanies!
You shouldn't say

191
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,500
something like that
to your manager!

192
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,583
But Renge, I thought you had
feelings for Haruhi, as well?

193
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,666
Oh, I do, but I have
no problem with Haruhi

194
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,416
having a homosexual
relationship on the side.

195
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,791
I'm confused, I thought
that you had decided

196
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,291
to go back home
to France, Renge.

197
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,583
Well, I was going to start up
a host club of my own but,

198
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,666
I don't think France is ready
for a host club just yet.

199
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,666
Cut it out already!

200
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,250
You're the one who's always
crawling into my bed!

201
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,791
Talk about annoying!

202
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,250
I only do that cause
you look lonely.

203
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,125
I wouldn't choose to sleep
in your bed, you idiot!

204
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,125
Who are you calling an idiot?

205
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,875
You're the one
who sucks at math!

206
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,375
Oh yeah? Well,
you're failing your

207
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,083
foreign language classes,
you big dummy!

208
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,875
The way you grind
your teeth is deafening!

209
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,583
At least I don't toss and turn
so much that I fall out of bed!

210
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,250
Sex pixie!

211
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,166
Sicko!

212
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,541
Your mama wears
too much makeup!

213
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,541
That's it! We're over!

214
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,625
Hey Haruhi!

215
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,958
Good Morning.

216
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,083
Hikaru. What in the world
happened to your hair?

217
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,416
Why is it dyed pink?

218
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Cause pink suits me.
Don't you think it's cute?

219
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,625
From now on I'm
the pink haired twin.

220
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,000
I didn't want to be mistaken
for that Kaoru for

221
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,958
the rest of my life, you know?

222
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,416
Good morning, Haruhi.

223
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,583
So Kaoru's
the blue twin?

224
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,291
I was finally able to sleep
all by myself last night

225
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,083
but I ended up
having a nightmare.

226
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,208
I dreamt that my stylist
had dyed my hair pink.

227
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,625
It was so garish and
ridiculous looking-

228
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,333
I woke up screaming.

229
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll have the A lunch.

230
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,041
No!

231
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,208
Give me the B pasta
and the D salad!

232
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,666
I'll take the F cappellini with
the barbarie duck. Hold on!

233
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,250
Make that a foie gras
in périgueux sauce!

234
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,458
Stop copying me! Why don't
you just leave me alone?

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,458
Amazing. Perfect unison
even when fighting.

236
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,541
I was wondering what
all the fuss was about.

237
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,291
I can't believe the two
of you are still fighting.

238
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,791
You're a disgrace
to the host club.

239
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,125
Hey, look who it is.

240
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,750
Oh! I love them!

241
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,500
I've never seen them
all together like that!

242
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,208
We've had enough of this!
You're both to blame

243
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,875
for this fight.

244
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,750
Hika-chan and Kao-chan I
want you to make up and go

245
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,541
halfsies on this cake, 'kay?

246
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,791
But I wanna have a piece
too so I guess we're gonna

247
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,125
have to go thirdsies. We're
not gonna be able to split

248
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,916
the strawberry on top, though.
What should we do? Maybe I

249
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,750
should just take it. After all,
strawberries are my favorite!

250
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,750
I forgot to ask.
Hika-chan, Kao-chan,

251
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,500
do you like strawberries?

252
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,333
You're just making
it worse. Leave them alone.

253
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,791
Oh, Haruhi! I didn't
expect to run into you

254
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,583
in the dining hall.

255
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,750
I was worried about those two
so I followed them here

256
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,833
without even thinking. I
always bring a boxed lunch,

257
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,375
and I was just gonna
eat it in my classroom.

258
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,041
A boxed lunch?

259
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,083
Here darling,
your boxed lunch.

260
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,250
I hope you're
not too embarrassed,

261
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,625
but I decided to make it
in a heart shape for you.

262
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,000
I love you!

263
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't care if my boxed
lunch is in an embarrassing

264
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,541
heart shape! I will eat it!

265
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,083
I have no idea what
you're talking about,

266
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,750
but it's evident
that your fantasies

267
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,375
are completely incoherent.

268
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,750
Haruhi, you want
to sit here with me?

269
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:04,958
Uh okay.

270
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,166
So what's that?
What'd you bring for lunch?

271
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,500
Yesterday's leftovers,
and a rolled omelet.

272
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,541
You wanna switch with me?
I had to order

273
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,958
something different than Kaoru
so I ended up with stuff

274
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,250
I don't really like.

275
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,291
That's fine with me.

276
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,708
This is really magnificent.
I've never tried

277
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,625
anything like this before.

278
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,541
Delicious. It's delicious,
isn't it Haruhi?

279
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,708
I'm so glad you like it. I want
you to eat like that every day.

280
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,166
Well played, Hikaru.

281
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,333
As a reward, I'd like
to trade you my lunch for

282
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,458
your boxed lunch.

283
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,166
No way.

284
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,125
C'mon, trade with me.

285
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:49,958
Forget about it.

286
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,416
So Haruhi, is that any good?

287
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,541
How would you like
to taste mine?

288
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,833
Here.

289
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,791
Quit butting in.
Get lost, Kaoru.

290
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,791
I think I'm gonna eat
in my classroom, after all.

291
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,166
Looking at the numbers, if
this situation isn't resolved,

292
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm afraid we're going to have
to stop offering our brotherly

293
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,708
love package. We're down
one pair of loving brothers.

294
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,833
Oh, Haruhi, I just want you
to know there's no reason

295
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,500
for you to feel responsible.
Even though it was

296
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,458
your tactless comment that
started this whole feud between

297
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,583
the twins in the
first place, right?

298
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,958
Clearly he blames me for this.

299
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,833
It's weird for Hika-chan and
Kao-chan to be fighting

300
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,000
like this. It's never
happened before.

301
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,958
They've never fought before?

302
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,625
I've known Hika-chan and
Kao-chan since we were

303
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,208
in pre-school. We weren't in the
same year, so I never really

304
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,375
got to talk to them, but I
remember that the two of them

305
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,666
always played together.

306
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:23,500
Yeah, that's true. I mean I've
only known the twins since

307
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:28,083
they were in middle school but
they definitely stood out.

308
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,583
It seemed like they kept
everyone at a distance except

309
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,791
each other. Believe it or not,
they were even more warped

310
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,208
back then. When you stop
and think about it,

311
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,833
maybe this fight is
a good thing for them.

312
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,583
Maybe it means that the twins
are expanding their horizons

313
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:52,291
a bit. We should just leave them
alone and let them work it out.

314
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:58,875
Who knows? Maybe it is a turn
for the better. But if this

315
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,791
really is their first fight,
they probably need someone

316
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:05,083
to tell them when it's time
to give in and call it quits.

317
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,250
And if they've never fought
before, would they even know

318
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,125
how to make up?

319
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,833
Don't you guys think that
maybe, it's time you give up

320
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,333
all this fighting?
It's driving me insane!

321
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,833
What'd you say?
It's driving you insane?

322
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,000
You've got to be kidding me-
how do you think I feel

323
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,500
right now? Every time I look
in the mirror I see his face.

324
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,750
I'm sick and tired of
constantly being mistaken

325
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,791
for you, Kaoru! The truth
is I hate your guts!

326
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,041
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

327
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,416
In fact, I hate you
so much I bought this.

328
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,625
Belzenef, the curse doll!

329
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,333
I'm going to complete
the curse, Hikaru.

330
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,583
I'm going to write
your name on his back.

331
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,333
From this day forward,
you're going to experience

332
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,666
nothing but
misfortune and sorrow!

333
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,250
Will you guys knock it off?

334
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,833
What do you think
you're doing?

335
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,208
You don't bring something
like this into a petty fight!

336
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,416
Both of you are at fault
here but what's really sad

337
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,958
is that you've brought
everyone else around you

338
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,458
into your big mess!

339
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,500
Now apologize to each other!
If you don't make up

340
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,875
right now I'm never gonna let
you come over to my house!

341
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,875
Have I made myself clear?

342
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,125
So then what you're saying
Haruhi is that if we make up

343
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,541
we can come over to your place?

344
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,791
I'm so sorry, Kaoru.
Even though I was just

345
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:07,375
following our script, I said
such awful things to you.

346
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,416
I'm not fit to be your brother.

347
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,708
Don't say that, Hikaru!
I was so worried.

348
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,958
I couldn't live with myself if
I ever thought I had hurt you.

349
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,916
Kaoru, I'll never
let you go again!

350
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,041
Hikaru!

351
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,750
You've gotta be kidding?

352
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,041
You mean you guys were
faking it this whole time?

353
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,083
We didn't have anything else
to do, we were bored.

354
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,375
They totally fooled me.

355
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,833
Twins with too much time
on their hands--

356
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,958
--are the devil.

357
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,708
I'm so glad they made up!

358
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:56,666
Okay, it's time to play the
"which one is Hikaru" game!

359
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,541
I know! The twin with
the pink hair is Hikaru!

360
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,875
We have a winner!

361
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,875
So are you two going to
keep your wild hair color

362
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,125
even though you've made up?
It's much easier to tell

363
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,791
the two of you apart now.

364
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,333
Huh. No, it isn't.

365
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,875
Today the pink one is Kaoru
and Hikaru's the blue one.

366
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,625
You swapped colors
for the day, huh?

367
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:54,041
Do you realize what's happened,
Hikaru? Until now, there were

368
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:58,500
only two groups of people: "us"
and "everyone else." But for

369
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,541
the first time, someone's
crossed into our world.

370
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:15,125
Rejoice, Haruhi! You're going
to have an underclassman.

371
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,916
Someone new wants
to join the club.

372
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,333
But he's in
elementary school!

373
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,250
I wonder what he'll
be like all grown up!

374
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,791
Next time, "The Grade-School
Host is the Naughty Type!"

375
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:26,375
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!
