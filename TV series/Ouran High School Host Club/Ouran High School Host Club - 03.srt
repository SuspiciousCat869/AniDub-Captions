1
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,583
Only those with excellent
social standing and those

2
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,791
from filthy rich families
are lucky enough to spend

3
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:36,583
their time here at the elite,
private school, Ouran Academy.

4
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,166
The Ouran Host Club is where
the school's handsomest boys,

5
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,583
with too much time on their
hands, entertain young ladies

6
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,916
who also have way too much
time on their hands.

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,291
Just think of it as Ouran
Academy's elegant playground

8
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,500
for the super-rich
and beautiful.

9
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,583
Welcome, ladies!

10
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,958
So, in which cup would my
princess like her tea?

11
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,458
The Foley? The Worcester?
Or perhaps

12
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,541
the Susie Cooper Gardenia?

13
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,708
Beautiful.

14
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,250
These are English antiques,
aren't they?

15
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,666
Which one do
you like, Tamaki?

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,125
Which one?

17
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,583
Well, none of these
compare to my princess.

18
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,583
Oh wow.

19
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,625
I don't really know
what to say.

20
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,250
You mean, you've never been
to Covent Garden?

21
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,666
No, all of our antiques
are from Portobello Road.

22
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,041
I think you'd like
Covent Garden.

23
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,500
Most of our Victorian
pieces are from there.

24
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,166
Kaoru!

25
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,583
Honestly Kaoru,
you have to be more careful.

26
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,416
From now on keep
your eyes on me, okay?

27
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Yes, Hikaru.

28
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,750
I can't take it!
It's overwhelming!

29
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,750
You have to watch this!

30
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,166
You may not
get another chance!

31
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,875
Who knows when
it'll happen again!

32
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,208
You are absolutely right,
mademoiselle.

33
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,416
All beauty is fleeting,

34
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,208
just take a look
at these cherry blossoms.

35
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,875
You'll never be able
to see them this vibrant again.

36
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,083
And that's why I've compiled
this picture book that contains

37
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,375
photos that capture the
beauty of each passing day.

38
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,291
Incidentally, I've prepared
similar books of the other hosts

39
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,166
as well. And if you ladies
are interested in collecting

40
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,625
all four of them, I'll
discount the full set for you.

41
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,166
I'll take them!

42
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,541
Me too, please!

43
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,416
Well, now we know how
the club makes extra money.

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,791
But I have to wonder.

45
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,750
When did he
take pictures of us?

46
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,875
Should I say
something to him?

47
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,791
Mitsukuni.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,875
You overdid it.

49
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,166
He told him!

50
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,750
Honey, I'll take it!
It looks so yummy!

51
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,250
It's just the right
amount for both of us!

52
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,583
Any more would be too much!
How'd did you know?

53
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,291
You never cease to amaze me!

54
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,583
Really?

55
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,708
Haruhi, how are you doing?

56
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,333
Are you having a good time?

57
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,791
Tamaki-senpai.

58
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:45,541
The flower-viewing reception
is going over quite well.

59
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,791
But even so, it's rather
daunting to spend more time

60
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:52,666
being admired than
doing the admiring.

61
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,958
Oh wow Senpai, you're blooming
in more ways than one?

62
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,166
You noticed!

63
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,458
Yes, today my beauty
is quite splendorous!

64
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:03,750
I'm in full bloom! I bet
you'll fall for me soon.

65
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,708
I swear this guy must live
his life completely unaware

66
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,083
of the hardships
of this world.

67
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,666
So, Haruhi, have you decided
your elective courses

68
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,916
for this term?

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,125
How about
Conversational French?

70
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,583
I don't know.

71
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,541
I think the three of us
should take it together.

72
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,250
It makes perfect sense.

73
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,083
We are in the same class.

74
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,666
Say, Mommy, dear?

75
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,166
What is it now, Daddy?

76
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,791
I have a new theory.

77
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,541
I mean, it's just my
hypothesis but it seems that

78
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,500
by being in the same class,
Hikaru and Kaoru

79
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,916
are able to spend more time
with Haruhi than I get to

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,583
here at the club. This
gives them a chance to get

81
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,416
close to her.
And if that happens--

82
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,750
Tamaki, you just now
realized that?

83
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,375
According to my research,
in a single day,

84
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,750
the twins spend roughly nine
hours of class time with Haruhi.

85
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,000
Meanwhile, your contact
with her is limited to

86
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,500
a couple of hours of club
activities. In other words,

87
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,083
your involvement in
Haruhi's life each day amounts

88
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,083
to no more than a mere
3 percent. I'm so very sorry.

89
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,833
I don't want to hear it!
I don't want to hear it!

90
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,958
Listen Haruhi, I want you to
stop hanging out with those

91
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,375
shady twins from now on!

92
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,875
Who're you calling shady?

93
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, take a good look
at yourself, boss!

94
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,500
Yes, that's it.

95
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,416
Alright then, we can't go on
hiding the fact that

96
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,541
you're a girl from everyone
in the school any longer!

97
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,291
All Daddy wants is for you to
go back to being the girl you

98
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,833
used to be! For you to surround
yourself with girl friends

99
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,708
and start leading
a wholesome life!

100
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,958
Who're you calling "Daddy"?

101
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,875
So do it! Change back,
now! Change, right now!

102
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,250
You don't have to rush things.

103
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,333
She's going to be
found out soon enough.

104
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,333
Physical exams are
the day after tomorrow.

105
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,875
Physical exams?

106
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,625
That's right,
I forgot all about it.

107
00:06:55,708 --> 00:07:00,291
Then that means, there's
no doubt, they're gonna know

108
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,208
I'm really a girl.

109
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,166
Beware the Physical Exam!

110
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,333
Haruhi!

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,708
Been waiting long?
What's the matter?

112
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,291
You look a little down.

113
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:31,625
I can't help it, everyone keeps
staring at me for some reason.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,125
I'm so embarrassed.

115
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,625
They're looking at you
because you are lovely.

116
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,500
Don't you worry, I promise
that I will protect you

117
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,291
no matter what.

118
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,250
Oh, Senpai, that
makes me feel better.

119
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,208
Thank you, I mean it.

120
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:57,041
I'm in love-love with you,
Tamaki-senpai!

121
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,583
Oh, you!--

122
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,000
He must be having
a great day dream!

123
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,875
He's kind of creeping me out.

124
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,833
Envious, Hikaru? This is
all part of my strategy.

125
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,291
While you've wasted time
blinded by your jealousy

126
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,458
I've foreseen
the outcome of this charade.

127
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,000
This anime is obviously
a romantic school comedy.

128
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,875
Haruhi and I are the main
characters so that means

129
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,791
we are love interests.

130
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,416
Yeah, then what are we?

131
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,875
You boys are the homosexual
supporting cast!

132
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,791
So, please make sure that you
don't step across this line?

133
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,750
You've got to be kidding.

134
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,083
Hey, listen boss.

135
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,583
I don't think you get it.

136
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,083
If word gets out that
Haru-chan is really a girl

137
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,791
then she won't be able to
be in the Host Club anymore.

138
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,166
But if Haru-chan started
wearing girls' clothes,

139
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,750
I bet she'd be even
cuter than she is now!

140
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,333
She dressed like
a regular girl when she was

141
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,750
in middle school, right? She
must have been pretty popular

142
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,250
with all the boys.

143
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,458
Yeah. According to my
investigative report,

144
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,500
someone would declare their
undying love to her at least

145
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:57,750
once a month.

146
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,250
Oh, I see. So the boss
wouldn't even be able

147
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,625
to get close to her.

148
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,125
But we'd be able to because
we're in class with her

149
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,583
all day long.

150
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,125
No way!

151
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,583
Hey guys, sorry I'm so late.

152
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,750
Don't you worry, Haruhi! We're
determined to keep your secret.

153
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,791
No one will find out that
you're really a girl during

154
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,416
tomorrow's physical exams!

155
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,583
So please, promise you'll stay
our beloved secret princess!

156
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,916
Sure.

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,416
You know what, I think
both of us would be

158
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,250
a little peeved if we had
to watch all the guys

159
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,583
flirt with her.

160
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,916
Then that settles it.

161
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,458
Listen up, squad members.

162
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,250
At tomorrow's physical
exams, position yourselves

163
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,041
in Formation A and then
wait for your orders.

164
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,250
Yes, sir!

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,458
I've got it. You guys are
worried cause if they find out

166
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,916
I'm a girl I can't be a host and
therefore can't repay my debt.

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,166
My balance is 5,333,332 yen.

168
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,916
Well guess I'll have
to come up with another way

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,791
to pay you back.

170
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,541
Do something! The subject
doesn't appear to have

171
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,333
any motivation!

172
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,041
Why'd we get stuck with
such a difficult heroine?

173
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,750
Are you saying that
you hate being a host?

174
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,208
That you hate this club?

175
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,166
Well, to be honest,
I'd have to say yes.

176
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,666
I mean, you guys
aren't bad but if it gets out

177
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,250
I'm a girl there's
nothing I can do, you know?

178
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,583
She doesn't seem to care
one way or the other.

179
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,791
Well before we do anything else
we have to find a way

180
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,083
to motivate her.

181
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,458
Fancy tuna.

182
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,666
Oh, that's right. You didn't
get the chance to eat any

183
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,000
during last episode's
party, did you?

184
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,458
Did you hear that?

185
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,791
She's never eaten fancy tuna
before. Isn't that awful?

186
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,166
Wow, talk about
a difficult childhood.

187
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,416
If only Haru-chan could
stay in the host club,

188
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,375
she'd have the chance to eat
all kinds of yummy things

189
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,791
whenever she wants.

190
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,500
What are you talking about?
Don't be silly!

191
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,000
Just cause I'm poor and
I've never had it doesn't mean

192
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,375
that I'm so much of a glutton
I'd go on fooling everyone

193
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,625
about my gender just
to try some fancy tuna.

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,833
Am I really gonna
get to try it?

195
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,916
We will begin conducting
physical examinations shortly.

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,083
All students, please proceed
to the clinic in your respective

197
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,583
school building.

198
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,708
So what's the deal with
is this "Formation A" thing

199
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,375
you guys were talking about?

200
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,041
What do they do during
physical exams here

201
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,708
at Ouran anyway?

202
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,416
It's no different than
a physical exam you'd get

203
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,083
at any other school.

204
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,083
Yeah, why would a physical
exam be any different

205
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,958
for us just because we're rich?

206
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,708
You're right. I didn't think
about it that way.

207
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,166
Welcome, students.

208
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,250
But what, what is all this?

209
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,916
Just another physical exam.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,250
The usual.

211
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,458
The usual?

212
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,541
Excuse me, Hitachiin Brothers.

213
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,250
Please follow me this way
to have your height measured.

214
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,583
Sure thing.

215
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,208
Mr. Fujioka?

216
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,583
I'm your nurse for the
physical exams this afternoon.

217
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,750
Okay.

218
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,458
Please, come this way.

219
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,708
Why are Honey and Mori
dressed as doctors?

220
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,708
I don't know--

221
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,916
Honey-senpai!
Mori-senpai!

222
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,833
You're so obvious.

223
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,541
I've got those two
for back up just in case

224
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,916
something happens.

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,791
But why are they
in doctor disguises?

226
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,583
They're just helping
to set the mood.

227
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,458
Disguises make our
operation feel like

228
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,375
a real espionage mission.

229
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,500
Wow, Miss Shiramine,

230
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,625
you've lost two whole
kilograms since this time

231
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,416
last year.

232
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
That's so good to hear!
I thought for sure

233
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,875
I was heavier!

234
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,125
Not at all! Keep it up
and you'll be even healthier

235
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,458
next year. Good work!

236
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,083
Don't you think it's weird
that these doctors are

237
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,083
all so jovial and nice?

238
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,625
They're chosen by
the school's chairman.

239
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,500
This may be a school
but it's also a business.

240
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,791
Therefore he wants
to keep the students happy.

241
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,041
After all, most of the students
that attend Ouran Academy

242
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,000
come from prominent families
that have their own

243
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,583
private doctors at home.
So this is just a formality.

244
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,208
These damn rich people.

245
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,583
I'm terribly sorry.

246
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,958
No problem.

247
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,166
Huh?

248
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,833
Hitachiin brothers,
would you please come with me?

249
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,416
We're ready to do
your chest measurements.

250
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,750
You can use the area behind
this curtain to undress.

251
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,291
Doesn't matter to me.

252
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,583
We're not shy.
Who needs a curtain?

253
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,500
See Haruhi? A rather
impressive turnout today.

254
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,541
Physical exam day is quite
popular with the ladies.

255
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,583
What's wrong with
the girls at this school?

256
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,291
I won't allow it,
it's just not fair.

257
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,791
I won't let those doctors
touch you, Kaoru.

258
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,625
What are you talking about?

259
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,708
You don't seem to have
a problem touching me

260
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,333
when we play doctor
at home. I can't get you to

261
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,125
stop tickling me
and toying with my body.

262
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,541
Come on, Haru-chan! This way!

263
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,875
W-what?

264
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,250
I've been waiting
for you, my princess.

265
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,708
Tamaki-senpai.

266
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,416
You're so cute
when you're surprised!

267
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,083
Mr. Fuijoka?

268
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,166
It's time for us to take
your chest measurements.

269
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,125
Once you've finished disrobing,
would you please come with me?

270
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,416
Haruhi's coming up next!

271
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,708
This is it, the inevitable
moment has arrived.

272
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,375
You just stay back here
and wait, okay Haruhi?

273
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,000
But what are you gonna do?

274
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,375
Don't you worry,
I'll protect you.

275
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,416
I promise I'll
protect you Haruhi.

276
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Mr. Fujioka? Are you ready
to be measured now?

277
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,625
Yes.

278
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,875
I'm Haruhi Fujioka.

279
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,458
Wait. That's Tamaki!

280
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,666
There's no denying it.
That's definitely Tamaki.

281
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,750
Is he cosplaying as Haruhi?

282
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,666
What's going on?
Is he trying to be funny?

283
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,916
I can't believe
he actually did it!

284
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,708
They recognized him.
I told you they'd

285
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,083
see through it!

286
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,708
It's payback for calling us the
"homosexual supporting cast".

287
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,833
I'm sorry. They figured it out.

288
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,250
Just as I thought.

289
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,583
Tamaki-senpai lives in his
own carefree, little world.

290
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,541
Haruhi, ready?
I went ahead and set up

291
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,208
a separate room for you,
a special boys' clinic.

292
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,250
And I have a doctor standing
by sworn to secrecy.

293
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,875
It turns out the doctors
here today are all on staff

294
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,041
at one of Kyoya-senpai's
family's hospitals.

295
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,583
Would've been nice
if he had said something

296
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,333
to us earlier.

297
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,041
I had to get my revenge,
too. I'm sorry,

298
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,583
I just don't think I'm
supporting cast, homosexual

299
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,333
or otherwise.

300
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,708
Is there something wrong?

301
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,333
Check it out!
Tamaki is eroding away!

302
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,541
Oh wow!

303
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,708
Haruhi is angry with me.

304
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,541
Come in.

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,250
Hello Mr. Fujioka.

306
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,333
I've been made aware
of your situation.

307
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,583
If you wouldn't mind, please
disrobe for me over there.

308
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,916
Sure.

309
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,083
I'm telling the truth!

310
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,375
One of the doctors grabbed
me by my shoulder.

311
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,250
He was trying
to make a pass at me!

312
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,083
I've never been so terrified!

313
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,333
Wow, how scary!

314
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,166
Do you think it
was a pervert?

315
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,541
I had a feeling
this might happen.

316
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,875
What do you mean?

317
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,333
A bit earlier today
I saw a strange man wearing

318
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,458
a white lab coat but clearly
not one of our hospital's

319
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,958
doctors and I thought
he was a little odd.

320
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,791
Shouldn't you have said
something sooner?

321
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,041
Oh, well it's no big deal.

322
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,750
I'm sure the security
guard will catch him.

323
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,500
Tell me miss, did you
happen to notice where

324
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,458
the pervert doctor
was headed?

325
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,708
Yes, sir.

326
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,583
He ran off toward the
special boys' clinic.

327
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,000
Haruhi!

328
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,500
'Scuse me.

329
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,666
No, it's not what you think!
Please just keep quiet!

330
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,250
Haruhi!

331
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,250
Tama-chan kick!

332
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,750
One. Good looks that
attract the public eye.

333
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,958
Two. More wealth
than you can imagine.

334
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,291
Three.

335
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,291
A chivalry that will never
be able to overlook--

336
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,750
--the hideous wickedness
of this world.

337
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,416
That's what makes up
the Ouran Host Club.

338
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,250
We're here, watch out!

339
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,583
Please don't hurt me!
Spare me my life!

340
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,541
I'm a doctor. I have a small
emergency medical clinic

341
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:26,583
that I run in the next town
over. My name is Yabu.

342
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,333
Did he say his name's Yabu?

343
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,250
That's crazy! What a
terrible name for a doctor.

344
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,791
Unless you're a quack.

345
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,208
I know, I'm here because
I was hoping to see

346
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,666
my daughter. My wife
left me last month and took

347
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,708
my daughter with her.
But I know that she attends

348
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,375
school here.

349
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,250
I don't mean to pry
or anything but

350
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,208
why did your wife
and daughter leave you?

351
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,458
Well, you see--

352
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,666
"I'm sick of this!

353
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,458
You let someone give you
an I-owe-you again?

354
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,666
You promised us you wouldn't
do that anymore!"

355
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,666
Don't worry, dear. I know
this guy's good for it.

356
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,041
We can trust him.
Everything'll be alright.

357
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,500
"I can't take this anymore!

358
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,166
Dad, you never think about
the welfare of our family!"

359
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,791
"I'm going home to Mother!"

360
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,000
No! Please, wait!

361
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,875
And that was it.
They left me forever.

362
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,375
I know I'm terrible
at managing our money and

363
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,333
I can't say no to anybody.
I don't blame them

364
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,208
for being tired of
constantly living in debt.

365
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,458
But I wanted to see my
daughter one more time,

366
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,250
so I came here. After
being pelted by rain and

367
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,083
wandering the streets I finally
made it to your school.

368
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,250
Once I entered I was
mistaken for a doctor here

369
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,166
to examine students.

370
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,166
Well, of course,
you're wearing a lab coat.

371
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,958
Anyone would mistake you.

372
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,291
And then it happened.

373
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,041
Excuse me, miss.
I'm looking for my daughter.

374
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,333
When I tried to ask her
about my daughter

375
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,833
the girl started screaming
and before I knew it there

376
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,250
were all kinds of
people chasing me!

377
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,625
That's so tragic!

378
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,708
Doctor Yabu, I think you
may have the wrong place.

379
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,291
Are you looking for
Ouran Public High School?

380
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,166
Yeah that's right.

381
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,958
I figured that
might be the case.

382
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,958
This is Ouran Academy,
a private institution.

383
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,791
Your daughter doesn't
go to school here.

384
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,958
Man, that's pretty sad.

385
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,250
You don't even know what
school your daughter goes to?

386
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,083
I bet your relationship
is messed up because

387
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,666
you don't pay
attention to her.

388
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,750
Not because of
some stupid debt.

389
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,541
Wow Kyo-chan!
I'm impressed that

390
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,791
you figured out
he had the wrong school.

391
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,500
Well, there's no way
the daughter of such

392
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,083
a small-time doctor would
ever be able to get into

393
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,666
Ouran Academy.

394
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,791
Kyoya would you please
find a map of all

395
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,541
the public schools
in this area?

396
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,916
I'd like to help this man
find his daughter.

397
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,291
Whatever you say.

398
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,250
Are you sure about this?

399
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,208
After all, even if he does
manage to find his daughter,

400
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,958
there's no guarantee
she'll want to speak to him.

401
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,500
Well then, that's something
he'll have to find out

402
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,875
for himself.

403
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,583
I'm sorry about this you guys
but could you please leave?

404
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,208
Haruhi! Are you
still angry with me?

405
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,541
You're not thinking of quitting
the Host Club, are you?

406
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,833
Don't be stupid, Senpai,
I've just got to finish

407
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,208
my physical exam.
As a male student, of course.

408
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,500
But lemme explain.

409
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,041
I'm not doin' this cause
you're bribing me with food.

410
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm doin' it to
pay back my debt.

411
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,291
You're so cute, Haruhi!

412
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,458
I can see right through you!

413
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,666
I know you're just after
that fancy tuna.

414
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,666
But it's so cute--

415
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,916
Cut it out,
Tamaki-senpai! Hey!

416
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,500
Don't touch me there!

417
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,916
Red card!

418
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,125
Looks like Tamaki senpai--

419
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,583
--is the real pervert!

420
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,666
Who cares?

421
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,333
Would you guys
just get out of here?

422
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,125
Hey Senpai, I heard a rumor
that there's another girl

423
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,333
joining the Host Club.
Is that true?

424
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,666
Don't act so surprised.

425
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,750
I've heard that she's
actually Kyoya's fiancée.

426
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,250
Next time,
Attack of the Lady Manager!

427
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,291
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!
