1
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,041
Now you've done it!

2
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,000
It's done, all right.

3
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,875
But it wasn't our fault.

4
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,125
What?! You idiots! You're the
ones who bumped into it, right?

5
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,375
Only because Haruhi
was running away.

6
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,541
We were trying to catch her
cause we wanted have some fun

7
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,125
and dress her up in cosplay.

8
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,208
So what- we cosplay
all the time!

9
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,708
We weren't going with
the usual Host Club costumes.

10
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:51,166
We want to see in bunny
cosplay disguised as a girl.

11
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,083
Disguised as a girl?

12
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,416
You'd like to see it too,
wouldn't you?

13
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,166
I'd definitely want to see
that-What am I thinking?!

14
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,958
There's no time
for stuff like that right now!

15
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,958
I know what you're up to.
You're trying to distract me

16
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,500
from the mess you've made!

17
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,500
Get away from
Haruhi, you punks!

18
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,375
No way!

19
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,375
Let me go!

20
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,625
Excuse me. We don't have
any guests at the moment

21
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,750
so I don't mind if you make
a racket but please.

22
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,958
Be careful. You don't want
to wake Honey-senpai.

23
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,625
He's a 3rd year who
still takes afternoon naps?

24
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,416
Well, we're gonna have
to tell him about the bunny

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,333
at some point. Let's just
wake him up and apologize.

26
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,000
No, wait! Don't get any
closer to Honey-senpai!

27
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,083
Come back.
It's safe over here!

28
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,500
What're you talking about?

29
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:49,416
Honey-senpai wakes up in
a very bad mood after napping.

30
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,083
This may be just a rumor,
but the HAHneenozuka family

31
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,708
once visited a U.S. military
base to give combat training.

32
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,291
Supposedly, Honey-senpai
slept through most of it

33
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,208
because of his jet-lag.

34
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,166
Hey, master,
are you doin' okay?

35
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,208
Then a soldier came in and
carelessly tried to wake him up

36
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,916
since he had been
sleeping for so long.

37
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:17,041
I'm still sleepy.

38
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,250
Oh dear god!

39
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,875
On that day, he wiped out two
entire platoons of soldiers,

40
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,000
and not just any
soldiers-green berets!

41
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,916
And I've heard we've
had diplomatic issues with

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,041
America ever since that day.

43
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,625
How terrifying.

44
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,625
And we've got a bigger problem.
Usa-chan was hand-made

45
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,708
for Honey-senpai
by his deceased grandmother.

46
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,916
You've seen the way he carries
it around, that little bunny

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,708
is his most prized possession.
I can't imagine how

48
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,208
he's going to react
when he wakes up and sees

49
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,708
that his precious
Usa-chan is ruined!

50
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,833
He's gonna do to us what
he did to those green berets!

51
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,541
You're exaggerating.

52
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:07,500
It's imposible for that story
to be true, I mean, come on.

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,791
It is, and there's other
evidence that Honey-senpai has

54
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,208
an evil side to him.
Listen to this.

55
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,750
His blood type is AB-
how do you like that?!

56
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,291
Yeah, so what?

57
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,583
But Haruhi, that means he's
the same blood type as Kyoya!

58
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,416
What's the matter? Do you
guys have a problem with

59
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,625
my blood type?

60
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,333
Oh, those of you
watching with type AB,

61
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,583
please don't take
any offense to this.

62
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,625
Man. This is bad. We have
to do something quick before

63
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,458
he wakes up. Hikaru, Kaoru.

64
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,958
Sir!

65
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,125
Go get your folks' Cessna.
Fly to Osorezan and bring back

66
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,958
a medium. We'll channel his
grandmother and she can

67
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,541
guide us through it.
We can make a new Usa-chan

68
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,166
for Honey-senpai!

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,625
Take this map of the
Aomori Prefecture with you.

70
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,958
And don't forget to bring back
apple juice, apple jam

71
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,833
and Nebuta souvenir dolls!

72
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,666
But we don't
have that much time.

73
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,166
We're used to your crazy ideas,
but you should come up

74
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,541
with something more practical.

75
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:13,416
Alright, how about this, we'll
send Usa-chan to the cleaners.

76
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,625
Haruhi!

77
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,375
You're going to have
to wear the bunny suit.

78
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, good idea, boss!

79
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,166
Forget about it!

80
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,250
I'm not wearing
that stupid bunny suit!

81
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,000
It's not gonna work!
He'll know it's me!

82
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,125
No he won't. He won't
be able to tell the difference

83
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,041
if he's just
waking up from a nap!

84
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,416
Well then why don't
you wear it, Senpai?!

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
It won't be as cute
if I wear it! C'mon this

86
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,833
is the least you can do.

87
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,375
Since we can't get
another bunny you're gonna have

88
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,541
to step in. Besides, if the
twins hadn't been chasing

89
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,958
you none of this
would've happened!

90
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,833
He's awake! We'll have to use a
substitute! We've got no choice!

91
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,083
No! Not my teddy-bear!

92
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,750
He's gonna come after us next!

93
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,041
He just spotted
his bunny rabbit!

94
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,500
Who's responsible for this?

95
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,500
Who got Usa-chan dirty?

96
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,416
Someone help! Mori-senpai!
Don't let him hurt us!

97
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,375
He wanted tea, so Usa-chan
decided to have a drink.

98
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,875
I see. So that's why his face
is all dirty, isn't it?

99
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,625
Hey. Do you think
he wants some cake, too?

100
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,125
"Honey Senpai's
Three Bitter Days"

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,458
Honey, how do you like
to have chocolate?

102
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,708
Mousse? Bonbons? Wait,
I bet chocolate cake

103
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,458
is your favorite, huh?

104
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:12,166
Um. let's see. Well. I like 'em
all! I love anything chocolate,

105
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,833
Usa-chan and all of you ladies!

106
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,541
He's so cute!

107
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,291
Mitskuni Haninozuka,
otherwise known as Honey-senpai,

108
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,625
age 17. Ouran Academy
3rd-Year, Class A and

109
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,583
member of the Host Club.
Favorite things include cake,

110
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,375
chocolate, and bunnies.
He's famous for his enchanting

111
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,458
boy Lolita characteristics.

112
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,208
That was a close call
earlier, huh senpai?

113
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,125
No kidding! I'm glad
we settled that Usa-chan issue

114
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,791
without any violence.

115
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,875
Honey-senpai's catch phrases
include, "I love candy"

116
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,958
and "I love cute things". And
while some find this charming,

117
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,666
I'm not quite sold on
his cutesy loli boy image-

118
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,166
it's not exciting enough!

119
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,166
It feels like something's
missing in his character arc!

120
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,583
Honey-senpai. You can't keep
eating nothing but sweets

121
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,250
all of the time,
you know, you're gonna end up

122
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,416
with a cavity.

123
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,416
Oh, don't worry.
I always brush my teeth.

124
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,500
Honey-senpai, is it?

125
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,916
Nah, it's nothing, 'kay?

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,916
Lemme just take
a look in your mouth.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hold still.

128
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,750
Honey-senpai,
please quit squirming.

129
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,250
There's nothing wrong! Quit
messing with me! Leave me alone!

130
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,583
Yes! That's it! That's it!
That's what was missing!

131
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,916
It's moe!

132
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,375
So is it a cavity?

133
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,625
Yeah.

134
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,583
Oowie! Ouchie! Oowie!
Ouchie! Oowie! Ouchie!

135
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,208
It's all right. I'll be okay.

136
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,041
Tamaki.

137
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,875
Yes, you're right.
I'll take care of this.

138
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,500
Until Honey-senpai
gets over his cavity,

139
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,458
I'm afraid he can't
have sweets.

140
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,916
Therefore, we'll be supportive,
and ask that you kindly

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,291
refrain from eating snacks
in the club room until

142
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,875
this ordeal is over.

143
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:20,708
No, no, don't, Takashi. Please
don't take my snacks away.

144
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:25,166
You can't. Don't do it.
What'll I do without them?!

145
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:32,458
I can handle it!
Please don't take away my cake!

146
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,125
No more cake.

147
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,416
And that's how it all began.
One little cavity and

148
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,791
suddenly Honey-senpai's
life became a living hell.

149
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,250
Poor Honey-senpai looks
so miserable. It's a shame

150
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,250
the Host Club banned snacks.

151
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,666
It must be really
difficult for him.

152
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,958
I hope this doesn't
seem insensitive.

153
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,875
I know he's in pain but-

154
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,500
He's so cute!

155
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,458
Mitsukuni, bag.

156
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,875
I can carry it.

157
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,208
Yes, you can. Hand it over.

158
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,916
I was just looking.
I wasn't gonna eat them.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,875
Really? If you're
just looking, then try this.

160
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,208
I'll keep the real stuff.

161
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,041
Aw man, that was rough.

162
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,125
I can't help but
feel sorry for him.

163
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,916
You know, I had no idea that
Mori-senpai could be so brutal.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,375
You wouldn't expect it. I
thought his principles kept him

165
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,833
from doing anything
to upset Honey-senpai.

166
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:59,500
And to think that he could get
the boss to go along with him.

167
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,875
It's too bad, Tamaki.
I wanted to give you some of

168
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,916
the chocolates specially-made
by our new pâtissier.

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,500
My family just hired him
from France, but I can't

170
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,333
share them with you because
you're not eating sweets.

171
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,625
Do not fret my princess.
For the present I must abstain

172
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,250
for poor Honey-senpai's sake,
but eventually we'll

173
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,291
be able to share
chocolate together again.

174
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,916
The friendship you boys have
is absolutely beautiful.

175
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,291
I believe things will work
out for the better this way,

176
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,666
my dear.

177
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,833
I'm sure it's delicious
but no chocolate could ever

178
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,833
be able to withstand
the heat wave of my love.

179
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,916
So it would all
melt and go to waste.

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,625
Oh, Tamaki.

181
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,166
Impressive, boss.
That was quite an act.

182
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,083
Missing sweets, aren't you?

183
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,666
Buzz off.

184
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,708
The club's number one priority
is our guests. All that matters

185
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,333
is their happiness.

186
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,916
You had better watch yourselves
out there. Don't give any

187
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,041
sweets to Honey-senpai
no matter what tricks

188
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,375
he resorts to.

189
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,583
Oh, and incidentally those
instructions come from

190
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,041
Mori-senpai.
This isn't my doing.

191
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,791
So is it just me, or does
he seem to be enjoying this?

192
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:26,916
I just can't hide it any longer.
I have to get this off my chest.

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,125
I need to know what your
feelings are towards me

194
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,875
and if you'll accept my love.

195
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:40,916
Will you, please? Unless of
course there's someone else.

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,708
Please tell me. Is there
someone else who's dear to you?

197
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,250
There is, isn't there? Huh?

198
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,166
I should've known.

199
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,833
Look, Takashi!
My cavity's all better now!

200
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,125
You sure?

201
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,000
The swelling
has even gone down!

202
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,541
Has it?

203
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:34,958
So do you think I can have a
piece of cake? Just one? Please?

204
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,041
You're not fully recovered yet.

205
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,208
What are you ladies drinking?

206
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,041
Um. Darjeeling tea,
it's really good.

207
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,500
Yeah? What are you
gonna have to eat?

208
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,625
Well, I was going
to have a sandwich.

209
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,416
Know what you need? Some
sweets! That tea would go well

210
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,791
with something sweet!
Like maybe some cake! C'mon!

211
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,833
What d'you say?

212
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,833
Well. It would be
good with cake.

213
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,250
It sure would.

214
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,583
We're so sorry, Honey!

215
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,791
But it's for your own good!

216
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,583
Wait!

217
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,041
Honey-senpai.

218
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:58,208
Haru-chan, am I a bad person?

219
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:03,500
I just don't understand why
God hates me. What have I done?

220
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,208
Okay, fine,
but only this once, got it?

221
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,125
Is it a snack?

222
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,333
Yeah.

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,333
Here.

224
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,375
It's the same color
as chocolate. Try it.

225
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,416
He's gonna crack.

226
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Would somebody please talk
to him. He's scaring me.

227
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,083
He's headed for the candy!

228
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,250
No need to worry.
We emptied out all the sweets.

229
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,583
Kyoya-senpai, you seem
really chipper today.

230
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,541
He keeps doing that
to my teddy-bear!

231
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, there he goes.

232
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,083
Three days and he gives up.

233
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,333
Um, Honey-senpai?

234
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:34,083
Somebody help me!
He's eating my arm off!

235
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,125
Mitsukuni, don't take
this out on other people.

236
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,291
You saved me.
I thought I was a goner.

237
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,958
It's disgraceful.

238
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,000
Takashi.

239
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,000
You idiot!

240
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,000
A little bit isn't gonna
hurt me! You're so mean!

241
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,083
You're such a hardhead!

242
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:16,458
That's it, I hate you!
I hate you Takashi!

243
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,291
Honey-senpai!

244
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,333
Hey, Mori-senpai.

245
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,583
That was harsh.
Will you be alright?

246
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,875
I hate you, Takashi!
I hate you, Takashi!

247
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,500
I hate you, Takashi!

248
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,416
Wow, senpai, it looks
like he really got to you.

249
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,375
I don't know what's going on,
but it seems like

250
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,916
you're self-destructing.

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,375
Maybe Honey-senpai wouldn't
hate you if you hadn't been

252
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,416
so hard on him
in the first place.

253
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,458
It was on purpose.

254
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,916
Mori-senpai, by any chance,
have you been acting like this

255
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,708
because you're trying to get
Honey-senpai to hate you?

256
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,458
Why would he do that?

257
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,125
It makes no sense.
That would be like the end

258
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,208
of the world for Mori-senpai.

259
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,208
Why would he do it on purpose?

260
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:19,333
Well maybe because he was
trying to punish himself.

261
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,125
I'm right, aren't I?

262
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,583
Yeah, you are;
this was my fault.

263
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:34,458
Mitsukuni has a cavity
because I'm careless.

264
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,166
Twice before his naptime
I forgot to make him

265
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,458
brush his teeth.

266
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,083
But that's not really
your responsibility.

267
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,208
He should know better.

268
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:53,666
But if Mitsukuni has to get
false teeth, it'll be my fault.

269
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,041
Don't worry.
That's not gonna happen.

270
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,250
Wow, what a pessimist.

271
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,125
I wouldn't be able to live
with myself right now

272
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,083
if he hadn't thrown me down.

273
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,916
Because he felt at fault,
Mori-senpai wanted some sort

274
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,875
of punishment from
Honey-senpai to make up

275
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,666
for his failure.

276
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,750
Well, while that certainly makes
for a nice story and everything.

277
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,708
It was just
a little cavity, right?

278
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,583
Well, there you have it,
Honey-senpai.

279
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,666
What will you do now?

280
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:44,666
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry, Takashi!

281
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,375
I promise! I won't forget
to brush my teeth again!

282
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,916
I won't forget!

283
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,375
A few days later,
Honey-senpai recovered

284
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,041
from his painful cavity,
so the Host Club decided

285
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,875
to lift their ban on sweets,

286
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,166
and Honey-senpai could greedily
stuff his face once more.

287
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,416
What's with Kyoya-senpai?

288
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,375
He looks depressed
about something.

289
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,208
Cause Honey-senpai's back
to eating snacks again.

290
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,750
All those sweets get expensive.

291
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,833
Excuse me.

292
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh my, looks like we have
a new guest, gentlemen.

293
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,333
Are you a fan of Mori-senpai?

294
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,875
It's that girl.

295
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,750
Well, Mori, I understand now.

296
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,833
I know who you feel so
strongly about, and it's okay.

297
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,166
I must say I find it a little
surprising that it's Honey.

298
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,875
To think he's so special
to you, I don't know.

299
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:23,583
It's just so. I can't
explain it- it's so-

300
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,083
Congratulations. You've just
taken your first big step

301
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,125
into a brand new world.

302
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,500
Mitsukuni, you've made a mess.

303
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,541
That's right ladies,
it's moe! It's the greatest!

304
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,250
I just can't get enough of it!

305
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,791
You know, even though this
whole thing may look and feel

306
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:56,375
just like a happy ending, I'm
not sure everyone out there

307
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,291
would think moe is a good way
to wrap things up.

308
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,750
Moe!

309
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,541
Oh, good grief.

310
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,291
Tamaki-senpai, why are you
wearing a silk hat?

311
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,625
And Kyoya-senpai, why are you
on top of a mushroom?

312
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,333
You're not doing a very
good job of keeping up

313
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:20,416
with the story line.

314
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,333
Next time,
"Haruhi in Wonderland"!

315
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,875
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you!

316
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,250
We'll see you then!
