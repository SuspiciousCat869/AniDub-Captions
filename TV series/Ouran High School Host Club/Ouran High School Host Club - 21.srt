1
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,166
At the stroke of midnight,
the carriage would

2
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,500
change back
into a pumpkin.

3
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,958
But this particular
spell wasn't cast

4
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,958
by a fairy godmother.

5
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,500
All right.

6
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,541
Next item on the agenda.

7
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,875
I move to discuss
what the class plans

8
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,375
will be for next week.

9
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,416
Next week?

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,875
Yeah, Halloween.

11
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:23,333
Oh Haruhi, you've only been
a student at Ouran Academy

12
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,833
since high school, right?
So you don't know.

13
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,583
After we've finished
taking our exams

14
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,958
for the fall, we're
allowed a few days off

15
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,833
until the end of October.
And we get to throw

16
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,791
costumes parties
on campus to celebrate.

17
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,458
And also, to promote
comraderie, each class

18
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,791
is allowed to use
an entire day for a special

19
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,625
class event of their choosing.

20
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,666
Event?

21
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,458
Right. They're
pretty fun actually.

22
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,791
Yeah, we socialize
or watch some old movies.

23
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,125
Stuff like that.

24
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,625
Boring! Boring! Boring!

25
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,625
Halloween.

26
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,250
The day that sounds the
death knell of summer and

27
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,916
ushers in the icy
breath of winter.

28
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,375
Halloween. Once a day when
ghouls walked the earth

29
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,125
and disguised
as ghouls we tried to

30
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,416
ward them all off.

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,708
Halloween. A day for
wearing costumes

32
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,333
and playing pranks
on trick-or-treaters

33
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,625
with reckless abandon.

34
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,875
Some people don't wait for
Halloween to dress up.

35
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,416
Some people cosplay year round.

36
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,333
I know that's right.
So, what's with the uniform?

37
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,875
Just between us, this is
the female uniform in

38
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,083
"Uki-doki Memorial 2,"
which isn't scheduled

39
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,541
for release until next spring.
What do you think?

40
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,083
I know important
people on the inside,

41
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,208
if you catch my drift.

42
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,375
Miss Hoshakuji,
we're having homeroom now.

43
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,375
Could you get down
off the desk please?

44
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,458
Tea parties and cosplay?
The Host Club does that

45
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,333
practically nonstop!
What our Halloween

46
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,666
requires is
something special!

47
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,000
Um, we're supposed
to decide this as a class.

48
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,833
So I propose holding

49
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,458
a Halloween Test-of-Courage
Tournament!

50
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,666
The bravest student wins!

51
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,250
A test-of-courage-

52
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,625
-tournament, you say?

53
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,833
Here's what we'll do.
We'll ask the superintendent

54
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,791
to give us access
to the school after hours,

55
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,875
when it's dark.
Then we'll all dress up

56
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,166
in our freakiest costumes
and proceed to have

57
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,291
the time of our lives
scaring the absolute crap

58
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,666
out of each other!

59
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah! We're in!

60
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,541
I really like the part about-

61
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,875
-it being dark.

62
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,083
That sounds awesome.

63
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,416
The school is
so spooky at night.

64
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,250
Oh, I'm getting so many
great ideas for this!

65
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,125
We can all take turns being
scared, and later get

66
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,916
our chance to scare
someone else!

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,083
Well now why don't we think
this through everyone.

68
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,625
We can't all
go individually.

69
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,833
We should be in teams
of at least three or four.

70
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,083
Yeah, teams would be scarier!

71
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,541
And anybody who leaves-

72
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,583
-gets featured on the front
page of the school newspaper

73
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,791
as "The Captain
of All Cowards."

74
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,083
Seconded!

75
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,875
Um. Alright then,
are there any objections

76
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,250
to the majority vote?

77
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,500
Are there any at all?

78
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,416
Is anyone
opposed to the idea?

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,041
Come on, anyone?

80
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:46,166
Oh very well.Then the
motion passes unanimously.

81
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,416
The class 1-A event for
this year will be a special

82
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,166
Halloween Test-of-Courage
Tournament.

83
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,625
"Until the Day
It Becomes a Pumpkin."

84
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:25,208
Trick or treat, girls. Give
me candy, or else your blood.

85
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,000
Halloween might be
a week away officially,

86
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,375
but here at the
Host Club, we start

87
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,291
haunting season
a little early.

88
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh Tamaki, you make
such a handsome vampire.

89
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,916
Those fangs look real.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,583
May I nibble your
lovely neck for a treat?

91
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,250
Oh no you mustn't.
You'll have to play

92
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,041
a trick on me instead.

93
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,708
And indeed I shall.

94
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,833
Oh, me next! Me next!
Me next! Me next! Me next!

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Hello.

96
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,166
Why are you guys late?
Hurry up and change.

97
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,625
Sorry Boss. But from
now until Halloween-

98
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,000
-Count us out.

99
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:05,833
Okay?

100
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,000
What?

101
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,416
Count you out?

102
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,833
We're on the preparation
committee for a special event.

103
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,958
Class 1-A is sponsoring it.

104
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,125
Duty calls then.

105
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,000
Good luck without us
here for a week.

106
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,041
You have fun.

107
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,250
Hold on! Why is Haruhi going?

108
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,833
Well boss, she is
in our class you know.

109
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,625
Oh. The special event
is an after dark

110
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,791
Test-of-Courage
Tournament.

111
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,000
After dark?

112
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,750
I'm scared, Hikaru!

113
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,708
Hold me! Protect me!

114
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,416
I'm scared, Kaoru!

115
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,041
Hold me! Protect me!

116
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,375
Haruhi. You're not going
to take part in this are you?

117
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,791
For decency's sake,
tell me you won't!

118
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,958
Calm down, Senpai.
It's just some harmless fun.

119
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,375
Harmless. She thinks it's--

120
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,958
--harmless?

121
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,083
Oh why me?

122
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:15,333
You won't go! You can't!
Daddy doesn't like it.

123
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,208
This is the magic spell.

124
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,958
We may just be members
of a host club--

125
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,208
--but the boss calls Haruhi
his daughter, and imagines

126
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,875
us to be members
of his family.

127
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,041
Okay, time to go now.

128
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,125
Boss, Adieu!

129
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,666
Wait! I could be
a valuable asset

130
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,500
to the planning committee!
Let me come too!

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,416
Nekozawa-senpai,
when did you--?

132
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,166
Well now,
isn't that interesting.

133
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,041
What was that? You think it
sounds like fun, Belzenef?

134
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,541
You may just be on to
something there.

135
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,541
If it's fear they want,
the Black Magic Club

136
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,666
will be happy to oblige.
After all what's Halloween

137
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,750
without a healthy dose of
pure unadulterated terror?

138
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,791
So, what kind of
budget-limit should

139
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,041
we put on costumes?
Once everyone starts

140
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,666
shopping,
they'll go all out.

141
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,625
Why don't we follow the
commoner's rule of keeping it

142
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,666
under 300 yen?

143
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,958
That should make
things interesting.

144
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,958
It would be a good idea
to have a doctor handy,

145
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,125
just in case anyone faints--

146
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,458
They all seem pretty
excited about this.

147
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,500
Okay, so under
three hundred yen,

148
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,416
needs a doctor present.
Hey, are we going to have food?

149
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,208
You have Nyctophobia?

150
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,333
So you're afraid of the dark?

151
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,708
Yes and you can add to
that horror-movie-phobia,

152
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,041
scary-ghost-story-phobia,
being-startled-by-

153
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,166
a-loud-noise-in-the-
other-room-phobia,

154
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,916
and
accidentally-seeing-trailers-for

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,250
horror-movies-phobia.

156
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,916
And what's with those
things? Why do they keep

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,416
showing them without
warning us about it first?

158
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
It just doesn't
make sense to me.

159
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,708
Whatever happened to civil
rights for the fraidy-cats

160
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,708
out there? Cowards are
people too! And what about

161
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:07,500
the other classes with their tea
parties? It's just so unfair!

162
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,791
Class Rep, calm down.

163
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,625
Oh my, I'm sorry.

164
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,208
If you were opposed to the
idea from the start,

165
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,750
why didn't you just bring
it up in the meeting?

166
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,541
I tried to. But I don't want
to look like I'm throwing

167
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,125
my weight around up there.

168
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,875
So I was counting on
your help to save me!

169
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,291
Please, calm down.

170
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,541
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,833
How exactly was I
supposed to save you?

172
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,416
I was desperately giving you
signs to oppose the motion

173
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
while it was up for vote,
but you just didn't

174
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,875
seem interested.

175
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,541
Are there any objections
to the majority vote?

176
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,000
Are there any at all?

177
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,541
Is anyone opposed
to the idea?

178
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,458
Come on, anyone?

179
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:53,666
If just one person objects,
then it goes up for discussion.

180
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,000
Sorry, I had no idea.

181
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:59,291
Please Fujioka. You have
to let me be on your team!

182
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,291
If I'm with you,
then maybe your

183
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,125
peace of mind
will help me.

184
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,000
And I can remain
more calm!

185
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,791
Class Rep!

186
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,458
And one more thing, you can't
tell the Hitachiin brothers!

187
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,375
Is someone a fraidy cat?

188
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,416
Oh, there you are.

189
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,208
We're about to
choose groups.

190
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,958
So do you have any idea
who you'd like

191
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,375
to have on your team?

192
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,125
Yeah, the four of us'll be one!

193
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,916
Great. Then you guys
are Team B, alright?

194
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:38,000
Sounds like fun,
right Class Rep?

195
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,041
This is a nightmare!

196
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,500
It's all over now.

197
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,833
Hey Kaoru, tell us
the story about

198
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,125
the Evil Clock Tower Witch.

199
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,625
One Halloween many years
ago, a girl dressed in

200
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,500
a witch costume,
fell to her death from

201
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,000
the tower.

202
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,208
And now--

203
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,625
--Whoever sees her ghost
on Halloween Night--

204
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,500
--Will be cursed forever!

205
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,458
No! Please stop it, you guys!

206
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,250
Knock if off. The point
is to scare someone not

207
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,125
on your team.
Why don't you save

208
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,291
that dumb shtick
for somebody else?

209
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,458
But no one's come yet. We're
tired of waiting around.

210
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,208
Hey, not so fast.

211
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,791
Look Class Rep. Cool huh?
I borrowed this book

212
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,041
from the library:

213
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,708
"Surefire Methods for
Coping with Anxiety."

214
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,708
Fujioka.

215
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,250
Now let's have a look,
shall we?

216
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,958
"The three cardinal rules
for dealing

217
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:01,708
with anxiety are as
follows. First--"

218
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,333
"Pretend everything's okay.

219
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,708
Second: whistle a
cheerful little tune.

220
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,625
Thirdly: repeat to yourself
'I'm brave'."

221
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,708
Are you kidding me?

222
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,875
None of those things
actually work!

223
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,291
Call me the Captain of All
Cowards - you can scream it

224
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,250
from the rooftops,
just get me out of here!

225
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,666
Really? Even if it means
Kurakano will think

226
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,250
you're a big chicken?

227
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,333
Whoa? Wait a minute.

228
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,416
What's going on
with you and Kurakano?

229
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
No! It's not like that!
We're just friends!

230
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,708
I've known her
since we were little -

231
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,291
None of this has
anything to do with it!

232
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,958
Fine, fine. We understand.

233
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,833
Funny how you had
told us you didn't want

234
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,333
to throw your
weight around-

235
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,208
-when the reason you agreed
to any of this is because

236
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,500
you didn't want to look
like a fraidy cat.

237
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:54,291
That's not it, that's not the
reason why I couldn't oppose it.

238
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,125
I--It's just--

239
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,125
That sounds like so much fun!

240
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,833
Kurakano.

241
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:12,125
Well she had her heart set on
this tournament. I didn't want

242
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,041
to let her down so
I couldn't say no.

243
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,416
You mean?

244
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,958
Oh crap! He's totally pure!

245
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,458
He's got a heart
of gold, Hikaru!

246
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,291
Our powers are nothing
against his wholesomeness!

247
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,666
So, does this mean
we have to help him now?

248
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,333
Did you see that?
That creepy shadow just now,

249
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,541
outside the window?

250
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,125
Aw come on!
Not you too Fujioka!

251
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,666
Knock it off, would ya?

252
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:58,166
No way. It's a sneak attack
from those A-team hacks.

253
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,625
Hey! It's not your turn guys!
Follow the rules!

254
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,375
My skull.

255
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,083
Yeah, you show 'em.

256
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,541
My skull.

257
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,916
My skull.

258
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,833
Could it be
The Clock Tower Witch?

259
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,916
Why did you kick--

260
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,250
--my skull?

261
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,250
Who's there?

262
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,708
I'm Frankenstein.

263
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,541
I'm the Wolfman!

264
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,791
Class Rep, slow down!
I can't keep up!

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,166
My fright strategy was
perfection itself.

266
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,958
Kyoya, you're not
joining in on the fun?

267
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,208
I'm not.

268
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,208
Damn it.
They've locked us in.

269
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,208
Ow! This was supposed to be
a tournament, not a hunt!

270
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,958
Kaoru! Where is he?
I've got to find Kaoru!

271
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:46,083
Hey! Cut it out! Stop thrashing
around like an idiot!

272
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,083
I can get us out of this
with my sewing scissors.

273
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,583
Wow! Even you have a
feminine side. Impressive.

274
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,791
And just what is that
supposed to mean?

275
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,541
You've got a smart mouth.

276
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,000
What do you mean
"I've got a smart mouth"?

277
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,875
Kaoru has one, too, you know.

278
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,375
Dream on. Not when he's all
by himself he doesn't.

279
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,000
Unlike you. When you're alone

280
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,541
you only get worse.
Believe me.

281
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,583
Oh yeah?

282
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,791
Now hold still for a second.

283
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,875
What are you doing?

284
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,916
Grow up. This is the
only way I can reach

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,583
where I need to cut.
I know it's

286
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,916
awkward but it'll
only take a minute.

287
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No. It's alright.
Take your time.

288
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,458
I can't allow this!

289
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:34,083
Patience, Tamaki.
The payoff is yet to come.

290
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:40,000
It's hopeless.
There's no one outside.

291
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:44,041
Looks like the A-team got
a little overzealous, huh?

292
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,500
Which one are you?

293
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,958
I'm Kaoru. Are you scared?

294
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:52,458
Well not anymore, no.
My nerves kind of shut down.

295
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:58,000
Man. Our plans are completely
shot. Such a shame.

296
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,000
We even had it all
figured out,

297
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,583
down to the last detail.
We had worked out

298
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,916
a plan to frighten
Kurakano half to death

299
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,958
and then let you come
charging to her rescue.

300
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,750
Wow, you'd do that for me?
That's really thoughtful

301
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,333
of you. But I don't
stand a chance.

302
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,125
There's someone else she likes.

303
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,791
Haruhi!

304
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,875
While it's true, Fujioka
doesn't seem to feel

305
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,708
the same way quite yet,
I'm positive that it's

306
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,250
only a matter
of time.

307
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,708
Yeah, that's not going to
happen, I can promise you that.

308
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,541
Why not?

309
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,958
It just won't.

310
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:36,416
Still, this may sound weird
but I don't want to risk

311
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,958
changing anything right now.

312
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,875
'Cause things are perfect.
Just being on the committee

313
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,666
with her is such an honor.
If this is as good as

314
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,916
it's going to get,
I'm still grateful.

315
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,916
So in other words, you've cast
a spell on the carriage.

316
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,041
And maybe you're right,
Class Rep. Keeping things

317
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:01,458
the way they are
wouldn't be so bad.

318
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,541
I'm sure that's what the
boss had in mind when he

319
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,333
put a spell on his
own carriage.

320
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,333
We're like a family to him.

321
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,333
He doesn't want
that to change.

322
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,333
Back when we were children,
neither the boss nor Hikaru

323
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:23,000
and I had many
friends to speak of.

324
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,375
Now he just wants to enjoy
what he has for as long

325
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,958
as he can.
I can't blame him.

326
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,791
Uh sorry but you've lost me.

327
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:37,166
But still, one of these days,
it'll all turn back into that

328
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,375
same ol' grubby pumpkin again.

329
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,666
Kaoru! Are you in there?

330
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,750
Kaoru!

331
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,125
Hikaru!

332
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,625
--Kaoru!
--Hikaru!

333
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,666
So what happened
to Fujioka?

334
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,666
Oh yeah, that's right.
Kinda lost track.

335
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,375
What's wrong with you?
I get us out of the net

336
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,041
and you go tearing off
by yourself?

337
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,250
Sorry.

338
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,333
There they are!

339
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,208
We've been so worried
about the four of you!

340
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,666
Why did you leave
your post in the middle

341
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,083
of the tournament?

342
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,375
We called off the whole thing
to go looking for you.

343
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,375
Wasn't that you guys
trying to scare us?

344
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,333
We didn't do anything.

345
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,291
What is it?

346
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,375
Outside by the window--

347
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,333
--there's a dark figure!

348
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,208
They sure got us.

349
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,666
Nekozawa is such a jerk.

350
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,541
How did we not know
that was Belzenef?

351
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,208
I heard.

352
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,166
You're really a fraidy-cat,
aren't you Kazukiyo? But you

353
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,791
still agreed to the
tournament just to be nice?

354
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,958
Um, yeah. Sure. That's it.

355
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:15,375
I think that's so
unbelievably sweet of you.

356
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,416
Would you look at that. I guess
the spell on the carriage

357
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,375
can't last forever after all.

358
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,833
What do you mean?

359
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,208
What's wrong with you?
I get us out and you go

360
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,916
tearing off by yourself?

361
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,916
Sorry.

362
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,625
Well, since you ran towards
me in that situation,

363
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,083
I suppose everything's
alright for now.

364
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,583
Nothing, nothing.
Just my own private joke.

365
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,416
Let's get out of here.

366
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,958
Still.

367
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,333
One day Hikaru will realize
he wants to take the

368
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,125
next step on his own.

369
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,541
When that happens.

370
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,166
I don't know what I'll do.

371
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,833
Huh? Mori-senpai
has an apprentice?

372
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,708
Wait a minute -- the
apprentice is from the

373
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:17,916
Kasanoda Syndicate?

374
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,458
Are you serious?

375
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,125
Next time, "Mori-senpai Has
an Apprentice Candidate"

376
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,958
The Ouran Host Club will
be waiting for you.

377
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,583
We'll see you then.
