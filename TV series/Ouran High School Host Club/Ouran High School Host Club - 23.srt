1
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,125
Hey, you okay?
I'm sorry about--

2
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,583
Get out!

3
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:33,250
Ma.

4
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,625
Ma!

5
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,291
"Tamaki's Unwitting
Depression."

6
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,833
Uh. My bad.

7
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:56,375
Peeping Tom!

8
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,333
You saw-- 

9
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,291
--didn't you, Bossa Nova?

10
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:05,041
No. I didn't see! I mean,
I caught a glance, yeah,

11
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,250
but it was all
so fast that I didn't-

12
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,541
It was just an accident!
I swear to you

13
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,166
that I am not a pervert!

14
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,500
Of course you would say that.

15
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,125
Sure sign of
a guilty conscience.

16
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,250
How is it that the lovely
item is the scariest person

17
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,750
in the room?

18
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,833
So then Fujioka's a girl?

19
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:34,041
Red alert. He's on to
Haruhi's little secret.

20
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,541
That's not good.

21
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,291
So let's hear it.

22
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,250
How much of her maidenly
terra incognita did

23
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,583
you actually see?

24
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:52,500
Well she was changing
so I saw her underwear.

25
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,958
You saw Haruhi's underwear?

26
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,750
So what do we do?

27
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,333
There's only one thing to do:
we have to induce amnesia.

28
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,666
Hold him.

29
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,583
That's enough, you two.
Leave assault and battery

30
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,166
to the professionals.

31
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,791
What are you, made of ice? How
can you be so calm about this?

32
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,708
Look! The boss is so deep
in shock he's regressing.

33
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,083
Well, now that it appears
the proverbial cat is

34
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,708
out of the bag. Let's talk.

35
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,000
Haruhi is compelled to hide
the fact that she's a girl

36
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,750
due to certain mitigating
circumstances.

37
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,166
While we can't physically force
you to cooperate exactly,

38
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,500
there is something
I would like for you

39
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,916
to bear in mind.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,125
Coming from the sort of
family you do, I'm certain

41
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,666
you hear all sorts
of juicy little rumors.

42
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,583
Enough to know what
is true and what is not.

43
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,666
Take the Ootori family's
private police force,

44
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,541
the Black Onion Squad.
It is said that

45
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,125
they can be mobilized
against our enemies

46
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,458
in the blink of an eye.

47
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,583
You have heard of them, right?

48
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,583
Clearly this isn't just a talk.

49
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:13,083
Come on guys. Stop scaring
Casanova. Sorry about all this.

50
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,708
Hey Fujioka.

51
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,333
Look, it's alright.
Doesn't really matter to me.

52
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,333
You can tell
whoever you want to.

53
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,750
Well well, Bossa Nova.

54
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,083
Since you know she's a girl,
are you in love?

55
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,333
Tetsuya, how is the Young Lord?

56
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,375
Did he refuse
to eat dinner again?

57
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,875
Yeah.

58
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,625
Damn it all, what is wrong with
him? Are we not giving him

59
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,833
the moral support
like you told us to?

60
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,375
When is he going to snap
the hell out of this?

61
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,500
And what about kick the can,
huh? Did I chug all those

62
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,333
drinks for nuthin'?

63
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,583
We were supposed to play.

64
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,375
I mean, did you see
his face when he came home

65
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,958
from school today?

66
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:29,000
The Young Lord looked like
he'd just killed somebody.

67
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,333
Stop it now! Please everyone.

68
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,250
You musn't be discouraged.
The emotional support has

69
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,666
been getting through
to him, I know it.

70
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,875
It's just--

71
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,250
What?

72
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,000
Well it's obvious that
there's something different

73
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,833
weighing on his mind today.

74
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,625
Well then, what's the matter?

75
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,541
As I was bringing the
Young Lord his dinner

76
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,000
earlier this evening--

77
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,916
Young Lord?

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,083
 Like. Love. Like. Love.

79
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:06,583
 Like. Love.

80
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,583
I knew it! I'm in
love with Fujioka!

81
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,125
So you're saying he's--

82
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,416
In love?

83
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,416
Does the Young Lord
even have a chance?

84
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,416
Oh yeah-- I see the two
of them hanging out together

85
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,291
at school all the time.
Fujioka does have

86
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,541
an unusually cute little
face. I mean, for a guy.

87
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,250
I don't understand.
What does that mean?

88
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,083
Means he's in love with a dude!

89
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,750
I'm sorry about
all this, Casanova.

90
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,541
This is bad.

91
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,708
Now that I know he's
a she I can't get her

92
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,291
out of my mind.

93
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,250
No peeking, you naughty boy.

94
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,125
She's just so cute.

95
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,250
Look, it's alright.
Doesn't matter to me.

96
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,000
You can tell
whoever you want to.

97
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:03,958
She was-- She was bluffing.
Oh how incredibly brave!

98
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,458
My poor Fujioka!
She must really be

99
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,125
in some kind of
desperate situation

100
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,750
if she has to dress
like a guy and pretend

101
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,083
to be a host!

102
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,791
All right. From this point
forward, I will keep Fujioka's

103
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,666
secret even if
it costs me my life!

104
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,583
It's Kasanoda, from class D.

105
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,041
I heard he made himself
Mori's apprentice.

106
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,166
I wonder if that means he's in
training to be a host, too.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,541
I'd like to request Fujioka.

108
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,083
What is this?

109
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,541
Is he for real?

110
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,625
The genuine article.

111
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,166
At long last!

112
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,416
Renge, is it true?
Is he really--?

113
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,083
Could he really be
that kind of persuasion?

114
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,333
What are they goin'
on about? You know,

115
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,875
before yesterday
people froze in terror

116
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,708
if I so much as looked at them.

117
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,625
But for some reason today
is different. However hard

118
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,708
I glare, no one is freezing.

119
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:32,291
Just the opposite.
All eyes are on me.

120
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,958
And it burns!

121
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,708
Welcome, Casanova.

122
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,666
So you're our guest today, huh?

123
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,250
Uh, that's right.

124
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:51,416
Come on, keep it together,
Ritsu. Don't lose your cool.

125
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,625
Would you like to have
some tea? How much sugar

126
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,166
do you normally put in?

127
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,291
Here, uh, let me help.

128
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,041
Now, now. You're
our guest. It's okay.

129
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,083
 Tea, made especially for me.

130
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:10,833
So tell me, is this your first
time in a place like this?

131
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,583
Haha. Gotcha.

132
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,666
You sure have this down, huh?

133
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,166
Well trust me, it didn't
come naturally at all;

134
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,541
at least not at first.
But then I realized

135
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,458
if I just sat back
and had fun with it,

136
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,833
everything sort of fell
into place on its own.

137
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,041
Hey, don't just stand there,
Kyoya-senpai.

138
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,416
Get him out of here.

139
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
If he's getting along
with his goons so well now,

140
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,833
why does he need to be here
in the first place?

141
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,083
He has kept Haruhi's secret
so far and, since he is

142
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,250
after all a paying guest, I can
see no reason to eject him.

143
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,416
But the other guests are afraid!

144
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,375
Oh, no I think not.

145
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,541
Observe.

146
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,166
The look on his face
is just priceless.

147
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,583
I've never seen someone
so in love before!

148
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,791
Hello, Sumire? Forget about
you stupid violin lesson

149
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,416
and hightail it to the
Host Club! I'm telling you,

150
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,208
this is a one-in-million
chance to witness

151
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,083
something truly amazing!

152
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,791
Hello, Kurakano? You've got
to get to the Host Club

153
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,875
right now! If you don't,
you'll regret it for

154
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,291
the rest of your life.

155
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,708
See? We're just fine.
Thanks to him we may even set

156
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,583
a new record.

157
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,333
You money-grubbing enabler!

158
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,625
Can I pour you
another cup of tea?

159
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,291
Uh, yes. Thank you.

160
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,083
Oh no, she's giving him
the adorable smile--

161
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,791
--The one which
no man can resist!

162
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,083
Wow. Usually you guys
wouldn't waste any time

163
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,750
interrupting the two of them.

164
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah but our hands are tied.
After our screw-up in

165
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,041
Karuizawa, Haruhi would
never forgive us

166
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,250
if we butted in.

167
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,250
Karuizawa was really
your screw-up, Hikaru.

168
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,083
Hey boss, are you done
being shell-shocked yet?

169
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,916
Yeah, we could really use
our king right about now.

170
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,291
Go get 'em!

171
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,708
Ma.

172
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,375
Tamaki-senpai?

173
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,125
Um, just what exactly
are you doing?

174
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,416
Hey, if you want to sit down,
do it over there.

175
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,666
You can play with this
if you need a distraction.

176
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,708
It's a little freebie I got
at the supermarket when

177
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,750
I bought the instant
coffee earlier.

178
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,750
Look I've solved it, Haruhi.

179
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,416
Wow, that was fast. Okay,
now try to see if you can

180
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,041
put them back together.

181
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,333
Ma.

182
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,666
That moron!

183
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,000
Ma?

184
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,833
Earth to Boss! Will you
snap out of it already?

185
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,791
The longer you sit there like
an idiot playing "robot"

186
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,541
the worse the situation
becomes for all of us!

187
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,000
Ma.

188
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:08,541
Now, listen to me carefully.
You can't let this happen.

189
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,958
If she and that
two-bit thug hit it off

190
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,666
she's going to spend her life--
as a mob-wife!

191
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,750
Ma?

192
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,333
Lowlife snitch.
You ratted me out!

193
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,000
What? No way!

194
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,791
Daddy won't stand for that!

195
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,708
Ugh. Please don't do this.

196
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,875
Bossa Nova!

197
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,208
Just what do you think
you're trying to do here?

198
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,291
You established a bond
with your henchmen,

199
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,958
didn't you? Why aren't
you with them right now?

200
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,500
You tell him, sir!

201
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,833
Yeah!

202
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,583
What about kick the can?
You remember that?

203
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,791
You should be out there enjoying
life to the fullest with

204
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,333
your friends while you're still
young enough to appreciate

205
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,625
it before it all slips away
right under your nose!

206
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:18,333
Why are you harassing
my Haruhi?

207
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,791
As her father,
I forbid you to see her.

208
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,791
Wait, what? You're telling me
that you're Fuijoka's dad?

209
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,916
You have got to be kidding me.
That's just not possible.

210
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,625
Oh no.

211
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,958
He's painted the boss
into a corner.

212
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,125
Well, we might not
be related by blood.

213
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,208
Okay, so, what're you
married to her mom then?

214
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:59,916
No, as a matter of fact.
I've never met the woman.

215
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,916
So I guess you're really
not her father are you?

216
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,291
Wah! Tama-chan!
I'll catch you!

217
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,708
He's right you know.
Strictly speaking,

218
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,625
I'm not Haruhi's real father.

219
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,333
Uh, strictly speaking
or otherwise.

220
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,416
Hey look. He's waking up.

221
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,333
I need to sort this out.

222
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,333
Sort what out exactly?

223
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:01,750
If supposing I'm not my
Haruhi's daddy after all--

224
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,708
We don't have
to suppose it, Boss.

225
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:09,125
Then how can it be that I
find her so utterly adorable?

226
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,875
What are you talking about?

227
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,208
When she's with another man,
why is it that I become

228
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,291
so insanely jealous?

229
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:25,166
I'm not her father. I have no
right to be so protective.

230
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,583
No right whatsoever.

231
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,208
So then, uh, tell me what
exactly is with the whole

232
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,958
"making Haruhi your wife
one day" thing?

233
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,583
I know! Daddy's don't typically
want to marry their

234
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,375
little girls when they're
all grown up do they?

235
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,250
What about keeping her
from kissing anyone?

236
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:45,166
I only wanted to preserve
those precious lips.

237
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,125
Preserve? Really?

238
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,583
That's a very interesting
choice of words, sir.

239
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,291
You think everything
is absolutely perfect,

240
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,208
just the way it is now.

241
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,375
And having this family
setting will keep it all

242
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,125
from changing, right?

243
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,500
Hey Kaoru?

244
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,208
I don't understand.

245
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,750
He's an idiot!

246
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,333
Is he really that oblivious?

247
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,958
Actually, he's got a point.
I mean, you're delusional,

248
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,666
yes, any halfwit could
see that but who knew

249
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,375
that you were so--?

250
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,625
Tama-chan's completely blind
when it comes to himself!

251
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,708
Kaoru, just what did you mean
by things changing?

252
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,125
Oh.

253
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,041
Nothing. Just a little
theory I have.

254
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,291
Which I'm probably
completely wrong about.

255
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,625
You think everything's
alright over there? I mean,

256
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,083
I didn't say anything
to set him off, did I?

257
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,791
Who knows? Although,
when I think about it,

258
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,166
Tamaki-senpai is like
my dad in some ways.

259
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,000
Did you hear that gentlemen?
Apparently in some ways

260
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,083
I am like Haruhi's father!

261
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,541
Well to be more precise,
I think what she's saying is

262
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,333
that while you and
her father do share some

263
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,500
personality traits,
in actuality-

264
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:06,541
I've got it! I've got it now!
I'm like a father to her!

265
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,791
And we've lost him yet again.

266
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,583
Fujioka. Um.

267
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,833
Do you think that we could
maybe do this more often?

268
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,375
Because, I was just thinking,
since you entertain girls

269
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,750
all day long it might kind of
give you a break from all that.

270
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,083
You know, if I came around.

271
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,666
I mean if--if you
want that, that is.

272
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:35,208
Absolutely! That way you and
I could get more aquainted.

273
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,666
Here it comes!

274
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,750
Fujioka, I--

275
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:57,875
Loosing control.
Can't hold back feelings--

276
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,625
I, uh, have something to say.

277
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,125
I just wanted to tell you.

278
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:18,708
I just wanted
to tell you. That I'm--

279
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,708
That you're excited to have
someone you can relate to,

280
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,333
aren't you?

281
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,125
I know I sure am.
A conversation like this is

282
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,541
a rare thing for me.
We're going to be

283
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,041
great friends.

284
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,416
Uh oh. Hung out to dry.

285
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,166
He totally just got shot down!

286
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,750
He didn't even get a chance
to profess his love!

287
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,125
Oh. The friends thing.
That really stings!

288
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,458
I bet that rejection haunts
him for the rest of his life.

289
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,458
Aw, the poor guy.

290
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,500
It's so tragic.

291
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,958
Okay. Did not think
that one through.

292
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,333
I guess if she has
to live her life as a guy,

293
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:09,750
dating a guy would probably
raise some suspicions.

294
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,208
So be it, then. For Fujioka's
sake, there's only

295
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,916
one thing to do.

296
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,291
Of course the two of us
are going to be friends!

297
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,458
Best of friends! Forever!

298
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,375
Bossa Nova!

299
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,500
Kasanoda!

300
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,500
Casanova!

301
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,791
How lovely.
How absolutely beautiful!

302
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,208
You've moved us to tears!

303
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,583
We'll be your friends!

304
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,958
That was breathtaking!

305
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,375
Do it again!

306
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,833
We want to be friends
with you, too, Boss Nova!

307
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,500
Let's play kick the can!

308
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,333
I know I'm your senpai,
but I'll still be your friend!

309
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,250
You can even hold Usa-chan!

310
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,916
I'll include a
special piece on you in

311
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,791
"Moe Moe Ouran Diaries,
Vol. 11!"

312
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,291
Adieu, brave one!

313
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,666
What's the matter, Tamaki?

314
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,250
When I think about
how Bossa Nova must have

315
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,583
been feeling, my heart
goes out to him a little.

316
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:22,041
That's strange, isn't it?
I mean, as Haruhi's father,

317
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,541
you shouldn't feel
sympathy for the man

318
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,708
who tried to take your
precious little girl away,

319
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,291
now should you?

320
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,000
Hyper Starlight Kick!

321
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:52,750
One. Two. Three. Four.

322
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,083
Here quick! In here!

323
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,083
Hey, what are you doing?
This hiding place is only

324
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,708
for Haruhi and me, got it?

325
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,041
What kind of a rule is that?

326
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,375
Yeah! And for that matter,
why do you and Haruhi

327
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,041
always have to hide together
in the first place?

328
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,500
Idiot! It is perfectly natural
for a father to hide

329
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,916
with his daughter!

330
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,875
Some might disagree.

331
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,708
Would all of you just be quiet!

332
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,958
So, Hika-chan may seem
oblivious, but deep down

333
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,375
he's beginning to
understand his feelings?

334
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,083
And even though it's clear
to the rest of us

335
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,458
how Tama-chan feels,
he's still completely

336
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,208
in the dark about it himself?

337
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,291
Yeah.

338
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,791
Then what about
Kao-chan and Kyo-chan?

339
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,666
Between the two of them, I'll
bet there's someone even more

340
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,083
oblivious than Tama-chan is.

341
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,208
Considering that, I wonder
if something really big

342
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,291
is gonna happen
before we graduate.

343
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,583
You never know.

344
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,625
Well for starters,
why even kick the can?

345
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,625
Hey, stop pushing so hard.

346
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,333
Get your hands off my Haruhi!

347
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,958
She doesn't belong to you!

348
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,458
Oh yeah! If not me, then who?

349
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,583
I do not belong to anybody!

350
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,416
Kyoya-senpai, how does someone
cool like you get roped

351
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,708
into something as crazy
as the Host Club?

352
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,333
The secret of the Host Club's
birth is about to be revealed!

353
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:20,333
Will you please shut up?

354
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,750
Next time:
"And so Kyoya Met Him."

355
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,750
The Ouran Host Club
will be waiting for you.

356
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,166
We'll see you then.
