00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:46.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:11.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:50.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

receives an alert,

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:52.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
