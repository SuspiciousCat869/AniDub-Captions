138
00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:51.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

are just so strange.

140
00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

that over the past few years,

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:10.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:28.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's as if there's some
other meaning to his message,

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

someone else what that is.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:26.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[groans] Anyway,

178
00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's all tangled together.
It's a bad omen.

179
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:33.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't seem to shake
this feeling, and...

180
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I tried to stop thinking,
because everyone told me to,

181
00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but that didn't last long.

182
00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:40.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So then, once I started thinking
about the case again,

183
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
all of my thoughts
got jumbled up inside my head.

00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I spent all night

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so this morning,
I decided to come here.

186
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That doesn't strike me as smart.

187
00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:55.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lily] "Smart doesn't

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sometimes being foolish
is the answer."

00:10:57.573 --> 00:10:59.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's one of your lines,

190
00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:01.786 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

191
00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:03.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did he also give you my address?

192
00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He told me lots of things.
He likes to talk.

193
00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That man's old.

194
00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:10.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He'll ramble on and on
without me even asking.

195
00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:13.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But coming to see you today
was all my idea.

196
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:15.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can tell him this--

197
00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
stop putting stupid ideas
in your head.

198
00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's so annoying.

199
00:11:19.303 --> 00:11:21.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And here I thought
you were gonna be helpful!

200
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought you were
the only person on the planet

201
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:28.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who could untangle these
confusing knots in my head!

202
00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:31.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why I came here,
Keith Flick...

203
00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:34.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to talk to Genie, the genius.

204
00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:35.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait. What? That's weird.

206
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong with this?

207
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:44.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let's say the culprit
behind these recent incidents

208
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-is this pastry...
-A tasty-looking criminal.

209
00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and this bun in the perp.

210
00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:52.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The zeppole is Killer B.

211
00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We know there's no interaction
between these two,

212
00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:57.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so there's a giant gap
in these cases.

213
00:11:57.091 --> 00:12:00.136 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If my theory's correct,
there's something we're missing

214
00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:03.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in this gap that links
the two cases together.

215
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:05.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

on the outside,

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if we tear the red bean bun
in half and...

00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:23.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lily] Now it makes sense.

[Keith] I've lost my appetite.

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know! It's a jumble, chaos!

222
00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:29.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your point?

223
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

224
00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

225
00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:35.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you're saying it's a mess?

226
00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:36.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not!

227
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then what are you saying?

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Figure this stuff out
before speaking, idiot.

230
00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:48.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I could, I wouldn't
have needed to come here!

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why didn't you say that before?

232
00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you owe these buns
an apology.

234
00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:58.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Idiots like you shouldn't make
pointless presentations.

236
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.202 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, I know that there's
a third player out there

237
00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:07.453 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
no one knows about.

238
00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:10.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's disguised
as something else,

239
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so even though
it's in plain sight,

240
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:13.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
no one can see it.

241
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.463 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a balance that's
currently being maintained,

242
00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:20.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
but the instant the disguise
is revealed, it'll take action,

243
00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:23.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
expanding with the speed
of a subatomic particle

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.722 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
and swallowing up
the whole country.

00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:29.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Then a cycle of multiple
incidents will begin,

246
00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and before we know it,
we'll all be reduced

247
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to nothing more
than powerless spectators.

248
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:39.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know it sounds like
some stupid conspiracy theory,

249
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:42.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I can't find evidence
to the contrary.

250
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's what
I keep thinking about,

251
00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:45.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and my thoughts
get all mixed-up.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:25.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
