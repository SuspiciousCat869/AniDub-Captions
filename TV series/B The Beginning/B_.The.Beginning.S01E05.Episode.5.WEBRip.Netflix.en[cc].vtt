00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:48.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Ten, eight, 18.

324
00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:04.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Converting the hands
into letters,

325
00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:07.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
starting from the top,
we get J, H, R...

326
00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:09.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and French.

327
00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A very simple code,

328
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.802 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but a question still remains.

329
00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why would Brandon
do something so intricate

330
00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:18.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with his life on the line?

331
00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:21.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He couldn't leave a message
in the elevator,

332
00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:24.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because his attacker was someone
who could return to the scene

333
00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:26.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and remove any evidence,

334
00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:28.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so he started thinking.

335
00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even as his consciousness faded

336
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he feared
he was going to die,

337
00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:34.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he frantically thought of a way
to get a message to me.

338
00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:38.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Five people have those initials,

339
00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:41.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but there's only one person who
uses the French pronunciation

340
00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:45.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
as a sign of trust and respect
from his fellow detectives.

341
00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:47.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't want to believe it,

346
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:07.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So how long have you known?

347
00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:10.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I first suspected you
eight years ago

348
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:12.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when I discovered
the multi-camera program.

349
00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:15.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was immediately
after we had solved that case.

350
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

pretending to be my friend

351
00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:20.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

352
00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:21.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

353
00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:25.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

354
00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:28.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For as long as I live,
I'll never forgive you.

355
00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:33.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll do it over

357
00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

358
00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:39.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

359
00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:43.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

360
00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:44.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

361
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:49.646 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

362
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to keep them safe this time?

363
00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:54.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

364
00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:56.820 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you do it?!

365
00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:06.038 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you will be the last to go.

366
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:08.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

367
00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:13.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

is reduced to nothing but ruin.

368
00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:16.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
