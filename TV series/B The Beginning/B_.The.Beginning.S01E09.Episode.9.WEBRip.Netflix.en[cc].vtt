I'll prove that I
can do this all by myself!

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

Lily, I want you
to watch this very closely.

[Keith] I can't believe
you used Lily.

11
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:22.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
INTERROGATION ROOM

12
00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Eric] You don't approve?

13
00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:25.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Not really.

14
00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Eric] So what's your endgame?

15
00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I doubt you'd willingly
turn yourself in without one.

16
00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:35.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My endgame?

17
00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You certainly turned out to be
a rather suspicious individual.

18
00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.975 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And whose fault would that be?

19
00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:49.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what he's up to, right?

20
00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>The answer</i>
<i>you've been looking for</i>

21
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>has been</i>
<i>right underneath your noses.</i>

22
00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Eric] I see.

23
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's get down to brass tacks.

24
00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Market Maker's involvement
in this has made

25
00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
any fact-finding attempt
pointless for us.

26
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In that case,
we just expose things

27
00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that reflect badly
on the country.

28
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:12.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

29
00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a strong possibility

30
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the leader of Market Maker
is off his rocker

31
00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and more than likely
abusing his position.

32
00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:23.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My point, this deranged leader
is deriving pleasure

33
00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
from tormenting me
about my sister's death,

34
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they're exploiting
their position

35
00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:30.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to commit a string of murders
purely out of self-interest.

36
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>It's about as reprehensible</i>
<i>as it gets,</i>

37
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>so all we have to do</i>
<i>is inform the country.</i>

38
00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.950 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Eric] <i>Impossible. They run</i>
<i>an extremely tight ship.</i>

39
00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Keith] <i>Exactly.</i>

40
00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:43.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
An organization
that orchestrates madness

41
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
would never guess that madness
is being spread from within.

42
00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:48.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If that's true,

43
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then there's
a single disease vector,

44
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and knowing you, you've already
come up with a theory

45
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as to who that vector is.

46
00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:59.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not act on it?

47
00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I don't have
any hard evidence at this point.

48
00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As far as I can tell,

49
00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this man has religiously
maintained the same routine

50
00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
every day
for the past eight years.

51
00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Assuming he can't control
his homicidal urges,

52
00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
getting a bead
on his murder patterns

53
00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
gets that much harder.

54
00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Homicidal urges?

55
00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So he has
impulse-control disorder?

56
00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, and not just him.

57
00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you saying
he has accomplices?

58
00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:33.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wouldn't
necessarily go that far.

59
00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

60
00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:37.091 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm still unsure.

61
00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:40.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I figured I'd come back here
to confirm it in person.

62
00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does that mean...

63
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

64
00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The killer is close by.

65
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We only have a few hours left

66
00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to find what you couldn't
in eight years.

67
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you hoping
to uncover in that time?

68
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks to the snot-head on
the other side of that mirror,

69
00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
nothing's gone
according to plan.

70
00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't do a damn thing
by myself in our--

71
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's taken you this long
to figure that out?!

72
00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's like you've been living
in a blasted fantasy world!

73
00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've got mental muscle in
spades, but none anywhere else,

74
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is why you're not able
to do anything by yourself!

75
00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How the hell
can you be such a dumb-ass?!

76
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eric's showing his true colors.

77
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He can get that way
now and again when he's drunk.

78
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

79
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and now you have the gall
to blame us?! [gasps]

80
00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Apologies.

81
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everything I learned about
police work, I learned from you.

82
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's a point of pride for me.

83
00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:50.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Every time I do something,

84
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:54.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always ask myself,
"What would Keith Flick do?"

85
00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look sharp. That's our cue.

86
00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Took long enough.

[Keith] What's going on here?

89
00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Eric] It doesn't matter
how convoluted the instructions.

90
00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:16.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The team in this room
can follow them to the letter.

91
00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've assembled
the very best around

92
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and have drilled into them
everything that you taught me.

93
00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Any idea why?

94
00:05:29.787 --> 00:05:33.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Eight years ago, after we
got fed up with that show trial,

95
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we plotted to kidnap Dead Kyle
and bring to light

96
00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
all of the heinous crimes
that we had uncovered.

97
00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:43.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That said,
the whole thing was my idea,

98
00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you acted on your own
and left us all behind,

99
00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and as a result,
I found myself

100
00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the awkward position
of having to arrest you.

101
00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would you do such a thing?

102
00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Were you protecting me,
or had you lost control?

103
00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:03.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To this day, I still don't know.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But what I do know is that we
were missing something that day,

105
00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:10.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
something I've found,

Let's turn this thing around

113
00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm doing it,
no matter what you say.

122
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

123
00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My first day back, we met,

126
00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

129
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could say that.

130
00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

131
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He still talks to Erika,
even now.

132
00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could I trouble you

142
00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:06.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Long story short, I'm
the only one who wasn't busy.

143
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right, that thing with Genie.

144
00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It must be difficult.

145

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:17.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

147
00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:19.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, I'd have to agree.

148
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact,
there aren't many cases...

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

152
00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:43.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thing is, I'll keep believing
in him to the bitter end.

157
00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's surprising
he's won your trust,

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:05.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always find myself
thinking about him.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:10.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

or is she...
