00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
then why don't you

I don't, not really.

There's a question
I've been dying to ask.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

32
00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Has she noticed the marks
you've been leaving for her?

33
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
From the looks of things,

34
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
she hasn't responded
to them yet.

35
00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:26.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And after all of your hard work.

38
00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

39
00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's very upstanding of you.

40
00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:42.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here. Take it.

41
00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

42
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

any grown-ups around

43
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

45
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you know about it?

46
00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing, I guess.

47
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

48
00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with the meaning of the mark
you always leave behind.

49
00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

52
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that's only used on clocks...

53
00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

66
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

67
00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:08.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
must be because there's
something you wanted to ask.

108
00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:43.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. Boris said you and Keith
are old friends

109
00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who've known each other
for a very long time.

110
00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:49.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right. I've known him

111
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're best of friends.

112
00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:55.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, Doctor, do you

113
00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What about you?

114
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:59.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I don't think he's guilty.

115
00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, there you go.

116
00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you could, please tell me

117
00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:04.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
everything you can about--

118
00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In all the years
I've known Keith Flick,

119
00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
one thing hasn't changed.
He's an exceptionally dull man.

120
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He can readily predict
what lies ahead,

121
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:16.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which is why it's hard
for him to act in the moment.

122
00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh-huh. So then, you're implying

123
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this incident
doesn't seem to be premeditated,

124
00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which would rule out Keith
as a suspect.

125
00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is that
what you're trying to say?

126
00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:27.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know all the particulars
of this case,

127
00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but if he is under suspicion,

128
00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:32.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it probably means he
isn't guilty of any wrongdoing.

129
00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:36.414 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That guy just couldn't do
anything so careless.

130
00:07:36.497 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't you mean he wouldn't?

131
00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, my dear, couldn't.

132
00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Interesting.

133
00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:48.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Same old story.

134
00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

which is fascinating

137
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:59.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

less-than-pleasant personality.

138
