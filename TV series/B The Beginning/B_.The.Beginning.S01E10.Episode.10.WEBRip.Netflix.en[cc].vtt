110
00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:45.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

131
00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:55.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

There's no traffic at sea.

00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:00.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

137
00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:06.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the Ramon Harbor.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

140
00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:13.743 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

144
00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

145
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:26.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:08:28.132 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%
