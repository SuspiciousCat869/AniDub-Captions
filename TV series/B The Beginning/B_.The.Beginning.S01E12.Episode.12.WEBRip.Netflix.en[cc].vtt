Let me give you
one piece of advice.

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:24.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

4
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

go near the Jetblack.

7
00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:33.116 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who was called a god
because of his power,

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

11
00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in the inscription.

25
00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then...

26
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the legend of a new king

27
00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:30.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<i>This is what it boils down to.</i>

30
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.403 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What if a vaccine were incubated
using Minatsuki's body

31
00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

32
00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:57.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a treatment that could stabilize
the Reggies was developed?

33
00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I suppose the public

34
00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:01.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

35
00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.623 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
namely that the funds raised
for reviving gods

36
00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:05.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Moreover, everyone will learn
that the military oversaw it

38
00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.881 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

In his later years, my father
was starting to come around

42
00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:30.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

43
00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:36.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps in his old age,
he grew sentimental.

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

54
00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:18.740 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

55
00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you get Minatsuki

56
00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:54.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-He actually left.
-[Brandon] What's going on?

320
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ignore him.
-Ah, well.

321
00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:58.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess this means things
are getting back to normal.

322
00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:00.717 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Brandon] Hey, guys...
-When this began,

323
00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:02.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
people talked
about Market Maker,

324
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:03.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Jaula Blanca, "bad cops."

325
00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:05.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There was a worldwide ruckus
over the whole mess.

326
00:21:05.889 --> 00:21:07.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Brandon]
...ticking time bomb...

327
00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:09.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's quiet again
after only three months.

328
00:21:09.184 --> 00:21:10.477 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you stop ignoring me?!

329
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's just the way
we human beings are wired.

330
00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:14.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We get bored easily
and also forget.

331
00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:18.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's why we can start over.
-I know, but there's still

332
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a ton of loose ends
that needs to be tied up.

333
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:22.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, you're right.
Which is exactly why

334
00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he's coming all the way back
from headquarters.

335
00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:27.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
That may be,
but I can't shake the feeling

336
00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:28.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
that once Keith gets back,

337
00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:31.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
we're gonna be up to our ears
in disturbing incidents again.

338
00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Brandon] Why are
you being so mean?!

339
00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:35.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-I can hardly wait for it.
-You scare me.

340
00:21:40.924 --> 00:21:43.302 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Knock! Knock, knock, knock,
knock, knock,

341
00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:45.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
knock, knock,
knock, knock, knock...

342
00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Knock it off!
Just come in, would you?

343
00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:49.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lovely morning!

344
00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:53.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fresh from Matsuya!

345
00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:55.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't make music
by knocking on the door

346
00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:58.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did it with
a half-time shuffle today!

347
00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:00.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You don't do anything right,
do you?

348
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
And... up.

349
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:03.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
COULDN'T DO IT AT ALL

350
00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:05.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm? Hmm?

351
00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:06.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They left already.

352
00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:08.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What?!
What are you talking about?

353
00:22:09.077 --> 00:22:10.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I even bought two extra.

354
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know!

355
00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:13.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If that's all you wanted,
get outta here.

356
00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:16.793 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you serious? Today's your
first day back at the office!

357
00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:19.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Boris gave me direct orders
to drag you in,

358
00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:21.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
even if I had to slap a leash
on your face!

359
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Therefore, I went out
and bought a rope!

360
00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:26.344 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Agh! My rope!

361
00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:28.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't it great?

362
00:22:28.388 --> 00:22:30.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell is it?

363
00:22:30.265 --> 00:22:32.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I took the liberty
of buying myself a '58.

364
00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:34.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know she looks pretty dainty,

365
00:22:34.352 --> 00:22:36.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I swapped out
her engine for a 356

366
00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:38.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and customized the exhaust
manifold to do 140--

367
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:40.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, wait!
-I can't fit into that, idiot.

368
00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I'm walking.
-Do as you're told,

369
00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:44.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or else I'm
getting the rope again!

370
00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:49.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Be grateful when someone
offers you a lift.

371
00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, shut up.

372
00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:56.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lily] I should have
asked earlier.

373
00:22:56.333 --> 00:22:57.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm?

374
00:22:57.334 --> 00:22:58.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
About Erika.

375
00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Adopted.
-I knew it.

376
00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:02.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She didn't look
anything like you.

377
00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:03.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
'Scuse me?

378
00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Forget it. It's nothing.

379
00:23:06.843 --> 00:23:10.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You know, something's been on
my mind for a little while now.

380
00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:11.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
What?

381
00:23:11.598 --> 00:23:13.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
He died
with a smile on his face.

382
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I've been trying to figure out
the emotion behind it,

383
00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:18.772 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
but I can't seem to come up
with an answer.

384
00:23:18.855 --> 00:23:21.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lily] Satisfaction?
Superiority?

385
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[engine revs]

386
00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Keith] What else would it be?

387
00:23:25.403 --> 00:23:27.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Gratitude.

388
00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:29.991 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is gonna
sound way out there,

389
00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but what if Gilbert wanted

390
00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:33.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to finally put an end
to his madness,

391
00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:35.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but the multiple personalities

392
00:23:35.622 --> 00:23:38.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
rattling around in his head
wouldn't let him?

393
00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:42.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Basically, he was
no longer in control of himself.

394
00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe he put his destiny
in your hands, you know?

395
00:23:45.006 --> 00:23:47.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And in the end, when it
came to stopping his madness

396
00:23:47.717 --> 00:23:50.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
once and for all,
he entrusted that role

397
00:23:50.178 --> 00:23:53.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to Keith Flick, who's the one
and only person superior to him.

398
00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:57.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you arrived at that place
just as he hoped you would

399
00:23:57.894 --> 00:24:01.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and pulled the trigger,
releasing him from his pain.

400
00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:05.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's only
one thing I know for sure.

401
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Gilbert's the real winner
in all this.

402
00:24:11.575 --> 00:24:13.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're saying you're
not frustrated or anything?

403
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.537 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? Should I be?

404
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, isn't that essentially
the same as admitting defeat?

405
00:24:18.331 --> 00:24:21.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh. I couldn't give a damn
about stuff like that.

406
00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:23.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you sure?

407
00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:25.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To be honest, winning and losing

408
00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:29.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
were never that important,
not to me and him.

409
00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:33.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One sets out a puzzle.
The other solves it.

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:37.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

nothing more than that.

00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:41.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What matters now is how hectic
things are gonna get at work.
