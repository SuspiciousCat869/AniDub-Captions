00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Boris] I changed it?
-[Lily] You didn't notice?!

108
00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

109
00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:42.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh-oh.
What's with the dramatic sigh?

110
00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't tell me you're starting
to feel sick or something.

111
00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Killer B wasn't the one
who did this.

112
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh?
-Hmm?

113
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:50.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Care to explain that?

114
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't you see his usual symbol
is there in front of your eyes?

115
00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:56.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, Keith, what makes you
think it wasn't him?

116
00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:59.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. It's sloppy.

117
00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You mind explaining it in a way
the rest of us can follow?

118
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The angles are not naive.

119
00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:06.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What the heck
is he talking about?

120
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No clue.
It's one of his Genie-isms.

121
00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:11.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Eric, could you
come with me for a minute?

122
00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's something
you should see.

123
00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Keith] Don't get any closer.
-[gasps]

124
00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Keith,
you thinking what I'm thinking?

125
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

126
00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:42.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[doctor]
This is worrisome.

127
00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Keith] Sure is worrisome.

128
00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The cause of death for our
friend in there was poison gas.

129
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are also symptoms

130
00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of ingested nerve gas
and a blistering agent.

131
00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The killer
must have manufactured a gas

132
00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that combines
the properties of each.

133
00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It doesn't act
as fast as nerve gas,

134
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's not as slow
as a blistering agent.

135
00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
One thing's clear.

136
00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whoever made the stuff
is twisted.

137
00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The killer obviously wants
to ensure their victims suffer

138
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the most horrible of ways
before they're murdered.

139
00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is there a countermeasure?

140
00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm afraid not.

141
00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>If this were an existing gas,</i>

142
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>there would be</i>
<i>some way to counteract it,</i>

143
00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:32.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>but this is something new.</i>
<i>Refinements have been added.</i>

144
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I've asked the Army Institute</i>

145
00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:37.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

<i>how long it'll take</i>

146
00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>to come up with</i>
<i>an effective counteragent.</i>

147
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:42.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At any rate,
I can't make it here.

148
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The most I can do
is prepare a preventative,

149
00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which I suppose
is better than nothing.

150
00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:49.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Think it'll work?

151
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No idea.
-Aren't you helpful?

152
00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't know if it'll work
if I haven't made it yet, can I?

153
00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or would you
rather hear the odds?

154
00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not today.

155
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:02.940 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I knew the odds,
I'd probably lose all hope.

156
00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:06.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you can take solace
in the fact they're not zero.

157
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Spoken with the cold bluntness
of a doctor.

158
00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:13.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you have a problem with it,
I suppose you should tell Eric

159
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to apprehend the criminal
before they can use the gas.

160
00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:18.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll do that, Doctor.

161
00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Genie...

162
00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
are you still searching?

163
00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:27.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's been seven years now.

164
00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you learned anything
in all that time?

165
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't yet say for sure.

166
00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not?

167
00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:39.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I found a clue that will
lead me directly to the killer.

168
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Eric] What you see here is
an invitation to a charity party

169
00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:53.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
sent by the Mayor
to the murdered assemblyman.

170
00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Boris] A warning that he's
gonna hit the place, huh?

171
00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Mario] Any chance it's a bluff?

172
00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:01.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We detected real poison gas
in the container

173
00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:03.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when we examined the box
that was left beside the corpse.

174
00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
However,
it was only a small amount.

175
00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
According to the report I have

176
00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
from the Royal Institute
of Forensic Medicine,

177
00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's a substance
they have never seen before,

178
00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but apparently
it's highly lethal.

179
00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:18.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Releasing something like that
at a party would be disastrous.

180
00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:20.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It could potentially affect
the whole region.

181
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it does, we're looking at
millions of innocent lives lost,

182
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:25.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
depending
on the weather conditions.

183
00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Boris] How the hell did
our perp get their filthy hands

184
00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
on a nasty gas
like that, anyway?

185
00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not like you can buy it
at a convenience store.

186
00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:39.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The victim found in the attic
is Ian Reyes, age 42, male.

187
00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was a senior researcher
at Premio Farmacia

188
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
until he went missing
about six months ago,

189
00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
which caused a missing persons
report to be filed.

190
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Mario] So this guy
definitely made the gas.

191
00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:51.507 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Brandon] Yeah,
but we still don't know

192
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if he was coerced or not.

193
00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Boris] Do you think
he outlived his usefulness?

194
00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:58.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Jonathan, work the Reyes angle
and look into his acquaintances.

195
00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes, sir.
-Kaela, you contact

196
00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:03.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the relevant ministries
and research agencies.

197
00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you find out
if materials or equipment

198
00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that could be used
to make poison gas

199
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
have been reported
stolen or missing?

200
00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

201
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mario and the rest,

202
00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:13.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
head over to the party location.

203
00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:15.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Check out suspicious people
or objects

204
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and put together
a plan for security.

205
00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Lastly, to avoid
unnecessary panic,

206
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we've been informed
not to reveal

207
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
anything about the gas
to the public.

208
00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Brandon] Man, I'm not sure

209
00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:29.754 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's even possible
to cover a building this big.

210
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what if this plan
doesn't work?

211
00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has to.
