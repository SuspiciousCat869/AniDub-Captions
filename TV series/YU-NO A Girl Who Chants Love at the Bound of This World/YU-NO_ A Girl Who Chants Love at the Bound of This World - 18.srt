00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:12,442
[TAKUYA]
Dad?

2
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:16,150
[KODAI] Oh. You came
to save Kanna, did you?

3
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,525
Pretty impressive, for you.

4
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:22,192
The truth of the matter is,

5
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:25,067
without psychite,
Kanna won't survive.

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,567
Keiko was exactly the same.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,150
[TAKUYA]
Where is mom now?

8
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,650
Don't worry.
Keiko is here with me.

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:37,525
In a world that's known, in the
realm of philosophy, as "Idea."

10
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:39,400
[TAKUYA]
I'm coming after you, Dad.

11
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:40,858
Just stay there and wait for me.

12
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:42,900
[KODAI]
Yes, it's time, I think.

13
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:44,233
Although time as we know it

14
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:47,442
doesn't actually mean
anything at all.

15
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:51,275
Which is a lesson you're
about to learn very well.

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,942
[TAKUYA]
So, this is Dela Granto?

17
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,692
[TAKUYA]
Huh...

18
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:19,900
Wonder if those are edible?

[TAKUYA grunting]

20
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:25,108
If my dad wanted me
to play survivalist,

21
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:26,442
the least he could've done was

22
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:28,983
give me a little heads-up
or something!

[TAKUYA]
It's been years since I've spent

28
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,150
so much time in the woods.

29

be able to get back to Kanna.

[SAYLESS]
Help me!

00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,608
[TAKUYA]
Who's there?

40
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,483
[SAYLESS]
No!

41
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:15,317
Stay away!

You okay?

53
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,233
Mind if I ask your name?
Where did you come from?

[gasps]

55
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:51,192
Wait a minute,
can you not speak?

56
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:52,692
That's odd.

57
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,692
Could've sworn I heard a girl's
voice calling out before.

58
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,692
[SAYLESS sighs]

59
00:04:57,775 --> 00:05:00,775
Ha, ha! Not sure what to do,
but you know,

60
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:04,692
you're pretty much my only hope
in this world, so, here we go!

61
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:08,108
My name's Takuya.

00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:10,650
Ta-ku-ya.

63
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,692
And I promise I'm not scary.

64
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,275
See? Look!

65
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:22,900
[SAYLESS laughs]

66
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:25,400
Ha, ha! Good, a laugh!

67
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,442
[gasps]

68
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,150
Why don't you tell me
if your name starts with

69
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,192
any of these letters, okay?

70
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:50,692
A... That's I, U, E, O?

71
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:53,317
How 'bout...

72
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,567
Ka, Ki, Ku, Ke, Ko?

73
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:03,150
Welp, looks like this
is gonna take a while.

74
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:09,900
[TAKUYA] All right, what we know
is, your name is Sayless.

75
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,358
And you don't know
where you're from,

76
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:15,317
or anything about Sakaimachi
or psychite. Right?

77
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:21,150
So now there are two lost
people instead of one, I guess.

78
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,192
[laughs]

79
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,858
A desert?

80
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:49,483
[TAKUYA]
Mm! What is it?

81
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,817
That way?

82
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,483
[TAKUYA]
A house?

83
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,608
Maybe there's someone there!

84
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,067
Let's go see.

85
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:12,025
[TAKUYA]
Hello? Is anyone home?

86
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,775
Excuse me, is anybody here?

87
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,442
[TAKUYA]
Uh.

88
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,942
Hey, Sayless.

89
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:27,733
Would you say this room
is pretty typical?

90
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,233
Wow, interesting.

91
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:33,942
So, I guess this
world's civilization

92
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:36,317
isn't all that
primitive, after all.

93
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,858
[SAYLESS]
Watch out!

94
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,483
Drop your weapon.

95
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:01,358
Who are you? And don't lie.

96
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:04,233
Honestly, I wish I knew
who I was in this world.

97
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,358
Let me know if you
figure it out.

98
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,525
Are you from the city?

99
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:10,317
You're asking if I
came from there?

100
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,942
Is it Sakaimachi?

101

[AILIA]
Hm...

102
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:15,150
Take off your clothes.

103
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:18,400
Aren't you even gonna
buy me dinner first?

104
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,275
Disarm, immediately.

105
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:22,483
[TAKUYA]
Heh. Ah, very perceptive.

106
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,733
You noticed my Magnum, huh?

00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:29,400
Magnum? You're toying
with me! Do it, now.

What did you do to me?!

[TAKUYA]
Hardly anything, really.

114
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,858
I mean, you peed yourself,
so I took care of that,

115
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:55,358
but nothing else.

Uh! Sorry, I wasn't serious!

everything, not me!

[footsteps]

119
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,650
[AILIA] I'm sorry for pointing
my sword at you like that.

120
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,817
My name is Ailia,
and I'm a knight.

121
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,400
I guard our border at the
request of the Divine Emperor.

122
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:23,817
[TAKUYA]
The border?

123
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,317
[AILIA] Yes, the boundary
that separates Dela Granto

124
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,775
from the rest of the world.

125
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,775
I'm tasked with defeating
the monsters

126
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:31,692
that tend to show up here.

127
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,817
Wow. Sounds like being
a border guard is intense.

128
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,692
Yes, it certainly can be.

Takuya, why did you come here?

[TAKUYA] Well, my only goal
is to find psychite.

132
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:52,025
Have you heard of it?

133
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:55,067
Sorry, I'm afraid I haven't.

134
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,525
What is it for?

135
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:59,525
Is it a jewel to give
to that girl?

136
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,317
No, nothing like that.

137
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,233
The stone's going
to another person.

[BAT MONSTER screeches]

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,108
[AILIA] The monsters
have grown in number

142
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:15,108
and gotten more violent
with each passing day.

143
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:20,150
Mother nature. She shows
her wrath every 400 years.

Four hundred years again, huh?

145
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:24,442
That number comes up a lot.

[AILIA]
The wrath of Mother Nature

147

shows the people of
Dela Granto no mercy.

148

Great rains. Floods.

149

Earthquakes.

150
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:37,067
Lands turned to desert.

[TAKUYA] Natural disasters
can't be helped, though.

152
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,192
[AILIA]
There is a way.

153
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:44,108
In five years, a ritual will
be done to purify this world,

154
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,400
and at that point,
a god shall manifest.

155
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:47,983
A god?

156
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:50,775
[AILIA] In order for a priestess
to become the vessel of the god

157
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,150
she must sacrifice
her physical abilities

158
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,775
in exchange for divine power.

159
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:58,650
For instance, some lose
the ability to walk.

160
00:10:58,733 --> 00:10:59,942
Others, their voice.

161
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:03,942
[gasps] Wait a minute.
Do you mean Sayless?

162
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:06,067
Yes, I had that thought,
as well.

163
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,983
But the thing is, if she
really is a priestess,

164
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,608
how'd she get here from
the Imperial City?

165
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:14,275
Guess she must've
crossed the desert.

166
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:15,983
[AILIA] Crossing the
Rafaelo Desert under

167
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:19,233
Melgio's hateful
gaze is impossible.

168
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:21,442
Completely impossible.

169
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,400
Honey, I'm home!

170
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:31,067
Wow, looks like you
really know how to cook!

171
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,942
Wonderful! Shall we eat, then?

172
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:37,108
I am so ready for this!

[ADVISOR]
The Priestess is gone?

174
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,567
[GUARD A] We've confirmed
she was on the dais

175
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,817
as of this morning.

176
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,192
[ADVISOR] Divine Emperor, what
would you like for us to do?

177
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,733
[EMPEROR] The royal guards must
form a team to track her down.

178
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:06,442
I shall consult
the will of Mother.

179
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,067
[ADVISOR, GUARD A]
Yes, sir!

181
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:19,067
[AILIA]
This "kendo" of yours

182
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,858
isn't meant for real
combat, is it?

183
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:23,817
Look, I've never held
a real sword before!

184
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,108
[AILIA] Never let your guard
down in Dela Granto.

185
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,858
All the knights on the
border except me have died.

186
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,525
It is deceptively dangerous.

187
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,858
[TAKUYA] What lies out there,
beyond the desert?

188
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:40,858
[AILIA] The Imperial City,
and on the way, the quarries.

189
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:42,608
What the heck are the quarries?

190
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:44,233
I don't have details.

191
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:46,858
But I know that's where
they mine the holy stones.

192
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:49,983
And are these holy stones
different from psychite?

193
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:52,942
I don't know. I'm sorry.

194
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:57,650
[TAKUYA] No, I get it. You can't
cross the desert, right?

195
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:58,942

Yes.

No, and just after I told you
not to let your guard down, too.

[TAKUYA] What happened?
That's not like you.

216
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:54,442
I don't know. I had this
memory of my little sister.

Your sister?

218
00:13:56,317 --> 00:14:01,150
[AILIA] Amanda. She's the
only family I have left.

219
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:04,942
She was different from me
in every way imaginable.

220
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:08,150
She ran away from home.

00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:11,650
I have no idea what
she could be doing now.

Yes, but fighting
against it won't help.

This disease that
eats away at me...

We'll go to the forest later.

you were the priestess.

Why did you abandon the ritual
and choose to come here instead?
