Toyotomi. I'm confused...

Why were you there?

35

'Cause somebody had to save
the day and it sure wasn't you!

[growls]

[AYUMI] I don't know how
to thank you for this.

No need, it was my pleasure.

Call me any time.
I swear, I'll come running.

You know I don't
like to scold you,

44
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,125
so I've only done it once,
when it was really important.

45
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,166
Remember?

46
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,000
It was after I got in
that big fight, huh?

47
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,166
That's right.

48
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,958
I heard the whole
story from the police.

49
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,000
They said that some thugs
were harassing Yuki

50
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,875
and you rushed in
to protect him.

51
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,250
[laughs] Honestly.

52
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,458
I was so proud of you that day.

53
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,000
I thought, "wow, he's
grown up so much."

54

Even if it was dangerous,
you were like a real hero.

But now... Everything
feels different.

It's only us.

Losing your father
was hard enough on me.

We should halt the construction,
at least for the time being!

we need to find out

[TAKUYA]
Uh.

00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,791
I know I said I don't like to
scold you, but don't you ever

enter a girl's room without
knocking first, got it?

77
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:43,750
Okay.

78
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,958
Next time you do that,

00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,666
you'll be in for a world
of hurt, young man.

It's great!

If you're trying to get me
to up your allowance,

00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:57,833
then don't bother.

I mean it, really! Uh.

Say "ahh."

Hey. Is there anyone
you like, Takuya?

Whoa, where did
that come from?

I'm the one asking
the questions here.

[TAKUYA]
Hmm...

93
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,916
Hideki Yukawa, then.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,875
He's a Nobel prize-winning
scientist.

95
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,416
[AYUMI] I mean someone
you like romantically!

96
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,916
Maybe... Elizabeth Taylor?

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,250
[AYUMI]
Come on...

98
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,416
[TAKUYA]
What about you?

99
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,833
Huh?

100
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,125
[TAKUYA] Is there
someone <i>you</i> like, Ayumi?

101
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,166
[AYUMI]
Heh. Well, that's obvious.

102
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,375
Doctor Kodai Arima, of course.

103
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,083
Uh. I'm sorry.

104
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,166
I should've known better.
I didn't mean anything by it.

105
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,000
It's all right, because
there's someone I love

106
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,375
just as much as him.

107
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,458
He's a caring and
honest young man.

108
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,250
Although he is trying
to grow up too fast.

109
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,250
But he's quick to apologize
when he's wrong,

110
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,583
so I give him a break.

111
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,666
We're family.

112
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,000
There's nothing more I need.

113
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,083
I never asked you before,

114
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,583
but what are you planning
to do after you graduate?

115
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,166
[TAKUYA]
Get married, of course!

116
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,875
Okay, but that won't
pay the bills

117
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,666
unless you marry someone rich.

118
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,041
[TAKUYA]
You know I'm kidding, right?

119
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,250
I'm not sure,
but I'll take suggestions.

120
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,833
As long as you're happy,

121
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,833
and as long as you live without
any regrets, I can't complain.

122
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,958
[TAKUYA]
That's kind of vague, isn't it?

123
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,416
I'm serious, though.

124
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,833
You know better than anybody
else what's right for you,

125
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,958
so follow that path.

126
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,250
Uh! It's nearly 8:30!

127
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,375
I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry!

128
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,416
Would you mind
finishing up the dishes?

129
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,666
Sure. I'll see ya after work.

[YUKI]
Mornin', Boss!

00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,416
Uh! Dude, what happened
to your face?

133
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,625
I crashed my moped, that's all.

134
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, I'll never learn like this!

135
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,875
Guess I'll just have to go to
the nurse's office instead!

136
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,000
You've got a good
excuse, for once.

137
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,125
Put my name on a printout
and turn in it for me, 'kay?

138
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,500
[YUKI] Huh? How am I
supposed to do your work?

139
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,875
I'm a grade lower than you!

140
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,833
[TAKUYA]
Just do whatever. I don't care.

141
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,541
What am I supposed to do
if the teacher catches me?!

142
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,375
[TAKUYA]
Pretend to be me.

143
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,083
[YUKI]
How's that supposed to work?!

144
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,041
[TAKUYA]
Good luck! Later!

How are you feeling?

148
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,583
I think I'm better now.

00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,875
Uh.

Oh, you again?

151
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,500
Did something happen?

152
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,000
[ERIKO] She keeps getting
these inexplicable fevers.

153
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,625
There's nothing
I can do about it.

154
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,375
I have medicine for that.

155
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,541
My mom's fever reducer.

[ERIKO]
Ayumi?

157
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,958
No, my birth mother.

Hm. I see.

159

Oh, by the way, Kanna.

160
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,291
I swear I've seen a necklace
like yours someplace before.

161
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,083
Are they popular?

162
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,291
This isn't just some necklace.

163
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,250
To me, this is life itself.

164
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,083
I'll be leaving now.

165
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,708
She's a weird one, isn't she?

166
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,208
Uh-huh. Even weirder than the
teacher wearing fishnets.

167
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,833
[ERIKO]
Hm? My outfit is fine.

168
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,166
What are you talking about?

169
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,416
[TAKUYA]
I'm hardly complaining,

170
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,416
but that's not what
teachers wear.

171
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,750
You better not complain.

172
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,708
You're the one who told me
this look was in style.

173
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,625
[TAKUYA]
I did say that, didn't I?

174
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,083
Well, I mean, you've been out of
the country for a while, right?

175
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,333
Just grab a fashion magazine.

176
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,250
Oh. Hey.

177
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,291
Have you seen Ichijo today?

178
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,791
Mitsuki, you mean?

179
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,041
[ERIKO]
I caught her earlier

180
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,958
and it seemed like she
wanted to talk to you.

181
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,916
[MITSUKI]
Sorry about this.

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,833
I know you have summer school.

183
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,333
It's fine. I was just hiding
in the nurse's office.

184
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,666
I wanted to ask you about
what your plans are

185
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,333
for after you graduate.

186
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,583
Seems to be a popular
question today.

187
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,458
You should be flattered that
everyone's so worried about you!

188
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,166
We know you've had a tough time
after your dad went missing.

189
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,250
That's all it is.

190
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,541
You've had a pretty
tough time, yourself.

191
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,541
[MITSUKI]
I suppose.

192
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:33,750
But it's always been tough
knowing he would never love me.

193
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,250
To answer your question,
I don't know what I'll do.

194
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,875
I'm just gonna get through
school for now. How's that?

195
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,125
[MITSUKI laughs]

196
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,625
You're laughing.

197
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,875
You've cheered up a bit
lately, haven't you?

198
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,125
Huh. I guess so.

199
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,875
[MITSUKI] We haven't been able
to relax and chat in a while.

200
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,291
You've been busy lately?

201
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,958
I'm spending every day going
through your father's research.

202
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,833
Listen, I was wondering,

203
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,500
has Ryuzoji seemed
different to you these days?

204
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,666
Men change all the damn time.
They get some new idea

205
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,916
in their head and go running
with it full-force. Y'know.

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,625
It's not like that at all.

207
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,416
Something strange is
happening with him.

208
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,166
Oh, yeah? Like what?

209
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,833
[MITSUKI] For starters,
he suddenly threw away

210
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,791
all the furniture in his house.
He just sleeps on the floor now.

211
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,500
Huh, Yeah, I gotta admit,
that is pretty strange.

212
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,875
Seems mostly harmless though.

213
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,791
[groans]

214
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,833
Whoa! Are you okay?

215
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,416
[TAKUYA]
What happened?

216
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,041
Oh, uh. Just, a migraine.

217
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,708
Happens a lot lately.

218
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,583
[TAKUYA]
Be careful, okay?

219
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,541
Anyway, the furniture isn't
the only thing with Ryuzoji.

220
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,958
[TAKUYA] He dancin' around
in his underwear at work?

221
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,958
I'm serious about this!

222
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,708
One morning, he was ready to fly
into a rage over nothing at all.

223
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,583
Just the phone ringing
was enough to set him off.

224
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,958
Do guys go through "that
time of the month," too?

225
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,458
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:17,041
These days, he's been completely
obsessed with his research.

227
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:21,375
And not in a good way--
More like he's been possessed.

228
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,416
I'll try to keep an
eye on him for you.

229
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,666
You don't mind?

230
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,041
If you notice something,
then please let me know!

231
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,750
So if I said that he had
a gun, for example.

232
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,541
You'd buy that? For real?

233
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,666
That wouldn't
surprise me at all.

234
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,541
He's lost it. So be careful.

235
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,125
This is Takuya speaking.

236
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,541
[AYUMI sighs]
Thank goodness!

237
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,458
Ayumi, oh, hey. What's wrong?

238
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,291
I left something I need for
work back at the house.

239
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,333
[TAKUYA] Let me guess,
a big envelope?

240
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,708
Uh-huh.

241
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,291
I hate to ask, but could you
please bring it to me?

242
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,708
I can't leave work right now.

243
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,416
No prob. It's urgent, I assume?

important paperwork!

You sure are going all out.

you were coming.

quite a crowd out there.

over your head.

still know him.

not like I would forget.

Thank you all for coming.

The chief of the Geotechnics
Construction Project,

Chief Arima, will now
begin her presentation.

306

Let's start by taking
a look at the report

307
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,916
we compiled regarding
the accidents.

308
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,916
We know the lightning strikes
began at the same time

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,791
as our construction,
but the cause is unclear.

This is the top of Mt. Sankaku.

appeared suddenly.

Lightning struck.

313
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,791
Then the sky was clear again.

314
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,458
Both before and after
this strange incident,

315
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,916
the weather was sunny.

was reported that day.

to look for an explanation,

318
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,958
and hopefully a
solution as well.

319
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,291
In the meantime, we've
introduced safety precautions

320
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,208
for our workers that far
exceed the legal requirement.

321
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,250
For example, these insulated
suits are now mandatory

322
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,791
for everyone on
the construction site.

323
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,708
Thank you, we will now be taking
questions from the audience.

324
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,708
[MALE TOWNSPERSON 3A]
Yes.

325
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,666
I run a café on the beach.

326
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,583
This construction of yours
is ruining my livelihood.

327
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,208
Do you intend to compensate me

328
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,416
and the other local business
owners for this?

329
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,125
We're within the law, and
the project has been approved

330
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,833
by city hall. So while
you have my sympathy,

331
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:03,166
I'm afraid our company can't
offer compensation at this time.

332
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,625
So you "invited specialists"
and you "compiled a report,"

333
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,083
but have you actually learned
anything useful at all?

334
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,333
We've worked out a few details.

335
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,791
[FEMALE TOWNSPERSON 3B]
So tell us already!

336
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,916
For starters, when our workers
try to remove something

337
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,708
from the island, that's when
the lightning strikes.

338
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,875
Without fail.

339
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,208
We have no logical
explanation for this,

340
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,208
so obviously, we still need
to perform more tests.

341
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,750
You've angered
the gods of the sea.

342
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,791
That's the only answer you need!

343
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,291
No matter what you say,
these accidents were caused

344
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,000
by your lack of
safety precautions.

345
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,708
That's not the case at all.
We've followed protocol,

346
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,958
but the lightning strikes
couldn't be predicted.

347
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,958
Now we're looking to
introduce new measures to--

348
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,125
[FEMALE TOWNSPERSON 3A]
Then stop!

349
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,958
Put the operation on
hold until you know

350
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,500
what the hell is going on!

351
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,666
That's common sense!

352
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,791
It's too dangerous
for us to do our jobs!

353
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,083
We're gonna end up
dying out there!

354
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,958
Everyone, listen to me!

355
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,250
My husband was wearing one
of those insulated suits,

356
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,416
and he still died in
a lightning strike!

[CROWD shouting]

358
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,291
[AYUMI] We're still
investigating that accident.

359
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,666
We don't know if the suit
was at fault or not.

360
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,416
While you're "investigating,"
people are dying!

All right, guess that's that.

the opportunity.

That was awful!

Would you like us to postpone
the recording until later?

376

It's just a little egg,
I'm not hurt.

If that's what you want,
then all right!

Now I just need to get changed.

Our coverage continues

382
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,791
with a NEWS Presence
exclusive interview.

383
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,875
Our guest tonight
is Ayumi Arima--

384
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,666
chief of the
construction project.

385
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,833
Thank you for having me here!

386
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,875
[KAORI] Just to be clear, to the
audience and to Chief Arima,

387
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,041
we didn't invite her here
to give Geotechnics

388
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,500
a chance to make excuses.

389
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,583
Of course.

390
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,583
We want to be as
transparent as possible

391
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,833
to the people of the town,

392
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,750
and we're committed to
keeping an open dialogue

393
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,666
as we continue with
the construction.

394
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,166
[KAORI]
I'll just come out and ask:

395
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,958
why are you
continuing construction,

396
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,750
even in the face of these
dangerous lightning strikes?

397
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,416
[AYUMI] Our company is confident
that we can mitigate the risk

398
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,375
of accidents without
drawing out the project

399
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,916
with needless delays.

400
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,583
Would a delay be that bad?

401
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,041
[AYUMI] Working out our permit
with city hall was a challenge,

402
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,750
we're at risk of
missing the deadline.

403
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,916
If that happened, it would
be bad for the town.

404
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,416
Frankly, we want to
wrap this up quickly.

405
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,750
We are aware of the problems,
and we don't want

406
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,750
to inconvenience the locals
any longer than we have to.

407
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,958
[KAORI] It seems a lot
of people are angry.

408
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,375
[AYUMI]
Yes. I felt that today.

409
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,541
Some of them have even
lost family members.

410
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,958
They expressed concerns
that you, personally,

411
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,666
aren't taking the danger
seriously enough.

412
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,208
I understand. I lost my
husband in an accident.

413
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,541
So the pain that they're
feeling, I've felt it too.

414
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,625
This is too much.

415
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,333
[KAORI] I see.
That was quite recently.

416
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,416
I know Dr. Arima
died in a cave-in,

417
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,291
so that must have
been quite a shock.

418
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,000
I just want the families who are
out there suffering right now

419
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,166
to know that I speak
for our entire company

420
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,166
when I say we're committed
to making this right,

421
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,916
no matter what it takes.

422
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,666
So tell me, we've heard
rumors that some sort of

423
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,000
deal was made between
Geotechnics upper management

424
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,833
and the government.
Any thoughts on that?

425
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,375
[gasps] I don't think
that has any merit.

426
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,708
I've heard nothing of the sort.

427
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,125

I'm good at from now on.

Either way, I'm not used

can keep this up.

So please, just let me cry.

[TAKUYA] In that moment,
I thought to myself:

476
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,500
No matter how many times I went
back with the Reflector Device,

477
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,916
I could never stop those tears.
