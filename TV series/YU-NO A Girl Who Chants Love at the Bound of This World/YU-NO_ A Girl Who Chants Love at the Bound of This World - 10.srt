1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,567
They're going to be okay.

2
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,483
They have to be.

3
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:20,692
--Uh.
--[YUKI gasping]

4
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,442
There's no way Mother
Nature made this, right?

5
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,025
It's like a machine.

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,233
[YUKI] But everything in here
is carved out of the mountain.

7
00:00:27,317 --> 00:00:28,817
What's going on?

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,858
[yelps]

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,692
[TAKUYA]
What is this place?

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,692
[YUKI] Who do you think
built this place?

11
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:18,233
I mean, we're in the middle
of the mountain, right?

12
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:20,817
I know I talked about how
nobody'd really checked out

13
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,733
Mount Sankaku yet, but this is
beyond what I even imagined.

14
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:28,025
[gasps] The underground
base of Gelgey the Fiend!

15
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,525
It's exactly like this!

16
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,400
Who's Gelgey?

17
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:35,858
Gelgey the Fiend is very
dark and very powerful.

18
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:39,775
The treacherous leader
of an evil organization!

19
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:42,608
He forces the innocent
to engage in hard labor

20
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:45,817
to accomplish his
terrible, nasty deeds.

21
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,983
Is this one of those things
where I need to punch you

22
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,442
to wake you up?

23
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:51,983
[laughs] It was a joke.

24
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:54,567
[sighs] Well, that may be.

25
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,025
You might not be all
that far off, though.

26
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:01,358
Look at that. My guess is
this place must've been

27
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:05,525
some combination of
a prison and a mine.

28
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:09,025
I've never seen
anything like it.

29
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:12,150
Well, maybe it's because
they're from a long time ago?

30
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,442
No, and you won't find it
in our history books.

31
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,442
[TAKUYA]
Huh?

32
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,400
Looks like we can
go through there.

33
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,817
[footsteps]

34
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:33,192
[BOTH gasp]

35
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:37,108
[YUKI]
Huh. Looks like a dead-end.

36
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:38,192
[thud]

37
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,108
Hey, what's that? A rock?

38
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:47,733
It's a crown. At least,
I think that's what it is.

39
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:51,108
Wait, it's goes in there, right?

40
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,942
Oh, crap, what's happening?

41
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:58,608
[TAKUYA]
Who knows?

42
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,442
[YUKI]
Huh?!

43
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,483
Wow, a hidden passage.

44
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:09,483
What kind of high-tech maze
is this place, anyway?!

45
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,775
[groaning]

46
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,650
[TAKUYA]
I'm gonna go on ahead.

47
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,692
And I want you to
follow from behind.

48
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:24,275
Ahh! It's another body!

49
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:25,900
You're such a spaz.

50
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,483
Uh, sorry about that.

51
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,233
[TAKUYA] Maybe he was one
of the workers here.

52
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,650
[TAKUYA] Hey, those look like
the letters on Futago Rock.

53
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,275
Boss, over there.

54
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:47,900
[TAKUYA]
Hm... Oh! That's Mio's!

55
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:49,858
Shimazu...

56
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:57,150
That notebook she always
keeps with her is missing.

57
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:01,358
Was she here, though?
Staring at this same thing?

58
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,317
So is she lost down here?

59
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,858
Without food or water?
She must be so scared!

60
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:13,608
[TAKUYA] Yeah, this isn't good.
We need to hurry.

61
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:15,942
Shimazu! Where are you?!

62
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,608
Uh. Wait, where're you going?

63
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:21,025
[YUKI] I'm coming! I'll be
right there! Just hold on!

64
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:22,942
Hey! Wait up!

65
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:25,442
[YUKI yells]

66
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:27,817
[TAKUYA gasps]

67
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,692
[TAKUYA]
Yuki! Yuki!

68
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:36,442
Shit...

69
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,317
[rope stretching]

70
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,692
[TAKUYA grunting]

71
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,567
Yuki! Where are you? Answer me!

72
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,608
[YUKI groaning]
Boss...

73
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,108
Yuki!

74
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:56,483
[gasps]

75
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:57,442
[TAKUYA]
Oh, no...

76
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,442
[footsteps]

77
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,608
[TAKUYA]
Hang on, buddy! I'll help you.

78
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:07,108
[YUKI]
No, forget me. Find Shimazu.

79
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:09,733
Don't be an idiot!
What're you trying to say?

80
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:11,358
Please, listen to me, Boss!

81
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:12,858
[gasping]

82
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:15,317
This is all my own fault.

83
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,942
Because it's my fault
that Shimazu--

84
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:19,108
[coughs]

85
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,233
[TAKUYA]
Don't talk! Try to stay calm!

86
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:23,192
I'll get Mitsuki, okay?

87
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:27,567
[YUKI]
Please. You have to go save her.

88
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:37,025
No. Oh, please, no.

89
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,733
Wake the hell up, Yuki!

90
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,608
Come on! Wake up!

91
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,025
Do you hear me?! Come on!

92
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:52,275
No way. This can't be real.

93
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:55,650
Yuki! Wake up!

94
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,900
Say something ridiculous!

95
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:00,233
[TAKUYA cries]

96
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:09,150
[TAKUYA] Any world where Yuki
dies has to be a terrible lie!

97
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,900
Listen, here's the thing.

98
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,567
What's up, Boss?

99
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,233
[TAKUYA] It's just... I actually
think you should stay here.

100
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:27,692
[BOTH gasp]

101
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:29,192
Wait, why are you saying that?

102
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:31,317
You just said we
could go together!

103
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,942
I stopped to think about it.

104
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:36,442
I'm worried you're too emotional
to be clearheaded in there.

105
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:39,525
Honestly, I think
you'll get in the way.

106
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:42,567
You don't get it!
This is all my fault!

107
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,608
I need to be the one
who saves her!

108
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:46,275
[TAKUYA]
You'll just make it worse, okay?

109
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:47,942
[gasps]

110
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,733
[TAKUYA] I don't have the
time to look after someone

111
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,608
who can't take
care of themselves.

112
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:52,983
Mitsuki, let's go.

113
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:55,817
[MITSUKI]
Yeah. Okay.

114
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:07,650
Heh. That was textbook "you."

115
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,442
What are you talking about?

116
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:11,692
That was some pretty
tough love with Yuki.

117
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,067
You're a good friend.

118
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,233
Look, the kid's really clumsy.

119
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,067
That's why he gets
himself kill--

120

[clears throat]

121
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:19,442
What?

122
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:24,192
Nothing, forget it. Anyway,
I think it's right around here.

123
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:25,525
There we go.

124
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,067
You knew it was here, how?

125
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,692
I dunno. I guess I play
a lot of video games.

126
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:43,692
Now, shall we?

127
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,442
[MITSUKI]
Look! Is that her bag?

128
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:50,733
[TAKUYA]
I think so.

129
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,608
--[rumbling]
--Uh?

130
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,692
What could that be?

131
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:55,692
[TAKUYA]
This isn't what happened

132
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,983
in the universe
where I just was!

133
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:00,442
[MITSUKI gasps]

[TAKUYA]
Man, that was rough.

138
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:14,483
Hey, you okay?

139
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,817
Yeah, I can't believe it,
but I am.

140
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,067
Unfortunately, I think
I lost my flashlight.

141
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,942
Yeah, me too.
Dammit. Where'd it go?

142

[BOTH gasp]

143

do you think you're doing?

144
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:29,900
[TAKUYA]
Ah. Sorry.

Hey, it's dark.
I couldn't see anything.

Can we keep focused
on the task at hand?

Sheesh, yeah, of course we can.

Wait. Look, I think
there's something here.

Hey! Stop!

151
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:44,317
Don't try to touch me just
because I can't see you!

Sorry! It wasn't deliberate!

153
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:49,317
Wow, your body's just as
sensitive as ever, isn't it?

Here we go! Check it out!

Ahh! Mitsuki!
What happened to you?

You're as old and
dried out as a mummy!

Shut your mouth,
you little jerk.

Sorry.

You think it's someone
who got lost?

Hard to say.

162
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,775
[TAKUYA] It seems a lot
newer than the other bodies,

163
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:15,942
doesn't it?

164
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:24,525
[MITSUKI] This belonged
to Dr. Yurika Imagawa!

165
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:27,483
[TAKUYA]
Uh. Dr. Imagawa?

166
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:30,067
Wait, didn't she
work with my dad?

167
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,108
[MITSUKI] Yeah. I remember
hearing that she'd gone missing.

168
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:35,733
Guess she was here.

169
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:38,692
What's it say in her notebook?

170
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:40,442
"It's overwhelming.

171
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:43,858
The fear and anticipation
threaten to crush me."

172
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:45,858
Even as I write these words,

173
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:50,150
my hands are shaking
as if I were a child."

174
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,942
[IMAGAWA]
Mount Sankaku.

175
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,817
It's possible that the key to
history's greatest mysteries

176
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,858
lie right here, where I stand.

177
00:10:57,942 --> 00:11:00,900
After all, these ruins have
been here for millennia.

178
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:02,650
I still regret the fact
that I couldn't bring

179
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,400
a whole team with me.

180
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:08,400
[IMAGAWA] These ruins are
starkly different from those

181
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:11,567
of any other culture
throughout history.

182
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,067
I truly think this phenomenon
might have been...

183
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,608
[MITSUKI] "...caused by an event
collision between two dimensions

184
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:19,608
that crossed each
other's boundaries."

185
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:22,442
What is an event collision?

186
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:23,942
[IMAGAWA]
"Dr. Arima's theory was that

187
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:28,108
event collisions occurred
approximately every 400 years."

188
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:30,650
[IMAGAWA]
For example,

189
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,650
Takanoamahara exists in a
different dimension than ours,

190
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,900
but there was an event
collision with Japan,

191
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,733
resulting in the importation
of a new culture.

192
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,525
I was able to
thoroughly investigate

193
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,608
the electromagnetic and
gravitational fields

194
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:46,067
of Sakai-machi, and I
concluded that, indeed,

195
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,567
an event collision had
taken place in the past.

196
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,108
What must occur to cause
an event collision?

197
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:57,150
I was so obsessed and eager
to solve the mystery,

198
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,858
that I foolishly allowed myself
to get to the point where I

199
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:02,733
could no longer go on.

200
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:07,983
However, my heart remains
joyous and full of curiosity.

201
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:13,317
This feeling. Yes, it reminds
me of that moment.

202
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,025
That fateful day, when Dr. Arima
handed it over to me.

203
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:21,317
I still remember as if
it were yesterday.

204
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,733
The moment I first held that
strange, foreign object.

205
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:27,567
[MITSUKI] "The wondrous thing
I couldn't let go of...

206
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:33,108
Which I later decided to call
the Reflector Device."

207
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:36,692
Uh. Oh great.

208
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,317
[MITSUKI]
The Reflector Device.

209
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,775
You have it, don't you, Takuya?

210
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:48,775
Uh. What're you talking about?

211
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:53,608
[laughs] Yep!
Hand it over, right now.

212
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:55,858
That's Ryuzoji's gun!

213
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,692
So? Give it here, chop chop.

214
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,233
[TAKUYA grunts]

215
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:03,733
Takuya. Be a good boy.

216
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,567
I can't.

217
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,025
My dad entrusted
the device to me.

218
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:10,358
Sure.

219
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:13,025
Well, then, you
leave me no choice.

220
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:14,025
[TAKUYA gasps]

221
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,775
[gunshot]

222
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,442
Next time, I'll be
aiming for your head.

223
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:27,942
Now, give me the Reflector
Device immediately.

224
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:30,733
[groans]

225
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:32,775
Run, Takuya.

226
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:35,150
What's happening?
Is it the Niarb?

227
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,733
[MITSUKI]
Takuya, I have to shoot you.

228
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,692
But... I... I don't want to.

229
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:43,525
I don't want to but I must!

230
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:47,150
Listen to me! Ryuzoji's
controlling you right now!

231
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,775
You need to get
ahold of yourself!

232
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:52,233
If he wants it,
I'll get it for him.

233
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:57,692
That's my job. I'm afraid
your time's up. Bye!

234
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:59,067
[TAKUYA grunting]

235
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,983
You're not getting
away from me.

236
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,483
[TAKUYA panting]

237
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:10,692
Yes!

238
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:16,025
[TAKUYA]
What's that?

239
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,858
A coffin?

240
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,983
[MITSUKI]
Takuya!

241
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,567
Where're you hiding, sweetie?

242
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:25,192
Son of a bitch!

243
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:31,608
Playing hide-and-seek?

244
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:37,192
Well, well. Don't worry, I won't
keep you waiting for very long.

245
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:45,900
[TAKUYA screams]

246
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:51,608
[gasps]

247
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:59,983
That light! What is it?

Hey, wake up!

251
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:24,608
I don't, uh...

252
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,442
[MIO]
Takuya!

253
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,358
Please, just five more minutes?

254
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:31,650
I'm really wiped out. Okay?

255
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:34,608
Good grief, would you
please just wake up?

256
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,858
[TAKUYA grunts]
Hey, don't, that hurt!

257
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:39,483
[gasping]

258
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:40,775
[MIO screams]

259
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,025
[smack]

260
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,858
[TAKUYA]
Ow! Was that necessary?

261
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:46,650
You're impossible!

262
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:49,192
I'm really glad you're
safe, though, Mio.

263
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,358
'Course, I had a feeling
a history nut like you

264
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:53,525
would be harder
to kill than that.

265
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:55,775
Wow, quite a compliment.

266
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,942
Forget about that--
did you get hurt?

267
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,650
[MIO]
Heh. I'm good.

268
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,525
Although my butt's a
little cold right now.

269
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:05,608
Nice! Anything I can do
to warm it up for ya?

270
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:09,108
[MIO]
No thanks, you pervert.

271
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:12,025
I thought I was a
goner at one point.

272
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:14,608
But somehow I knew
that, eventually,

273
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:17,275
you'd make your
way down here, too.

274
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:20,067
Sorry that it kinda
took me a while.

275
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:24,442
[TAKUYA] Anyway, wow.
This place is weird.

276
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,400
A glowing, underground lake?

277
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:29,483
From here, it looks like
the glow is coming

278
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,692
from the rocks that
are under the water.

279
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,525
Rocks that glow...?

280
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,067
It's the psychite.

281
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,567
What'd you say?

282
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,608
Nothing. Let's get out of here.
Surely we can manage that.

283
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,650
[MIO] I'm not even sure
where I should begin.

284
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:54,650
Generally speaking,
I start with mild flirtation.

285
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:57,525
I was always convinced that
the Takanoamahara people

286
00:16:57,608 --> 00:17:01,317
just had to be related to
Mount Sankaku in some way.

287
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,358
But you can't deny the fact is,

288
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:06,025
these ruins are a lot
older than that.

289
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,150
That's right.

290
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,567
So, I want to do a
real investigation.

291
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,817
Solve the mysteries.
All of them.

292
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,317
I don't just mean Japan's,

293
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,525
but the mysteries
of all of humanity.

294
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:18,900
[TAKUYA]
You know,

295
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:22,692
Dr. Imagawa's notes said
the same thing you just did.

296
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,858
You read them, right?

297
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:28,150
[MIO]
Yes. I found them in the cave.

298
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:29,983
To me, her theory about

299
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,067
event collisions was
especially shocking.

300
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,025
The part where she said
that one dimension

301
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:37,192
might collide with another...

302
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:41,067
I know. Do you believe it
could be a valid theory?

303
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,900
I have to admit, it is
pretty hard to believe.

304
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:45,775
However, if it is the truth,

305
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,525
it would explain why there's
an entire civilization here

306
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,608
that's not found in our history.

00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:30,567
[MIO]
Uh? Don't stare! Look away!

318
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,983
Maybe I should go
look for the exit.

319
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,983
Seems like a solid idea.

320
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:39,692
[MIO] Uh! Hold on!
Don't just leave me here.

321
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,817
But...

322
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,067
Trust me, okay?
You won't find an exit.

323
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,817
I've obviously already
looked for it everywhere.

324
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,150
Please, just...

325
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,317
Don't leave me here alone.

326
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,317
[MIO]
The papers this morning.

327
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,442
[TAKUYA]
Hm?

328
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,025
On the bulletin board.

329
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:09,108
You weren't responsible
for that, right?

330
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:11,942
Sorry. Yes, I did it.

331
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,192
[MIO laughs]

332
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,817
What's funny?

333
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,692
I guess somehow I knew
you'd take the blame.

334
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:19,775
It was Yuki, wasn't it?

335
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:24,150
[TAKUYA] Uh! No way! Wh-Why,
did he tell you that he did it?

336
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:25,483
[MIO]
Mm-mm.

337
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,942
No, I could just read him.
When we talked about it.

338
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:32,442
He's, uh...
He's a really bad liar.

339
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:38,733
Before I came down here,
I actually hit the kid.

340
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:41,817
I'm not saying it's a
reason to forgive him.

341
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,317
But try not to blame
him too much.

342
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,067
[laughs] Guess that's
a lot to ask.

343
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,442
It's not.

344
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,733
I mean, I was hurt
when I saw them,

345
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,608
but everything those
papers said was true.

346
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:58,192
People would've found out.

347
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:01,317
If not from the papers,
then some other way.

348
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,233
Besides, I believe my father
deserves to be punished

349
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:06,317
for the things he's done.

350
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
[coughs]

351
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:11,400
Hey, you okay?

352
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:13,192
Tell me something.

353
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:15,483
Do you think we'll die here?

354
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:18,567
Uh. No, of course I don't.

355
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,775
Yuki's waiting for us up there.

356
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:23,275
I think he'll go
to the police. Uh?

357
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:24,525
[MIO]
Arima.

358
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,483
Will you... kiss me?

359
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,233
[MIO]
Please, I...

360
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,942
I want something else
to remember when I die!

361
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:38,817
One time?

362
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:54,233
[gasps]

363
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:56,317
This isn't your last memory,

364
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,733
because we're both
getting out of here alive.

365
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:03,025
Do you hear me? Alive.

366
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:22,025
[TAKUYA]
Should I head back now? Crap.

367
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:24,942
I don't remember the path
I took to get here,

368
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:28,442
and I don't know if
I'll see Mio again.

369
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:32,150
I'll rest up for a little bit,
then I'll get outta here.

370
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:46,108
[KEIKO]
Takuya.

371
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:50,900
[KEIKO]
Takuya. Don't worry.

372
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:52,108
[TAKUYA gasps]

373
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,233
[KEIKO]
I'm here.

374
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:04,817
I'm right here beside you now.

375
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:12,775
[TAKUYA]
Mother?

376
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:48,108
