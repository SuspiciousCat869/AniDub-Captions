[clock ticking]

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,375
[KODAI] It's impossible
to resist causality.

3
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,833
This is the correction of chaos.

4
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,250
It seems that you weren't meant
to be in that world after all,

5
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,083
so a correction must be made.

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,791
You will be sent back
to where it all began.

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,541
[TAKUYA]
Wait, what are you saying?

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,416
It's fairly simple, really.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,125
You'll experience the same
events over again.

10
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,291
Only this time everything
is going to play out

11
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,375
slightly different than before.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,791
Takuya, remember this:

13
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,125
Causality rules over
everything in this world.

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:49,458
To discover its vast and deep
secrets is to explore history.

15
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,166
[TAKUYA]
What does that mean, though?

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,083
Hey! Dad!

00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,083

So I'm re-starting from here?

[TAKUYA groaning]

23
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,041

I have to keep doing this.

Hello?

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,750
[YUKI] This is your
friendly wake-up call!

28
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,958
From the one who's here in your
hour of need, hero on call,

29
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,666
Masakatsu Yuki!

30
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,875
[TAKUYA] Dude, where do
you get all this energy?

31
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,916
Did somebody wake up on the
wrong side of the bed today?

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,125
Cheer up! Summer break
starts tomorrow, Boss!

33
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,791
That's right, it does
start tomorrow.

34
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,041
[YUKI]
Could you not sleep?

35
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,291
You did get a good nap
in class yesterday.

36
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,541
[TAKUYA] Actually. I saw
a pretty terrible monster,

37
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,250
if you want to know the truth.

38
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,625
Whoa, you think it might
be the one from the curse?

39
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,625
Sometimes, and I know
how this sounds,

40
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,750
but I get this feeling that
maybe the old legends

41
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,791
and folk tales are
real, you know?

42
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,666
How are you this excited?

43
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,541
[YUKI] Like, there might be
an entrance that takes you

44
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,250
to some alternate
universe that only opens

45
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,750
once every few hundred years!

46
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,500
Wait a minute. Where are
you getting this from?

47
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,416
It's fascinating stuff, right?

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,583
It was in a book I read by
Doctor Kodai Somethin'-or-Other.

49
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:54,375
--Uh. Boss? Uh, hello?

Oh, stop it, you're so silly.

[door closes]

60
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,250
[TAKUYA] Hey. Didn't you two
see each other just last night?

61
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,333
We were supposed to,
but I had something to do

62
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,666
and couldn't make it.

63
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,833
Heh. And I was reduced to
waiting around at home.

64
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:39,291
Lately, I've been keeping
to the indoors at night.

65
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,791
Scared of the curse,
guess you could say.

66
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,833
[AYUMI]
Oh, come on, you are not!

Excuse me.

revealed your true nature!

you were just a pervert,

but you're a mega-pervert!

someone's panties!

Ms. Eriko, anyway?

are right there. Why?

How should I know?

Maybe the lucky thing finally
shed her cocoon and flew off.

She's not a freaking butterfly!

And could you please
stop being gross

and put the panties down
while you talk to me?

Uh.

I need to talk to you.

How has Ryuzoji seemed to you?
Notice any changes lately?

00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,458
What type of changes?

99
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:24,166
For example, this is small, but
he used to criticize smoking,

100
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,458
and now he's started
smoking cigars.

101
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,541
[TAKUYA] People pick up
bad habits all the time.

102

What's the big deal?

103
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,666
It's not just that.

104
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,458
His mother actually came
to me about this first.

Ha, ha. Sorry.

108
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,500
She could see it. And then
I started to notice it, too.

109
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,000
Subtle changes in his character.

110
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,708
There's no denying
that he's different.

111
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,125
You know what?

112
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,375
There's been something bugging
me about Ryuzoji, too.

113
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:58,083
Have you noticed him talking
to anyone strange lately?

114
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,666
[MITSUKI]
Yes. I have.

115
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,625
[TAKUYA] There's this one
self-proclaimed journalist

116
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,208
named Kaori Asakura
to be careful of.

117
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,166
There's another one besides her.

118
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,750
He's actually hired
a detective now.

[TAKUYA]
You okay?

124
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,708
Yeah. It's just a migraine.

125
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,708
[TAKUYA] I talked to
Ryuzoji this morning,

126
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,583
and something felt off.

127
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,333
Wow, you too?

128
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,750
One thing, in particular,
when he talked about the curse.

129
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,750
Laugh all you want, but I have
no plans to be the third victim.

130
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,500
He said the third?

131
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,250
Yep, and as far as I know,

132
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,750
the news has only
reported one victim.

133
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,000
Strange, what are we
supposed to make of that?

134
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,375
Hard to say, but it didn't
feel like he misspoke.

135
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,291
I'm taking my dad's
research materials

136
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,083
to Ryuzoji's house today.

137
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,541
I'll use the opportunity
to check on him.

138
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,750
I appreciate that.
There was no one

139
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,208
I could really talk to
about this. So, thank you.

140
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,333
Please. Let me know if
you find anything.

141

[TAKUYA, YUKI sputtering]

142
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,458
[YUKI] I can do this,
I can do this, I can do it,

143
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,583

144
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,583
[TAKUYA, YUKI]
We're done!

145
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,125
[ERIKO] Once you turn
those in, you can go.

146
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,500

All right!

147

148
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,041
[YUKI]
Huh? You really have to go

149
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,166
to Ryuzoji's house
right now, Boss?

150
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,833
'Fraid so, I'm takin'
him my dad's stuff.

151
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,541
[YUKI] Well, You're
a lot braver than I am.

152
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,208
That mansion of his
totally creeps me out.

153

You coward.

154
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,041
I want to go, too!

155
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,916
I mean, it's only fair
since he promised me

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,666
before that I would
get to see his tapestry.

157
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,875
[TAKUYA] Look, I'm just
going to take some stuff,

158
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,291
and this one's all
I need to carry it.

159

Wait, did you say
I'm going with you?

160
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,416
[MIO] It would be awkward
for me to visit him on my own.

161
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,833
So, this is a good
chance for me to go!

162
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:51,750
Well, I don't mind you coming if
you feel that strongly about it.

163
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,583
[TAKUYA, MIO, YUKI gasp]

164
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,125
You wanna come, too?

165
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,041
I need to head home now.

166
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,500
[TAKUYA] Aren't you at all
curious about Ryuzoji's house?

167
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,333
Everyone's talking about
it 'cause of the curse.

168
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,333
He smells different.
Different from everyone else.

169
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,708
[BOTH]
Uh?

170
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,875
Ryuzoji is not the same.

171
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,333
[TAKUYA, MIO]
Uh...

172
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,500
Hatano can be kind of
tough to talk to, huh?

173
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,833
She's pretty intense,
it's true. So hot.

174
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,791
She seems to be avoiding
people deliberately.

175
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,166
But yeah, she's hot!

176
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,416
[BOYS]
Like, really, really hot.

177
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,250
Wow, what a shock that the boys
are into the mysterious beauty.

178
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,416
[doorbell buzzes]

179
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,458
I stand by it.
This place is terrifying.

180
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,708
[door creaks]

181
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,041
Well, hello, young people,

182
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,708
is there something I
can do for you today?

183
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,458
I brought the documents
that I was asked to bring.

184
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,333
I'm Arima.

185
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,958
Pardon?

186
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,500
[TAKUYA] Um. I called here
a little bit earlier.

187
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,208
Oh, dear, I'm so embarrassed.

188
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,666
When you get old, you forget so
much, everything's a surprise.

189
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,833
Do come in, won't you?

190
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,750
[UME] Goodness, it's a little
bit chilly today, isn't it?

191
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,750
Come on, stop walking so weird!

192
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,125
I'm trying but there could
be a wildcat or something,

193
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,208
you don't know!

194
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,500
Or even better,
there might be an alien.

195
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,916
[gasping] Boss, look over there!

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,750
[TAKUYA]
What is your problem?

197
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,458
It's just a rotten,
old storehouse. Shut up!

198
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,541
The mansion was originally
built 400 years ago,

199
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,875
and then the entire place was
completely remodeled.

200
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,625
It looks like it's in
pretty bad shape, though.

201
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,541
It's strange, isn't it?

202
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,458
Almost as if the storehouse
had traveled back in time.

203
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,875
[UME] Now then, let me guess,
you've come here to see my son?

204
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,916
[TAKUYA]
Uh. Yes, that's right, we have.

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,375
Except, that man
isn't my son anymore.

206
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,041
He's changed.
A mother sees these things.

207
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,791
[TAKUYA]
Hm?

208
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,875
I wonder. Have you children
heard this old saying.

209
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,833
I've pondered it lately,
"the swallows and sparrows

210
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,083
know not the thoughts
of geese and swans."

211
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,541
[ALL]
Uh...

212
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,416
[laughs] You should see
the look on all your faces!

213
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,375
[door slides]

214
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,291
Mother? What are you
talking about out here?

215
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,458
Oh! Uh, forgive me, dear.

216
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,166
You have to know I didn't
mean any harm by it!

217
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,541
Oh, please, forgive me!

218
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,666
[UME screams]

219
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,916
Well, welcome to the center
of the curse, kids.

220
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,541
I apologize if Mother
frightened you at all.

221
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,916
She has Alzheimer's

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,708
and doesn't seem to recognize
her own son anymore.

223
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,708
I didn't realize.

224
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,333
You're not very much
different in age than Ayumi,

225
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,708
isn't that right?

226
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,208
So, that's not something
you'll have to worry about.

227
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,000
Right. I guess.

228
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,375
[YUKI]
This place is so huge!

229
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:22,000
Or maybe it just looks that way
because there's no furniture.

230
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,708
I've gotten rid of everything
that isn't directly involved

231
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,500
with my research.
I don't even have a bed.

232
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,083
Where do you sleep
if not in a bed?

233
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,208
[RYUZOJI]
On the floor, of course.

234
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,458
[YUKI] That sounds
pretty uncomfortable.

235
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,625
I can't sleep in a soft bed.
I feel like I'm floating.

236
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,041
It's far too hard to relax.

237
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,125
[RYUZOJI]
This is the tapestry.

238
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,125
[MIO]
Whoa...

239
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,375
[TAKUYA]
Wow.

240
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,166
[YUKI]
It's enormous!

241
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,791
Is this piece from
400 years ago, too?

242
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,041
Probably. It's been here
for many, many years.

243
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,458
But it might have
come from overseas

244
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,166
and been brought over
here 400 years ago.

245
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,458
So, maybe it's even older.

246
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,833
[laughs] Chip off
the old block, huh?

247
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,833
You're exactly like
your father, you know.

248
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,208
Kodai made the same observation.

249
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,250
[TAKUYA grunts]

250
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,791
[YUKI] Whoa, it looks like
the people are on fire.

251
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,458
[MIO] You can almost
feel their suffering.

252
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,458
[TAKUYA]
Is it symbolic of something?

253
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,000
Maybe there's some
kind of hidden meaning.

254
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,750
[YUKI]
Oh, yeah! Cool!

255
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,833
[MIO] That structure kind of
reminds me of a church.

256
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,125
[TAKUYA] Yeah, it definitely
feels religious.

257
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,666
[YUKI] So, in that case,
do you think this bright light

258
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,708
is God punishing mankind or
something crazy like that?

259
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,083
[MIO]
Huh, maybe.

260
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,708
What sin would they have
committed, do you think?

261
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,125
Thank you for those
very interesting opinions.

262
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,875
I will take them
into consideration.

263
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,458
I'd love to sketch it.

264
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,291
Would you mind if I take some
time to do that while I'm here?

265
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,166
[RYUZOJI] Of course not!
You seem to like it quite a lot.

266
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,541
Yes. It's wonderful!

267
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,291
Actually, to be honest,

268
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,291
I didn't care for the tapestry
much when I first saw it.

269
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,166
I can see why. Looking at it

270
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,166
kinda kills your appetite
for anything fun at all.

271
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,208
However, once Kodai
demonstrated an interest in it,

272
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,791
I came to see the
tapestry in a new light.

273
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:13,833
Because of him?

274
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,583
Well, yes, you
have to understand,

275
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:19,333
I was well aware of the
strength of Kodai's intuition.

276
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,625
I think I'd like to talk with
Takuya in private, if I could.

277
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:25,958
Is that all right?

278
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,958
Of course! I'll stay here
and finish my sketch.

279
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,958
And I'm gonna hang out with her.

280
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,625
Excellent, we'll go
to my room, then.

281
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,041
This might come as a surprise,

282
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,041
but I've always wanted
to talk with you like this.

283
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,833
[TAKUYA]
Yeah, me too.

284
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,083
You remind me so
very much of him.

285
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,750
Of the Kodai Arima
I remember so well.

286
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,416
[TAKUYA]
I have a question.

287
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,333
Go right ahead.

288
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,041
Well, I've wanted to ask...

289
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,458
What was he
researching with you?

290
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,333
[RYUZOJI]
Mm. That is quite a question.

291
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:10,833
I'll have to go back a pretty
long way to explain that.

292
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:16,166
Kodai and I were classmates.
We were in college together.

293
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,666
Even then, we shared
a common goal.

294
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,791
We both wanted to discover
the hidden elements of history,

295
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:26,416
the things that would never
be put in any textbook.

296
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,125
Years later, Kodai was banished

297
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,875
from respectable
academic society.

298
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,291
[RYUZOJI] But I remained
extremely impressed

299
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,875
by his Four Hundred
Year Cycle theory.

300
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,041
[RYUZOJI]
So, naturally, I invited him

301
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,541
to come conduct his
research at my university.

302
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,083
Kodai focused on
Sakaimachi as a place

303
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,750
to research both the Four
Hundred Year Cycle Theory

304
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,291
and the Takanoamahara people.

305
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,458
[RYUZOJI] And then he met a
physicist, Yurika Imagawa,

306
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,875
who was investigating
the fact that the magnetic

307
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,041
and gravitational
fields of Sakaimachi

308
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,583
were different than
in other places.

309
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,416
We were engaged in nearly
constant heated debate.

310
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,666
Professor Imagawa was focused
on pursuing a unified theory,

311
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,708
based on quantum mechanics.

312
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,041
I ended up choosing
humans themselves

313
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,375
to be my research subjects.

314
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,291
Do you know what
your father picked?

315
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,875
Kodai dared to
choose immortality.

316
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,666
That was his research theme.

317
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,958
Immortality?

318
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,333
[RYUZOJI]
Do you find that surprising?

319
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,916
Well, I mean, I knew
he was a little nuts

320
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,041
but I didn't think
he was that crazy.

321
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,250
[RYUZOJI] Tell me this--
when you really consider it,

322
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,916
what do you think the dawn
of the universe was like?

323
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Or the dawn of this world,
if you prefer.

324
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,916
[TAKUYA]
Wait, what's this about?

325
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,916
[RYUZOJI]
I'm interested in your opinion.

326
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,916
For instance,
one prominent scientist

327
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,666
claims that the universe
has always existed.

328
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,875
[TAKUYA] That doesn't
seem realistic to me.

329
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,791
"Eternity" isn't real.

330
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,708
[RYUZOJI] Of course, one other
popular theory is the big bang.

331
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,666
[TAKUYA] Right. The one
that says a small,

332
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,041
high-density nucleus exploded
and became the universe.

333
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,541
[RYUZOJI] What are your
thoughts on that theory?

334
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,750
[TAKUYA]
Well. I mean,

335
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,958
it's at least better
than "eternity," right?

336
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,000
[RYUZOJI]
Okay, then, tell me this.

337
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,875
Before the big bang,
what existed around

338
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,291
the "small nucleus"
you speak of?

339
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:19,208
I... Yeah, I have no idea.

340
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:23,500
That's our job as researchers.
We theorize about things.

341
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:27,250
We study inexplicable events
and prove our theories.

342
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,750
But back to the subject at hand.
When we were working together,

343
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,750
Professor Imagawa's research
notes spoke of a woman.

344
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,083
According to the professor,

345
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,833
she lived in reclusion not
far from Ken-no-Misaki.

346
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,458
She was blind, and she
had the most perfect,

347
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:46,166
shining gold hair complimented
by beautiful, pale skin.

348
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,833
Her name was Keitia.

349
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,458
which was later
changed to Keiko.

350
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,250
And this young woman
was your mother.

351
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,916
[TAKUYA gasping]

352
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,333
[YUKI] The boss said
it was supposed

353
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,416
to be symbolic or something.

354
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,958
[MIO] If you look closely
and listen carefully,

355
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,291
you might be able to discover

356
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,833
a message from
those in the past.

357
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,291
[RYUZOJI]
Through his research,

358
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,458
Kodai ended up growing
very close to Keiko.

359
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:18,041
They fell in love and soon
after, you were born.

360
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:22,541
So strange. I barely have any
memory of my mother at all.

361
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,125
[RYUZOJI] It was easy
to forget she was blind.

362
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,500
Her lack of sight didn't
seem to hinder her.

363
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,333
She helped Kodai
with his research

364
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,250
and took care of you
when you were sick.

365
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,333
[TAKUYA]
Sick?

366
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,916
[RYUZOJI]
That's right.

367
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,958
You seemed to get fevers all the
time when you were very young.

368
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,708
I suppose that I could
send you after Kodai.

369
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,708
It's one option, anyway.

370
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,833
[MIO]
Hey, this is an entrance, right?

371
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,958
[YUKI] Yeah, now that you
mention it, it seems obvious.

372
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,125
For some reason, it reminds
me of something else.

373
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,375
[YUKI]
Of what?

374
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,875
[MIO]
Mm...

375
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,125
Somehow, we've managed
to go off-topic.

376
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,208
[TAKUYA gasps]

377
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,875
[RYUZOJI]
Takuya Arima.

378
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,291
Do you think I could
ask you a question?

379
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,208
I'll answer if it's
something I can tell you.

380
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,750
Be honest.

381
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,375
Did Kodai give you anything
at all before he disappeared?

382
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,625
[TAKUYA]
Mm! I have no idea.

383
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,833
As you're aware, he pretty
much up and died on me.

384
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,041
[RYUZOJI] Then did he leave
you anything? Anything at all?

385
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,791
Maybe something you
discovered later?

386
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,958
What are we talking about?

387
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,708
Uh.

388
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,500
[TAKUYA gasps]

389
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,541
[RYUZOJI] For example,
perhaps something similar

390
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,791
to a time machine?

391
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,166
[TAKUYA gasping]

392
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,875
[RYUZOJI]
Well?

393
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,875
No, he didn't.

394
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,875
[TAKUYA]
This is weird. I'm dizzy!

395
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,375
See, my theory,

396
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,500
is that Kodai found the truth
hidden here in Sakaimachi.

397
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,791
That's what I believe,
at any rate.

398
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,875
What's wrong?
I can see you sweating.

399
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,666
No, I'm... I don't know.

400
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,833
[TAKUYA] What is this?
What is he doing to me?

401
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,125
I know you must have a
device in your possession

402
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,666
which Kodai left
specifically for you.

403
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,000
[TAKUYA grunts]

404
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,375
[RYUZOJI] So, I want you
to give me what you have.

405
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,166
[TAKUYA grunting]

406
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,416
Now! Give it to me!

407
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,708
[TAKUYA groaning]

408
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,500
He was actually able
to resist the Niarb?

409
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,958
Is this because of the factor?

410
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,500
[knocking]

411
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,625
[MIO]
Sir?

412
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,458
[YUKI]
Hey, Boss?

413
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,000
[MIO]
You all right?

414
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,583
This was fun, but it's
time to call it a night.

415
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,625
[TAKUYA gasps]

416
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,041
[MIO]
Thank you for having us.

417
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,208
My pleasure, come back any time.

418
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,041
I would like to say it again.

419
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,416
I couldn't be more sorry
about Kodai, Takuya.

420
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,166
He could still be alive.

421
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,666
You know how persistent
the old man always was.

422
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,083
Not here, though. I bet
he's somewhere far away.

423
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,500
[RYUZOJI chuckles]
Those are the same eyes.

424
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,000
Sometimes Kodai would look at me

425
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,041
with exactly the same
expression on his face.

426
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,958
[YUKI]
Man, looking at that tapestry

427
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,458
for so long kinda made
my blood run cold.

428
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,208
[MIO]
Yeah, me too.

429
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,083
What were you and
Ryuzoji discussing

430
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,083
for all that time
together, boss?

431
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,083
Nothing much, just immortality.

432
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,291
[MIO, YUKI]
Huh?

433
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,333
[MIO] Really? It's not
like he's that old.

434
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,833
[YUKI]
Right?

435
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,458
Did you consider the words
I spoke to you before?

436
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,083
I hope you've at least given
them a bit of thought.

437
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:45,958
Uh...

438
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,250
Do you mean the thing you said

439
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,458
about the swallows
and the sparrows?

440
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:54,750
So, you haven't yet. I guess
I should've known that. [laughs]

441
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,208
Very well. Let me ask you
another question.

442
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,791
[ALL]
Huh...

443
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,500
Have you not noticed the thing
that exists within this mansion?

444
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,166
My ears can hear it
even if yours cannot.

445
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:11,041
Listen, it's the
breath of 400 years.
