[yelling]

2
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:11,733
No, wait!

3
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,317
[TAKUYA]
Yu-No. What's happened to you?

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,317
I'll kill anyone who
defies the Emperor!

5
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:28,358
[gasps]

6
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:29,358
What're you doing?

7
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:30,317
[TAKUYA]
Get down!

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,650
[YU-NO yelps]

9
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:18,900
[GUARD A] We won't tell
you assholes anything.

10
00:02:18,983 --> 00:02:20,525
Might as well give it up!

11
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,067
[ASCHE]
Is that so?

12
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,983
Well, maybe I'll just start
carving you up, piece by piece,

13
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:26,567
until you change your mind.

14
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,983
Your ears, your eyelids,
then your lips.

15
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,608
[whimpering]

16
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,358
[KURTZ]
I'm glad you're safe Boss!

17
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,608
[DEO]
That was crazy.

18
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,358
I wasn't expecting her
to be there, were you?

19
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:39,608
[TAKUYA] The girl in
the mask was my daughter.

20
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,983
Huh...?

21
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,775
Hold on, you have a daughter
who wants to kill you?

22
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:45,733
Is it possible it's just
a rebellious phase?

23
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,608
[TAKUYA]
I don't know why or how,

24
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:50,442
but Yu-No's completely
forgotten about me.

25
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:52,192
Still...

26
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,442
You know what I think?

27
00:02:56,525 --> 00:03:00,150
I believe that her memory
loss is only temporary.

28
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:02,942
So if it comes back...

29
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:04,192
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,025
Do you even realize
how many of our men

31
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:08,525
the masked woman
has already killed?

32
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:12,733
I'm sorry, but I'm asking
you to leave her to me.

33
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:22,692
[TAKUYA] What's this,
an underground tunnel?

34
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:25,233
Yeah, it's kinda creepy.

35
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:29,983
[TAKUYA] The event element
measurement device.

36
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,150
[DEO]
The longer we take,

37
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,942
the more likely we
are to be discovered.

38
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:35,483
Yeah, you're right!
Let's get going!

39
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:48,150
[TAKUYA]
What is this place?

40
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,733
[KURTZ]
Careful, that looks dangerous!

41
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,192
[KURTZ]
Who is that?

42
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:07,442
Another prisoner?

43
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,192
Hey, you okay?

44
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,650
It's been a long time, Takuya.

45
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,275
[gasping]

46
00:04:14,358 --> 00:04:16,233
[TAKUYA]
Ryuzoji!

47
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,192
Wait, do you know this guy?

48
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:20,483
Quick then,
let's get him free.

49
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,817
No, don't.

50
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,358
I thought you knew him?

51
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,942
Tell me, why did you
let them catch you?

52
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:28,983
You don't even have a body.
You could escape this!

53
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,608
Heh. Well, the story is

54
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:34,108
the Divine Emperor
outsmarted me.

55
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:36,525
I never would've expected
her to work with Mother

56
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:40,067
and prepare a divine
device to seal me.

57
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,733
C'mon, let's go.

58
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:47,817
You're looking for the
priestess, isn't that right?

59
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,233
What was your darling
daughter's name again?

60
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:54,150
Ah, yes. Yu-No.
I think that was it.

61
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:58,692
[TAKUYA]
Where is she? Tell me!

62
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,358
What happens when you find out?

63
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,483
What are you planning
to do then?

64
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,108
Don't tell me you're
actually thinking of saving

65
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:08,525
the daughter who attempted
to take your life!

66
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,942
[growls]

67
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:11,192
Who is this?

68
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:14,108
That's a really good question.

69
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,900
[ASCHE grunting]
It's no good.

70
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,525
This goes way beyond
my lock-picking skills.

71
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:21,025
[AMANDA]
Well, then.

72
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:23,067
Something important
must be in there.

73
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,817
[SALA]
Oh? Is that you, Amanda?

74
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,900
[AMANDA]
Sala!

75
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:30,108
[ASCHE]
Well isn't this convenient.

76
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:32,650
Been a long time!

77
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,067
[TAKUYA]
Tell me! Where is Yu-No?

78
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,983
I can only tell you one thing.

79
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:43,442
In order to allow the god
entrance into her body,

80
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:46,025
it's necessary for a
priestess to offer up

81
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:48,317
one of her body's functions.

82
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,233
Your mother. Keitia.

83
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:55,317
She offered sight as her
sacrifice and became blind.

84
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,317
So my mom was a priestess?

85
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,067
[RYUZOJI]
Your wife, Sayless,

86
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,067
decided to choose words
as her sacrifice.

87
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,275
So, of course,
she could never speak.

88
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:07,858
And as for your daughter, Yu-No,

89
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:09,858
she chose to offer her heart,

90
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:12,442
which meant that she
lost all her memories.

91
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:13,942
That's why...

92
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,192
[RYUZOJI] But there's still
a way to get her heart back

93
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,692
if that's what you want.

94
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:19,192
[gasps]

95
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:22,400
If you help me now, break
this barrier and set me free,

96
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,358
I'll tell you anything
you'd like to know.

97
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:26,775
[TAKUYA]
You know I can't do that!

98
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:30,108
I was under the impression you
wanted to save your daughter.

99
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:32,150
Your beloved Yu-No.

100
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,817
[ERIKO]
Ryuzoji!

101
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,525
Nice of you to drop in.

102
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,150
How nice, this is like
a little reunion.

103
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:45,233
I've finally found you.

104
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,442
Where did the hot
lady come from?

105
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:50,442
Takuya, is this another person
you knew from before?

106
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,317
You could say that.

107
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:58,400
So, I'm guessing this must be
a pretty enormous weight

108
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,817
off your shoulders, huh?

109
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,400
Yes. Thanks for all your help.

110
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:05,317
You two are so naive it's
almost embarrassing.

111
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,067
You have no clue
what he really wants.

112
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,192
[DEO]
Just ignore him.

113
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:13,900
Doesn't this seem strange
to you, though?

114
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,025
He defiled the last priestess,

115
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:18,442
and now his daughter
is the new priestess.

116
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:19,692
[gasps]

117
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,525
That's just the beginning.

118
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,108
Isn't it also a little curious
that he knows me?

119
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:27,442
And that he also knows
that strange woman

120
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,900
who appeared out of nowhere.

121
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,942
Wow, did you get tired of
the skin-tight mini-skirt?

122
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:35,525
Not that this doesn't work.

123
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:36,900
[ERIKO]
What do you mean?

124
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,775
This happens to be the
official uniform for my job,

125
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,775
thank you very much.

126
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:43,233
[DEO yells]

127
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:44,525
Stop!

128
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,567
[DEO grunts]

129
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,067
Niarb! Ryuzoji!

130
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:54,358
[grunts]

131
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:57,692
[TAKUYA]
The barrier!

132
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:02,983
[laughs] Looks like it's
now time for me to go.

133
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,608
[TAKUYA]
Wait! Ryuzoji!

134
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:16,900
He's going to try to get
back to the imperial city.

135
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:21,650
All he ever wants to do
is create more chaos.

136
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,775
But don't worry.
I'll catch him before that.

137
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:29,983
[ASCHE]
You sure about this, Sala?

138
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:31,983
You're a maid here
in the city now, right?

139
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,900
[SALA]
Don't worry, it's fine.

140
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,358
Honestly, if you're here, I
figure that must mean the castle

141
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:39,025
is pretty much done for, anyway.

142
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:41,192
[ASCHE whistles]

143
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,858
[SALA] I've already had my
share of fun with the guards.

144
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:44,942
[AMANDA]
You what?

145
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,817
Sorry. You didn't
need to know that.

146
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,025
Bye-bye, now! See ya around!

147
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:55,233
[SALA humming]

148
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,733
[sighs] She's just
the same as ever.

149
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:01,608
[sighs] Now my head's throbbing
like nobody's business.

150
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:05,358
Yeah, I feel like I've got
the worst hangover of my life.

151
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:07,192
[TAKUYA] And of course, the
room where they're keeping

152
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,733
the priestess is super
heavily guarded.

153
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:13,608
How the heck are we
gonna get through?

154
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,650
Hey, Boss, leave it to us!

155
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:19,525
Yeah, we kinda need to pay
you back for our screw-up.

156
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:20,567
[KURTZ]
Intruders!

157
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,233
[DEO]
Intruders inside the castle!

158
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:23,567
[GUARD B]
What?

159
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,942
[KURTZ] Quick! We must

That you're the Divine Emperor.

234
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,733
That's quite a long story.

235
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:19,358
[AYUMI] That day, when I
was struck by lightning

236
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:25,275
on Mount Sankaku, I somehow
ended up in Dela Granto.

237
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:28,567
I was saved by Ryuzoji,
who, by that point,

238
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,233
was no longer even human.

239
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,900
Under his supervision,

240
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:35,942
I officially took control
of Grand Mother.

241
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,942
Over the long years,
the people of Dela Granto

242
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:40,817
had unfortunately
lost the ability

243
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,358
to control the Unified Computer.

244
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:46,942
I tried to find every
piece of information

245
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,900
I could from Mother.

246
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:52,192
That's how I eventually learned
that Ryuzoji was planning

247
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:57,817
to rule over this country
using Mother's power.

248
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,942
Grand Mother seemed to
become more and more afraid

249
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:05,358
of Ryuzoji, so she chose me
as the one to defeat him.

250
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:06,858
With her help,

251
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:09,275
I was able to create a device
that could seal creatures

252
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:11,400
with no bodies, like Ryuzoji,

253
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:14,692
and we locked him
below the city.

254
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:20,192
That's when I chose to become
the Divine Emperor myself.

255
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,900
The lucky thing was,

256
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:27,192
Mother's will was respected
like some kind of god.

257
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:30,483
So the transition
didn't take long at all.

[AYUMI]
When I became Divine Emperor,

276
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:16,442
I learned the relationship
between Earth and Dela Granto.

277
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:20,400
It was thousands,
maybe millions, no...

278
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:23,317
Tens of millions of years
ago, on the planet Earth,

279
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,025
there lived a
civilization that was

280
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,483
incredibly advanced,
scientifically.

[GROUP gasps]

282
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:31,858
The people who are living
now have a term for them.

283
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:34,692
They are known as
the Earth Precursors.

284
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:37,442
But then, one day, their
civilization suddenly became

285
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:41,442
exposed to a tremendous
danger. The scientists...

286
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,608
[AI] ...all predicted that
big meteors would fall

287
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,400
all over the planet and
that everyone would die!

288
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,233
And those meteors...

289
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,983
...had a name of their own.
"The Tears of God."

290
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:52,233
So, you're saying the race

291
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:54,817
that ruled the earth was
destroyed by meteors.

292
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,692
Sounds like the dinosaurs.

293
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:59,025
[AYUMI] Their scientific
abilities had reached the point

294

where even the will of god
had no effect on them.

295

their destruction...

where it would be safe!

301

Dela Granto, as we know it.

302

[TAKUYA chuckles] So the whole
neighborhood up and moved, huh?

Basically! Yes, they did.

304
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:33,275
And the leader of that move

305
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:36,317
was the prominent
female scientist, Grantia.

306

[TAKUYA]
A scientist? Not a politician?

307
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:42,400
[AYUMI] Yes. Massive amounts
of new technology

308
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:45,817
was necessary to allow humans
to live in another dimension.

309
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,692
For example, they needed
artificial plants...

310
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,942
...to provide an oxygen supply.

311
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:54,483
And a heavy fusion reactor,
the artificial sun, Melgio.

312
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,275
You know all those
pretty well, right?

313
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:59,233
But the environment in
this other dimension

314
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:03,900
was too different. So, sadly,
everybody started to die.

315
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,608
Humans dropped down to 10%

316
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:08,608
of their former population,
poor things!

317
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:10,483
So they tried something else.

318
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,525
They modified the living
beings themselves

319
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,567
to give them the power to adapt
to the new environment.

320
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,442
[TAKUYA]
They altered living beings?

321
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:18,817
[AYUMI]
Correct.

322
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,025
Didn't you ever notice anything
particularly strange

323
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:22,942
about the various
creatures in this world?

324
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,233
[gasps]

325
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,483
[TAKUYA]
Of course.

326
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,192
That's why Yu-No grew up
as fast as she did, right?

327
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:35,233
[AYUMI] That was another
result of her adaptation

328
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:37,650
to the environment.
Her time as an adult

329
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:40,150
was increased so she'd
be more productive.

330
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:41,650
Wow, fascinating.

331
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:44,525
[AYUMI] But, and this
is terrible to say...

332
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,233
A lot of the
modification attempts

333
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:48,400
ended up being failures.

334
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:55,650
[AMANDA]
No! Then these monsters...

335
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,733
She's saying they used to
be human, just like us!

336
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:00,442
[AI]
But at the same time,

337
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:03,233
they became unable to survive
on the floating continent

338
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:05,900
without a certain
essential energy ore.

339
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:08,317
And the name of that ore was...

340
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,275
[BOTH]
...it was psychite.

341
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,608
The same thing that I had
been researching at Geotech.

342
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:16,108
[TAKUYA] It was also the
stone that Kanna needed.

343
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:19,317
The one I came to Dela Granto
for in the first place.

344
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,858
But then, just when they'd
solved that problem,

345
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:23,692
they realized that
their calculations

346
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,192
for Dela Granto's
orbit were off!

347
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:30,525
[GRANTIA] According to the
orbital calculations I've done,

348
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:34,108
our dimensional floating
continent and Earth

349
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:36,442
have continually
approached and separated

350
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:38,275
from each other over time.

351
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:42,067
And all of this occurred
over a 400-year cycle.

352
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,275
Are you serious?

353
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:46,817
Then my dad's 400
Year Cycle Theory...

354
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,400
[AYUMI]
As it turns out, he was right.

355
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:53,025
Also, only the leader of the
scientists Grantia was able

356
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:57,233
to control the enormous,
floating continent. But...

357
00:19:57,317 --> 00:19:59,650
I'm aware, there is
no way to escape

358
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:02,067
from the end of
my natural lifespan.

359
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,650
So, I have developed technology

360
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,983
that will allow my mind
to live on as data

361
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:10,983
and therefore control the
continent even after my death.

362
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:14,108
Unfortunately, it has
one undeniable flaw.

363
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:16,275
It requires a specific catalyst.

364
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:18,858
Someone with whom
I can synchronize.

365
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:21,983
The catalyst needed
is a human female.

366
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,567
You mean the priestess?

367
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,067
[AYUMI] Yes. Grantia's scan
program would select her.

368
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,817
She would be required to lose
one of her body's functions

369
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,608
in order to make it
easier to synchronize.

370
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:34,983
So, my mom served
as the catalyst,

371
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,567
and then Sayless,
and now it's Yu-No's turn.

372
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:43,483
Takuya. The Earth
and Dela Granto

373
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:46,900
are about to be at their
point of maximum approach.

374
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:52,483
[AI] If Earth and Dela
Granto get too close,

375
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:55,900
then it's Ka-boom! Big trouble.

376
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:57,608
[ALL grunt]

377
00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:00,275
So we're gonna die?
What can we do?

378
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:02,525
You just need to do the ritual.

379
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:04,817
The priestess needs to
synchronize with Grantia

380
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,525
and avoid the collision!
If that happens...

381
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:11,317
...then both worlds
will be saved.

382
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,192
However, nothing good
ever comes without a price.

383
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,275
I'm so sorry, Takuya, this is
very difficult to tell you,

384
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:25,275
but even if the ritual succeeds,
the priestess, Yu-No,

385
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:27,442
will most likely be annihilated.

386
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,192
[gasps]

387
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:31,692
Thank you, that concludes
my presentation.

388
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:35,733
So what did you think?
Pretty interesting stuff, huh?

389
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,317
So, that means the ritual
we all thought was a lie...

390
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,733
The priestess, and the Divine
Emperor's involvement...

391
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:47,442
It's real. This proves
that all of it was true.

392
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:49,483
We came here with
one major goal,

393
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:52,775
which was to stop
that ritual. But now...

394
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:56,233
[AI] If that happens, I think
you'll have a big problem.

395
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:57,817
