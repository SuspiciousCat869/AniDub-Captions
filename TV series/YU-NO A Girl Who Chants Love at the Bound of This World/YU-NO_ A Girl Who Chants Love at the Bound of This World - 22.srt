[whip cracking]

2
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:19,775
[BAZUKU] Where are your little
resistance friends hiding?

3
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:22,858
And what exciting new
plot are they cooking up?

4
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:26,358
Trust me, it's best
if you cooperate.

5
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:28,650
We want the Divine Emperor.

6
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,858
Really? Go on.

7
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:36,025
We're gonna shove your
head directly up his ass.

8
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:37,483
[laughs]

9
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,900
I'm glad you find all
of this so amusing.

[AMANDA groaning]

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,692
Don't worry, I won't
kill you just yet.

14
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:55,983
Patch her up.

15
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:57,025
Sir!

16
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,358
[PRISON GUARD A]
On your feet!

[PRISONER D]
Please! Let me go home!

20
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:35,358
You shut your mouth!

21
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:38,442
[PRISONER D] I'm begging you,
please, I have a daughter!

22
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:40,400
Daughter?

23
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:42,358
[PRISONER D] Don't you
understand? She needs me!

24
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:43,775
Go on, get back to work!

25
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:45,275
[PRISONER D]
But I didn't do anything!

26
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:46,983
You have to send me home!

27
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,942
[screams]

28
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,900
You think this is a show?

29
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:54,983
All of you, get your
asses back to work!

30
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:56,233
Hey!

31
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,817
[gasps] Oh, no!

32
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,442
[PRISON GUARD A]
What, another one?

33
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:02,817
I'm tryin' to stop the guy!

34
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,650
[PRISON GUARD A]
No, wait!

35
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,108
[PRISONER D panting, crying]

36
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:07,358
Hey!

00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:11,733
[PRISONER D panting, crying]

38
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:14,108
Uh! Don't!

39
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,275
[TAKUYA groans]

40
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:06,483
You just worry
about yourself.

41
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:09,400
The other prisoners don't
need your meddling.

42
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,775
[TAKUYA grunting]

43
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:13,108
You're never gonna
learn, are you?

44
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:16,692
[TAKUYA] Persistence is one
of my better qualities.

45
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:19,233
Sorry everything's
taking so long.

46
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:23,108
Me and the others, we're still
working on our escape plan.

47
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:28,025
Well, I'm not dead yet,
so, I guess I've got time.

48
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:30,692
"As long as you don't
die, there's hope.

49
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:34,900
And as long as there is hope,
there's possibility.

50
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,983
And as long as
there's possibility,

51
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:40,650
you must continue to live."

52
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,608
Y'know, I like that.

53
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:46,775
[TAKUYA] Someone very
important to me told me that.

54
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:49,608
Thank you. I'll remember it.

55
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:56,067
[PRISONER C] Hey, better eat
up. You'll need your strength.

56
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,275
[PRISONER B]
That man.

57
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:59,567
He said he had
a daughter, right?

58
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,567
Yeah, he did.

59
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,942
Such a shame.

60
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:05,483
I have a family on
the outside, too.

61
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,317
[PRISONER C]
We all do.

62
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,733
[PRISONER C]
Right.

63
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:14,567
[KURTZ] So listen, the escape
plan has two separate parts.

64
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,067
For our first move, we'll create
some confusion in the quarry.

65
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,400
At that point, we'll take
advantage of the chaos

66
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,358
in order to rescue our leader.

67
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,025
When is this happening?

68
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:27,483
It will all happen on the day
they carry out the coffin.

69
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,233
[gasps] Bazuku, sir!

70
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:45,400
[BAZUKU]
It's ugly!

71
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:49,900
Look at that! Half-finished
piece of trash!

72
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,483
Start over! Now!

73
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,900
The ritual is upon us!

74
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:58,108
So you'd better make damn
sure that this is ready!

75
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:01,233
[TAKUYA] Explain to me
why we're doing it

76
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,275
on the day they
carry out the coffin.

77
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:05,608
I still don't get how
we could possibly leave.

78
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,108
Not with the tower there.

79
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:08,608
Don't worry.

80
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:11,608
They're shutting the tower down
that day, just to be safe.

81
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:14,525
I mean, the guards don't want
to die any more than we do.

82
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,942
[KURTZ]
So, we hit them when it's off.

83
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:20,108
[TAKUYA] Will both the Tower
of Garzel and the backup

84
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,192
really shut down?

85
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:24,692
Well, that's the hope,
but we can't be sure.

86
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,525
This is new territory for us.

87
00:06:26,608 --> 00:06:29,650
We've actually never
seen them do this before.

88
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:34,525
So, if they leave the second one
up in order to prevent escapees.

89
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:38,817
[KURTZ] Then we'll need to
shut that one down, too.

90
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,817
[BAZUKU] It's the perfect
accessory for a beauty like you.

91
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,858
[AMANDA] Hmph. I won't
need to wear a disguise

92
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:47,483
in the imperial city anymore.

93
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:50,025
You know something?
If you weren't a sworn enemy

94
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:52,692
of the state, I'd want
to hire you, myself.

95
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:55,150
Heh. Funny, I'd rather die.

96
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,608
[BAZUKU]
I say we play a little game.

97
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:00,942
Called "how long can you
hold that tongue of yours?"

98
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:10,858
Actually... Here's the thing--

99
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:13,192
I once destroyed
the Tower of Garzel.

100
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,192
That's ridiculous.

101
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:15,442
Wait, how?

102
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:20,692
Hey! Take a sword and
stab it into the tower.

103
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,067
It'll act as a lightning rod,

104
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,233
using the tower's own
electricity to destroy it.

105
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:30,608
Are you serious? You're
pulling our legs now, right?

106
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:35,233
No, that's what happened.
I'm telling you the truth.

107
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:37,442
[DEO, KURTZ]
Uh...

108
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,817
[KURTZ] Well.... I don't
think this really changes

109
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,150
the plan itself.

110
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:44,233
Someone will still need to
destroy the backup, too.

111
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,525
I don't see a good way for us
to accomplish all of this

112
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:48,067
with only three people.

113
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,983
[footsteps]

114
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,233
[PRISONER C]
Hey.

115
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:55,108
We want to help out with
what you're planning.

116
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,608
We're willing to do anything
to get out of here.

117
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,775
For our families
on the outside!

118
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:01,650
[DEO, TAKUYA gasping]

119
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,067
[KURTZ]
Uh, wow.

120
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,900
[KURTZ laughs]

121
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:06,983
[DEO]
Well, Takuya?

122
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:14,358
If this plan ends up failing,
our fate's worse than torture.

123
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:19,150
If you're not okay
with that, then, go.

124
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,150
Even if this works,
some of you will die.

125
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:25,067
This is your last
chance to back out.

126
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:36,400
Okay, that means everyone
here right now is one of us.

127
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,567
[ALL]
Welcome to the resistance!

128
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,608
[BAZUKU] So, what's the latest
gossip on the prison ward?

129
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:51,650
Do you remember Takuya,
prisoner number 10-98?

130
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,525
It appears he's
friendly with Amanda.

131
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:58,733
I wonder if he might be
a part of the resistance.

132
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:03,192
[BAZUKU laughs]
That's not possible.

133
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,192
I know why he
was imprisoned.

134
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:07,192
He defiled the priestess
at the border,

135
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,192
the boundary at the
edge of the world.

136
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:11,442
He's not one of them.

137
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:14,942
There's another rat
in my prison. But...

138
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,525
[gasps]

139
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:19,192
[BAZUKU] He does seem to have
the right touch with the ladies.

140
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:21,483
That may come in handy.

141
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,817
I brought the prisoner!

142
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,192
All right. Now get inside.

143
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,233
Try to behave yourself.

144
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,192
[BAZUKU]
Welcome!

145
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:44,942
This seems like a
pretty fancy room

146
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,275
for the middle of the desert.

147
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:50,525
[laughs] Come along, I have
something to show you.

148
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:54,025
[gasps] This tapestry.

149
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:55,358
Well, what do you think?

150
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:57,900
An evocative piece
wouldn't you say?

151
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,400
[TAKUYA]
Yeah.

152
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:02,483
Looking at it kinda kills your
appetite for anything fun.

153
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:06,358
I like a young man
with an artistic soul.

154
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:11,608
Did you really bring me here
just to talk to me about art?

155
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,858
[BAZUKU] I'm actually
offering you a deal.

156
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:15,192
[TAKUYA]
Hm?

157
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:17,817
A little bird told me that
you're close to Amanda.

158
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,692
I want you to use your charms
to get her to talk to you.

159
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:23,692
What do I get if I do?

160
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:26,358
If you succeed, then I'll
let you see your daughter.

161
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:30,775
And her name is Yu-No?
If I'm not mistaken.

162
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:33,442
You'll let me decide how
it happens, though, right?

163
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,025
Well, yes, of course!

164
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:38,317
You can even make her
yours, if you like.

165
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,692
[TAKUYA]
Okay.

166
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,775
Can you lend me
that sword, then?

167
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,650
[BAZUKU]
Why, whatever for?

168
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:46,067
It belonged to
the knight, Ailia.

169
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,275
Amanda's sister, the only
relative that she had left.

170
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,150
Should come in handy.

171
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:56,275
Yes, that'll be fine.
You may have it.

172
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:19,442
[BAZUKU]
Very well!

173
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:23,858
The priestess's coffin
is finally complete!

174
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:26,983
[PRISONERS sighing, chattering]

175
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,650
[PRISONERS chattering]

176
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:34,983
[TAKUYA]
Can you help me?

177
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,733
I need to talk to Amanda.

178
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:39,233
Uh? Tonight? That'll be tough.

179
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:44,358
I really need it to be tonight.
Go check with Bazuku.

180
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,858
That's fine with me.

181
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:46,817
[PRISON GUARD H]
U-Uh.

182
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,525
[BAZUKU]
Let him do as he wishes.

183
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,400
But tonight the
priestess's coffin--

184
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:52,942
That was overdone.

185
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:55,108
Bring me another.

186
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:56,358
Sir.

187
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:16,650
[PRISON GUARD A]
Go!

188
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:17,900
[PRISON GUARDS]
Sir!

189
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:25,275
Okay. Here's the part
where it gets fun.

190
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:29,692
[TAKUYA]
Thanks.

191
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,775
[TAKUYA]
Don't blame me for this.

192
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,358
[AMANDA whimpers]

[PRISONERS yelling]

194
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,775
[BAZUKU]
What is that?

195
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:50,608
[yelling]

196
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:55,317
[PRISONER B yells]

197
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,192
[PRISON GUARD A] You dog!
You're going to regret this!

198
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:01,733
You saved me!

199
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,400
Yep, looks like you owe me.

200
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:07,025
Stay together! We can't
go off course, now!

201
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:08,358
Stick to the plan!

202
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:10,150
Head for the Tower of Garzel!

203
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:11,233
[BAZUKU growling]

204
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:12,567
[PRISON GUARD A]
Warden Bazuku.

205
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,650
The prisoners, they're rioting!

206
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,192
Then activate the
towers, you idiot!

207
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:19,650
[PRISON GUARD A]
Sir, we can't.

208
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,025
You see, they're using some
of the guards as hostages!

209
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:25,525
We couldn't possibly
attack our own men!

210
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:26,525
[PRISON GUARD A gasps]

211
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:28,775
Do you think I care?
Get it done!

212
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,192
[PRISON GUARD A]
But, I...

213
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,108
Listen to me, you're all being
paid very competitively

214
00:13:32,192 --> 00:13:34,483
for taking on the
risks of this job!

215
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,567
Therefore, if I ask you
to die, then you will!

216
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,733
[PRISON GUARD A]
Die?

217
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,108
Fine, then I shall
have to do it myself.

218
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:49,108
Here we go. You ready?

219
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:50,233
Ready.

220
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,525
[KURTZ]
Hey, Boss! Look, I got it!

221
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,817
[TAKUYA]
Bazuku's headed for the Tower!

222
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,692
Be careful!

223
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:06,733
Leave it to me!

224
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,858
This is the judgment of god!

225
00:14:30,942 --> 00:14:32,775
[PRISONERS, GUARDS yelling]

226
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,858
No! Run away!

227
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:41,817
[PRISONERS, GUARDS whimper]

228
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,400
[PRISON GUARD C]
Look at the Tower!

229
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:46,650
Turn back, now!

230
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:47,900
Right!

231
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:52,983
[BAZUKU laughs]
It's time to accept your fate!

232
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:57,567
[AMANDA]
That's not good.

233
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,900
First thing, we have
to stop Bazuku!

234
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:06,942
[DEO] Damn it!
That backup tower is active!

235
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:08,567
Can you throw the sword?

236
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,858
[KURTZ] Maybe, but I'd
have to get closer!

237

00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,025
[gasps] Amanda!

241
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:21,400
[BAZUKU]
Stay where you are, don't move.

242
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:23,817
I would advise you to
put down that sword.

243
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,442
By the way, don't get any
funny ideas, all right?

244
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,317
I have this feeling
you're the kind of person

245
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,608
who wouldn't sleep well if
she died because of you.

246
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:35,483
[BAZUKU laughs]

247
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:39,650
Now let her go.

248
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:40,942
[BAZUKU]
Not quite yet.

249

[gasps]

250
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,525
First, I'll need you
to do me a favor

251
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,233
and kill all the prisoners.

[gasps]

253
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:49,858
[BAZUKU] I'll keep an eye
on her while you see to that.

254
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:54,400
What happened?
Why'd the lightning stop?

255
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:55,567
Here they come!

256
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,233
Go, guys, go!

257
00:15:57,317 --> 00:16:00,442
We need to open
a path for Kurtz!

258
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,400
Do it, now!

right, after all!

[BAZUKU]
You bastards!

Seems you have more than
your fair share of luck,

267
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,567
but your good fortune ends now.

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,817
I'll show you the price
for double-crossing me!

Please, help!

You can't just leave
here me to die!

Get in here and save me!

[TAKUYA] No good.
I think we have to jump!

291
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,692
[AMANDA] Impossible. Break so
much as a leg and you'll die

292
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,942
in the desert before you
reach the imperial city.

Would you rather we both
get fried here, then?

294
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:07,275
I don't plan to be killed by
lightning or die of thirst.

295
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:10,358
I choose death on my own terms.

As long as you're still
alive, there's hope.

And as long as there's hope,
there's possibility.

there's possibility,

grown up since we went away.

00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:58,358
[TAKUYA, AMANDA scream]

320
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,733
[AMANDA groaning]

321
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,108
[TAKUYA]
Ow...

322
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,692
Kunkun?

323
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:20,025
Sorry. I pushed too hard.

324
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,775
No, it's okay.

325
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:25,733
Thank you for always
taking care of me.

326
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:29,025
[TAKUYA] I'm the one who
should be thanking you!

327
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:35,400
I love you and Yu-No so much.

328
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:38,942
Yeah. We'll play again someday.

329
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:40,567
All of us.

330
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:47,942
I want to be one
with you. I want to...

331
00:20:48,025 --> 00:20:49,567
[TAKUYA gasping]

332
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,775
Will you please...
let me do that?

333
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,775
Kunkun.

334
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,900
Take this.

335
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,192
What for?

336
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:09,442
[AMANDA]
Nogards are food.

337
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,442
You understand?

338
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,192
[TAKUYA]
You-- You can't be serious!

339
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,900
She's not gonna survive long.

340
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:21,650
Do your duty as her owner.

341
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:22,733
[TAKUYA]
What are you even--

342
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:25,483
The imperial city
is a long way off.

343
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,942
Would you rather die here?

344
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:30,317
And let her death
be for nothing?

345
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:33,650
But, I...

346
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:38,275
[AMANDA]
It was her last wish.

347
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,192
Honor that.

348
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,358
It's okay.

349
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:06,317
[KUNKUN]
I love you, Papa.
