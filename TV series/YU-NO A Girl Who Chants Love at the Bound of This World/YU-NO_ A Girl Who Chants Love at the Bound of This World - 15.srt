[KANNA]
Hey, what'd you make?

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,833
[TAKUYA] A mermaid!
And now she's finished!

4
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,666
[gasping]

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,583
[KANNA]
Aw, it washed away, huh?

6
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,083
I'll make another one!

7
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,625
Great! How about
we do it together?!

8
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,458
[TAKUYA]
Yeah!

[AYUMI] Takuya!
Hey, are you awake up there?

[grunting]

15
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,541
[AYUMI]
Your friends are here!

16
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,375
They look ready for
some fun in the sun!

17
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,208
[YUKI, MIO laugh]

18
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,833
Would you like to come in?

19
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,083
Oh, thanks, but we're
okay to wait here.

20
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,416
[YUKI, AYUMI]
Uh?

21
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,791
Sorry, guys, I'll be ready
in just a few minutes!

22
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,041
Come on, Boss, a day
of adventure awaits!

23
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,875
Hurry! We're gonna miss
the train if you don't.

24
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,041
[YUKI]
Want me to help you pack?

25
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,958
[MIO laughs]
That's so weird.

26
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,083
They're bein' loud again today.

27
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,916
[AYUMI]
Did you remember sunblock?

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,416
Oh, and you sure
don't want to forget

29
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,375
this insect spray, either!

30
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,375
Right, yeah. Thank you.

31
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,083
Oh, I forgot!

32
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,083
Where do we keep
the fever reducer?

33
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,458
It's always in the second
drawer of the cupboard.

34
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,833
Why, do you have a fever?

35
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,250
Nah, just like to be prepared.

36
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,000
[AYUMI]
Speaking of "just in case,"

37
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,083
you should bring a few
candles with you, too.

38
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,083
Sure, also. I was thinking
a harness and a whip

39
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,875
might come in handy. Those would
be in your room, right?

40
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,583
No! Of course I don't
have a whip!

41
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,958
I'm out!

42
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:23,625
[AYUMI]
Oh, wait, one more thing! There.

43
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,583
This was Kodai's.
It suits you.

44
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,625
[TAKUYA]
Okay. See ya.

45
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,416
[AYUMI]
You all have a good time!

46
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,750
--[YUKI, MIO] Thanks!
--[TAKUYA] We will!

47
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:33,791
So, it's three of them, huh?

48
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,083
[YUKI]
I can't freakin' wait!

49
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,041
[YUKI, MIO laughing]

50
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,791

[YUKI, MIO laughing]

52
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,291
Wasn't that Hojo?

53
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,291
[doorbell rings]

54
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,166
[KANNA]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

55
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,875
[YUKI]
Whoa! Hatano, you look so cute!

56
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,291
[TAKUYA] Yeah, it's weird seeing
you out of your uniform.

57
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,250
Well, I guess we'd better go!

58
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,000
If we don't, we'll be
late for our train.

59
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,625
[YUKI] Hey, Shimazu!
You should try one of these!

60
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,833
It's addicting but
it's totally worth it.

61
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:24,083
You can have some, too,
if you want! Don't be shy!

62
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,541
[TAKUYA]
Is all this crap we brought

63
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,125
really necessary, though?

64
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,708
[YUKI] Yes! It's stuff you need
on a summer trip to the beach!

65
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,583
That's fair, but couldn't
we have at least

66
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,708
blown up the swim ring
after we got there?

67
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,958
Pretty sure you can buy
watermelons there, too.

68
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,791
No, if they only
have pre-cut ones,

69
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,000
we wouldn't be able to
do watermelon splitting!

70
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,000
Would that really be
such a bad thing?

71
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,958
Yes, it would actually
be a terrible thing

72
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,750
because Shimazu said
she's never done it!

73
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,833
Uh. Really? That's just
what you do in the summer!

74
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,833
Yeah, well, my dad
said I wasn't allowed.

75
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,416
Right, I get it.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,833
A fancy girl like you can't be
exposed to anything so barbaric.

77
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,625
It's her first classic
summertime experience!

78
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,583
And I'm gonna be beside her
every step of the way!

79
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,833
It's your first time,
too, isn't it?

80
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,541
Would you like someone
to stick beside you

81
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,083
every step of the way, too?

82
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,333
No, I've actually split
watermelon before, so, I'm good.

83
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,333
Oh, Is that right?

84
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,041
I have to admit, I have a
pretty hard time imagining you

85
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,833
swinging a stick around
violently like that.

86
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,750
I think I'm better
at it than most.

87
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:27,125
[YUKI] Cool, so, what
time is our transfer?

88
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,875
We'll have to wait a while.

89
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,625
[YUKI] Oh. In that case,
who wants a snack?

90
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,000
[MIO]
Uh? Already?

91
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,083
[TAKUYA] I can't believe
he followed us here!

92
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,333
Wait, explain who's
following who?

93
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,375
That dude's constantly
trailing Kanna.

94
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,458
Sounds like he's one of
those creepy stalker guys.

95
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,125
[YUKI] I mean, should one of us
call the cops or something?

96
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,458
Or at least tell
the station chief?

97
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,291
No, wait. I've got an idea.

98
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:04,333
[HOJO whistles] That's a nice
package you've got there.

99
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,708
[TAKUYA]
I'm a grower, not a shower.

100
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,916
Aren't you interested in
knowing where Kodai Arima is?

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,625
Why, do you know?

102
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,583
[HOJO] Not me. Kanna's the
one with all the answers.

103
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,041
Know what I'd do?

104
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,250
If I were you, I'd steal her
pendant, and then I'd say,

105
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,791
"if you ever want
to see this again,

106
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:26,291
you'd better tell me
where Kodai Arima is."

107
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,208
[TAKUYA] That's a terrible
idea, man, ciao.

108
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,583
Hey! Hold on!

109
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:34,750
Damn, can't stop!
Come on! Seriously?

110
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,875
[HOJO grunts]
Okay, where did you go, huh?

111
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:46,833
[gasping]

112
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,375
[HOJO]
A watermelon?

113
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,208
Bye-bye!

114
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,000
[HOJO]
You brats tricked me!

115
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,750
That train runs nonstop
to the end of the line.

116
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,333
Don't ever come back, dude.

117
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,083
My watermelon.
Bye, little friend,

118
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,833
it was fun while it lasted.

119
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,708
Don't let it get
you down, buddy.

120
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,416
We'll buy you one
when we get there.

121
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,208
And Kanna, you can use
this since yours is gone.

122
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,333
[gasps]

123
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,125
I appreciate it. Thank you.

124
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,166
[MIO grunts]

125
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,916
--[TAKUYA] Wow!
--[YUKI] Whoa! This is huge!

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,833
Just so everyone's clear here.

127
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,916
There's not a shotgun-wielding
mayor inside, is there?

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,416
That's weird.

129
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,166
You wanna tell me how it is that
you know my dad has a gun?

130
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,500
It's just a hunch, you know?

131
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,208
I can totally imagine him
as that kind of dad.

132
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,166
Threatening any guy who
comes near his daughter.

133
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,458
Well, don't worry.

134
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,583
Dad's pretty busy with
the city council today.

135
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,000
So! Welcome, everyone!

136
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,458
[TAKUYA, YUKI]
Thank you!

137
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,916
[KANNA]
Thank you for having us.

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,166
I think I'll head upstairs
to get changed now.

139
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,791
You boys go ahead
and find a place

140
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,916
to change into your
swimsuits, okay?

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,625
[YUKI]
Roger that!

142
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,791
Well, you heard the lady,
let's get changed!

143
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:47,958
Yeah.

144
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,333
[YUKI gasps, yelps]
Don't look!

145
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,625
Are you really
screaming right now?

146
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,541
[KANNA] Don't worry about me.
I'm not easily phased.

147
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,416
So, you're planning to stay
down here while we change?

148
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,708
[KANNA]
I'll go upstairs.

149
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,208
That seems like
the wisest option.

150
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,625
I don't wanna be
mean or anything

151
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,208
but Hatano's a weird girl.

152
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,541
Fair.

153
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,416
[TAKUYA]
Hojo's out there somewhere.

154
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,916
Maybe, just in case...

155
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,250
[TAKUYA]
Whoa! A private beach!

156
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,791
[YUKI]
This is amazing!

157
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,125
[MIO]
Calm down, you guys.

158
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,041
You act like you've never
seen a beach before.

159
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,291
[TAKUYA]
Oh-ho!

160
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,291
She wears a bikini really well.

161
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,291
He's right! You do!

162
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,000
[KANNA]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

163
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,416
[TAKUYA, YUKI]
Uhh...

164
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,541
What were you expecting
her to wear?

165
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,458
[clears throat] Never mind.

166
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,708
Come on, let's get
this party started!

167
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,208
[TAKUYA, YUKI]
Yeah!

168
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,000
What are you making
over there, Arima?

169
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:29,083
Heh, heh. Hot mermaid!
And now, she's finished!

170
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:33,583
Ahh! No! Why?

171
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:38,208
I'm sorry your mermaid
got washed away.

172
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,416
Tell me something, Kanna.
You have an older sister?

173
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,541
No. I've always been on my own.

174
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,041
On your own?
What about your family?

175
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,458
I'm alone. I don't
have a family,

176
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,291
but I used to live with my mom.

177
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,166
Oh. I understand.

178
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,000
[YUKI]
Hey, Boss!

179
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,333
I told you! It's no good!

180
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,625
They don't sell whole
watermelons here!

181
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,875
Weird for watermelon season!

182
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,750
Well, they sell it all cut up.

183
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,875
And now Shimazu won't
get to experience

184
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,583
her first watermelon-splitting!

185
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,833
Thanks, but it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

186
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,000
[gasps]

187
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,458
[YUKI laughs]

188
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,875
[TAKUYA]
Pardon me, Madame.

189
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,125
Uh?

190
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,625
Would you care for
any assistance?

191
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,375
No, thank you. I don't
think I can trust you

192
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,500
to slather me without
taking peeks.

193
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,875
I'll slather you
however you like.

194
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,250
Would you stop it with
the creepy hand thing?

195
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,958
Right. Fair.

196
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,791
Seriously, though.
I'm still kind of amazed.

197
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,916
I can't believe your dad
let us have the villa.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,458
Well, if he finds out about it,

199
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,416
that gun will make
an appearance.

200
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,416
He doesn't know?
Please, don't tell me that.

201
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,666
I said that I was staying
with my girlfriends.

202
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,166
Uh! I mean, you didn't
have to lie just for me.

203
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,541
[gasps] I didn't do it for
your sake, you narcissist!

204
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,041
Oh, that's right!

205
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:03,625
I need to take some photos
so I have proof. Hey, Hatano!

206
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,875
That's weird.

207
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,958
Where the heck is she?

208
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,000
What's goin' on, are you
guys not getting in?

209
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,833
It's so perfect out there!

210
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,708
We don't know where Kanna is.

211
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,750
Huh?

212
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,291
[TAKUYA]
Kanna!

213
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:22,291
[YUKI] Hatano? I wonder
where she could be...

214
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,833
We should split up
and look. Hey!

215
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,125
Are you in here?

216
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,750
Hatano, you here?

217
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,750
[TAKUYA]
Kanna! Where did you--

218
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,041
I'm sorry, is there
something wrong?

219
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,166
--[MIO] What?
--A watermelon.

220
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,041
Where did you get that?

221
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,083
[KANNA] Turns out there's a
watermelon field just down

222
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,375
the road and the farmer
said I could have one.

223
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,375
[gasps] Thank you, Hatano!

224
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,166
[TAKUYA] Okay! I think
it's time to get started!

225
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,458
Let's make Shimazu's
first time good!

226
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,083
Right, here I go!

227
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,875
Uh? Wait, is it normal
to start this far away?

228
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,458
[TAKUYA]
Don't forget the blindfold!

229
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,625
What? Are you serious? No way!

230
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,750
And now you get to spin around!

231
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:13,666
[MIO gasping]

232
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,291
Go get 'em Shimazu!

233
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,666
But how? I don't know
which way to go!

234
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,375
You wanna go a little
more to the left!

235
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,291
[TAKUYA] You need to go right,
you're too far to the left!

236
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,875
--Not that left!
--No, seriously, the right!

237
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,916
Am I on the right track
yet or am I really off?

238
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,625
[TAKUYA]
Veer right! Trust me!

239
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,708
[YUKI]
Keep going just like that, okay?

240
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,958
You've got this! Just keep
truckin'! Don't give up!

241
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,541
You're doing so great, Shimazu!

242
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,250
Ahh!

243
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,666
[YUKI]
Ohh...

244
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,250
Huh? Uh? Why was I even
listening to you guys?

245
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,875
The watermelon
is way over there!

246
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,083
[TAKUYA]
Sorry! I mean,

247
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,208
that's kinda how it
goes your first time!

248
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,208
Yeah? Well, then, I think you
should be up next, Arima!

249
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,458
I used to be on the
kendo team, you know.

250
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,541
So just don't go blaming me
if the melon gets pulverized.

251
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,333
Well, in that case, we
should let you go last!

252
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,291
Hatano! Would you
like to go next?

253
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,708
Sure. I'm ready.

254
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,833
First, I'll put on
the blindfold.

255
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,750
Spin.

256
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,083
Here I go.

257
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,083
Right! You wanna go a little
more to the right, Kanna!

258
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,541
[BOTH shouting]

259
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,791
[YUKI]
U-Uh...

260
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,416
--[YUKI] Huh?
--[TAKUYA] Uh?

[ALL gasping]

262
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,875
That was really delicious.

263
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:45,250
Yeah. So, uh...
I just wanted to say...

264
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,750
Thank you for the melon.

265
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,083
[YUKI, TAKUYA laughing]

266
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,333
[KANNA]
It was nothing.

267
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,791
[TAKUYA]
Wait up, Yuki!

268
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,708
[YUKI]
No way, you gotta catch me!

269
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:58,083
[MIO] Hey, wouldn't you like to
go feel the water for yourself?

270
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,583
[KANNA]
But I...

271
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,125
You could just stay in the
shallow part if you can't swim.

272
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,791
[KANNA] It's just that...
I didn't bring a suit.

273
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,250
That's no problem!

274
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,125
I have an old one I always
keep here. You can use that!

275
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,333
[TAKUYA]
...you can't catch me, big baby!

276
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,083

Is something wrong guys?

281

[BOYS]
You look great! Really!

282
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,875
You could lose your pendant
if you wear it in the water,

283
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,916
so you may want to consider
leaving it here.

284
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,875
Sure.

285
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,458
It's cold.

You don't have to
go in, you know.

I want to.
It feels really good.

so we can do them after dinner!

Where's my pendant?

I know I left it right there,
and without it I...

[YUKI]
What the...?!

Check it out, all the meat
for the barbecue is gone!

Down to the last hot dog!

I have no idea.

Think the mayor's after us
with a shotgun after all?

No, are you kidding me?

If that was my dad, you and
Yuki would be dead by now.

What the hell happened here?

314
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:13,791
The device is gone. I wonder
if this could be Hojo.

[TAKUYA]
What's down there?

317
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,791
It's the basement.

318
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,583
Yuki, come with me.

319
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,500
[YUKI]
Sure!

320
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,958
[TAKUYA]
Mio, look after Kanna.

321
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,000
Got it.

322
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:31,291
Look, don't worry about a thing,
okay? We're all here for you!

323
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,458
[TAKUYA]
Uh...

324
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,291
Seriously?
A dog did all of this?

325
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,291
[BOTH scream]

326
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,083
[TAKUYA]
We can't let him get away!

[MIO, KANNA scream]

[TAKUYA]
Are you two okay?

329
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,666
We're fine,
but whose dog is that?

330
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,208
He's wild. Just stay back.

331
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,250
[ALL gasp]

332
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,041
[TAKUYA]
Watch out!

333
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:39,500
[YUKI grumbles] I was looking
forward to that barbecue.

334
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,250
It's a bummer that we lost
all our fireworks, too.

335
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,541
So, do we have
nothing for dinner?

336
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,500
[MIO] I think I've got some
instant ramen in there.

337
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,958
All our perfect summer
beach plans...

[TAKUYA grunts]

339
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,083
Nah, I don't think I will.

340
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,458
[MIO]
What're you talking about?

341
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:05,000
Uh. We only get one shot
at youth. Know what I mean?

342
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,583
What?

343
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,958
This summer will
never come again.

344
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,500
It'll only happen once,
and that's why it's special.

00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,291
[door creaks]

346
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,291
Uh? You got some sun, huh?

347
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,541
Yeah, and the water stung a
little bit. Not bad, though.

348
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,125
You should put some
after-sun lotion on it.

349
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,416
Have a seat. I'll help you out.

350
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,750
[MIO]
That was a pretty full day,

351
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,541
but it was fun, don't you think?

352
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,291
Mm? Did you not have fun?

353
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,041
It's just that this was
my first time doing this.

354
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,958
Hanging out with
friends, I mean.

355
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:53,666
Yeah, I think it was fun.

356
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,916
How about we all come back here
and do this again next summer?

357

[YUKI, TAKUYA grunting]

Yuki, stop! Stop pushing!
You're gonna make us fall!

Oh no. Is that
another wild dog?

[BOTH barking, howling]

365
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:32,333
[MIO] Hey, Hatano. What do you
think of Arima? Do you like him?

366
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,458
[KANNA] I've noticed
that when he's around

367
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,666
my heart beats faster.

368
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,166
[MIO]
Wow. It's funny you say that,

369
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,083
because mine does
the same thing.

370
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,083
[KANNA]
I guess, we're the same, then.

371
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,500
[MIO]
We are.

372

Oh, there it is.

374
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,833
I thought I lost my yummy hot
dog earlier but it looks like

375
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,791
I just found it.
Time for dinner!

376

00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,750
[YUKI] Well, you two. Shimazu
and I are going this way.

379
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,583
See you around, Arima!
Goodbye, Kanna.

380
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,125
[KANNA]
Bye, see you soon.

381
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,250
[TAKUYA]
Later!

382
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,541
That really surprised me.

383
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:43,250
It was a lot of fun. Thanks
again for inviting me along.

384
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,666
Aw, stop, it was my pleasure!

385
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,250
So, anyway, you want
me to walk you home?

386
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,791
No. Thanks,
I'll be fine on my own.

387
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,333
Bye, then.

388
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,500

See ya.
