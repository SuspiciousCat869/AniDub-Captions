Yeah, I actually

I've heard that stuff before.

You say that to all
the girls, don't you?

36
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,775
I'm interested in Mount Sankaku.

37

Doing some research.

38
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:52,192
Naturally, I decided
to come to you first.

39
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:55,942
Oh. Now, that makes more sense.

Here, this'll have
everything you want to know.

00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:02,817
Okay, this book looks
older than both of us.

42
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,983
Do you remember,
what Kanna said before

43
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,483
about the diorama we're making?

44
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,817
When I heard that, I decided
it was time to look into

45
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,775
the history of
Sakaimachi's geology.

'Course you did. I'd expect
nothing less from a history nut.

But I haven't said
anything yet.

50
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:26,233
Right and that's fine
because I already know

51
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:27,608
what you were gonna say.

52
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:29,608
Give it a guess, then,
if you're so sure.

"In the chaos during and
immediately after the war

66

[MIO]
Yes.

68
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,025
The plan was scrapped but
one rock was destroyed.

69
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,900
That's why it's
called Futago Rock,

70
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:21,442
which actually
means "Twin Rock."

71
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:27,108
[TAKUYA] Looks like this
photo was taken in 1945.

This is definitely it!

back on all the sci-fi novels.

I saw that weird stalker guy
on the way over here.

You talking about Hojo?

He's in the back alleys
of Central Street.

That means he must be up
to something naughty again!

think about this?

What is it?
The geology of Sakaimachi?

95
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,775
[YUKI]
Huh... How weird.

96
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:37,900
Doesn't it almost look like a
bomb went off or something?

97
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:41,233
Yeah, it does. I wonder...

98
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,733
Is it possible Sakaimachi
could've been made

99
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:46,692
when two different
things collided?

100
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:48,442
Collided?

101
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,400
Interesting.
Doctor Arima's research

102
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:53,275
actually said something similar.

103
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:55,650
In his 400 Year Cycle Theory,

104
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,025
he proposes that once
every 400 years,

105
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,900
different dimensions
approach each other.

106
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:03,150
So, yeah, maybe
it was a collision

107
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,400
instead of a gentle approach.

108
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:08,275
Dr. Imagawa mentioned
the exact same thing.

109
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,567
Called it an "event collision,"

110
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,275
where two different
dimensions collided.

111
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:16,733
An event collision, huh?

112
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:21,025
That would also explain
Mount Sankaku's unique geology.

113
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,275
How did that work?

114
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,400
I mean, just
practically speaking?

115
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:27,192
Did one dimension fall
right outta the sky?

to do with this.

That might be kinda rare,
but it's not weird.

What's weird is the number

Don't call me that, it's rude.

You should learn
some manners, boy.

Look, we both want to know where
Doctor Arima is, don't we?

C'mon I'm not askin'
you for very much.

What I need you to do is take
this and leave it somewhere

in Kanna's room. That's it!

You want me to bug her room?

Hatano is refusing to talk,

very uncooperative, as well.

[ERIKO] I know I told you
she'd done this before,

but when I looked into
all those transfers,

Uh?

00:20:57,775 --> 00:21:00,900
There's a clear pattern.
She's only been transferring

407
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:03,483
to certain schools
around Sakaimachi.

[TAKUYA]
Huh?

Essentially, she's stayed
within a pretty tight circle.

Always on Sakaimachi's doorstep.

She never strayed
from that pattern.

Why was she doing it, though?
I don't understand it.

[ERIKO] We can assume
there's some reason

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,942
she needs to stay
near Mt. Sankaku,

415
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:23,192
and that it's most likely
related to whatever reason

00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:26,025
she had to keep
transferring schools.
