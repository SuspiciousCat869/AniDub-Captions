1
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:13,400
No!

2
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:15,317
Let me go!

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,275
Help me, Papa!

4
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:19,983
Yu-no! Yu-no!

5
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:36,067
Where the hell am I?

6
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,900
[PRISONER A]
Welcome to the quarry.

7
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,192
Although, in our case,

8
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:42,150
it's more accurate to
call it "the prison."

9
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:48,483
Why is the device from
Mount Sankaku here?

10
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,150
[BAZUKU chuckles]

11
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:51,567
Oh, happy day!

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,108
Is that a lively new batch
of prisoners I see?

13
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,067
Hey. You in charge here?

14
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,483
What did you do with Yu-No?

15
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,858
Shut up, you--

16
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:01,358
Heh...

17
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:05,317
[TAKUYA groans]

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,733
I'm the warden of this
prison and your new hell.

19
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,358
You can call me Bazuku.

20
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:12,400
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance.

21
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:19,358
[BAZUKU]
Aw, it really suits you.

22
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:21,692
What that pretty little
necklace means is that you

23
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:24,233
now belong to me, and me alone.

24
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,192
Starting today, you're
prisoner number 10-98.

25
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:28,983
My name is Takuya Arima!

26
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:31,025
I'm not a number! Don't y--

27
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:34,525
[groaning]

28
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:35,775
[exhales]

29
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:11,317
[GUARD A] We've captured
the priestess's heir.

30
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,025
Let go! Let me out of here!

31
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:16,942
Where is Papa?!
I want to see him!

32
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:19,275
[ADVISOR] You're addressing
the Divine Emperor,

33
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,150
so calm yourself.

34
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,775
[EMPEROR]
Release the girl.

35
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:25,442
[GUARD A]
Uh! But, but, sir...

36
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:27,858
[YU-NO]
Huh...?

37
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,733
[EMPEROR]
There's nothing to be afraid of.

38
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:44,983
[banging]

39
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:48,150
On your feet!

40
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,733
[KURTZ]
Hey, you okay?

41
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,067
You passed right out yesterday

42
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,650
and then they tossed
you in here.

43
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,358
I kinda thought
you'd never wake up.

44
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,067
[TAKUYA]
Where are we?

45
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,525
[KURTZ] Oh, these are
our sleeping quarters.

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,067
What's up, something wrong?

47
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,983
I'm fine.

48
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,067
[DEO]
Guys, aren't you coming?

49
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,817
Most important meal of the day!

50
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:23,692
[TAKUYA]
This is all we get?

51
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:25,442
That meat's actually good!

52
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:28,192
It's the one thing we have
to look forward to here.

53
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:30,942
Oh. By the way,
my name is Kurtz.

54
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:32,817
I'm Takuya Arima.

55
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,067
Takuya Arima?

56
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,108
That's kind of a weird name!

57
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:39,983
Hey, I'm Deo. So, be
straight, is it true

58
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,733
that you're the criminal
who defiled the priestess?

59
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:44,400
[TAKUYA]
Uh...

60
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,650
I... I guess.

61
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,150
So? Don't hold out.
Was it good?

62
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:50,275
Was what good?

63
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:52,567
Come on, don't play dumb!

64
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,525
The priestess's body,
was she hot?

65
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:58,025
Watch it, or I'll
hafta kick your ass.

66
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:01,483
Calm down, guy.
I was only joking.

67
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:06,358
What's your story?
How'd you end up in here?

68
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:07,483
Who, me?

69
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,442
Well, we can discuss
that another time.

70
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:12,942
So, I guess, for now, just
know that I've been here

71
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:15,233
a whole lot longer
than you've been here.

72
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:19,817
Yep. I'm Joe and I've been
here even longer than he has.

73
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,608
I'll take this.

74
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:24,858
[TAKUYA] Hey! The hell
are you doin', man?

75
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,567
[groans]

76
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,358
You see, one of the
rules around here

77
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:30,900
is that the new guy has
to hand over his food.

78
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,692
--[KURTZ] Uh.
--[JOE] Hm?

79
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,358
[DEO hums]

80
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:40,108
S'what I thought. It's survival
of the fittest in here. Heh.

81
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,900
[KURTZ] Um, You okay?
You seem out of it.

82
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,567
I'm fine. That jerk just
caught me off guard.

83
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,275
Next time, I'll kick his ass.

84
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:08,400
[DEO]
That's very good to know.

85
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:09,650
But here's the thing:

86
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:12,400
strength alone won't be
enough to survive here.

87
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:14,942
All the ones who
succeed use this.

88
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,692
The quarry doesn't have walls.

89
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:18,192
And, I mean, come on,
look around,

90
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:21,358
there are hardly any
guards anywhere.

91
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,442
It looks like you could escape

92
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,692
without using much
brainpower at all.

93
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,817
Oh, okay, now I understand.

94
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,275
In that case, I should probably
start by giving you a heads-up.

95
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,067
[PRISON GUARD A]
Hey, You! New guy!

96
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,775
Why aren't you working?

97
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:36,608
[PRISONER E whimpers]
Please, no!

98
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:39,192
--[PRISON GUARD A] Stop!
--[PRISONER E screams]

99
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:42,608
See what I mean?
It's easy to get out of here.

100
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:46,192
[gasps]

101
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:00,317
Just like Mount Sankaku!

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,150
Now that you've seen
the Tower of Garzel,

103
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:05,608
you don't need an explanation.

104
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,983
I wouldn't get any
ideas if I were you.

105
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,067
What exactly are we digging up?

106
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,817
Is it psychite?

107
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,775
Did you say psychite?
I've never heard of that.

108
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,442
No, that's not what this is.

109
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,192
What we mine has
a different name.

110
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:26,775
They're called holy stones.

111
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:28,692
Wait, did you just
say "we mine"?

112
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:30,525
Because from what I've seen,
you haven't done

113
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,067
a single bit of work.

114
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,025
Oh, right, well, that's because
Bazuku appointed me foreman.

115
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:36,108
That's why.

116
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:39,067
[TAKUYA]
Hm? Foreman, huh? Interesting.

117
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,400
You're starting at the bottom,

118
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:43,108
so get ready to work hard
if you want to move up.

119
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:45,858
And would you mind telling
me where I go from there?

120
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:47,942
What task a prisoner's
assigned depends on

121
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,817
how long they've been in here.

122
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,400
New inmates are always ordered
to dig up the holy stones.

123
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:56,733
Next, you'll be assigned
crystallizing them.

124
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:59,942
And as for the final step
in the process...

125
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,650
[gasps]

126
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:16,775
The coffins of the priestess,
used in the ritual.

127
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:18,442
And look! Through here is where

128
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:21,358
all the major crystallization
work is done.

129
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:28,150
[TAKUYA gasps]

130
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,358
[TAKUYA] I knew it. It looks
almost exactly the same.

131
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,900
[PRISONERS chattering, laughing]

132
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:47,942

Huh?

133
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,067
[PRISONER B]
Where'd he come from?

134
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,858
[PRISONER D]
Grab it!

135
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:52,483
Uh. What's that?

136
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:56,483
No big deal. Just a nogard.
Wandered into camp.

137
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:57,983
A nogard?

138

[PRISONER B]
I say we take our time with it!

139
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:03,108
I know that voice.

ust what do you think
you're doing?

144
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:14,483
Are you trying
to steal from us?

145
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:15,733
Steal from you?

146
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:19,233
We found him ourselves,
so we get to eat him!

147
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:20,358
You wanna eat him?

[chirps]

149
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:24,567
He has a name,
and it's Kunkun!

150
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,025
He was a pet and a friend to me!

151

[PRISONERS]
Huh?

152
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,233
That thing's your pet?

Wait, did I hear that right?

154
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,400
Did he just say a nogard we
use for livestock was his pet?

Livestock? What?

157
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,567
No way, you really don't know?

158
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,400
Hate to tell ya, but the
meat you chow down on

159
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:43,233
every day here happens
to be nogard.

Hey, it's my new favorite kid!

161
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,817
You haven't already
forgotten the newbie rule

162
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,692
I taught you about, have you?

163
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:54,692
Heh. Oh, sure, 'course I
remember. Right, Kunkun?

164
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:55,942
[chirps]

165
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:57,358
So, get out of here!

166
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,900
[PRISONER C]
Are you freaking kidding me?

167
00:09:58,983 --> 00:10:00,483
[PRISONER D]
Man!

168
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,650
[PRISONERS murmur]

169
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,150
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

170
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,317
[KURTZ]
Guys, please, calm down!

171
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,525
I mean, think about it,

172
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,233
if the guards catch
you eating a nogard--

173
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,358
Shut up! Here's a thought:
maybe I should just

174
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,650
roast and eat you instead,
how's that sound?

175
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:13,983
Uh!

176
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,775
[TAKUYA]
Get the hell away from him!

177
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:16,817
[gasps]

178
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,525
[groaning]

179
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:23,067
Wow. Thank you for doing that!

180
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,192
[BAZUKU] So much noise out here!
What's all the fuss about?

181
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:29,942
He was trying to eat a nogard
that he and the others found.

182
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:31,817
I told him not to.

183
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,692
And I saw it all!

184
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:36,650
Really? Well, that's very
disappointing to hear!

185
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:41,442
I'm afraid that means he'll
need to be harshly punished.

186
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:44,525
[gasps] No! No, please don't!

187
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:46,525
I beg you!

188
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:52,567
[JOE screams]

189
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:56,442
What's he doing to him in there?

190
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:59,525
Well, Warden Bazuku has
very specific tastes.

191
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,525
No matter whether it's
a man or a woman

192
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:06,067
he gets off on inflicting
pain on them.

193
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,275
Trust me, you'll wanna be sure

194
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:09,567
he doesn't take
an interest in you.

195
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,067
[KURTZ] Holy crap, you
were so cool back there!

196
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,442
This is weird, but can
I call you "boss"?

197
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:19,817
I guess. You wouldn't
be the first person.

198
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,650
See, that doesn't
surprise me at all!

199
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:24,317
You mean people back where you
came from called you that?

200
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,775
Yeah. I suppose.

201
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,692
But I never thought
I'd hear it again.

202
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:32,775
At least not here, anyway.

203
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,650
Would you rather I didn't?

204
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,942
Uh. No, I...

205
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:38,442
[sighs]

206
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:39,775
Yeah, Of course you can.

207
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:40,692
[gasps]

208
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,150
Okay then, I will.

209
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,942
Thank you, Boss!

210
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:47,067
D'you mind if I ask why you
ended up in this place?

211
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,733
Well, Boss, I, um...

212
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:50,817
I don't...

213
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,233
It's just that...
Actually, I'm--

214
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,650
[DEO]
Quiet, Kurtz.

215
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:59,025
There's no person in here who
doesn't have a dark past.

216
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:02,942
That's why it's best not to ask
each other too many questions.

217
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:05,400
Well, uh, it's getting late.

218
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:07,275
Goodnight, Boss!

219
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:17,150
[clock ticking]

220
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:21,817
[KODAI] Takuya, how is life
in Dela Granto treating you?

221
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,150
I bet it must be
pretty painful for you,

222
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:27,108
considering your
easy life before.

223
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:31,067
Dela Granto and
Sakaimachi are linked.

224
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,650
They make contact with each
other about every 400 years.

225
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,983
And once, they even managed
to collide physically.

226
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,317
I imagine you're in a place
right now that proves this.

227
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,567
Which also means it should be
pretty obvious how to escape.

228
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,525
All you have to do
is take a closer look.

229
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,442

[PRISON GUARD A]
Wake up!

232
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,650
[PRISONERS yawn]

233
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:07,567
[TAKUYA]
The Tower of Garzel.

234
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,275
The ruins at Mount Sankaku
were actually this quarry.

235
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,108
Which means...

236
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:31,358
[TAKUYA]
There's no doubt in my mind.

237
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:34,900
These holy stones are
definitely psychite.

238
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:36,317
[BAZUKU]
Well, hello, there.

239
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,233
Just what do you
think you're doing?

240
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,608
Nothing, just admiring.

241
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:43,900
Now, prisoner 10-98, surely
you wouldn't be planning

242
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:47,775
on stealing any of
the holy stones?

243
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:51,275
Of course not! I would never.

244
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,692
[TAKUYA] Hey! I told you,
I didn't take anything!

245
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:57,692
Look at me, it's obvious!

246
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:01,567
Yes, I can see that you haven't
hidden anything in plain sight.

247
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,858
Thing is... There are
so many fun little

248
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,650
nooks and crannies
in the body where

249
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:10,317
a small stone could
easily be hidden away.

250
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,942
And I assure you, I'll be
checking every one of them.

251
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,983
Hold on. What're you doing!

252

Damn Bazuku! I hate him so much!

255

[KURTZ]
I'm so glad you're okay, Boss!

256
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:32,317
Although, I guess I don't really
know what he did to you, so...

257
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,900
Did the warden introduce
you to any fun new games?

258
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:37,233
Are you serious right now?

259
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,442
[TAKUYA]
Damn it, this is ridiculous.

260
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,192
I've gotta get out of here.

261
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:45,108
No way, don't even try it!

262
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:47,942
The Tower of Garzel
will fry you right up!

263
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:51,067
Trust me, there's gotta be a
way out without getting fried.

264
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,692
Huh?!

265
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:56,275

Here we go.

[KURTZ]
Hey! Boss, wait up!

267
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,900
Do you even know how many
tunnels are down here?

268
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,567
[TAKUYA]
It's a dead end.

269
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,733
[KURTZ]
So much for that plan, I guess.

270
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:12,858
If we escape via the well, the
Tower of Garzel won't attack us.

271
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:14,442
Huh?

272
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:18,650
I don't care how long it takes.
I'll find us a way out of here.

sure to let me know, right?

Well, I wouldn't get my

No chance of that.

00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:46,233
[chuckles]

319
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:48,400
That's exactly the kind
of spunk I like to see

320
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:51,233
from a resistance
leader, Amanda!

321
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:53,108
Amanda?

322
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:55,442
[BAZUKU] That'll be all
for today, I think.

323
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:58,567
Heh. Yes. Quite.

324
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,942
[TAKUYA]
Hey.

325
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,692
Did I hear the warden
say "Amanda"?

326
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:17,233
That's right. I guess I'm
kinda famous now, aren't I?

327
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:21,233
Ailia told me that she had
a sister. Her opposite!

328
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:22,858
You know my sister?

329
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:25,692
Do you know where she is
or what she's doing?

330
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:29,900
Is she still a huge
pain in the ass?

331
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:34,150
Ailia died as a true knight,
doing her sworn duty.

332
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,983
Fighting monsters at the border.

333
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:41,025
Oh, I see.

334
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:44,567
Yes, that definitely
sounds just like her.

335
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,817
I don't hear that woman
screamin' anymore.

336
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,400
Think she might be dead?

337
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,608
[PRISONER D] Bazuku would
never get rid of her that fast!

338
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,650
You know he'll take his
sweet time on that one.

339
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:54,900
[PRISONER B]
You got that right.

340
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:56,608
Just heard from a guard.

341
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:59,692
Takuya was actually put into
the cell right next to hers.

342
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:01,192
Huh? Then...

343
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:03,692
They're probably talking now.

344
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,942
Oh, Ailia. She was
always a believer

345
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:09,317
in the ritual to
save Dela Granto.

346
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,733
I was put in here for the crime

347
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:13,692
of defiling a priestess,
did you know that?

348
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:16,650
Heh! Nope, but it's
good to know!

349
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:19,275
The existence of the
priestess, and the ritual.

350
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:21,525
All of that's just
a pack of lies.

351
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:24,025
Wait, what do you mean?

352
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:25,150
[AMANDA]
The Divine Emperor

353
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,275
kills the priestess
in cold blood.

354
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:30,192
Then claims it's
a 400-year ritual.

355
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:32,317
That alone is enough to
make the people worship

356
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,942
and fear the Divine Emperor.

357
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,108
After all, what
easier way to rule?

358
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:38,317
You're saying the whole
thing is a lie?

359
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,942
So, Sayless's death,
that was just because

360
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:43,775
this Divine Emperor guy
wanted some power?

361
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,483
That's the gist of it.

362
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:49,442
The resistance is trying to
overthrow the Divine Emperor.

363
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:52,025
It feels like we're
so close now.

364
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:56,900
Preparations have been made.
I just have to give the order.

365
00:20:56,983 --> 00:21:00,358
Takuya, would you consider
joining the fight?

366
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:01,900
That sounds like a plan.

367
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:05,067
Considering I was on my way
to punch the guy in the face,

368
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,150
how could I refuse?

369
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,775
My allies are here now.

370
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,567
They've infiltrated this
place to help me escape.

371
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,858
You should meet up with them.

372
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,733
Do this to show you're an ally.

373
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:19,483
Cool, got it.

374
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:22,192
I'm gonna make sure
you get out of here.

375
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,775
[TAKUYA]
Hey!

376
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:33,525
Uh!

377
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:34,525
Hey, Boss!

378
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,275
Guess you're okay, then!

379
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:37,150
And our leader?

380
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:38,858
--Really...?
--[gasps]

381
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:41,692
[TAKUYA] It's okay.
I figured it was you.

382
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:44,608
Amanda was great,
she told me everything.

383
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:47,192
So, come on,
let's get out of here!

384
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:48,942
[BOTH gasp]

385
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,108
[KURTZ, DEO]
Right!

386
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,942
[MACHINE A]
Check.

387
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:09,275
Initiating re-education program.

388
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:47,983
