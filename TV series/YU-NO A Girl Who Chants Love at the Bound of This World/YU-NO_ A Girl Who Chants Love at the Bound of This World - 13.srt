1
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,750
[TAKUYA]
Mitsuki...

2
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,041
Well, as soon as she wakes up
we can ask her what happened.

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,208
Don't we need to take her
to a hospital or something?

4
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,375
[ERIKO]
Nah, I've cleaned her up.

5
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,875
Her life's in no danger.

6
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,708
[TAKUYA] Mm? Wait a minute.
Where're you going?

7
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,041
[ERIKO]
The storehouse.

8
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,333
Gotta get rid of the body.

9
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,083
Hey, uh, about Ryuzoji.

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,500
Why're you investigating him?

11
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,375
Don't worry about that;
I'll tell you later.

12
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:51,791
You'll need to learn the truth
at some point, anyway.

13
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,708
Please take care of Ichijo.

14
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,666
Be careful, though,
the Niarb is still in effect.

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,041
I got it. Thanks.

16
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:08,666
Why does this one feel different
from the other parallel worlds?

17
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,416
[MITSUKI groaning]

18
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,000
[TAKUYA]
You awake?

19
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,333
Huh?

20
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,500
Well, it's about time,
Sleeping Beauty.

21
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,916
I was about to see
if a kiss might work.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,708
You know, like a prince
from a fairy tale.

23
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,708
[MITSUKI]
Where am I?

24
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,666
Bed, with me.

25
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,458
In my head, anyway.

26
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,083
In reality,
it's the nurse's office.

27
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,208
But what happened to me?

28
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,333
You got into a bad accident
in Ryuzoji's car.

29
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,833
Accident? No, this is dangerous!

30
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,458
[groaning]

31
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,166
You hit your head,
you should take it easy.

32
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,333
I bet there are painkillers
in the First Aid box.

33
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,958
[TAKUYA] Great, lots of
bandages, very helpful.

34
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,666
[TAKUYA]
Uh. The power's out?

35
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,833
Crap...

36
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,416
[rustling]

37
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:41,916
[MITSUKI yells]

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,416
[TAKUYA groans]

39
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,291
[laughing]

40
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,291
You're gonna die. Get ready!

41
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,458
[gasps]

42
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,958
Well done, Ichijo.

43
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,625
Thank you, I'm so glad
you're pleased.

44
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,916
No! Ryuzoji!

45
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,291
[RYUZOJI] It's useless.
Don't bother resisting.

46
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,250
At least I don't have
to use mind control

47
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,500
to get someone to agree with me.

48
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,625
[RYUZOJI] Hm... You know you and
your friend should be far more

49
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:26,333
careful when meddling in affairs
that are quite beyond you.

50
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,708
[TAKUYA]
Eriko?

51
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,083
[RYUZOJI]
Don't be alarmed.

52
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,541
She and I are actually
old acquaintances.

53
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:36,375
I mistakenly thought I was safe
after Abel's death, but then,

54
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,458
I didn't expect her to come
after me the way she did.

55
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,333
Who's Abel?

56
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:45,958
I should've kept my mouth shut.
Go ahead, show it to him.

57
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,333
Yes sir, as you wish.

58
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,958
[TAKUYA]
Wait. Is that...?

59
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,791
[RYUZOJI]
Yes, it is.

60
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,875
It seems clear that you
know what this jewel is.

61
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:03,208
Which means... Kodai must have
given you the Reflector Device,

62
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,791
just as I thought in
the very beginning.

63
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,000
I've wanted it for
myself for so long.

64
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,291
[TAKUYA growls]

65
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,833
[RYUZOJI]
It's wasted on you.

66
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:15,208
You, who still know nothing
of its actual power.

67
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,625
Don't you think that at
the very least, it should be

68
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,833
in the possession of someone
who knows its true worth?

69
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:24,250
So, tell me. Where is
the Reflector Device?

70
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,583
Heh. Actually, it's a whole
lot closer than you think!

71
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,750
[BOTH gasp]

72
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,041
You're gonna die. Get ready!

73
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,208
[TAKUYA grunts]

74
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,500
[TAKUYA]
Stop it!

75
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,291
[MITSUKI grunts]

76
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,041
Mitsuki, you gotta
wake up! Please try!

77
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,666
[MITSUKI gasping]
Takuya.

78
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,166
You're so good to me.

79
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,208
Are you back? That you?

80
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,375
[MITSUKI chuckles]

81
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,208
[MITSUKI grunting]

82
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,125
Quit it! Seriously!

83
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,833
[MITSUKI laughs]
Takuya. Time to say goodbye!

84
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,083
[MITSUKI yells]

85
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,041
[MITSUKI groans]

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,166
Hey, didn't know
you could fight.

87
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,583
I heard some noise, so I figured
I should come and check on you.

88
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,541
Didn't I tell you to be careful?

89
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,125
Yeah, and I did what you said!

90
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,375
Why else do you think I'm
here from a parallel world?

91
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,083
Interesting. Well, it looks

92
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,750
like this route might've
been the right one, then.

93
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,875
Listen, can't you just tell
me what's been going on?

94
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,416
What is it that Ryuzoji's
been planning?

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,041
Why did he do this to Mitsuki?

96
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,791
Let's head to his mansion.
I'll tell you more there.

97
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,458
[TAKUYA]
Hold on.

98
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,750
Is it cool to move the body
before the cops come?

99
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,875
Look, I get it,
but there's no time.

100
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:22,916
[TAKUYA]
Uh.

101
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,458
[ERIKO]
Here we go.

102
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,541
Okay, so what's up
with this wall?

103
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,250
I can tell the coloration
is different.

104
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,958
You're right. So, knock it down.

105
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,708
Uh. Why me?

106
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,208
Just do it. We're in a hurry.

107
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,208
First it's trespassing,
then I move a corpse...

108
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:44,458
Might as well finish the day
with some property damage.

109
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,166
[TAKUYA grunting]

110
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,833
[TAKUYA gasps]

111
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,666
[TAKUYA]
What the hell?

112
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,958
[ERIKO] Look closely.
Do you notice anything?

113
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:07,208
[TAKUYA] I can't really figure
out what I'm looking at.

114
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,541
No torso! That's just
limbs and a head.

115
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,416
[TAKUYA]
No way.

116
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,458
[ERIKO]
That's right. The monster seen

117
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,125
during the uproar
about the curse.

118
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:26,750
This is Abel's body, with
Ryuzoji's soul stuffed inside.

119
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,750
[ERIKO] As for Ryuzoji's body,
it's been taken over

120
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,000
by something else.

121
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,041
Uh? Are you kidding?
That's really possible?

122
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,875
Yes, it is, I'm afraid.

123
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,916
For a Class A Dimensional
Criminal, anyway.

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,916
They're beings of pure thought

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,625
who travel between
different dimensions.

126
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,125
[TAKUYA gasping]

127
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,708
[ERIKO] Well, I'm sure it's
asking a bit much for you

128
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,916
to believe me immediately.

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,041
But at that time, I still
hadn't become aware of the fact

130
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,625
that he was actually
something else.

131
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,500
You haven't failed me yet.
I believe you.

132
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,041
I've been investigating
Ryuzoji for some time.

133
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm hoping that
we can arrest him.

134
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:10,416
Arrest him? Okay, c'mon,
just who exactly are you?

135
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,916
[ERIKO]
A long time ago--

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,583
Well, actually, it was the
future, from your point of view.

137
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,125
There was a man named Abel.

138
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,625
He was a scientist.

139
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,375
And he and his assistant spent
their days doing research.

140
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,375
The two of them studied
the science of events.

141
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,708
They researched
the tree of Vrinda.

142
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,291
[ERIKO]
It's basically a diagram.

143
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,666
It shows all the potential
events that can result

144
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,375
from one single cause.

145
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,000
Endless possibilities branching
out from one source.

146
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,166
The nodes on the diagram
split like the roots of a tree,

147
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,625
stretching out according
to a set of rules.

148
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,791
This sequence of events
becomes a new reality

149
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,708
in and of itself, creating
new sequences in turn.

150
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,041
That's where the parallel
worlds come from.

151
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,500
Abel was curious and
performed an experiment.

152
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,750
He went searching for the root

153
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,708
of all the events that
have ever taken place.

154
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,000
Are you sure? It seems too
dangerous to go to the root.

155
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,791
There's nothing to worry about.

156
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:19,375
It's only my mind that
will be traveling backwards.

157
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,208
I don't know.

158
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,583
Come on, relax.

159
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,708
I'll be fine as long
as you're with me.

160
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:50,291
That's 2 to the 50th event
splits. Looking good so far.

161
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,875
Now, he's reached
the sixth layer.

162
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:03,291
[ABEL] So much light. Infinite
events are passing me by.

163
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,541
He's reached the fourth layer.

164
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,958
Incredible.
Tell me what you see.

165
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,416
Ha!

166
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,416
The truths of the universe!
They're here.

167
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,583
[alarm blares]

168
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:32,208
[ERIKO] What's this? Abel,
stop! It isn't what you think!

169
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,833
[laughs]

170
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,083
[CRIMINAL 13A screams]

171
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,791
[gasps]

172
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,000
[ERIKO]
No. Look at these readings!

173
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,708
A Class A dimensional criminal?

174
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,208
[CRIMINAL 13A yells]

175
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,666
[ABEL groans]

176
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,708
What is this thing?
And why is it going after Abel?

177
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,708
Two to the 96th
event splits passed.

178
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,625
Approaching the first layer.
Abel, you have to run!

179
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,833
Or else you won't make it back!

180
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,000
[ABEL groans]

181
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,875
[CRIMINAL 13A growls, yells]

182
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,416
[ERIKO]
Abel! Are you okay?

183
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,083
What happened to the criminal?

184
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,833
I'm just fine. Don't worry.

185
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,083
Continue the experiment.

186
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm so glad!

187
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,250
Wait, you're not...

188
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,250
Is something wrong?

189
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,916
[ERIKO] No. You're not...
You're not Abel!

190
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,250
[ERIKO yelps]

191
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,375
You're right, but I've
inherited every one

192
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,875
of this man's memories.

193
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,666
My, my, you're not
easily fooled, are you?

194
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,250
I guess that's because
you loved each other.

195
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,750
Abel...

196
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:23,166
This is a good body. I like
it very much. I'm taking it.

197
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,375
[ERIKO] As easily as that,
the dimensional criminal

198
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,083
commandeered Abel's body,
then it fled here

199
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,291
to the parallel universe
you and I are in right now.

200
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:35,625
At that point, he switched
from Abel's body to Ryuzoji's.

201
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,208
Abel's soul is out there,
stripped of its body,

202
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,541
wandering event space
with no way back.

203
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,541
[TAKUYA] I hate that tapestry.
It always creeps me out.

204
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,791
Here it is.

205
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,916
[TAKUYA gasps]

206
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,666
Just through here.

207
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,625
Hey, the device!

208
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,833
Look, it's going nuts!

209
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,500
Of course. It's resonating
with what's up ahead of us.

210
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,583
[TAKUYA]
What is this?

211
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,291
[ERIKO] Something that
allows one to move between

212
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,458
parallel worlds.
It basically serves

213
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,250
the same purpose as
your Reflector Device.

214
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,666
[TAKUYA]
It's wrecked.

215
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,916
[ERIKO]
It was probably destroyed

216
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,625
entering this dimension.

217
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:11,166
That's why he approached you,
pretending to be Ryuzoji.

218
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,916
I'll admit, that's an
entertaining theory.

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,083
Of course, there is
the inconvenient issue

220
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,125
of it being a total fantasy.

221
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,708
Ryuzoji.

222
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:24,500
The bones in the storehouse wall
and the rumors about the curse.

223
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:31,125
Not to mention, this dimensional
transportation device.

224
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,750
All these fragments fit together
and lead us to one conclusion.

225
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,416
Ryuzoji!

226
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,708
You're officially under arrest!

227
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:44,500
Heh. You wanted me so badly you
became a dimensional inspector?

228
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,750
Look out!

229
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:54,958
[TAKUYA]
Uh.

230
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,166
[RYUZOJI]
Hmph.

231
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,416
[TAKUYA yelps]

232
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,541
[TAKUYA]
How did he not just die now?

233
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,250
To a being pure of thought,
the body is just the vessel.

234
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,500
However...

235
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:17,375
There are limits to what
a vessel can take!

236
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,583
[RYUZOJI grunts]

237
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,458
Get ready, this is it!

238
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:23,875
[gasps]

239
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,833
No! Eriko!

240
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,750
It appears we now
have the advantage.

241
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,500
[TAKUYA grunts]

242
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,708
[RYUZOJI] Ichijo. I want
you to tie them both up.

243
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,000
Right.

244
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,333
[groans]

245
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,791
[RYUZOJI]
Is something wrong?

246
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,500
I'm fine. Sorry.
I'll do it now.

247
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,750
[TAKUYA grunting]

248
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,750
Such a fool.

249
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,166
[MITSUKI groans]

250
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,125
[TAKUYA]
Mitsuki!

251
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,333
This body is about done for.

252
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,083
No, wait!

253
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,250
[RYUZOJI grunts]

254
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,125
I'm sorry.
You were trying to help.

255
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,375
It's okay now.
Everything's okay.

256
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:35,125
No, it's not okay!
You're dying because of me!

257
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,083
Can I tell you something?

258
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,958
Throughout all of this,
I was always thinking of you.

259
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,833
[TAKUYA]
Hello? Hello?

260
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,958
[TAKUYA]
You there? U-Uh.

261
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,000
You know I've always loved you.

262
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,958
I think you knew that.

263
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,500
The jewel.

264
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,500
Take it with you.

265
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,916
I know you're going to
need it on your travels.

266
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,791
Takuya, keep following
your path, okay?

267
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,958
And don't be afraid.

268
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:38,166
[gasps] Please, no.
No, you can't go!

269
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,958
Stay with me, okay?

270
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:44,208
Do you hear me?
Come on! Please don't go!

271
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,708
[ERIKO]
It's useless.

272
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,708
Going to another parallel
world won't bring her back.

273
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,500
Nothing will. This conclusion
was already ordained.

274
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,041
The hell does that mean?

275
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,250
It means that it doesn't matter
whether she was shot or not.

276
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,041
The outcome would be the same.

277
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,041
The flux in the event
potential is just too high.

278
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,916
U-Uh...

279
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,125
Haven't you traded
goodbyes with her before?

280
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,541
You have, haven't you?

281
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,125
[gasps]

282
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,291
[ERIKO] You would be better off
forgetting about Mitsuki,

283
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,375
you hear me?

284
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,291
She's already doomed.
She'll be lost.

285
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,541
[ERIKO] It's one of those events
that can't be avoided.

286
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,500
The kind people
refer to as "fate."

287
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,500
So, my saying goodbye
to Mitsuki is fate?

288
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,333
[ERIKO]
Yes, and it won't change

289
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,000
no matter what parallel
world you're in.

290
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,625
That can't be right.

291
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:48,041
I don't believe it
and I won't accept it!

292
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,250
[gasps] Not again!

293
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,833
It's the forced
revision of causality.

294
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,833
The correction of chaos.

295
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,666
[TAKUYA grunts]

296
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,166
[ERIKO]
Just in case,

297
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,666
I think I should erase your
memories of me and Ryuzoji.

298
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,458
If he thinks you might
know who he really is,

299
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:08,208
then he's gonna go after you
even in the next world.

300
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,833
You ready?

301
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,083
[TAKUYA]
Yeah.

302
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,333
[ERIKO]
Time for you to hop universes.

303
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,541
What will you do
when you get there?

304
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,125
What I have to.

305
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:26,458
No matter what fate
awaits me up ahead.

306
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,625
You'd better believe I'll
keep following my path.

307
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,583
[KODAI]
Takuya.

308
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,583
[clock ticks]

309
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,125
[TAKUYA]
This again.

310
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:53,375
Remember the simple truth that
causality guides everything.

311
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,208
[TAKUYA] Sorry, I'm not
interested in your lectures

312
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,333
right now. I'm sick of this.

313
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:04,041
Even if it is my fate, saying
goodbye to the people I love...

314
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:09,208
There's one who will show you
which path you should take.

315
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,000
That person's name
is Kanna Hatano.

316
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,625
[TAKUYA]
Kanna? Really?

317
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,291
And as soon as you're able
to gather the eight jewels

318
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,958
together, a new path is
going to be opened to you.

319
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,875
[TAKUYA]
A new path?

320
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,541
[KODAI]
Takuya. I'll be waiting for you.

321
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,375
[TAKUYA grunting]

322
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,041
Here again, huh?

323
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,250
Oh, right.

324
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,958
[groaning]

325
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,375
[TAKUYA] I'm getting sick
of these headaches.

326
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,125
[TAKUYA]
Hey, Kanna!

327
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,625
[KANNA]
Mm.

328
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,541
I'd like to get to know
you a little better.

329
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,500
A lot better, actually.
