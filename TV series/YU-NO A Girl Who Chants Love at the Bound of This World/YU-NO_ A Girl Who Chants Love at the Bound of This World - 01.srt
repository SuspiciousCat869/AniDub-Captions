[baby cries]

2
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,608
[KEIKO] There, there.
It'll be okay, kiddo.

3
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:21,608
[KODAI]
What a little crybaby.

4
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:25,775
Takuya, you need to
grow up to be strong!

5
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:27,817
[TAKUYA cries]

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,942
[KEIKO]
Come on, don't tell him that.

7
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:31,567
You're only going to scare him.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,983
[KODAI grunts]

9
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:36,192
[KEIKO]
You're such a good boy, Takuya.

10
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:39,108
You're my sweet
little angel, aren't you?

11
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:43,150
[clock ticks]

12
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,650
[TAKUYA]
I remember reading once

13
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,942
that some famous doctor said,

14
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:30,317
"Dreams are manifestations
of repressed desires."

15
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,858
If that's true,

16
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:35,358
what does a dream of
my dead parents mean?

17
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:36,775
[yawns]

[footsteps]

19
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,358
[TAKUYA] Just look at that
blue sky and those white--

20
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:41,525
Panties!

21
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:43,817
Skipping class again, I see.

22
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
[TAKUYA chuckles]

23
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:46,775
[ERIKO]
Would you get up off the ground?

24
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,775
[TAKUYA] Maybe if you
help me get these pants off.

25
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,775
Whaddya say, Eriko?

26
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:52,525
[ERIKO] That would make
something else stand up,

27
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:53,692
wouldn't it?

28
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,317
[TAKUYA chuckles]
You know me too well.

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,067
You're a terrible
student, you know.

30
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,567
See, you say that, but I'm
willing to bet that you don't

31
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,942
actually care about that
crap any more than I do.

32
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:11,942
[ERIKO]
Hey. I heard about your dad.

33
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,442
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:16,942
I wish there was something
I could say to make it better.

35
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:19,983
Well, this is better than the
uncertainty of not knowing.

36
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,108
At least I have an answer
instead of just wondering

37
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,942
if he's okay.

38
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:25,317
I get it.

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,525
[TAKUYA] He died in a cave
doing research.

40
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,275
Which is how I
expected him to go.

41
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:35,400
Is there anything
else you wanted?

42
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,525
[ERIKO] Actually, I need
your help with something.

43
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:39,650
Hey, I could use your help
with something, too.

44
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,150
Hard no.

45
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,900
[TAKUYA] Problems of teenage
boys can be pretty serious.

46
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:46,067
Look, we're getting
a transfer student.

47
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,233
[TAKUYA] Now? Right before
summer break? Really?

48
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,858
[ERIKO]
Well, she has her reasons,

49
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,567
and I want you to say
you'll look after her.

50
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,025
Hard no. I'm not babysitting.

51
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,358
[ERIKO]
Man, what a shame--

52
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:58,608
especially considering
how cute she is.

53
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:00,858
Well, why didn't you
say so? I'm in!

54
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:03,608
Ha, ha! Kinda figured
that's how you'd feel.

55
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:04,608
[chiming]

56

[ANNOUNCER A]
Attention, Arima.

57
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:09,358
Please report to the Historical
Research Department.

58
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:17,400
[YUKI]
Hey, Boss!

59
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:19,567
You quit the kendo team?
What's up with that?

60
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,983
Leave me alone, okay?

61
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,317
I've got some bigger
fish to fry right now.

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,733
Oh, yeah, that's right. I heard
them call you on the intercom.

63
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:29,317
Hang on, is it about the...?
Or the other thing?

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,983
Ah! I was so sure they would
never find out about that!

65
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:33,983
Now I'm screwed!

66
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:37,400
So many options.
Almost impressive.

67
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:41,442
Come on, you've just gotta
join the kendo team again!

68
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:43,483
Look, I only took up
kendo in the first place

69
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,942
because my dad told me I should.

70
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:49,358
And now he's gone,
so I'm done with it.

71
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:54,317
Things change. People move on.

72
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,067
Uh? Anyway, you're in more than
one club, though, aren't you?

73
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,608
Ha, ha. Yeah, that's right.
Historical Research Club.

74
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:04,817
And you're after Mio,
am I right?

75
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,358
I, uh...!

76
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:08,900
Dude, don't freak out, I can
tell you have a crush on her.

77
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:10,608
I think you should go for it.

78
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:13,692
Huh? Do you really?

79
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:15,317
Lately there's been
that curse thing

80
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,692
and the lightning strikes.

81
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,067
We've been exploring all
the crazy stuff together.

82
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,442
I'm having a great
time with her!

83
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,858
[TAKUYA] I bet. She loves
paranormal stuff.

84
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:26,275
Yeah, she does! Wait a minute.

85
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:30,108
Why do you know so much
about Shimazu? 'Fess up.

86
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:32,733
Calm down. I'd never
date that Ice Queen.

87
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:34,233
That's good to hear!

88
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:37,983
It is kinda weird, though,
because she's nice to everybody.

89
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:41,067
It's only you who really
seems to set her off.

90
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,150
Uh?! Shimazu!

91
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,483
[TAKUYA]
Hey.

92
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,233
So, what's up, sweet cheeks?

93
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:49,483
Don't call me that.
You know I hate it.

94
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:53,150
Sorry, do you prefer
"Queen of the World"?

95
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:55,317
[sighs] I'll never
understand how you

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,275
can get under my skin so easily.

97
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,400
Good question, maybe it's just
that time of the month?

98
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:03,317
[gasps] You misogynist!

99
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,108
[YUKI] I can feel years
coming off my life

100
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:07,400
just from listening
to you guys bicker.

101
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,108
[MIO]
Come on, Yuki. Let's go.

102
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:12,692
Yes, ma'am! Hey, see ya later,
Boss, have a good day!

103
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,525
[door opens]

104
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,025
[TAKUYA]
What is this?

105
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,108
Why'd they call me
to an empty room?

106
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:24,108
[knocking]

107
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:29,108
Ah-hem. You may enter!

108
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,192
[AYUMI]
Pardon me. It's Arima.

109
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:32,692
Oh, crap!

110
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:33,775
Ayumi.

111
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:36,358
Oh my. Takuya,
what are you doing here?

112
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:39,900
Yeah, funny thing. Ha, ha...
They called me on the intercom.

113
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,275
[AYUMI]
Why? What did you do this time?

114
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:45,400
Nothing! I've been on my
best behavior, I swear!

115
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:48,483
Aww. I do wish that
was the truth, kiddo.

116
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,650
This makes things difficult
as your stepmom.

117
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,483
[TAKUYA]
U-Uh...

118
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,358
[AYUMI] I'm fairly sure
they were calling for me,

119
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,358
and not you.
It's probably about

120
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:58,275
the Geotechnics'
construction project.

121
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:01,775
[TAKUYA] Ah, yeah, I heard
it was having lots of issues.

122
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:05,400
[AYUMI] It's true. Weird things
seem to keep happening.

123
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:06,567
Matter of fact,

124
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,775
I'm off to an inspection
right after this.

125
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:10,525
You're heading to
the coast, also?

126
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:11,900
Well, of course.

127
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:14,067
I never want to be the kind
of boss who simply sits

128
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,358
where it's safe and tells
other people what to do.

129
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:18,067
[door opens]

130
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:30,150
Good to see you, Ryuzoji.
It's been a long time.

131
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:33,067
Yes, it certainly has.
Hello, Ayumi.

132
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,733
I'm glad I caught
the two of you together.

133
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:40,400
About Kodai. No.
I mean, about Dr. Arima.

134
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,150
What about my dad?

135
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,942
I'm not sure if you're aware of
this, but I worked alongside him

136
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:47,400
in his research for
a number of years.

137
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:49,608
If you would both be
willing to allow it,

138
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:51,358
I would consider it
my greatest privilege

139
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:53,692
to be able to carry out
your father's work.

140
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:56,400
[AYUMI] How wonderful.
He would've loved that.

141
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:59,733
I feel it's the best thing
I can do to honor his memory.

142
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,900
[RYUZOJI] So! Would it
be all right with you

143
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,192
to send his research
notes to my house?

144
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:08,108
I'll pay for the cost
of shipping, of course.

145
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:11,108
I'll make arrangements
immediately.

146
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:13,275
I do have one question.

147
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:15,400
Was there anything that
Dr. Arima gave you

148
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:16,858
specifically to keep?

149
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:20,358
There wasn't. Not that
I can think of anyway.

150
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:24,983
Same here. Nothin' like that.
What would it be, exactly?

151
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,275
Excellent question.

152
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:29,608
Some sort of
archaeological relic.

153
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:31,608
And the plot thickens.

154
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:36,108
[MITSUKI]
Takuya.

155
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:37,942
Hey, Mitsuki!

156
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,358
It's been so long.

157
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:40,817
I feel like we
should revert back

158
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,692
to proper names or something.

159
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:46,067
I'd never forgive you.
It really has been forever.

160
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,900
Sorry. I quit my job
lecturing here.

Did you know that?

Hey. It's not
because of us or...

[laughs] No, of course not!

164
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:57,858
I'm just a lot busier now
that I'm Ryuzoji's secretary.

165
00:08:57,942 --> 00:08:59,275
Right.

166
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,817
By the way, I heard
about your father.

167
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,733
I was a little worried I might
find you in worse shape.

And if I was?

00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:12,692
Don't you know? I'd make
you feel better again.

00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:14,400
You hang in there.

Yeah, you too.

Well, you know me. Not really
one who gives up easily.

Do you mind, sir?

177
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:32,733
Regarding the Geotech project.

178
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:34,900
[TAKUYA]
Heh. For sure.

179
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:36,942
It super sucks that I
can't go to the beach

00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:40,108
over summer vacation!
The hot girls in swimsuits...!

181
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:42,608
Give us back our summer,
you hear me?!

182
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:45,817
Thanks so much!
That was actually perfect.

183

[TAKUYA]
Home at last.

[TAKUYA]
Hm? Package?

185
00:09:56,817 --> 00:10:00,442
It's the right size... and
the weight! It's gotta be!

00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:02,025
An adult--!

187
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:06,067
I mean, a very artistic video
of scantily clad women posing!

188
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,983
I owe ya one, Yuki!

What was that about?

[YUKI]
C'mon, Shimazu.

196
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:36,025
I think we should
get out of here.

Give me a few more minutes.

special report on Sakaimachi.

Yes, hello!

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,650
I'm here at the coastal
construction site.

205
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,900
Didn't I just see her?

206
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:05,233
As I believe you
can see behind me,

207
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:08,400
these demonstrations do seem
to be getting more adamant.

208
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:10,317
It super sucks that I
can't go to the beach

over summer vacation!
The hot girls in swimsuits...!

Seriously?

[AYUMI]
Uh. What're you doing here?

233
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,567

on TV. Are you okay?

Yes. I'm totally fine.

Oh! I had no idea
he belonged to you.

Looks to me like you've
raised him very well.

I'm site foreman, though,

242

so you can't come in here
without my permission.

strange when you did?

to be over at the shrine.

pretty unnatural to me.

Well, because of his dad.

Is something going on?

313
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,650
[TAKUYA] Nah. I'll come
back later. See ya guys.

314
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:01,567
Hey, no fair!
Tell us what's up!

315
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,567
[door closes]

316
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,775
[TAKUYA]
What a day.

317
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:22,358
[TAKUYA]
Hm? Another one?

318
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,567
Gimme a break.
What the heck is it this time?

319
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,858
Uh?

320
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:33,025
[TAKUYA] "Parallel World
Constitutive Theorem"?

321
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:36,025
"Reflector Device Construction"?

322
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:49,067
Got me. What in the world
am I even reading?

323
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,317
This thing definitely wasn't
written to be understood.

324
00:16:56,942 --> 00:17:00,442
[TAKUYA] "Reflector device."
This is obviously that.

325
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,775
Uh?

326
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:04,067
Dad...?

327
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,608
[KODAI]
By the time you read this,

328
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,400
I will have already disappeared.

329
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:12,608
I'm sorry, I'm sure
that was rough.

330
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:14,733
But son, please believe.

331
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:16,858
It doesn't mean I'm dead.

332
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:20,233
Wait a second. My dad's alive?

333
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:23,525
[KODAI] I need you to gather
the jewels together, and go to

334
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,817
the base of Ken-no-Misaki
at ten o'clock tonight.

335
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,608
You should find someone
waiting for you there.

336
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:32,358
Oh, crap. Tonight at ten?

337
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,317
Hello! Are you here?

338
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,942
Dad?!

339
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:02,567
[TAKUYA]
Sheesh.

340
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,775
[thud]

341
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:14,650
[TAKUYA]
Uh. Is that my dad in disguise?

342
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:19,567
Man, I really hope not.
Hey, are you okay?

343
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,025
[TAKUYA] Were you goin'
for a little night swim?

344
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:27,983
Huh? Her ears are...

345
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,567
Hey. Miss, are you okay?

346
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:37,150
[TAKUYA]
Um...

347
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,483
Heh!

348
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,900
Yu-- Yu-no.

349
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:43,733
"You know"?

350
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:46,317
Sorry, I'm not sure-- Uh!

351
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:54,942
What was that for?

352
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:57,150
You can't just...

353
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:06,942
[gasps]

354
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:08,358
Where did she...?

355
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:11,025
This is impossible!

356
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,983
[RYUZOJI]
Now I see.

357
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:17,317
She was abandoned at
the far end of causality?

358
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,192
Takuya, what on earth
are you doing up here?

359
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:22,317
And who was that girl?

360
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,733
Yeah, great question--that's
what I'd like to know.

361
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:28,275
Everything is going exactly
as Dr. Arima planned it.

362
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:31,192
That item you're hiding in
your pocket, for example.

363
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:34,483
[TAKUYA] Uh... What is it
you think I have?

364
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:35,567
[RYUZOJI]
I believe that your father

365
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,900
should've left you something.

366
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:40,317
Something that allows you
to cross Neumann space.

367
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,317
No idea what you're
talkin' about.

368
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,483
Your father had discovered
the existence of a law

369
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,233
that controls this world.

370
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:49,317
The woman who gave birth to
you gave him the inspiration.

371
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,275
Takuya's mother?

372
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,817
[TAKUYA]
Seriously?

373
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,025
Your mother and Kodai are still
out there, living in a world

374
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:58,858
that's totally different
from the world we live in.

375
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:03,025
[gasps] All right, how the hell
do you know all this?

376
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:06,483
The item in your possession
is the key to everything.

377
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,025
[RYUZOJI]
And unfortunately...

378
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,358
I'm afraid I can't
leave here without it.

379
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:16,233
Wait, what are you doing?!

380
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:17,983
Are you serious?

381
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:21,025
Any chance that might
be a cigarette lighter?

382
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,858
[TAKUYA]
Fine. But tell me one thing.

383
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:26,733
Very well.

384
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:30,817
[TAKUYA] All I wanna know is if
you can use this to find my dad?

385
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,025
[RYUZOJI]
Correct.

386
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:34,608
If there's any way,
it lies in your hand.

387
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,067
It's the only device
that can see

388
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,025
the infinite possibilities
of spacetime.

389
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:47,358
I'm done discussing it with you.

390
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:50,775
[AYUMI]
Earthquake?

391
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:53,608
No, I think... it's resonance!

392
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:54,650
[TAKUYA]
Huh.

393
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:55,983
[AYUMI yelps]

394
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,567
[screams]

395
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,942
[RYUZOJI] Did that girl who
just disappeared cause this?

396
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:14,275
That's enough! Hand the
device over to me, now!

397
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,817
[TAKUYA]
Kanna?

398
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,817
[TAKUYA groaning]

399
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:40,150
What happened! Ayumi?

400
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:41,942
What the...?

401
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:45,400
--[heartbeat]
--[groaning] My head!

402
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:53,192
[TAKUYA] This is one seriously
nasty headache.

403
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,942
[muffled groans]

404
00:22:01,358 --> 00:22:04,525
[phone rings]

405
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:07,108
Ayumi?

406
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,275
[YUKI] Hey! This is your
friendly wake-up call!

407
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:11,817
What do you want, Yuki?

408
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,942
Well, dang. What's wrong?

409
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:16,317
You're in a bad mood
this mornin', Boss.

410
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,983
Cheer up, our summer break
starts tomorrow, man!

411
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:20,858
[TAKUYA]
I've got bigger problems.

412
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:22,567
I'm on my way to the cops.

413
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,525
What? Did they get ya for
underage smoking or something?

414
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:28,442
[TAKUYA]
It's not about me this time.

415
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:31,108
It's Ayumi. My stepmom is...

416
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:33,817
[YUKI]
Oh, okay. I gotcha.

417
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,442
Watching her walk right now,
as a matter of fact.

418
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:37,733
She glides along so quick.

419
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:40,567
She's like a brisk
autumn breeze!

420
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,900
[TAKUYA]
Hm? What did you just say?

421
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:44,358
[YUKI]
Like a brisk autumn breeze...

422
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:47,525
No, not that part.
What did you say about Ayumi?

423
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:49,650
[YUKI] Only that she
happened to walk past me.

424
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:51,858
You know what I mean,
like a sweet little--

425
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:55,275
[TAKUYA panting]

426
00:22:55,358 --> 00:22:56,442
So it would seem.

427
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,858
Oh, stop it, you're so silly.

428
00:22:58,942 --> 00:22:59,692
Ayumi!

429
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:01,692
[AYUMI]
Oh! Takuya!

430
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:06,567
Huh. You look pale,
are you doing all right, son?

431
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,358
What's wrong with you, why are
you staring at him like that?

432
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:10,692
Are you okay?

433
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm staring because of what
happened last night!

434
00:23:12,483 --> 00:23:14,567
I would've thought that
would be pretty obvious!

435
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,858
What about it?

436
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:20,233
Oh, perhaps you mean because
Ayumi completely blew off

437
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,692
our meeting last night.
I just assumed she was busy.

438
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:25,733
I'm so sorry about that.

439
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:28,942
What is this?
I don't understand.

440
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,983
Takuya, you hang in there, okay?

441
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:34,900
I know that's what your
father would've wanted.

442
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:36,775
[TAKUYA]
What's going on?

443
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:41,192
Is it possible they don't even
remember what happened?

444
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:47,775
[YU-NO] Episode Two: "Parallel
World Constitutive Theorem."
