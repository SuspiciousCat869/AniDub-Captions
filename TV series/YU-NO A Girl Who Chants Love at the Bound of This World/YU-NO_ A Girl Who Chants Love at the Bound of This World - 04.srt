1
00:00:10,025 --> 00:00:11,275
[TAKUYA]
I mean it!

2
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:13,942
Just tell me when you're
gonna come back, already!

3
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:15,067
[KODAI]
I don't know.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,275
And what about Ayumi?

5
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:17,942
You're just gonna
leave her alone?

6
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:21,442
Unlike you, Ayumi understands
the importance of my work.

7
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:23,150
I'm sure that's what
she tells you.

8
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:26,942
Come on, can't you show her half
the kindness she deserves?

9
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:28,775
[KODAI chuckles]
Falling for her?

10
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:30,567
[grunts] What is your problem?!

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,817
I'm worried about her,
that's all!

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,900
[KODAI] Then you'd
better look after her.

13
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:37,692
Who knows what she's
going through right now.

14
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:38,733
[gasps]

15
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:45,858
Ayumi?

16
00:00:45,942 --> 00:00:47,817
[water running]

17
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,900
[AYUMI]
Takuya? Is that you out there?

18
00:00:58,983 --> 00:01:00,317
[TAKUYA]
Yeah.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,067
No matter what happens,
even if my dad treats you wrong,

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,900
I promise I'll always
be here for you.

21
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,275
[AYUMI]
Thank you, but...

22
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,442
I'm just so tired of everything.

23
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:12,525
Living only brings more pain.

24
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:14,150
I can't do it.

25
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,192
[TAKUYA gasping]

26
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:18,525
[TAKUYA]
Ayumi!

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,733
[TAKUYA gasping]

28
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:14,608
Anyone home?

29
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:22,108
I knocked this time, okay?

30
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,608
I'm coming in!

31
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,692
[water running]

32
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,567
[gasps]

33
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,317
[TAKUYA]
Oh, please no.

34
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,483
[TAKUYA]
Ayumi?

35
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,400
[gasps] Ayumi!

36
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:44,650
[gasps]

37
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:47,192
Takuya, what on Earth
is going on with you?

38
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:49,067
[TAKUYA]
Uh! I'm sorry!

39
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,483
It's not what it
looks like, I swear!

40
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,025
[sighs] What is wrong with me?

41
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:58,150
It was just a dream, you idiot.

42
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:02,567
[phone rings]

43
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,025
Hello. It's Takuya.

44
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:05,942
[TOYOTOMI] Oh the little
slacker, perfect.

45
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,525
If you want porn actors, you're
barking up the wrong tree.

46
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:10,983
That joke wasn't funny
the first time, either.

47
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,692
Save the banter for later.

48
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:14,275
I need to talk to
the chief right now,

49
00:04:14,358 --> 00:04:17,233
not her freeloading house guest.
Just put her on for me.

50
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,150
[TAKUYA] Sorry jackass,
but she's busy right now.

51
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,858
Changing your diaper?

52
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:22,108
You idiot.

53
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:23,483
[TOYOTOMI]
This is important.

54
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,275
Tell her it's an emergency,
all right?

55
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:26,733
[door clicks]

56
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:29,442
What's wrong?
Who are you arguing with?

57
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,900
[TAKUYA]
Uh. Oh, it's uh...

58
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:33,733
Captain Douchebag from work.

59
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:37,025
Toyotomi, y'mean?
I can pick it up in my room.

60
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:38,942
Tell him to wait a sec.

61
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,317
[TAKUYA]
Sure. Got it.

62
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
[TOYOTOMI] What did you
call me you little jerk?!

63
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:47,775
So how has school been
treating you lately, Mio?

64
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:50,525
It's just summer classes,
but I'm busy with my club.

65
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:51,775
Well, that's good.

66
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,400
It's nice to pour your
heart into something.

67
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:54,650
It is.

68
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,900
I have a bit of a
proposal for you.

69
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:58,275
Proposal?

70
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:00,858
How does a foreign exchange
program sound to you?

71
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:02,775
I'd be leaving, you mean?

72
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:05,025
[MAYOR] Things around here are
about to get a little messy,

73
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:08,608
I'm afraid. I don't want to
see you get pulled into it.

74
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,483
Yeah, but...

75
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,067
[MAYOR]
I'm going to be frank with you.

76
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,317
The paperwork is already done.

77
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,317
You'll be starting next week
at a school in America.

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,275
That's not right! You can't
decide that on your own!

79
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:22,358
Besides, I need
to stay in Japan!

80
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:25,817
Sakaimachi is the subject
of my historical research!

81
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,025
That may be so, but I
think you can benefit

82
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:29,817
from an international
perspective.

83
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,233
Looking from the outside

84
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:34,025
might teach you something
new about your home.

85
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:37,650
Mio, it's already settled.
Let's not fight.

86
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,567
[TAKUYA]
Wow, looks great.

87
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:48,358
You're staring.

88
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:50,608
I don't have food on my
face or something, do I?

89
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,442
No.

90
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:57,358
Oh, no, my eyes aren't still red
after last night are they? Jeez.

91
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,442
You feel better now?

92
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,608
Heh, 100%.

93
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:04,358
All right, if you say so.

94
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:06,900
[AYUMI] You still have
summer classes, don't you?

95
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:10,817
Worry about your grades.
I can take care of myself.

96
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,733
Well, see you later.

97
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:20,358
[AYUMI]
Have a nice day.

98
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:30,567
[TOYOTOMI]
Check and mate.

99
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,775
I'm just being paranoid.
That dream messed me up.

100
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:48,400
Hey, Mio!

101
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:49,608
[MIO]
Morning.

102
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:51,942
Something wrong?
You sound upset.

103
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:54,358
Oh, I get it. It's that
time of the month.

104
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:55,900
You should find a new joke.

105
00:06:55,983 --> 00:07:00,317
Uh. Well, we're stuck going
to class on our summer break.

106
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,192
Can't blame you
for being grumpy.

107
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:03,775
I'm the same way.

108
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:06,400
You say that, but in my case,
I'm attending class voluntarily.

109
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:08,942
I didn't fail my exams,
like you did.

110
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:10,692
Mean, but true.

111
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:13,150
Stop skipping classes
and stop showing up late

112
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,858
while you're at it. You need
to take this seriously.

113
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:16,692
[TAKUYA]
Uh.

114
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:17,817
Got it?

115
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,983
[TAKUYA]
Hey!

116
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,400
[TAKUYA] Where the hell
did that come from?

117
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,817
[KAORI] What are you planning
to do with that thing anyway?

118
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,733
I can't imagine you'd just
sell it to make some cash.

119
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:37,858
Is it academic curiosity,
or something more?

120
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:40,150
Better not to ask
so many questions.

121
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:41,733
For the both of us, that is.

122
00:07:41,817 --> 00:07:45,442
I've heard that enough
times already. That's fine.

123
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:48,025
But I'm not happy
about his involvement.

124
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:51,358
I don't want him interfering
with my work, all right?

125
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:53,817
[RYUZOJI] I always have
a contingency plan.

126
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,400
Call it my personal
policy, if you like.

127
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:58,983
[TAKUYA grunts]

128
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,400
Goodbye. We'll speak again.

129
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:10,942
Oh, hey. Perfect timing, kiddo.

130
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,775
Can we have a little chat?

131
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:17,483
[TAKUYA] What does a
journalist need from me?

132
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,358
It's nothing too unsavory.

133
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:22,692
I just wanted to know what your
mom researches at her job.

134
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:23,983
Does she tell you?

135
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,192
And why do you care about
something like that?

136
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:27,775
The scandal!

137
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:30,692
I'm trying to get to the bottom
of what's going on at Geotech.

138
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:33,317
[TAKUYA]
Oh yeah, I saw your show.

139
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,233
[KAORI] Really? Well,
thank you for tuning in!

140
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,650
[TAKUYA]
As short as your skirt was,

141
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,775
I'm surprised I never
saw your panties.

142
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:40,858
[KAORI]
I'm a pro.

143
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:42,733
I cross my legs at just
the right angle.

144
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,650
[TAKUYA] I figured you
just weren't wearing any.

145
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,233
[KAORI]
Oh, I'll try that next time.

146
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:50,108
Anyway, I want to figure out
if Geotech is working with

147
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,608
the mayor behind the scenes.

148
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:53,650
I know you go to school
with the mayor's daughter.

149
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,983
Isn't she a friend of yours?

150
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,317
Yeah.

151
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,775
[KAORI] Has she said anything
to you about this?

152
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:00,733
Anything at all,
no matter how small?

153
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:02,567
Sorry, but I don't know a thing.

154
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,317
Besides, even if I did know,
I'd never sell out a friend.

155
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,567
'Specially to you.

156
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,983
Come on. I'm not asking
you to sell someone out.

157
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,275
I'm trying to help people, here.

158
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:13,525
How kind of you.

159
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,025
[KAORI]
I mean it.

160
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:17,567
Your friend is innocent--I
wouldn't dream of hurting her.

161
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,233
Mayor Shimazu's the bad guy.

162
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:22,608
If things are about to get ugly,
you need to make sure

163
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,358
she doesn't end up on the wrong
side of this whole mess.

164
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:27,317
Trading info can only help her.

165
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,650
We all deserve
to know the truth.

166
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:32,400
Don't give me that look.
I mean it.

167
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:36,983
If something comes up,
contact me as soon as you can.

168
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:40,192
And since we're friends,
you can call me Kaori.

169
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,858
It was nuts! He fell
flat on his face!

170
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:49,108
This is a surprise.
You actually showed up today.

171
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:52,400
You can consider it a favor
to a friend, I suppose.

172
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,692
You got something on
your mind, Shimazu?

173
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,275
If you need someone to talk to,
or a shoulder to cry on,

174
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:00,733
I'm always here for you!

175
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm a master of all matters
of the heart, y'know!

176
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:05,733
[MIO]
Heh. Thank you.

177
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:08,942
If I can confide in anyone,
you're at the top of the list.

178
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,775
Sounds good! Hey, let's do
your fortune really quick!

179
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:14,067
Let's see here,
you're a Taurus right?

180
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,442
Looks like your lucky item
today is... watermelon!

181
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:20,275
That seems rather useless.

182
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:24,525
[YUKI] Also... It says to be
careful around mountains.

183
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,608
Mount Sankaku, maybe?

184
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,608
[TAKUYA]
Toyotomi? That's not good.

185
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:33,317
Wonder what he was
calling about today.

186

--[STUDENTS gasp]
--Actually. I gotta go.

187
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,692
[YUKI]
You okay, Boss?

188
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:38,858
[MIO]
Hey!

189
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:44,108
[ERIKO] Hold it! I have
to say, you've got guts

190
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,358
trying to skip class the second
your teacher shows up.

191
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:49,525
Summer is beckoning--
I must heed the call!

192
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,317
Oh, how I long to be free!

193
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,483
The fleeting days of my youth

194
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,317
can't be confined
within this prison!

195
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,442
Well if you truly want to be
free, then free your mind.

196
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:59,358
Fill it with knowledge.

197
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:02,275
How 'bout this? Let's have
today's class on the beach.

198
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:03,483
And bring watermelon!

199
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,067
Of course! Then we'll
put on blindfolds--

200
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,067
and play "find the melon!"

201
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,442
I sense some already-- Ah!

202
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:14,150
'Kay. Fine.
We're having a pop quiz.

203
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,525
Anyone who gets a perfect grade

204
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,400
is exempt from class for
the rest of the summer.

205
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:18,817
All right!

206
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,192
But you better keep your
promise after I ace this thing!

207
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:22,692
Unbelievable.

208
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:24,858
Did you forget you're nearly
at the bottom of the class?

209
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:27,942
Ha, ha! Don't count me out!

210
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:30,067
[TAKUYA] I've got this
on my side, after all.

211
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,650
Might take a few tries,
but I'll get it!

212

'Kay. I'm passing
out the quiz now.

make sure you get the right one.

[PA VOICE] Takuya Arima,
you have a phone call.

216
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:50,275
Please come to
the office immediately.

217
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:52,733
You heard 'em. Too bad!

218
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:55,858
[ERIKO growls]
Just go.

219

[TAKUYA]
This is Takuya.

[MOCHIZUKI]
My name is Mochizuki.

221
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:03,900
I'm with Geotechnics'
legal department.

222
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:05,942
Uh. Okay.

223
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,483
[MOCHIZUKI]
I'll get straight to the point.

224
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,150
Do you happen to know where
Chief Arima is right now?

225
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:13,483
I'm not sure, but she said she'd
be working from home today.

226
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,025
[MOCHIZUKI]
We tried earlier,

00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:17,733
but she's not answering and
she's not returning our calls.

228
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:19,900
Why? Is something
going on with her?

229

[MOCHIZUKI] I'm not at liberty
to share the details.

230
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,775
So, uh, what now?

231
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,275
[MOCHIZUKI]
Well, I can tell you one thing

232
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:29,025
to put this in perspective.

233
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:33,525
The situation could possibly
develop into a criminal matter.

If you find your mother,

please tell her to come
to the office immediately.

look after her.

00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:05,942
[TAKUYA]
No.

316
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,567
I didn't invite you here
to gobble you up.

317
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,525
You don't need to look
quite so nervous.

318
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:27,067
Hey, been waitin' for you.

319
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,275
C'mon!

320
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:30,692
I need you to promise
me one thing first.

321
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:33,192
Don't show up at
my school anymore.

322
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:36,025
Ah, so you spotted
me today, huh?

323
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:37,692
All right, fine.

324
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:40,025
Now, get in here already!

325
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:45,442
[elevator dings]

326
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:52,900
[KAORI sighs]
Want something to drink?

327
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:53,775
A beer?

328
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:55,317
I'm not here to have fun.

329
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,650
Just tell me what's
going on with Ayumi.

330
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:01,150
[KAORI]
Could you relax a little? Jeez!

331
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,442
[TAKUYA] Just so we're clear,
I'll listen to you,

332
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:05,983
but I won't do anything
that might endanger Ayumi.

333
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,983
You really love
your mom, don't you?

334
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,192
Of course, we're family.

335
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:11,608
Well, good.

336
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:14,442
Because this plan of mine
will definitely help her.

337
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:16,358
Yeah, we'll see.

338
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:19,150
I have some juicy information
I'm still sitting on.

339
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,650
Something nobody else
has reported on yet.

340
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,608
[TAKUYA] Stop wasting my
time and just tell me!

341
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:28,858
[KAORI] Some secret data was
stolen from Geotech yesterday.

342
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,608
Whatever the content was, it
was highly important because

343
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:34,775
Chief Arima is going to be
fired for letting it slip.

344
00:18:34,858 --> 00:18:37,400
Well, that was the story at
first, but now they're saying

345
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,608
she might have sold the
data to another company.

346
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:41,275
She'd never!

347
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:45,108
Their legal department

348
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:48,150
probably gave you a call
already, I'd assume.

349
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:51,650
[KAORI laughs]
Don't worry.

350
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,983
I said this would
help her, remember?

351
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,900
I know she didn't do it.
She's been set up.

352
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:58,858
Why would they do that?

353
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:02,025
[KAORI]
Anyway. Here's the offer.

354
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,442
I'm going to prove her
innocence and reveal the truth

355
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,900
to the world, but to do that,

356
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:08,317
I have to break
into Geotech first.

357
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,942
That is the part
where I need your help.

358
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,400
I don't get it.
What am I s'posed to do?

359
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:17,025
[KAORI]
All I need is one of these.

360
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,900
An ID card.

361
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,275
I want you to take this fake
card I had made, swap it out

362
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:32,983
with your mom's, and bring
the real ID card back to me.

363
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,067
[TAKUYA]
This is completely insane.

364
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,858
[KAORI]
It's also completely urgent.

365
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,483
Right now, this information
is a Geotech secret,

366
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,525
but it's only a matter of time
before the news gets out.

367
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:43,817
Once the police get involved,

368
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,358
your mom will be
arrested, I'm sure.

369
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:48,442
Then the story
will be all over TV.

370
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:52,650
And that includes my program,
if I can't prove the truth.

371
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,317
All right,
but one question first.

372
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,483
[KAORI] As long as it's
not about my age or weight,

373
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,692
fire away.

374
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,733
Sneaking into Geotech
would be dangerous.

375
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,650
Why are you willing to
take a risk like that?

376
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,567
On your show last night,
you were happy to blame Ayumi.

377
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,317
Yesterday was yesterday,
today is today.

378
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,192
All I'm looking for
is the biggest scoop,

379
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,317
and this is it for sure.

380
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,567
But wait,

381
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,942
do you know who set her
up in the first place?

382
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,525
Be patient.

383
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:21,400
Once I sneak into their office,
I'll figure it out no problem.

384
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:22,650
Wait...

385
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:26,900
That must be it.

386
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,358
From the start...

387
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,525
...this was all
Toyotomi's fault.

388
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:33,192
In that case, I should go.

389
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,775
Thank you, Kaori!

390
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,067
Uh. Hey! Where are you going?!
I thought that we had a deal!

391
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,692
[TAKUYA]
I'll think about it!

392
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,692
[TAKUYA]
I should have trusted my gut!

393
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:49,108
She was only acting that way
because he was blackmailing her!

394
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:52,442
I have to set this straight!

395
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:55,358
I'm sorry Ayumi. I let you down.

396
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,358
[TAKUYA]
Uh.

00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:05,608
Ayumi!

Sorry, I'm coming in now!

Kick my ass if I'm wrong!
You hear me?
