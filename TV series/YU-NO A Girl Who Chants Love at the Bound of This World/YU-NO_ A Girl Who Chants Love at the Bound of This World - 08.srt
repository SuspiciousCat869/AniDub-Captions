the thoughts of
the geese and swans.

00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,108
Small birds such as those,
while intelligent,

could never be expected
to understand

what larger birds are thinking.

In the same way,
a small-minded person

could never reasonably be
expected to comprehend

[MIO] I have to tell
the others right away!

I see. Understood.

The media found out, so there's
that to deal with now.

22
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:54,275
Yeah, that's an understatement.

23
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:55,900
Look, I want you
to put this fire out

24

before it gets any bigger.

Sure, that's good, and feel
free to get a little rough.

So, Mio.

00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:42,317
How's school treating you?
Going okay?

28
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,817
Yeah. It's just summer classes,

29
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,900
but I've been keeping
busy with my club.

30

That's good.

31
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,358
So, um. I have a little
proposal for you.

32
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,942
How does a foreign exchange
program sound to you?

33
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,567
Huh?

34
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,150
Things around here are about to
get a little messy, I'm afraid.

35
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:04,108
I want to avoid you getting
pulled into any of it.

36
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:07,025
I can't leave! Is this something
you're really considering?

37
00:04:07,108 --> 00:04:08,483
It's already done.

38
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:10,983
Next week, you'll be
starting school in America.

39
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,733
You can't do that!

40
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:15,067
It isn't right that I don't
get a say in this!

41
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,025
Besides, I really
want to stay here.

Well, I'm sorry, but the
decision has been made.

43
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,317
Man, what is with this headache?

44
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,692
Is it all 'cause of all that
hypnosis-y stuff last night?

45
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,317
[ERIKO]
Morning. Is someone hung over?

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,692
Don't be ridiculous! [groans]

[TAKUYA]
Yeah, this isn't gonna work.

48
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:45,442
Sorry, but I've
gotta go home now.

49
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,733
Aw, what a shame.
For a second there,

50
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,567
I thought this might be
the perfect opportunity

51
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,858
to finally try out my special,
secret, headache-curing massage.

52
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:54,067
Oh, well.

53
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,858
Wait, you have a secret,
special massage?

54
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:59,192
[ERIKO] Sure, and it'll make
your whole body feel better,

55
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,983
not just your head.
You know what I mean.

56
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:05,567
Treat the whole person.

57
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,358
How 'bout it?

58
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:13,067
[TAKUYA] I'm in! I am so in!
I can almost hear the bed

59
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,525
in the nurse's office
calling our names!

[TAKUYA grunting]

00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:23,567
I found it sitting in
the principal's closet.

62
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,900
I'll put it back
when we're done,

63
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:27,150
so don't mention
this or anything.

64
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,900
That's what you meant when
you said it was "secret"?

65
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,192
Hey, by the way, let me ask you:

66
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,692
does this ring a bell?

67
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:36,775
"Nai-herb"? Or maybe
something like "Nai-hab"?

68
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,400
[ERIKO]
Do you mean "niarb"?

69
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:41,442
Yeah, that's it! It was "niarb."

70
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:43,650
[ERIKO]
It's a type of hypnosis.

71
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,650
There's more than one type?

72
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,983
Yeah, and the main
difference with this one

73
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:49,275
is that while you're in it,

74
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:52,150
your normal consciousness
remains totally awake.

75

[TAKUYA grunts]

76
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:56,067
[ERIKO]
Listen. It's kinda crazy.

77
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,483
Because since you're awake,

78
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,858
it's like you don't realize
you're being controlled.

79

I'm not feeling very well.
Do you think I could lie down?

You should try this out!
Little vibrating action.

Yeah, thanks, I'll pass.

This sucks.

None of that stuff made my
head feel any better at all.

[MITSUKI] What was that
about not feeling better?

95

[TAKUYA]
Hey, Mitsuki.

96
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,858
Not to be gross, but one part
of me is feeling better.

97
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,942
How very original, and subtle.

98
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:55,192
That's my Mitsuki.
You know just how I think.

99
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:57,942
[MITSUKI] Were you able to look
into what we talked about?

100
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,692
I was.

101
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:03,567
By the way, remember how your
head was hurting yesterday?

102
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,192
[MITSUKI]
Sure, what about it?

103
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:08,067
[TAKUYA] This is going
to sound really weird,

104
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,692
but it's possible we were both
hypnotized by Ryuzoji.

105
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:14,817
[MITSUKI]
Hypnotized? That's ridiculous.

106
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,733
[TAKUYA]
Standing here right now,

107
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,025
are you the same as always?

108
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:29,817
Of course I am, but you aren't.

109
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,900
You feel different than before,
there's no doubt about that.

110
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,150
Uh!

111
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,608
[MITSUKI] Almost like
you're another person

112
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:38,525
from another world or something.

113
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,858
[gasps] Oh, that.

114
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:44,317
Clearly, that's because I was
a virgin before I met you.

115
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,067
Sex changes a dude, you know?

116
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,567
Well, I guess I can
believe that.

117
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,442
By the way, how're things with
you and that girl? Shimazu.

118
00:07:56,525 --> 00:08:00,442
Well, the truth is,
she pretty much hates me now.

119
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,983
After that thing that happened.

120
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,983
She immediately started calling
me a "walking libido."

121
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,192
[bell chimes]

122
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:10,733
Crap, is that the bell?
Gotta get to class!

123
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:14,275
She takes unnatural pleasure
in yelling at me when I'm late!

124
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:17,817
I'll be in touch
later about Ryuzoji!

125
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,192
All right.

126
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:22,025
[MITSUKI]
Thanks...

127
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,692
Hey, are you okay?

128
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:27,525
I'll be honest, you're
looking pretty down.

129
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,025
No, it's nothing.

130
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,275
You should let me help!

131
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:32,983
Especially if it's
about your love life.

132
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,400
I'm a great shoulder to cry on!

133
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:37,733
No, it's definitely
nothing like that.

134
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,150
But sure, I guess I
could tell you about it.

135
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,400
[YUKI]
I'm all ears!

136
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:44,525
Do you have some time, too?

137
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,400
Uh? Time for what?

138
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:47,900
I want to go to Mount Sankaku

139
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,817
and poke around up
there a little bit.

140
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,983
[YUKI, TAKUYA]
Uh?

141
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:53,733
Preferably this week.
Stop by my place,

142
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,775
I discovered something
about the tapestry.

143
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:58,692
[YUKI] Why does it specifically
have to happen this week?

144
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,025
Why do you think?

145
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:03,108
I want to solve this mystery
as soon as possible.

146
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,900
[KANNA]
That place is trouble.

147
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:07,442
It'd be better
to just stay away.

148
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:08,692
Why is that?

149
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:10,733
Do you know something
about Mount Sankaku

150
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,567
that you might be
willing to tell us?

[door slides]

152
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,025
[ERIKO] Okay, I want to
see some butts in seats.

153
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:21,692
I've got something special
for you guys today,

154
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:23,400
and you won't be able
to just race through it

155
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:25,317
and be off the hook
like yesterday.

156
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,025
You'll keep doing it over till
you get every problem right.

157
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,858
Ya got that, Arima?

158
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:34,317
Bring it on. Love a challenge.

Ugh. No way!

160
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,983
[TAKUYA]
'Kay, see ya later, then.

161
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:46,233
I hate this.
It's gonna take forever!

162
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:47,858
Don't leave me, Boss!

163
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:49,608
He'll be tied up
here for a while,

164
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,733
we should probably
go without him.

165
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:52,692
Sure.

166
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,442
It's not fair.

167
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:02,067
[TAKUYA]
Wow, I'm impressed.

168
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,525
You really have spent a lot
of time on this, haven't you?

169
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:07,483
Dr. Arima's book, <i>Legacy.</i>

170
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:10,358
It says the secrets of the
Takanoamahara people could

171
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,817
be found here in
Sakiamachi, right?

172
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,442
Yeah.

173
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:18,483
Although the book never actually
specifies any certain location

174
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:22,942
if you read it closely, there's
one spot that presents itself.

175
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:24,775
I'll bite, where is it?

176
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:28,608
[MIO]
Ken-no-Misaki. Mount Sankaku.

177
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:31,192
Do you remember Futago Rock?

178
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:35,775
[exhales] Sorry, hard
to think about rocks.

179
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:39,233
I think I'm a little distracted
by the view right now.

180
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:41,317
They're calling me home.

181
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,192
Ah!

182
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,525
Stop messing around!

183
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:47,233
I mentioned this before,
but there's a good chance

184
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:51,358
that the writing on Futago Rock
is actually 8,000 years old.

185
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,775
I think it might
have been written

186
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:56,608
by the Takanoamahara
people themselves.

187
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,817
[TAKUYA]
The Takanoamahara...

188
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:07,817
You doing okay over there?

189
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,192
Yeah. I was just wondering
if the Takanoamahara

190
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:14,192
could possibly have been
blonde, elf-like people.

191
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:17,942
[MIO] "Elf-like people"?
What are you talking about?

192
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:21,525
You know. Hot girls with
pointy ears and blonde hair.

193
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:23,442
[MIO]
Wait, what?

194
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:24,650
And were naked?

195
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:25,858
[MIO gasps]

196
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:26,733
[TAKUYA groans]

197
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:27,983
You pervert!

198
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:28,900
[thud]

199
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,108
[BOTH]
Uh?

200
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:31,192
Huh?

201
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:48,150
[phone ringing]

202
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:53,233
[KANNA]
Yes?

203
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:56,483
[HOJO] Are you still at home?
What're you doin'?

204
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:59,275
[KANNA] Sorry. I had
something to take care of.

205
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:03,817
[HOJO] Hey now, you're supposed
to be with me today, aren't you?

206
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,233
You answer me, girl.

207
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:10,983
If you don't come here, I can
just as easily come to you.

208
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,692
[HOJO]
Hey, you there?

209
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:19,567
[KANNA]
Understood. I'll be right over.

210
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,525
[MIO]
Anyway, I'm completely convinced

211
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:28,233
there's something
at Mount Sankaku.

212
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,650
I mean, the tapestry I saw

213
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:32,858
at Principal Ryuzoji's house
yesterday proves it!

214
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:34,442
How does it do that?

215
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:37,150
[MIO]
Here, look at this!

216
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:41,192
Doesn't it remind you of the
lightning strikes on the coast?

217
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:44,275
Well, yeah, now that you
mention it, I guess it does.

218
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:46,650
Do you remember what
you said about this?

219
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,442
You explained that you
thought it had to be

220
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,400
some kind of symbol
or something.

221
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:53,483
[TAKUYA] Yeah, but a symbol
of what, I don't know.

222
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:57,775
Right, I understand that. So,
we're gonna go figure it out!

223
00:12:57,858 --> 00:12:59,942
I'll get ready,
just gimme a minute.

224
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:01,608
[TAKUYA]
Take your time.

225
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,275
[knocking]

226
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:09,233
[MAYOR]
Mio, do you have a second?

227
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:10,150
Hey.

228
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:11,358
Uh!

229
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:17,567
Sorry, somebody's at the door!

230
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,817
Huh?

231
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,317
[MIO screaming]

232
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,733
What's wrong? Are you
okay in there, Mio?

233
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:24,275
--[slap]
--[TAKUYA groans]

234
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:26,900
Hold on! Did I just hear
a boy's voice in there?

235
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:29,608
[panting]

236
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm coming in now!

237
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:35,150
[MIO]
No, it was nothing, Dad!

238
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,358
I got grossed out
by a cockroach!

239
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,400
[TAKUYA]
Dammit, that hurt!

240
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:42,525
How many times are you
gonna hit me today?

241
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:44,400
Tell me whose voice
that is, young lady!

242
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:45,942
Is there a boy
in there with you?

243
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:50,025
[MIO coughs] Of course there
isn't, you're just hearing me!

244
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:51,483
[MAYOR growling]

245
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,900
Oh my gosh. If my dad
finds you, you're done for!

246
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:56,733
I seriously think he
might kill any boy

247
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,067
he ever found in my room!

248
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,108
[TAKUYA gasping]

249
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:02,233
Go! Just get out of here, now!

250
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:05,858
[MAYOR] Mio, I want you
to move out of the way!

251
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:08,733
You'd better open that door
immediately, you understand?

252
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,692
Wait, Dad! You have
to give me a minute!

253
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:12,067
I'm trying to get dressed.

254
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,608
Get out of the way now!

255
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:15,025
Dad, no!

256
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:16,942
I said out of the way!

[doorbell rings]

Huh?

259
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,525
[MIO] I think somebody's
at the door, Dad!

260
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:25,692
Listen, I'm fine, just go
see who it is, all right?

261
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:26,775
[MAYOR]
But, I...

[doorbell rings]

263
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:33,233
I'll be back in a minute!

[footsteps]

265
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:37,025
Now's your chance! Run!

266
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,442
Go to Mount Sankaku
and wait for me!

267
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,108
Hold on, aren't we
on the second floor?

268
00:14:41,192 --> 00:14:42,192
[MIO]
Hurry!

269
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:43,442

[MAYOR]
Yeah?

00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,733
Hi, sir, I'm a friend
of your daughter's!

272
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:55,317
My name is Yuki, and she
and I go to the same school.

273
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,275
Thanks, I appreciate it!

[yelps]

275
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,067
Go away.

[YUKI screaming]

277
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:07,567
Sounded like Yuki.
Guess that's a relief.

278
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,692
[MIO]
Hey. I finally made it.

279
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:33,400
[TAKUYA]
Uh. Hey there.

280
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:35,733
[MIO]
Here, you forgot your shoes.

281
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,317
[TAKUYA] I panicked.
What've you got there?

282
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,942
Get ready to dig!

283
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,942
[TAKUYA]
Huh?

284
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,275
[MIO]
Look at this.

285
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:45,317
[TAKUYA]
That's the drawing you made.

286
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,942
No, here. See it? The hole
in the side of the tower?

287
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:54,192
[TAKUYA] Huh. Well, I guess
if that really is a tower,

288
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,900
then that would be
the entrance, right?

289
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:57,817
[MIO]
My thought, exactly!

290
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,900
There has to be an entrance
right around here.

291
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:05,317
[TAKUYA] I don't know.
Are you really convinced

292
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,358
there's anything to be found
after all this time?

293
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:13,608
Nobody in his field took
Doctor Arima seriously.

294
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:15,858
So, you know what
I think happened?

295
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:19,108
His research was simply ignored
and never widely published.

296
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:22,317
That is possible. Well...

297
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,525
Even if he did tell
people that the secrets

298
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,858
of the Takanoamahara people
were hidden in Mount Sankaku,

299
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:29,525
they would've laughed at him.

300
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:32,025
[shovels clinking]

301
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:37,608
[sighs] Wouldn't it be
a whole lot faster

302
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,150
to say the magic words
and open the door?

303
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:43,358
Believe me, I totally
would if we knew them.

I knew it... Arima!

308
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:00,275
What is it?

309
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:04,067
It sounds different
when I hit it right here.

310
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,317
Take a look.

I'm okay. Let's keep going.

317
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,442
You can't stand on that ankle.

318
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,858
I'm fine! It's nothing!

319
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,150
[TAKUYA]
You're not.

320
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,858
I think you should rest.

321
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,525
Whaddya say we go
home for the day?

322
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:29,525
We can come back tomorrow.

323
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,358
Yeah.

324
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:47,775
You've put on some weight.

325
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,025
[gasps] No, I haven't,
why're you such a jerk?

326
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:51,692
I was just kidding.

327
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:53,108
[MIO grumbles]

328
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:55,692
[sighs]

329
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,275
What's wrong?

330
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:59,567
I'm just tryin' to size them up.
I'm thinking they're double D's.

331
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,733
[gasps] Let me down!

332
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:04,567
It really doesn't help
when you fidget!

333
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,692
Hey, how's your ankle?

334
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:16,067
S' Fine.

335
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,858
Y'okay till we get
to the nurse's office?

336
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:23,442
[MIO] Mm-hm.
I'm really sorry about this.

337
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:25,150
No need to be.

338
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:33,400
[TAKUYA]
Eriko?

339
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:36,733
Right, why did I think
she'd be here at this hour?

340
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:53,108
[MIO] You can do a little bit
of everything, can't you?

341
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:56,733
My dad taught me this
when I was really small.

342
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:59,983
C'mon, Boss... Shimazu...

343
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:03,108
Where'd you guys
go without me?

344
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,233
Huh?

345
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:09,942
Let's get outta here, huh?

346
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:13,150
What's wrong?
What're you staring at?

347
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:15,233
[MIO]
When I look at a starry sky,

348
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:18,608
it helps me remember
how small I actually am.

349
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:22,983
[TAKUYA] Uh-oh, is this some
kind of existential crisis?

350
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:25,525
If something's
bothering you, let's talk.

351
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:29,108
I'm no starry sky,
but I can listen.

352
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:30,817
It's about my father.

353
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,983
I think he's involved
in something corrupt.

354
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,483
Wait, do you mean...

355
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:37,400
Something involving the
Geotech construction.

356
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:39,358
But that isn't all.

357
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:40,858
[TAKUYA grunts]

358
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:45,983
Earlier, he said I'm probably
leaving Sakai-machi.

359
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:49,067
He's telling me I need
to study overseas.

360
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,150
But you've got nothing
to do with it!

361
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,900
That's your dad's problem!

362
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,733
[MIO] Thank you.
You've surprised me.

363
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:59,858
It's hard to believe,
but now I kinda wish

364
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:01,900
more people were like you.

365

[door slides]

366
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,567
Oh, my. I thought I heard
someone talking in here.

367
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,233
Am I interrupting?

368
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:14,150
No, you aren't interrupting,
but you're still not welcome.

369
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:16,442
[laughs] My apologies.

370
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,817
Although, I'm glad
I didn't catch you

371
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,192
in the middle of something.

372
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:22,858
Well, I would never do
what you're implying.

373
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,983
Unlike a certain person.

374
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:27,692
Wow. Do you really
think it's that disgusting

375
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,150
simply to share your
love with someone?

376
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,275
[MIO growls]

[MITSUKI]
Look, I'm sorry.

378
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:38,567
What you saw then must have
been very traumatizing for you.

379
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,483
You definitely had a judgy
little field day, huh?

380
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:42,983
You even came to me and told me

381
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:45,108
I should break up with
Arima, remember?

382
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:46,692
Shut up!

383
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:49,567
You promised me that you would
never tell Arima I said that!

384
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,358
Sorry, I've had
some time to think,

385
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:53,692
and now I feel like it's better
if he knows the truth.

386
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:55,858
What does that even mean?

387
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:57,400
You like him.

388
00:20:57,483 --> 00:21:01,108
You like Arima
that way, don't you?

389
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,025
[MIO]
Don't be ridiculous!

390
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:06,358
How could I ever possibly love
a walking libido like this guy?

391
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,483
[MITSUKI]
See? I'm right.

392
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:14,317
The fact that you're getting so
emotional only proves my point.

393
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,192
Anyway, it's late.

394
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,150
Takuya, be a gentleman and
walk her home, will you?

395
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:28,733
Sorry about all that.

396
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:31,567
Oh, no. It's fine.

How could you?!

[TAKUYA]
Hm?

00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:59,608
I never thought you were capable
of something like this.

Uh?
