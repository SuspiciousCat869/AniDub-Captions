00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,358
[sighs]

3
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:17,275
[TAKUYA] There sure are a
lot more of these, lately.

4
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,775
Hey, I'm home from work!

5
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:39,692
Uh. I'm startin' to
sound like my dad.

6
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:43,442
Sorry, but this was all
I could manage to find.

7
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,108
Food is getting
harder to come by.

8
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:49,275
Think it'll last us
a few days?

9
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,275
[SAYLESS]
Mm.

10
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:53,567
[TAKUYA]
How's she doing? Asleep?

11
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,900
[SAYLESS]
Mm.

12
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:59,608
Heh, heh. Let's do our best
not to wake her up, then!

13
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:47,525
[TAKUYA]
Dad.

14
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:49,692
I followed the
clues you left me.

15
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,817
I made it to Dela Granto.

16
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:56,275
[TAKUYA] There are no clocks
or calendars in this world,

17
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:59,858
but I think it's
been about a year.

18
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:02,858

[gasps]

20
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:11,108
[TAKUYA] Right, right, I get it.
I know what you're thinkin'.

21
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,775
It's about the baby, right?

22
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,567
[wails]

23
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,233
[TAKUYA] This big stork
dropped it outta nowhere!

24
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:19,192
Okay, yeah, that's a lie.

25
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:22,400
[TAKUYA]
It's just what you thought.

26
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:25,358
Sayless and I have a daughter.

27
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,692
Come on, a man and
a woman, all alone.

28
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:30,150
Of course it's gonna happen.

29
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:35,775
Her name is Yu-No.
Sayless chose it for her.

30
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:40,025
The weird thing is,
I've heard that name before.

31
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:43,108
Yu... Yu-No.

32
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:44,567
[cooing]

33
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,400
[TAKUYA] Is there some kind
of crazy connection?

34
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,692
[TAKUYA] Sayless and I exist
humbly and peacefully,

35
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,608
living together off the land.

36
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,108
It works well.
We have a good life.

37
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:58,650
[door creaks]

38
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:00,150
[TAKUYA laughs]

39
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,317
[TAKUYA] I can't imagine a world
without Sayless and Yu-No, now.

40
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:11,358
[TAKUYA] So, to protect
the family I'd grown to love,

41
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:14,150
I took up the job
that Ailia used to do.

42
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:25,317
[TAKUYA] They just keep
coming, don't they?

43
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,942
What the heck are
these things, anyway?

44
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,858
[yells]

45
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,733
[TAKUYA] Heh, heh. Whatcha get
for messin' with the Kendo club.

46
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:44,525
[MONSTER A]
Divine Emperor.

47
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:45,900
[TAKUYA]
Mm?

48
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,942
Whoa, it talks?

49
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:51,192
That was weird.

50
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:59,275
[cries]

51
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:02,650
I never realized before
how much babies cry.

52
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,317
Here you go.

53
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,150
Ha, ha! She's so cute!

54
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:13,817
Ow, ow, ow! Hey, no biting.

55
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:17,650
[cries]

56
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,942
[TAKUYA gasps, chuckles]

57
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,525
[TAKUYA]
Sorry.

58
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:34,233
[TAKUYA]
Looks like she's enjoying it.

59
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,108
Hey, now, Yu-No. Stop hoggin'
the boobs, I like 'em, too!

60
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:52,150
Sorry. It's seriously like
I've become my dad.

61
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:06,858
[TAKUYA]
I've thought about it.

62
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:10,067
Several times, I've
thought of going back.

63
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,650
Of course, I haven't
forgotten my promise

64
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:16,067
to bring the psychite
back for Kanna.

65
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,692
Before she died, Ailia told
me that the holy stones

66
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:23,358
were mined at the
quarries in the desert.

67
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:29,442
I think... those holy stones
might be psychite.

68
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,650
I've attempted to cross
the desert several times

69
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:34,567
in order to find out
if that's true.

70
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,525
But the more I try,
the more I realize

71
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:43,608
escaping from this harsh land
is basically impossible.

72
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:51,525
[gasps]

73
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:53,483
Tell me something.

74
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:58,275
You came from the
Imperial City, right?

75
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:01,150
How did you make it
across the desert?

76
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,525
Without even a map or food?

77
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:07,608
[SAYLESS]
Mother's guidance brought me

78
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,942
to the end of the world.

79
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:13,525
In order for me to summon
the goddess Grantia.

80
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,817
I don't pretend to understand,

81
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,567
but when a priestess hears
the will of her goddess,

82
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,775
it must be amazing.

83
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:26,983
Sorry. I really shouldn't
have asked.

84
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:33,108
It doesn't matter to me
what your reasons were.

85
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:35,067
[gasps]

86
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,733
[TAKUYA] I'll always be here.
I'll keep you safe.

You're not goin' anywhere!

93
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:03,067
Watch that side!
Keep her surrounded!

94
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,942
Surrender, right now!

Fire your arrows!

00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:10,817

She's getting away!

You can't run forever!

00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:14,150
[MALE A]
Don't lose her!

102
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,275
[MALE D]
What do we do?

103
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:16,942

Great, now we've lost her!

104

[YU-NO]
Papa, there you are!

106
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,900
[TAKUYA yelps]

107
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,733
[YU-NO]
Hey, are you taking a bath?

108
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:27,733
Can I get in there with you?

109
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:32,525
Daddy needs a little privacy
while he takes a bath, sweetie.

110
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:35,150
[TAKUYA]
Yu-No seemed to grow up so fast.

111
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:38,192
A little too fast,
if I'm being honest.

112
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:48,525
Uh! Whoa, did you see that?
She's standing on her own!

113
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:53,733
[TAKUYA] It was impossible to
believe how quickly she grew.

114
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:56,358
At just three months old,
she was running,

115
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:57,817
and then...

116
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:01,567
Uh? Good morning, Yu-No!

117
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,858
Mama! Papa!

118
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:05,650
I love you both!

119
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:08,358
I love you both so very much!

120
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:11,358
Whoa. She's talking already!

121
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,525
Sayless, did you hear that?

122
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:14,733
I love you, Mom!

123
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:16,442
[TAKUYA] Yu-No started
talking just six months

124
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:18,358
after she was born.

125
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:22,233
[TAKUYA] One year later, she
seemed about four years old,

126
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:25,858
and four years later,
she was about 16.

127
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,525
[TAKUYA grunts]

128
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:31,733
[TAKUYA]
Now I'm afraid she's gonna be

129
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:34,567
older than me
before too long.

130
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,733
[YU-NO]
Papa, can I ask you a question?

131
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:43,608
Why is it you won't
take a bath with me?

132
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:44,858
[TAKUYA]
Uh...

133
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:47,483
Do you not love me anymore?

134
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:48,817
Are you kidding me?

135
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,108
Of course that's not true,
what gave you that idea?

136
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,192
Good, then give me a big hug!

137
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,858
After all, you give Mom big
hugs all the time, right?

138
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:58,108
I've seen you together!

139
00:09:58,192 --> 00:10:02,483
Uh! Well, I mean, we do
a bit more than hug.

140
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:06,150
Hug!

141
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:11,400
Ah. Hug. Hug!

142
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:13,692
I'm glad you and Mom
are here for me.

143
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:15,692
I'm a very lucky girl.

144
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:18,358
[gasps] Hey, Yu-No.

145
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:19,775
[YU-NO]
Hm?

146
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:21,692
[TAKUYA]
How would you like a friend?

147
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:24,275
What is a friend?
Can you eat it?

148
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,775
[TAKUYA]
Nope, you can't eat friends.

149
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,233
Let's see, they're
kind of like... Uhm...

150
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:31,567
Comrades, I guess!

151
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,567
Comrades?

152
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,442
Yeah! The ones you
hang out with.

153
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:39,108
The ones who get you through.

154
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:41,442
They're always there,
through thick and thin.

155
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:44,150
And you laugh and cry together.

156
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:48,358
[YU-NO]
Papa?

157
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:51,317
Uh. Sorry, what was
I talkin' about?

158
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,858
[YU-NO] We were talking
about eating friends.

00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:12,608
maybe I can cross
the desert, too.

320
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:15,358
But what about my life here?

321
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:17,858
What about Sayless and Yu-No?

322
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:33,025
Hey, what's wrong? Eat too much?

323
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,400
No.

324
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,192
Huh? Did something happen?

325
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:42,358
Papa, listen. I have
something to say.

326
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,483
[TAKUYA]
You know I'll hear anything

327
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:46,192
you have to tell me, princess.

328
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:50,442
It's just that... my heart
feels like it's fluttering.

329
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:53,608
Did you fall in love with
a prince or something?

330
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,233
That's not it.

331
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:56,983
Then what is it?

332
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:02,567
Never mind, it's not important.

333
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,983
Forget it.

334
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,983
Little guy really does
eat a lot, doesn't he?

335
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:22,150
At this rate, we're gonna
be out here all night.

336
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:27,108
[TAKUYA]
Uh...

337
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:28,900
That's...

338
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,442
They came back here to see us!

339
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,233
Come on, let's go!

340
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:37,025
Not yet. Look at him,
he's still really hungry.

341
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,192
[TAKUYA]
All right, I'll go alone, then.

342
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:41,775
Be careful on your way back!

343
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:43,150
'Kay.

344
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:46,067
[TAKUYA panting]

345
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:54,358
[GUARD F]
Find out if she's a virgin!

346
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:56,317
[GUARD G]
Do not resist us!

347
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,692
[GUARD F]
Hold her down!

348
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,233
[GUARD G] Priestess or not,
the rules are absolute!

349
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:02,025
[TAKUYA]
Sayless!

350
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:04,025
[GUARD G]
So, it was a man!

351
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:04,900
Takuya!

352
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:06,150
[GUARDS gasping]

353
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:07,525
[MALE H]
She's speaking, too!

354
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:11,567
Takuya, run! Get out of here!

355
00:23:44,108 --> 00:23:48,025
