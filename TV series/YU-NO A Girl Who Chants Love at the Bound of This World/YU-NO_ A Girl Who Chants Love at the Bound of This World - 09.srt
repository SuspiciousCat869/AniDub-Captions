can narrow the list down.

Okay, let's think.

They'd have to have
something against Mio.

They'd have to be connected
to the high school somehow.

And maybe they would benefit
from Mio going away?

00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,275
I don't think I'll make
it home till later.

160
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:03,400
Why don't you order out
for dinner tonight, okay?

161
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:04,567
[TAKUYA]
Yeah, no problem.

162
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,400
Don't stress yourself
out too much.

163
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:09,942
Things sound like they're
gettin' pretty crazy.

164
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:11,192
[AYUMI]
Don't worry.

165
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:14,108
The executives are the
ones under fire, not me.

166
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,608
There's nothing I can
do about it, either way.

167
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:19,358
I'll just have to wait
and see how it plays out.

168
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:21,483
I didn't catch it all,
but it sounds like the news

169
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,983
was talking about the
lightning strike stuff, too?

170
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:25,858
Also under control.

171
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:29,150
I spent a lot of time talking
to the affected families.

172
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:32,817
It's slow-moving, but we're
headed in the right direction.

173
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,400
That's great.

174
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:37,442
[AYUMI] Anyway, instead
of worrying about me,

175
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:39,108
maybe you should
look out for Mio?

176
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:43,192
Uh. Okay, but how do
you know about Mio?

177
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:46,317
Remember? You brought
her to the house one time.

178
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,108
She was really cute,
so she stuck out in my mind.

179
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,233
I thought you two
might be going out,

180
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:54,192
but I didn't want
to say anything.

181
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:57,108
[TAKUYA]
Uh... No, we're just friends.

182
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:58,900
[AYUMI]
Really...?

183
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,150
[TAKUYA]
Yes, really.

184
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:02,775
Then, as her friend,

185
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:05,858
try to do what you can to
help her out, all right?

186
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,317
[TAKUYA]
No problem.

187
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,442
[AYUMI]
See you later.

188
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:09,817
[TAKUYA]
Yeah.

189
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:16,275
[TAKUYA] It's probably better
if I go see her in person.

190
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:22,858
[TAKUYA]
Well, so much for that.

191
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:27,608
Not even my charming
personality will get me in.

192
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:30,983
Hey there! So we meet again!

193
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,108
It's cause you stick
your nose everywhere.

194
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:35,650
Now, be honest with me.

195
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:37,233
Did you know the
mayor was corrupt

196
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:38,983
before the news even broke?

197
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,358
Maybe.

198
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:41,775
[KAORI]
Heh, heh, heh.

199
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:44,275
I had a feeling
that was the case.

200
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:45,817
[TAKUYA]
Hm?

201
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,692
[KAORI]
Over here.

202
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,317
What is it?

203
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,608
This scandal is turning
into a disaster.

204
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:53,483
And it's not going to be pretty
for your classmate, either.

205
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:54,900
If you had come to me first,

206
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,317
I would've made sure the
story was handled better.

207
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,317
[YUKI]
Boss!

208
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,108
[panting]

209
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,108
Is something wrong?

210
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:07,108
[YUKI]
It's Shimazu. We need to talk!

211
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:08,775
She ran away from home?

212
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:12,233
[YUKI] Yeah. I heard
from one of their maids.

213
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:14,733
[YUKI] I'm a friend of Mio's.
Is she home?

214
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:20,192
No, she... Uh. Keep this is a
secret, but maybe you can help.

215
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:27,067
I'm useless, but I thought
maybe you'd know what to do.

216
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,775
It hasn't been that long--
I doubt she's gone far.

217
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:31,692
Let's split up and search!

218
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,650
[YUKI]
Boss...

219
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:37,275
I'll head over to the school,
then look along the coast.

220
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,525
'Kay. I'll check around
downtown, I guess.

221
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:44,108
Good! We'll meet in front
of the school in two hours.

222
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:45,317
[YUKI]
Got it!

223
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,817
Not at school, huh?

224
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,192
[MITSUKI]
Takuya?

225
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:05,275
Is something wrong?

226
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,400
[MITSUKI]
I see. That's not good.

227
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:12,775
[TAKUYA] No kidding.
Anyway, I need to get going.

228
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:15,733
[MITSUKI]
Wait. Let me help you find her.

229
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:18,567
Just tell me where
to go and I'll do it.

230
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,442
Listen she was my student
when I was a substitute.

231
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:25,108
I need to do whatever
I can to help her, 'kay?

232
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:27,275
I mean, sure!

233
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:31,483
'Kay, then. Why don't you search
the area around Meiunji park?

234
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:32,775
Will do.

235
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:33,942
[TAKUYA]
We're supposed to meet

236
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:35,983
in front of the school
in about an hour.

237
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:37,150
[MITSUKI]
You got it.

238
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,567
[TAKUYA]
Thank you!

239
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,858
[groaning]

240
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,108
[inaudible]

241
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:25,483
[TAKUYA]
Hey! Mio!

242
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:29,025
[KANNA]
Arima.

243
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:32,817
[TAKUYA] Kanna.
Have you seen Mio anywhere?

244
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
[KANNA]
Unfortunately, yes.

245
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:36,817
I tried to warn her,
but as usual,

246
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,067
she wasn't willing to listen.
She went to a dangerous place.

247
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,025
[TAKUYA]
Ah, don't tell me...

248
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:47,817
[KANNA]
Be careful.

249
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,192
[gasps] Yeah, sure! Thank you!

250
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:58,317
[YUKI]
Huh? Ms. Ichijo?

251
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,150
I heard the story from Arima.
I'm here to help.

252
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,233
[YUKI]
I see.

253
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:04,442
So I take it you
haven't found Shimazu?

254
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:06,025
[YUKI]
'Fraid not.

255
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:07,650
[TAKUYA]
Hey!

256
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,317
Uh. What's up?

257
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,150
[TAKUYA]
I know where Mio went.

258
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:13,483
Well, let's hear it, then.

259
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,692
[panting]

260
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,983
She's Inside Mt. Sankaku.

261
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:30,317
Why would she go in there
at a time like this?

262
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,858
She's leaving soon.

263
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:35,025
She probably thought this was
her last chance to explore.

264
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,442
It's just like I thought.

265
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:50,150
There was a cave down here
and nobody even knew?

266
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:53,108
Mio's the one who found it.

267
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:56,192
[YUKI] Does that mean
she went in there alone?

268
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:58,025
[TAKUYA]
We better hurry.

269
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:00,150
You're right, time is a factor.

270
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,817
It hasn't been made public yet,
but they'll be resuming

271
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,775
construction at the work
site tomorrow morning.

272
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,525
After all those accidents?

273
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,692
The point is, the police
could get involved.

274
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:11,567
That's bad for everyone.

275
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,692
Then we'll just have to settle
this mess before morning.

276
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:17,192
You've explored old ruins
before, correct?

277
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,317
Sure, a long time ago.

278
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,067
'Kay, then. You and I
can search inside.

279
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,817
Yuki will hold down the fort.

280
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,442
Wait a second! Take me!
I can't just wait out here!

281
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:32,317
Sure you can. Someone has to,
in case this all goes south.

282
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,150
That's not what I mean!

283
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:37,358
What I'm trying to say is...

284
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:39,317
...this is all my fault!

285
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,608
I'm the only reason
we're out here!

286
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:45,150
So, please! Will you just
let me help you fix this?!

287
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,233
I see. Well, that's
one mystery solved.

288
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:53,858
Those papers on
the bulletin board

289
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:57,025
at school this morning...
were mine!

290
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:58,275
[gasps]

291
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:02,192
[YUKI] I was walking in front
the nurse's office last night.

292
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:06,692
And, just by coincidence, I
heard you and Shimazu talking.

293
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:10,775
Then, I just... I lost it.
I don't know.

294
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:13,900
My head was messed up.
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:17,817
[YUKI cries]

296
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,067
You're not crazy. You just let
jealousy get the better of you.

297
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,025
[gasps]

298
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:26,317
[TAKUYA]
I can't believe this.

299
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,108
[YUKI gasps, groans]

300
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,400
[TAKUYA]
You're better than that.

301
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,525
[YUKI]
I know, it was stupid.

302
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:39,233
I thought Shimazu was over you

303
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:41,192
and maybe she would
love me instead.

304
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:43,150
So when all of that
came crashing down,

305
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,400
I didn't know what to do.

306
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:51,400
[coughs] Heh, but that's
a crappy excuse, I know.

307
00:18:51,483 --> 00:18:54,942
I'm sorry. That's all I can say.

308
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:58,317
[YUKI cries]

309
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:01,942
[TAKUYA]
The inside of Mt. Sankaku

310
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:04,025
has never been
investigated before.

311
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,650
So we don't know what could
be waiting for us in there.

312
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:12,483
In fact, we don't even know
if Mio is safe or not.

313
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:16,692
But listen. All that matters
is that we bring Mio back.

314
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:21,108
And we will! Then, as soon as
we do, you'll apologize to her.

315
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:22,817
You got that?

316
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,067
Got it.

317
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,817
Sorry, Mitsuki. Looks like
I'm gonna have to ask you

318
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,650
to stay out here.
You better not screw this up.

319
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,650
[gasps]

320
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:34,067
Give it your best.

321
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,192
You still trust me?

322
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,067
I'm just giving you a chance
to clean up your own mess.

323
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,067
Thanks, Takuya. I mean, Boss!

324
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,608
Would you stop calling
me that already?

325
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,817
Listen, you two.

326
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,775
If run into anything dangerous,
then get out immediately.

327
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:59,608
Like we said before, tomorrow
morning is our deadline.

328
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:01,692
If you're not back then,
I'm calling the cops.

329
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:03,358
Understood.

330
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:08,067
You ready?

331
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,442
Yeah.

332
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:32,733
I didn't expect the air
in here to be so damp.

333
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:33,900
[YUKI gasps]

334
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,233
It's an underground stream,
not sea water.

335
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:38,317
You're really good
at this stuff, Boss!

336
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,150
Guess that's no surprise,
since your dad was an explorer!

337
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,942
[TAKUYA]
Historian, actually.

338
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:43,775
[rumbling]

339
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,400
[gasps]

340
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:47,317
Something moved.

341
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,650
It's quiet now.

342
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,150
You think Shimazu might
be in trouble down here?

343
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:57,358
No point in discussing it.
Let's hurry.

344
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,400
What's that?

345
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,650
Looks like a cage.

346
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,192
[TAKUYA]
Get back.

347
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:25,442
O-Okay.

348
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:27,317
Just don't do anything stupid.

349
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,817
Have some faith, will ya?

350
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:35,942
[gasps] I think I did
something stupid!

351
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:38,150
[TAKUYA]
That didn't take long!

352
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:44,025
[BOTH gasping]

353
00:21:44,108 --> 00:21:46,817
There's no way Mother
Nature made this, right?

354
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,400
It's like a machine.

355
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:50,650
[YUKI] But everything in here
is carved out of the mountain.

356
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,317
What's going on?

357
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,192
[YUKI yelps]

358
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,733
[TAKUYA]
What is this place?

359
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:47,900
