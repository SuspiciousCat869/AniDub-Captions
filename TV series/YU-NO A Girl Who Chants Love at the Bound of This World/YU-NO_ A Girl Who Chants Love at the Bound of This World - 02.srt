1
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,458
[TAKUYA]
So weird.

2
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,666
It felt like Ayumi and Ryuzoji
were telling the truth.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,333
So, was it all a dream?

4
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,625
The girl? And that gun?

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,208
No. I know it had to be real.

6
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,833
Okay.

7
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,458
[TAKUYA]
Yup, back where it was.

8
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,125
[TAKUYA]
One more time!

9
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:48,375
Whoa. It seems like what
I carry stays with me.

10
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,625
[KODAI]
Takuya.

11
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,958
Tell me, what is history?

12
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,416
Did you really call me
in here to ask me that?

13
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,416
[KODAI]
Answer the question.

14
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,041
History is the sum
of everything

15
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,875
the human race has
done up till now.

16
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,208
[KODAI] Heh. A surprisingly
old-fashioned view.

17
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,291
It's been said that
history is the memory

18
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,291
of how things have
changed throughout time.

19
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,791
But the reality is,

20
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,916
history is the memory of
the process of change.

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,166
What does that mean?

22
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,791
"History" has quite
a broad application.

23
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,500
It can refer to the
changes to time itself.

24
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,625
Not that I expect your
flea-sized brain

25
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,583
to comprehend
something like that.

26
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,250
You trying to pick
a fight with me?

27
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,333
[KODAI] For instance,
let's say I wondered

28
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,041
what would happen if I hadn't
eaten this piece of cake,

29
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,375
so I went several minutes
back in time to find out.

30
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,416
Call it a thought experiment.

31
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,125
What do you think
would happen then?

32
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,041
Anyone would have
the same answer.

33
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,000
They'd say that you'd just
create a new history,

34
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,541
where you didn't eat the cake.

35
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,750
Well, then everyone
would be wrong.

36
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,291
Lemme ask you a question.

37
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,250
In this scenario, what
happened to the initial impetus

38
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,083
that led me to go back in time?

39
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,000
I mean... You went back

40
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,708
in time because you ate
the cake, isn't that right?

41
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:59,666
So, if you never ate it
in the first place... Huh.

42
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,416
[KODAI] Right. The initial
reason I made the choice

43
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,708
to go back wouldn't
simply disappear.

44
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,416
So, if I eat the cake,

45
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,500
then choose to go
back into the past,

46
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,083
then, a world where I don't
eat the cake is born.

47
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,916
And all three of these truths
are carved into history.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,375
[TAKUYA] "The Reflector Device
is an object that allows one

49
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,750
to move to another,
parallel world."

50
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,291
"Don't be mistaken, though,

51
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,500
it's a different beast
than a 'time machine'."

52
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,375
Uh.

53
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,791
Ouch. Oh, not again.

54
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,625
Is it a side effect from
using this thing too much?

55
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,666
Uh-- Ah!

56
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,625
Hey, Kanna! Were you
watching all of that?

57
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,583
[KANNA]
Depends what you mean by "that."

58
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,583
[laughs] Well, I assume that's
a "no," which is just fine.

59
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,333
See ya later.

60
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,000
Summer break starts tomorrow.

61
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,500
I want you to work as hard
at having fun as you do

62
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,833
at your studies.

63
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,416
You all better go and have
the time of your lives.

64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,083
[bell tolls]

65
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:02,583
[YUKI] Hey, why're we making
a diorama of Sakaimachi?

66
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,708
Doesn't seem very historical.

67
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,500
We're doing it
because Doctor Arima

68
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,250
always believed
that the city itself

69
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,541
actually hid a significant
historical mystery.

70
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,916
Then there's Mount Sankaku.
What do you think about it?

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,041
[YUKI] Hm... Well, it's kind of
a weird mountain to begin with.

72
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,416
That's true.

73
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,083
It's hard to believe that
erosion from sea winds

74
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,666
could make a shape like that.

75
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,041
And the geology...

76
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,166
Hey.

77
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,416
Uh. Arima, what're
you doing here?

78
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Do you wanna join
the club after all?

79
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,458
No I just had a question.

80
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,250
I came in here yesterday,
didn't I?

81
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,625
Uh, yeah.

82
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,833
I remember it perfectly
because you came in

83
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,250
right as we were talking
about Doctor Arima.

84
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,750
Oh, that's right!

85
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,166
You asked if you could borrow
his dad's research notes.

86
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,375
[TAKUYA]
I see.

87
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,208
Somethin' wrong there, Boss?

88
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,375
Nope. I just wanted to check.

89
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,041
Lemme borrow your phone.

90
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,250
Wait a second!
Asking would've been nice!

91
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:01,333
[TAKUYA]
Yeah, sorry. It's urgent.

92
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,458
Hello?

93
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,583
Hey, Takuya, you okay?

94
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,083
[TAKUYA]
You were talking with Ryuzoji

95
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,333
this morning at school, right?

96
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,750
What happened with my
dad's research notes?

97
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,833
Well, I promised that
I would send them

98
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,500
to him as soon as I could.

99
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,541
[TAKUYA] Hmm. So that
hasn't changed, then.

100
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,208
Nothing! Never mind.

101
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,583
[AYUMI] Actually, I'm glad
you reminded me.

102
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,625
If you don't mind,
I'd like your help with that.

103
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,166
Help with what?

104
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,208
[AYUMI] Kodai's notes have a
lot of random personal things

105
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,000
mixed in. So, it would be
super helpful if you could

106
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,125
sort through them before
the delivery people come.

107
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,541
A-Ah. You want me
to go through his notes?

108
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,250
The whole room?

109
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,250
I'm afraid so.

110
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,625
Hey, Chief.

111
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,791
[AYUMI] Uh. One sec. Sorry,
things are crazy here.

112
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,666
I understand. I'll do it.

113
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,875
[exhales]

114
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,666
[YUKI] Aw, Boss, you're
such a good stepson.

115
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,416
You're gonna have to
help me with this.

116
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,541
[YUKI]
What?! Why me?!

117
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,875
[MIO]
I'll do it! I'd love to.

118
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,125
[TAKUYA, YUKI]
Uh.

119
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,791
I know everything about
Doctor Arima's research.

120
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,166
Nobody's better suited than
me to go through his things

121
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,541
and say what's part of
his work and what's not.

122
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,333
Whaddaya think?
Will you let me help?

123
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,125
Sure, that's fine, I guess.

124
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,750
'Cept it means we'll need
to hang out all alone.

125
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,333
[YUKI gasps] Great! I'll
be joining you, then!

126
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,250
You saw that special on
the paranormal, right?

127
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,500
They covered our city!
It was so cool!

128
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,833
Yeah, of course!

129
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,625
Did you hear them explain
the whole curse thing?

130
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,958
About how the police kept
getting strange reports

131
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,041
that people were being attacked
by a headless monster.

132
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,708
[MIO] And then, there was
all the craziness when they

133
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,791
actually found a torso
with no head or limbs.

134
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,916
And those missing parts
still have yet to be found.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,666
The most likely theory is
that it's a mountain cat.

136
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,333
I've heard other theories.

137
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,166
My favorite one is zombies.

138
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,916
For real! Last night, people
were saying it was aliens!

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,333
So ridiculous.

140
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,833
Those lightning strikes,
and then the curse.

141
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,416
There sure is a lot of
weird stuff going on.

142
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,791
You never change, do you, Mio?

143
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,500
You're all about history
and the paranormal!

144
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:04,208
I'm interested in both from a
purely scientific perspective.

145
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,333
Solving this is our
duty as members

146
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,041
of the Historical Research Club!

147
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,416
Right!

148
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,666
[TAKUYA sighs]

149
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,750
[clock ticks]

150
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,833
[gasps]

151
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,333
Hey, everything okay, Boss?

152
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:28,583
Uh? Yeah, totally, I'm good.

153
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,333
Hey, if you happen
to find any porn

154
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,333
while you're digging
around, I call dibs.

155
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:36,083
Though, I'd be shocked if Dad
and I had the same taste.

156
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,000
[MIO]
Wow, another one.

157
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,666
Hey, Arima? Would
it be okay with you

158
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,750
if I made some copies before
we sent this off to Ryuzoji?

159
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,375
Yeah, sure. I don't care.

160
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,541
How about these? Want 'em?

161
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,250
[TAKUYA] Yep, put fragile
stuff over there.

162
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,625
Got it.

163
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,583
[TAKUYA]
Hm?

164
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,291
Knew it. He never did
stop researching.

165
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,000
He kept studying the
400 Year Cycle Theory.

166
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,750
[YUKI]
Four hundred year cycle?

167
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,708
What is that?

168
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:14,666
It's a fascinating concept.

169
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,666
Basically, it's a famous theory
Doctor Arima proposed.

170
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,208
Although, it's less a theory
and more the fantasy

171
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,583
of a delusional lunatic.

172
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,916
This theory has remained
completely original, even today.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,833
Yeah, so "original," in fact,

174
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,875
that his academic
society disowned him.

175
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,708
[sighs] Why do I try
to talk to you?

176
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,625
If only Dr. Arima were here,
maybe he could break through

177
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,333
that thick skull of yours
and drive in some sense.

178
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,083
Hey, I feel the same way.

179
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,416
I'm still pretty sure I owe
him a big punch in the jaw.

180
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,958
The way he up and died on me.

181
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,791
[gasps] I'm sorry.

182
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,416
That was insensitive.

183
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,833
Listen don't even
sweat it, okay?

184
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,166
I know when you get really
excited about something

185
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,583
you kinda lose track of
what's going on around you.

186
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,875
Uh.

187
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,916
[YUKI]
Cool, so...

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,583
Anyone gonna explain
the 400-year thing?

189
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,583
Oh. My dad's theory was
that Japan undergoes

190
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:13,041
a revolution of sorts
every 400 years.

191
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,708
Around the year 1600,

192
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,833
the Edo Shogunate
was established.

193
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,208
Before that in 1200,
they established

194
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,791
the Kamakura Shogunate.

195
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,958
In the year 800, they moved
the capital to Kyoto.

196
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,416
And it was about 400 when the
Yamato court unified Japan

197
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,458
under its control.

198
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,541
[MIO] It's important to remember
that in each case,

199
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,666
the revolution was brought
by outsiders to Japan.

200
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,041
That part isn't written
in the official histories.

201
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,416
[TAKUYA]
My dad's theory was that

202
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,208
even the ancient
nations of Japan

203
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,375
and our unique culture were
originally brought here

204
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,500
by people outside
of the country.

205
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,375
Of course, he got lots of
complaints from the right.

206
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,583
The details are all
written here, in <i>Legacy</i> .

207
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,833
That book looks
very intimidating.

208
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,416
You're a part of the
Historical Research Club now,

209
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,333
so I really hope
that you'll read it!

210
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,958
'Course! Your wish is
my command, Shimazu!

211
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:07,291
That thing's out of print,
you know. He won't find it.

212
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,375
I have some.

213
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,458
For reading, for collecting,

214
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,958
and for lending them out
to those who are in need.

215
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,958
I see.

216
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,083
[YUKI] Man! Can't believe
we're finally done.

217
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,708
Yep, and we never
found any porn.

218
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,083
Hey, look, it's still light out.
Let's go to Mount Sankaku!

219
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:28,500
Huh? You've got way too
much energy, Shimazu.

220
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,625
What could we even
do there this late?

221
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,625
We could do that thing I told
you about before, obviously.

222
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:37,041
When was this? Like, back when
you used to pee the bed?

223
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,791
Uh. I never did that!

224
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,541
Uh. You sure? Not even
when you were little?

225
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,083
Of course. Yes,
I did back then.

226
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,208
Dang it! How'd you
get me to confess?!

227
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,500
Uh. It's time to investigate
Mount Sankaku, right?

228
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,500
Well, let's go!
C'mon, we can do this!

229
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,125
All right, there she is!
Mount Sankaku!

230
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,041
This is pretty dang exciting!

231
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,125
[MIO]
Yeah, it is.

232
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,833
Why? Don't you think so, too?

233
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,500
Of course I do.

234
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,875
[door creaks]

235
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:14,250
We're screwed if the foreman
sees us. Let's hurry.

236
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,833
Hold on, isn't that...?

237
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,875
[TAKUYA]
Hey.

238
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,750
This place is dangerous.

239
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,833
You really should
stay away from here.

240
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,041
[TAKUYA]
If it's so dangerous,

241
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,000
shouldn't you be
avoiding it, too?

242
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,250
Fine, goodbye, then.

243
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:48,291
Hold on a sec, Hatano.
What exactly are you doing here?

244
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,750
[KANNA]
I'm enjoying the fresh air.

245
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,666
We could all see
you doing something.

246
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,125
The question is what
that something was.

247
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,375
[KANNA] I didn't feel well,
so I was sitting down.

248
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,708
That's all.

249
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,958
Hatano, are you
hiding something?

250
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,791
How do I even answer that?

251
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,375
Tell me what you want me
to say and I'll say it.

252
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,666
Look, that's not how it is.

253
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,583
[MIO]
Did you leave these?

254
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,333
They're always here when I come.

255
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,916
I wondered who
was bringing them.

256
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,166
You can answer that question
with a yes or no, can't you?

257
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,791
[TAKUYA]
Mio, wait.

258
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,416
Well, goodbye, then.

259
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,541
Where're you going?!

260
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,791
Hey, knock it off.

261
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,250
I don't have time for this crap.

262
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,166
Are you attracted to her?

263
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,291
[MIO] Look, Hatano
isn't a good choice.

264
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,791
What are you talking about?

265
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,083
It's just that there are
some rumors going around

266
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,541
about her right now, that's all.

267
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,833
Like, what do you mean?

268
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,166
[YUKI] Futago Rock really does
have a weird shape, doesn't it?

269
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,958
Scientists did radiometric
dating on it once,

270
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,625
and they discovered that
it's somewhere around

271
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,041
8,000 years old.
Pretty incredible, huh?

272
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,041
Whoa, 8,000?

273
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,666
[TAKUYA] That writing's
older than the four

274
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,750
ancient civilizations?

275
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,875
[MIO] Radiometric dating has
never been perfect, though.

276
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,416
Something as simple as a meteor
falling can change the results.

277
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,750
[YUKI]
Huh.

278
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,750
Anyway, all we're sure of
is that we know nothing

279
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,708
about Mount Sankaku.

280
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,083
Hang on, you guys, calm down!

281
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,125
Another man got
injured two days ago!

282
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,000
You expect us to keep working
in these conditions?

283
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,500
Look, I'm only doing what the
company tells me to do, okay?

284
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,250
You're the one who told us to
move those rocks, you jackass!

285
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,625
No! [groans]

286
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,166
Those were Chief
Arima's orders!

287
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,458
[WORKER 2A]
We're wasting our time.

288
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,833
[WORKER 2B] Let's go
talk to Geotech directly.

289
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,250
[WORKERS]
Yeah.

290
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,291
I try to play nice and
they act like assholes.

291
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,125
[TAKUYA]
Hey.

292
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,500
Uh?

293
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,791
Sounds like you've been
feeding them a line of crap.

294
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,125
[TOYOTOMI]
Oh, it's you!

295
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,666
Sorry, not sure what you mean.
Care to elaborate?

296
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,708
You just lied about
Ayumi being the one

297
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,416
to order them to
move those rocks.

298
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,458
[TOYOTOMI] Hmph. If I
hadn't said something,

299
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,333
those thugs would've
bashed my head in.

300
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,416
You're a piece of work.

301
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,625
Who is that?

302
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,541
Right, this is Ass-Hat.
He works with Ayumi.

303
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,708
"Toyotomi."

304
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,458
He films sad clown porn.

305
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,083
I run a construction site!

306
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,541
Bet you told them to do it
without getting her "okay."

307
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,416
Oh, yeah, you got any proof?

308
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,625
[TAKUYA]
Not yet.

309
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,041
But I'm pretty sure
that's how it went down.

310
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,041
Let's say it was true. Even if
I did, it's still really her

311
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,166
responsibility because
she's my boss, right?

312
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,208
So the buck slides past me
and lands right with her.

313
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,833
You piece of shit.

314
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:35,958
[TOYOTOMI]
What did you say?

315
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,041
Don't worry about it.

316
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,666
[TOYOTOMI]
You meddling kids better not

317
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,166
have been up there on
Mount Sankaku, you got it?

318
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,541
That place is
strictly off-limits.

319
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,416
That's not true.
Mount Sankaku is a public space.

320
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,083
They've already finished
their investigation

321
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,500
of the lightning strikes.

322
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,083
[TOYOTOMI]
I'm sorry, miss.

323
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,041
But it's under Geotech's
authority now.

324
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,083
It's dangerous.
We're tearing down Futago Rock

325
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,583
when we expand
the construction site.

326
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,916
[gasps] But you can't do that!

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,041
Those are historic landmarks
and should be declared

328
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,666
an Important Cultural Property
by the government!

329
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,958
Well, if you don't like it,

330
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,916
you're free to sue
just like anyone else.

331
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,083
Mayor Shimazu's already
given his permission,

332
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,458
and the legal application
paperwork is almost complete.

333
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,958
Will you at least explain
why you're tearing it down?

334
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,916
Company secret, I'm afraid.

335
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,541
Which means I can't tell you.

336
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,541
[MIO] So you've given
no proper reason,

337
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,500
and all you need is
the support of the mayor?

338
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,333
That isn't right, and it
shouldn't be allowed to happen!

339
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,458
Ugh. Who the heck
are you, anyway?

340
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,958
I am Mio Shimazu.
I'm the mayor's daughter.

341
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,000
You're the mayor's daughter?!

342
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,541
Uh-- Hey, listen.

343
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,375
I'm just doing what the company
tells me to, you know?

344
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,291
Anyway, it's really only
a matter of time

345
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,458
before the City
Council approves.

346
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,041
Democracy is all
about the process.

347
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,666
You need to get approval
before, not after.

348
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,708
[TOYOTOMI]
I don't know what to tell you.

349
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,916
I am personally going to talk
to my father about this.

350
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,416
Oh! Woulddya look at the time,
I've gotta be somewhere!

351
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,333
Bye!

352
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,166
Remember, in the end,
the good guys always win!

353
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,291
Uh?

354
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,291
[TOYOTOMI]
Ooh!

355
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,875
[TAKUYA]
What's his deal?

356
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,791
[MIO]
I'll ask my dad about it.

357
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,583
But since time is
of the essence,

358
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,791
we should continue
our investigation.

359
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,875
[YUKI]
Right.

360
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,541
Yuki, think you could
walk Mio home?

361
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,750
Leave it to me!

362
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,708
The cheap hotels are
that way, by the way.

363
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,666
Uh!

364
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,041
[door clicks]

365
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,333
[TAKUYA]
I'm home.

366
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:34,458
[AYUMI] Takuya. Unfortunately,
I'll be home late again tonight.

367
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,875
Please go ahead
and eat without me.

368
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,041
Mother, you know how much
I love you, right?

369
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,500
[ACTRESS 2A]
Don't say that.

370
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,708
I know I'm not your real mom,
but you and I can't--

371
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,416
[ACTOR 2A]
So what? I don't care!

372
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,958
[ACTRESS 2A]
But what about your father?

373
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,958
I could never betray him.

374
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,375
[TAKUYA]
Excuse me?

375
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,291
What could I possibly help
you with at this hour?

376
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,041
[TAKUYA]
My name is Takuya Arima.

377
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,291
I want to get in touch
with my stepmom, Ayumi.

378
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,916
Well, then, I'm afraid
you've missed her.

379
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,791
She left not too long ago.

380
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,166
[TAKUYA]
Where'd she go?

381
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,166
I can't tell anybody that,
not even her stepson.

382
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,958
[TAKUYA]
Please, I'm begging!

383
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,166
Besides, I know you're the type
who takes this job seriously.

384
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,125
Not the type who
watches TV at work.

385
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,625
[ACTOR 2A]
Mother!

386
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:47,416
[clears throat] She was
on her way to a meeting.

387
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,708
A scientific equipment
leasing corporation

388
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,291
in the warehouse
district at the port.

389
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,166
[AYUMI screams]

390
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,333
Uh. Ayumi?

391
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,333
Who are you and
what do you want?

392
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,083
[MAN 2A] Just like we
said on the phone.

393
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,958
We're repairmen with
the leasing company.

394
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,041
You really think
I'd believe that?!

395
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,291
Didn't anyone ever tell you not
to judge a book by its cover?

396
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,166
Look, lady, let's just
get to it. Hand it over.

397
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,625
Hand what over?

398
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,208
[MAN 2B] Don't play dumb.
We want that research data.

399
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,375
[AYUMI] I don't get it.
Why are you doing this?

400
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,333
[MAN 2A]
Just hand it over, honey.

401
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,166
[MAN 2B] Unless you're
interested in getting hurt.

402
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,916
[TAKUYA]
Okay!

403
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,791
[door creaks]

404
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,125
[TAKUYA]
Hey!

405
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,041
[MEN]
Huh?

406
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,375
[AYUMI]
What're you doing here?

407
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,500
I came to make sure
you were okay.

408
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,000
Was this guy a part of
the script, or what?

409
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,041
I don't think he's
part of the show.

410
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,791
I've notified the police.

411
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,666
[MAN 2B]
Ha. You're bluffing.

412
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,833
In five minutes,
you'll find out.

413
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,583
In five minutes, you won't
have one unbroken bone

414
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,666
left in your body.

415

[AYUMI]
Stop this! Please!

[AYUMI]
I'll give you the data, okay?

418
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,125
Here it is! But please,
just don't hurt him.

419
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,291
[TAKUYA] Ayumi, no! You don't
need to give that to them!

420
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,125
Takuya, listen to me.

421
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,125
Don't do anything crazy.

422
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,916
Please!

423
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,833
I say you put this kid
out of your head

424
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,416
and move on with
your life, lady.

425
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,958
We're so much more fun
to hang out with.

426
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,125
You haven't had
a man in a while.

00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,416
I can tell by the
look on your face.

Yeah. It's time for Round Two.

to get out of here.
