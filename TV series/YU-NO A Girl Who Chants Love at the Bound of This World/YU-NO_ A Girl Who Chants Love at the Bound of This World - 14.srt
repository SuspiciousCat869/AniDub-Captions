00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,958
[KODAI] Takuya, your history,
like everyone else's,

2
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,916
is carved into
the Tree of Vrinda.

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,666
[KODAI]
Creating history

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,666
means traveling through
infinite possibilities.

5
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,458
[KODAI] This might come
as a surprise to you,

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:33,000
but not a single thing you've
done is without meaning.

7
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,500
Events that are bound
by the laws of causality

8
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,916
flow like a river,
smoothly and organically,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,500
in direct accordance with
their event elements.

10
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:47,208
Nothing, not even time itself,
can break this particular law.

11
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,875
At least, that's what I thought,

12
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:52,666
until I finally learned
of their existence.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:58,250
Our time is almost up. Takuya,
we will see each other again.

14
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,708
[KODAI] It's been decided
by the weight of events,

15
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,083
the momentum of
the event elements.

16
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,750
If you prefer a more
literary phrasing,

17
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,125
it is, quite simply, our fate.

18
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,625
[STUDENTS chattering]

19
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,666
[TAKUYA]
Hey, Kanna!

20
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,291
I'd like to get to
know you a little better.

21
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,708
I'm not really sure what to say.

22
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,791
This is kind of sudden.

23
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:02,291
Oh, that's right. I forgot we've
barely spoken in this world.

24
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,333
Something wrong?

25
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,333
[TAKUYA]
Nope! Nothing at all.

26
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,583
I just think it's time we
got to know each other.

27
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:12,083
Check it out. Arima's hitting
on the ice princess.

28
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,750
She does have a weird
sexiness about her, right?

29
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,791
[STUDENT 14A]
Yeah, I admit, I get it.

[TAKUYA]
Hey, wait up!

32
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,041
What're your plans today?

33
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,541
I need to speak to Takeda
about something.

34
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,041
What about after that?

35
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,041
Nothing, really, I guess.

36
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,041
So, uh... Got any hobbies?

37
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,333
[KANNA]
No, none.

38
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,916
[TAKUYA]
Favorite band?

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,500
[KANNA]
I don't listen to music.

40
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,625
[TAKUYA] Well, surely you
have a favorite food?

41
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,000
[KANNA]
Nope.

42
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,833
[TAKUYA] Okay, help me out,
here. What're you into?

43
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:52,666
[KANNA]
Green. I like plants a lot.

44
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,750
I thought the ocean
was more your thing.

45
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,583
You know, because of
the way you watch it.

46
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,458
Not a fan of the sea.

47
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:04,208
It just happens to be
my responsibility.

48
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,250
Responsibility?

49
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,708
Are you all right?

50
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,375
I'm fine.

crazy. I gotta do something.

Damn it! Where is that total
slacker of a teacher?

58
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:50,833
I'll do it. I'll wipe
you down, Kanna.

59
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,000
And I won't look! So help me,
I refuse to look!

60

I'm doing this out
of medical necessity.

It's a tough job but
somebody's gotta do it.

Sometimes, I get these fevers.

But lately, it feels
like it's been

73
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,458
happening even more than usual.

Yeah, I guess so.

This'll sound weird, but I've
seen your necklace before.

I just wish I could
remember where.

79
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:16,125
Maybe it's what they refer
to as "déjà vu" in psychology.

80
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,375
I could've seen it somewhere
with my dad at some point.

Back when I was a kid,

82

he used to drag me all
over the place with him.

Your father, he passed away
not long ago, right?

That must be hard.

who called himself a historian.

So, it is what it is.

do we have here?

where the hell you were?

to talk to us about?

anything about Hatano?

transferred here, right?

You've finally decided
to join our club! Hooray!

Yep, somethin' like that.

[TAKUYA]
Can we both join?

00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,875
Why exactly did you
bring her here with you?

117
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,791
I didn't realize that you two
were even really friends.

118
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,458
[TAKUYA] Eriko asked me to
look after her for a while.

119
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,833
She's been a little bit
sick and needs help.

A teacher asked you
to take care of a girl?

121
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,666
Of all the people in the world,

122
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,375
why would she leave it up
to a walking libido?

123
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,250
I don't know how you
dare say that about

124
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,125
a stand-up guy like myself.

Look, whatever. Yes,
of course you can join.

127
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,750
As a matter of fact,
you can help us

128

make this diorama
if you want... to...

129
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,208
It's incredibly well-made.

130
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,083
I know, right?!

131
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,916
Except, the terrain
right here is a little off.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,916
[YUKI, MIO]
Huh?!

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,166
[MIO] But it's just
like the photo, see?

134
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,416
Tell me this. How old would
you say that photo is?

135
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,291
I'd guess, maybe
about ten years old?

136
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,416
Exactly, it looks
a lot different now.

137
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,125
Huh?!

138
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,250
[KANNA] Sakaimachi's geology was
formed in the Cretaceous period

139
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,750
as part of the Nakaminato area.

140
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,208
But Mount Sankaku is made
of dried limestone,

141
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,166
so it's actually
more like a desert.

142
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,375
It changes. It shifts
with earthquakes

143
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,791
and things like that.

144
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,625

00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,208
Amazing.

00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,625
Hey! Y'know what else?

148
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,541
Fifteen years ago, there was
another part of Futago Rock.

149
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,875
Do you think we should go
check it out right now?

150
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,375
[TAKUYA] Sure, there's no use
sticking around here, anyway.

to calm down.

00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,000
where there are no guarantees
for our safety?

160
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,375
You're in danger!

161
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,250
[TOYOTOMI]
Uh. Listen, you can't--

162
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,875
You have to call off
the hauling operation.

163
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,750
Are you one of the protestors?

164
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,833
No, I'm not.

165
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,250
Lemme guess, you gonna tell us

166
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,875
we angered the gods
or somethin'?

167
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,916
Another lightning
strike is coming.

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,125
What?

169
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,541
You don't know what
you're talking about.

170
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,625
Lightning strikes are
a natural phenomenon.

171
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,416
[KANNA] I'm saying this out
of concern for your safe--

172
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,208
Look, if you've got a problem,
take it to a judge.

173
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,166
They'll decide,
that's how things tend

174
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,166
to work in this country.
And who're you?

175
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,625
Go screw yourself.

176
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,125
[TOYOTOMI]
Oh, you're the slacker stepson

177
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,541
who's been causing problems
for my boss, aren't you?

178
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,083
Yeah, I know you, too.

179
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,750
How's the porn industry
been treating you?

180
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,708
I'm the man Geotech put
in charge of this site.

181
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:16,958
Then make them stop!

182
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,791
Let go of me!
This suit cost me a fortune!

183
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,791
[KANNA gasps]

184
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,000
[MIO]
Are you okay?

185
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,583
[TAKUYA]
Dude, you're an asshole.

186
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,958
Oh, give me a break, I was only
shaking her off me, that's all.

187
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,541
I paid 800 dollars for this suit

188
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,500
and she was wrinkling the micro
suede. It's dry clean only.

189
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,208
--[YUKI] You're a jerk.
--[rumbling]

190
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,125
[WORKER 11A]
You hear that, Toyotomi?

191
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,541
I think the girl was right;

192
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,583
I really don't like
the look of those clouds.

193
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,166
[WORKER 2B] Welp, it looks
like we'd better call it a day.

194
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,125
[TOYOTOMI]
W-Wait! Y-You can't!

195
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,333
[WORKER 11A] I'm sick of this
lousy job. Let's go grab a beer.

196
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,875
Thanks a lot! Hope you're
happy with what you've done!

197
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,916
Just get the hell
outta here. Now.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,166
There we go.

199
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,791
Those clouds are totally gone.

200
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,916
Like they were never even there.

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,833
[MIO]
You're right.

202
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,833
Yuki? Will you take Mio home?

203
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,958
I'm on it! What about you?

204
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,083
I'm gonna walk home with Kanna.

205
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,833
Huh? You're taking her?

206
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,458
[TAKUYA]
Yeah, why?

207
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,416
[MIO grumbles]
Hatano, look,

208
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,583
if he tries anything weird,
you can just hit him.

209
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,666
Okay, got it, thanks.

210
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,583
I would never!

00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,958
--[TAKUYA] See ya.
--[YUKI] Okay!

See you later.

00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,583
[KANNA]
Yes, goodbye.

214
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,500
[YUKI] Hey, we should get those
photos developed right away!

215

[MIO]
Good idea!

216
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,375
So, where do you live?

217
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,916
This way.

218
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,250
It's pretty late. Is it okay?

219
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,875
I don't know what you mean.

220
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,625
Won't your parents be mad?

221
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,875
No, I actually live alone.

222
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,250
Oh, wow, are you serious?

223
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,958
Thank you for helping me
out today. Goodnight.

Hey! Kanna!

225
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,625
[TAKUYA]
Uh.

226
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,875
I finally found you!

227
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,833
[KANNA]
Good evening, Hojo.

228
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,458
Who's this guy?

229
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,666
I've been a lil' bummed 'cause
you haven't called me up lately!

230
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,625
Let's have fun! Come on.

231
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,791
[KANNA] I'm sorry. I'm not
feeling all that well today.

232
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,916
[HOJO]
Aww, don't be like that now!

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,916
[TAKUYA clears throat]

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
Uh, who in the hell are you?

235
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,666
[TAKUYA]
Just some guy.

236
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,083
[HOJO]
Come on, let's go.

237
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,750
[TAKUYA]
Hey! Get your hands off her!

238
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,916
[KANNA] Arima, thanks, but it's
okay. I can handle this myself.

239

[HOJO] Listen, kid,
who do you think you are?

240
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,791
Shut up, crazy drunk dude.

241
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,166
[HOJO] Shut your mouth!
You don't know my life!

--I happen to be Kanna's--
--[KANNA] He's not a stranger.

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,833
Hojo is someone I know.

244
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,916
Arima happens to be one
of my new classmates.

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,541
Ah. Well, I'm glad to hear it.

246
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:49,041
I thought maybe you'd gone and
made another special friend.

247
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,708
What does that mean?

248
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,583
[HOJO]
None of your beeswax, kiddo!

249
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,750
You got no business
gettin' yourself involved

250
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,666
in other people's
private lives, you twerp.

251
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,291
[TAKUYA]
What was that?

252
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,833
Stop this now! Both of you!

253
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,958
[KANNA]
Let's go. Come on.

254
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,333
[HOJO] Kanna, you can
call me any time, okay?

255
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,208
I'll be waiting.

256
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,291
[KANNA]
Keep walking!

[KANNA]
Come in.

[TAKUYA]
Oh, um... I dunno.

260
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,958
I think it's probably
best if I head on home.

I see. All right.

263
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll be okay.
This happens all the time.

264
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,125
You don't look close
to "okay" to me.

00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,833
[panting]

266
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,750
[TAKUYA] This is just like what
happened in the nurse's office.

267
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,375
Where do you keep
your medicines?

268
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,291
I don't actually have any.

Huh?

I'm going to rest for a bit.

[TAKUYA]
Mm.

272
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,125
[TAKUYA] It's the exact
opposite of Ayumi's room.

273
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,500
Uh?

274
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,500

00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,458
I'm feeling a lot better.

278
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,208
I'm glad to hear it.

279
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,083
Guess I should probably
take a shower.

280
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,583
I need to get rid
of all this sweat.

281

You're such a bastard.

[TAKUYA]
Why is he still here?

285
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,208

286
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,750
Uh. Oh, no.

288
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:58,041

[KANNA]
What, is something wrong?

292
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,625
[TAKUYA] No, I just heard
a loud noise and thought

293
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,291
you might have collapsed again.

294
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,750
But... you're safe... Cool.

295
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:10,916
[KANNA]
I need shampoo.

296
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,958
Uh?

297
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,541
I ran out and I need
to wash my hair.

298
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,666
There's a new bottle under the
sink. Can you bring it to me?

299
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,083
You got it. Be right back!

300
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:26,458
[sighs] Does she just not get
embarrassed by anything at all?

301
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,375
Uh. Here we go.

302
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,791
[TAKUYA grunts]

303
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,875
[TAKUYA] Here it is!
I'll leave it right here!

304
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,250
[KANNA]
Thanks, I appreciate it.

305
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:46,916
[sighs] What am I doing here?

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,625
Wait, what is this? Uh?!

307
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,291
She was getting money from Dad?

308
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,208
[door opens]

309
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,958
I'm sorry but I wasn't trying
to poke through your things.

310
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,916
I promise.

311
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,458
But these deposits continued

312
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,333
right up until my
dad disappeared.

313
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:10,333
And you seem to know an
awful lot 'bout my dad,

314
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:14,083
and Ryuzoji, and the
correction of chaos.

00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,625
You almost know too much.

316
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,625
Well, I guess,
it seems as though

317
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,916
I need to tell you everything.

318
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,458
But not right now, okay?
I have my own reasons for that.

319
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,625
Kodai gave me
instructions to tell you

320
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,750
when the right time came.
I'll do it then.

321
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,791
My dad did?

322
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,166
So, tell me. Are you planning
to spend the night?

323
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,041
Uh! Spend the night?

324
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,083
[KANNA]
Yes.

325
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,375
That's a weird offer.
You mean it?

326
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,875
[KANNA]
Only if you want to.

327
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,291
It's late and I'd like to
go to bed. What do you say?

328
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,583
[TAKUYA]
I should just head home.

329
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,000
[door creaks]

330
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,750
Did you have a good time?

331
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,541
No, not the way you mean.

332
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,833
Were you waiting for
me out here or what?

333
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,708
Tell me kid, what's the deal
between you and Kanna?

334
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,708
I could ask you
the same question.

335
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,333
What the hell's a middle
aged drunk doing here?

336
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,000
You just like hanging around
young girls or what?

337
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:16,541
Ha! Whatever. I only have
one thing to say to you.

338
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,291
Stay away from Kanna.

339
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,000
You can talk to her
in class, nowhere else.

340
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,416
[TAKUYA]
Why's that?

341
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,250
[HOJO] Trust me, there are
some things in this world

342
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,875
it's better not to know.

343
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:29,250
Oh, wait, if you're leavin',
I guess it's my turn now!

344
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,625
[TAKUYA]
Wait just a minute!

345
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,416
I only came out here
to get some air!

346
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,458
[TAKUYA grunts]

347
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,125
[growls]

348
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,500
You're back.

349
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,666
[TAKUYA]
I think I'll stay after all.

350
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,708
Hey, you asleep?

351
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,708
Not yet.

352
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,458
There's one thing
I'd really like to ask.

353
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,208
Okay.

354
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:18,708
My father... Is he still
alive somewhere?

355
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,458
Yes, he is.

356
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:31,375
Thanks, Kanna. That's all
I needed to know, for now.

357
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,208
Goodnight, Arima.

358
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,708
[TAKUYA] Are you kidding?
I don't need a new mother!

359
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,625
What, are you in love
with her or something?

360
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,958
She's eight years
older than you.

361
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,541
Hypocrite! You're planning
on marrying your student

362
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,375
who's 20 years younger than you!

363
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,875
[KODAI]
In the face of real love,

364
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,750
something as petty
as age difference

365
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,791
doesn't even factor in.

366
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:57,333
I think it might be time
to discuss your mother.

367
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,583
I'll tell you everything.

368
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,916
Your mother, Keiko,
passed away years ago.

369
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,958
That is a fact,
carved into history.

370
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,750
However, despite what
most people believe,

371
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,916
not every fact is true.

372
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,958
[TAKUYA]
What the hell's that mean?

373
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,500
Listen to me.

374
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,625
History is not just a record
of changes from the past.

375
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,625
[TAKUYA]
What are you talking about?

376
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,750
[KODAI]
Your mother. She's...

377
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:27,125
Hold on! I can't hear you!

378
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,750
[whispers] Keiko is...

379
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,291
Dad, what?!

380
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,666
[inaudible]

381
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,000
[gasps]

382
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,375
[chopping]

383
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,458
[KANNA]
Oh, good morning.

384
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,416
Yeah. Morning.

385
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,833
Surprised you didn't try
anything last night.

386
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,458
Whoa, not sure I heard right!

387
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,333
Would you mind repeating that?

388
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:58,625
What's the deal, do you
not find me attractive?

389
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,041
No, that's not the problem.

390
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,333
When I'm with you,
I feel kinda weird.

391
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,916
What do you mean?

392
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,333
[TAKUYA] Like I've known you for
a long time. Like you're family.

393
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:16,958
I mean, would it upset you if
you reminded me of a, a mom?

394
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,083
No. It's fine.

395
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,458
If Dad was doing weird
things to you, I'm sorry.

396
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,083
No, he wasn't that
type of person.

397
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,375
Please have faith
in your father.

398
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,583
[YUKI]
I'm so bored.

399
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,875
Yeah, I guess there's
really not much to do

400
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,583
till the photos are developed.

401
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,458
I say we do something
summer-ish.

402
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,708
I need you to define
"summer-ish."

403
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,208
[TAKUYA]
Hitting on girls in swimsuits.

404
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,458
Is that literally
all you think about?

405
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,625
Yup!

406
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,541
[YUKI] But doesn't
the construction mean

407
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,708
the beach is shut down?

408
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,000
[TAKUYA sighs]

409
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,208
Hey, guys?

410
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,416
My dad actually has a private
beach next to a resort.

411
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,083
It sits just outside
of Sakaimachi.

412
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:10,958
Huh?!

413
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,458
Right, you're family's loaded!

414
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,791
If I were to ask him,

415
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,458
I think he would probably
let us use it for a day.

416
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,625
Are you serious?!

417
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,291
[BOTH]
Yeah!

418
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,958
Hey, you're not gonna tell us to
stay away from the ocean, right?

419
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,791
Since we won't be
near the mountain?

420
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,041
That's right.

421
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,750
All right, then it's settled!

422
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,208
Don't worry. I'll take
care of the tickets!

423
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,791
[KANNA]
Um. I can't really...

424
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,791
What is it, do you not swim?

425
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,250
I can, but I...

426
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,541
[TAKUYA]
Don't have a swimsuit?

427
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,916
No, I do.

428
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,791
Then you should come with us.

429
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,375
It's just... I've been
kind of sick lately.

430
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,375
The thing is, if that's
the case and you're not okay,

431
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,041
we'll feel better
if you're with us.

432
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:57,000
We won't be able to help
if you collapse alone.

433
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,250
That's true.
I guess you're right.

434
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,625
All right! We're going
to the beach!

435
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,875
Well, so much for hitting
on hot girls in swimsuits.

436
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,416
What exactly were you
planning to do, anyway?

437
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,791
[TAKUYA]
I guess we might as well enjoy

438
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,916
this rich girl's beach
while we can, huh?
