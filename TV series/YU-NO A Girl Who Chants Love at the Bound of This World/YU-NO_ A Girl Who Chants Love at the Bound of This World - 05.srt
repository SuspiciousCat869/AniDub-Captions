00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,875
[AYUMI]
I'm sorry Kodai. I tried.

317
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:06,000
But I can't do this anymore.
I'm too tired.

318
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,416
Ayumi!

319
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,375
Please, leave me alone.

320
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,250
[TAKUYA] I'm not going anywhere
until you hand me that razor!

321
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,583
Come on,
we'll work through this!

322
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,583
[AYUMI]
Stay back!

323
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,625
I'm done. Okay?

324
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,708
I don't have it in me
to keep doing this.

325
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,208
Can we please just talk?
I'm here for you!

326
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:35,541
Don't stop me.
I've made up my mind.

327
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,958
Oh, Kodai.

328
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:46,041
It's been so long, but I'm
coming to see you now.

329
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,916
--[TAKUYA] Stop it!
--[splash]

330
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,791
[AYUMI]
Get off!

331
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,583
[TAKUYA]
No way!

332
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,833
Let me go! It's my life!

333
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,125
[TAKUYA] I'm not giving up
after all of this!

334
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,875
Do what your mother
tells you to do, Takuya!

335
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,250
[TAKUYA] You really think
that's gonna work?

336
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,666
Ayumi, please.

337
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,500
Just calm down and we can
work this out together.

338
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,875
You're just a teenager!

339
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,708
I'm not going to listen
to some lecture from you!

340
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,333
Did you...

341
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,416
Did you just slap me?!

342
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,666
You were acting like a brat
throwing a temper tantrum.

343
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,125
Stop being such a smartass!

344
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,791
You don't know what
I'm going through!

345
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah, But I know your
bra size--is that enough?

346
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,833
[AYUMI]
You idiot! Stupid, stupid idiot.

347
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,791
I'm in so much pain.

348
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,250
I'm so lonely without him!

349
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,625
I know how you feel.

350
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,583
[AYUMI]
No! You don't!

351
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:52,166
Well. Maybe you could
talk me through it.

352
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm falling apart!
Why are you so calm?!

353
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,666
[TAKUYA]
"Don't be a fool, Ayumi.

354
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,791
Why, you know better than this!"

355
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,750
[AYUMI gasps]

356
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,541
[TAKUYA]
Ha, ha! Come on.

357
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,000
It sounded a little
like him, right?

358
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:14,958
Heh! Hardly. You
may be father and son,

359
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,833
but you two couldn't
be more different.

360
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,416
And here I thought I nailed it.

361
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Guess I'll have to be
charming all on my own.

362
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,500
Well? Feel better?

363
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,250
Yeah. Thank you for this.

364
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,041
I will never let
you down again.

365
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,750
I'll prove your innocence.

366
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,625
[gasps]

367
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,625
Life'll go back to normal, and
you can continue your research.

368
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,416
What have you been up to?

369
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,500
How much do you
really know, Takuya?

370
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,250
Don't you worry about that.

371
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:51,208
Even if it means going to
another time, another world.

372
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,958
I'll do whatever it
takes to save you.

373
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,458
But I need you to believe in me.

374
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,625
Don't ever do something
like this again.

375
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,625
Can you promise me that?

376
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,958
All right, you have my word.

377
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:46,416
