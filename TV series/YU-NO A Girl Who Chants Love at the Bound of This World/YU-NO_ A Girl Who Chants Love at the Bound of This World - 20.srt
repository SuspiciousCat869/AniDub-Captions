This is unbelievable.

So, she offered them both?

Do you have any idea who you

I honestly don't give a shit.

You monsters just broke into
my house and attacked my wife!

What do you bandits
want from us anyway?

Wait, who's the bandit?!

You murdered Ailia, the knight,

No, that's not what I did!

[GUARD H]
Uh-huh.

33
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:11,650
Then you dared to imply that
the royal guards were bandits.

34
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,900
That's a very bold
insult for a peasant.

Wait, what?

We're taking the priestess

Done by the order of
the Divine Emperor.

[ADVISOR]
So, Keyales had already

119
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
lost the right to
be a priestess,

120
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,233
to the same man who stole
the sacred treasure?

[GUARD H]
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:50,983
[ADVISOR]
Suicide, though? Very dramatic.

123
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:54,275
However, it may be a fitting
end to a fallen priestess.

124
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:55,775
[GUARD H]
Without a priestess,

125
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:58,775
we will be unable to
hold the ritual, sir.

Indeed. It's certain
the world shall perish

they are right now.

[EMPEROR]
Mother has spoken.

129
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:11,275
She tells me that Keyales
gave birth to a daughter.

130
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:13,442
Go and find her immediately!

[GUARDS]
Yes, sir!

132
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:16,983
[EMPEROR] What of the man
who was with her?

133
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:20,150
[GUARD H] He's probably
died in the desert by now.

134
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:22,525
[EMPEROR]
Have you discovered who he is?

135
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,317
No, sir, we know nothing yet.

136
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,192
But the priestess did address
him as "Takuya."

been a terrible decision,

but I have to get to the
imperial city, no matter what.

156

I need to get the
Reflector Device back,

00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:09,692
and I have to get the
psychite for Kanna.

Uh? Papa, look at that!
There's a town over there!

What do you mean?

163
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,025
What you're seeing is a mirage.

164
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:36,650
An illusion caused by
the bending of the light.

165
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,525
It's not real.

166
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,483
Oh, it's not?

167
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:52,150
[YU-NO yawns]
I'm sleepy, Papa.

168
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:55,025
[TAKUYA] You can sleep as
long as you don't fall off.

169
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:59,942
[YU-NO] Okay. We're not
there yet, are we?

170
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:02,358
[TAKUYA] We'll have a
daddy-daughter date on the way.

171
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:06,233
[YU-NO]
Sure. What's a "date," though?

172
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:17,442
[WOMAN grunts]

173
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:33,942
[TAKUYA]
Here.

174
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,233
Hold on, isn't that your water?

175
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:43,525
[chuckles] It's okay. I don't
want any more today, that's all.

176
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:51,525
[YU-NO] Hey, Papa. We'll be
there soon, won't we?

177
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:52,608
At the capital?

178
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,900
[TAKUYA]
Yeah, we're almost there.

179
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:03,692
[TAKUYA] We keep having this
conversation over and over.

180
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,483
But I can't tell the truth.

181
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,817
I won't take away her one hope.

182
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,942
I know these exchanges are
meaningless, but I can't stop.

183
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,733
[TAKUYA]
Mm? Uh!

184
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:19,525
What is this?

185
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:22,358
[YU-NO]
There's lots of them, huh?

186
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:26,233
[TAKUYA] It almost looks like a
dumping ground for old coffins.

187
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,858
[TAKUYA]
There's nothing inside.

188
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,108
[coughs]

189
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:55,025
Papa. Am I seeing
another mirage?

[CAMEL groaning]

193
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:27,775
Oh, Papa, he's saying
he's very tired.

194
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,567
I'm sure.

195
00:14:35,983 --> 00:14:39,358
You need to eat.

196
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:42,317
Thanks for all that
you did for us.

197
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:51,442
[TAKUYA] We're completely
out of food and water.

198
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,692
So, all we can do now is pray.

199
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:56,108
Pray that we're not out of luck.

200
00:15:11,692 --> 00:15:16,567
[TAKUYA] Yu-No! Come on,
sweetie, you have to wake up!

201
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,567
Papa, we're almost
there, aren't we?

202
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,400
[TAKUYA grunting]

203
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,858
Water! Please!
Just a little bit of water!

204
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:35,358
I need water for Yu-No!

205
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,567
[TAKUYA groaning]

206
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:47,525
[TAKUYA] Damn it.
Just another stupid mirage!

207
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:50,233
Unless... Hold on.

It's real, an oasis!

Hm?

[TAKUYA]
A-Ah!

Really? Wait, is there another
hot naked girl over there?

00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,692
What, another one? Where?

00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:51,067
It's nice to meet you.

your way with me, now,

isn't that right?

00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,317
You're a pervert and
a beast and a brute!

226
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,817
You're going to use to me
to satiate your manly lusts.

That's not true!

You're gonna make
me your sex slave!

even talking about?

235

[SALA] Wait, you came to beat
up the Divine Emperor?

236
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:24,733
Yeah, that's right.

237
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:26,150
And that was important
enough for you

238
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,525
to drag a kid across the desert?

239
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:31,775
That guy deserves a punch in
the mouth for what he did to me.

240

I think you might be going
up against the wrong guy!

I mean why do you want
to punch the Emperor?

I'll leave that to
your imagination.

is really dangerous these days,

thanks to the rebels. So,
I finally gave up and ran.

253
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:04,317
[TAKUYA] By "rebels," you mean
some kind of resistance?

Yep. People who want

255

to defeat the Divine
Emperor, just like you.

[SALA gasps]
When you get there,

257
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:13,192
you should try to find
them and talk to them!

258
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,525
[TAKUYA]
I'm not trying to make friends.

That's not...

00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:18,817
You really do just want
to punch the guy.

261

Yeah, basically.

262

Wow, look at you! You seem
to be feeling better!

I am! And I'm sure it's because

272
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:55,192
I got to spend so much
time talking with you!

Hm?!

This is something
really new for me!

275
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,942
So fun! I mean,
it was my first time

276
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:04,025
getting to talk
with another girl!

277
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:07,317
Oh? Wait, what about
your mother, though?

278
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,150
[YU-NO] Mama didn't talk, she
was kinda different like that.

279
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:13,108
Oh, yeah? You mean she
was really quiet?

280
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,275
[YU-NO]
Mm-mm. That's not it.

281
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:18,567
Mama was... Uh.

282
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,275
Sure, I understand.

283
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:21,775
So, what you're saying is,

284
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:25,150
I'm not supposed to talk to
strangers about you, right?

285
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,608
Yes. I got it.

286
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:30,733
Hey, what's up? Who are
you talking to over here?

287
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:33,525
Mama's here.
She's always inside me.

Oh, I can't say that, either?

I guess we've got it
kinda tough, don't we?

Hey, how long are you
gonna keep following us?

292

Didn't you just
flee the capital?

293
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,525
Well, I'm worried, though.

294
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,733
I mean, how can I just abandon
someone who says

295
00:19:57,817 --> 00:20:00,608
they're going to punch
the freakin' Emperor?

296
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:05,150
[TAKUYA]
Uh! Man, did we need this!

297
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:11,317
[SALA] Ha! There it is! It's
really about to come down, hard.

I say we go wait it out
inside that temple!

299
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:27,025
How does this thing open?

300
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:30,275
Leave it to me. Tad-ah!

[SALA] Push here, and here,
and now we're done!

303
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,108
I can see why you ran
away from the capital.

304
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:46,817
You're extremely talented.

305

I'm just very good with
my hands, that's all!

Hey, Papa?

00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:55,817
Yeah? What is it?

308
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,692
It's my heart. It feels like
it's pounding so hard.

I brought someone very special
here to meet you guys!

Look, don't blame me, okay?

00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,233
I mean, come on,

316
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,317
you know you've got that huge
bounty on your head, right?

[GUARD B] He's the one who
defiled Keyales the priestess.

is that girl her successor?

00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:33,233
No!
