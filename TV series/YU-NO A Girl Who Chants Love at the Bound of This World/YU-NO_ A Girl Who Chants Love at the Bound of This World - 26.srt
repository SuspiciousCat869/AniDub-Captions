You're making the

Takuya, when I first arrived
here in Dela Granto,

146
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,400
I learned real loneliness.

147
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:23,525
[AYUMI]
I was able to stop Ryuzoji

from taking over this world.

And then, before I knew
what was happening.

I became the Divine Emperor.

you'd come to me one day.

00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:26,483
Two hundred seconds until
the limit horizon is breached.

166
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,775
Not good. The limit
horizon breach

167
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:31,275
and synchronization are
happening at the same time.

168
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:33,275
Wait, what does that mean?

169
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:35,525
If they occur simultaneously,

170
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:38,192
that means that just when
you and I synchronize,

171
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,067
Dela Granto and Earth
will reach a point

172
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,900
when they can no longer
avoid each other.

173
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:44,442
That means...

174
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:47,108
[TAKUYA] Even if the ritual
succeeds as planned...

175
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:49,942
[ERIKO]
It's basically a 50/50 chance.

176
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,483
If only we had even
an extra second.

177
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,025
[ERIKO]
Yeah, that's all we need.

178
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:55,817
It would change everything.

179
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,108
At this point, even a
femtosecond would be enough

180
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,608
for us to avoid the
destruction of the world.

181
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,275
[gasps]

182
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:03,442
[ERIKO]
Not now...

183
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:05,775
Eriko, what the hell's
happening to you?

184
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,525
[ERIKO] The Dimensional
Bureau must have decided

185
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:10,358
that my mission
here is finished.

186
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:11,692
Now that my job is done,

187
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:15,067
I'm being forced back
to my own dimension.

188
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,442
Arima.

189
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:18,567
No matter what, don't lose hope.

190
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,233
Of course I won't.

191
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:22,733
[ERIKO]
I'm really glad I met you.

192
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,442
And I really hope
that we'll meet again

193
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,692
in another parallel world.

194
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,775
Priestess, farewell to you.

195
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:35,275
It is time now.

196
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:36,650
Right.

197
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:42,817
[TAKUYA]
Yu-No, are you okay?

198
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,233
Yeah. I'm just fine.

199
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:47,983
Remember, long ago,
when you and me

200
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,942
and Mom all slept in
the same bed together?

201
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:54,025
We'll do it again,
just wait and see.

202
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:55,942
[YU-NO]
Yes.

203
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,192
[gasps]

204
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:08,233
Okay, here I go.

205
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:09,650
[TAKUYA]
Wait for me!

206
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:12,358
Even if you're sent out beyond
the dimensional horizon,

207
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:16,025
I'll always come for you,
always, do you hear me, Yu-No?

208
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:19,275
[YU-NO]
Papa.

209
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:22,608
Papa!

210
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:44,025
Grantia, look. At this
rate, they'll all...

211
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:45,983
[PEOPLE chattering]

212
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,275
Hey, what's that?

213
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:48,442
[MAN B]
What the...?

214
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:49,983
[PEOPLE chattering]

215
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:52,525
[GRANTIA] Unfortunately, the
fate of dimensional collision

216
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:53,733
cannot be avoided.

217
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:55,233
[YU-NO]
If only we could make it happen

218
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,442
in a time and place
where nobody lived.

219
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:00,525
The energy is of a
different magnitude

220
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:02,983
than any other cycle before.

221
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,692
Using the maximum event shock,

222
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,233
it's not completely
impossible, but...

223
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:08,650
But what?

224
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,817
[GRANTIA] If that's done,
the body of the priestess

225
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,733
will exceed the speed
of the event elements.

226
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:15,983
Okay, what happens then?

227
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:19,525
The event order of the priestess
begins to run backwards.

228
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:21,567
The way tachyons that
exceed the speed of light

229
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,442
go backwards in time.

230
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:26,858
What happens then is
impossible to know.

231
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:31,567
I'll do what has to be done.

232
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,108
[GRANTIA]
Very well.

233
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:10,858
This is an event spiral,
repeating on an infinite loop.

234
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:13,358
As we speak,
another Dela Granto

235
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:16,900
is wandering the dimensional
rifts, repeating its approach

236
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:19,858
and withdrawal from this
earth time and again.

237
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,108
Please, tell me this.

238
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:26,275
Will we ever be able to break
the chains of fate that hold us?

239
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,733
I'm really sorry.

240
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:49,733
I... I think it's over.

241
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:51,233
Don't say that!

242
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:53,983
I finally found true friends.

243
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:58,150
You told me I'm not alone
and wanted to live with me.

244
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,608
[TAKUYA]
I'll get you some psychite!

245
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:04,067
[inhales]

246
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,608
I promise you!

247
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:08,317
I'll have to go get it
from another dimension!

248
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,108
Wait for me!
You just keep holding on!

249
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:13,817
[gasps]

250
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:25,108
[KANNA]
Mother...

251
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:26,192
[TAKUYA]
I'm back.

252
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:28,400
[KANNA gasps]

253
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,775
[gasps]

254
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:32,358
This is...

255
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:35,150
[KANNA]
What? Is something wrong?

256
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:38,525
Now I see. So, that's
how it ended up, huh?

257
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:42,192
[laughs]

258
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:46,858
[TAKUYA] It connected.
It finally all connected!

259
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:51,358
That means the route I followed
was actually the right one!

260
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:53,400
Wasn't it, Amanda?

261
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:00,733
You seem different now.

262
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:03,775
I swear I just said
goodbye a moment ago,

263
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:06,942
but it's almost like you've
become a different person.

264
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:10,942
I know, it's a lot.

265
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:13,817
I can't believe how
much has happened.

266
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:19,608
[TAKUYA] As promised,
here's the psychite.

267
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:23,942
In its crystallized form,
so it'll never break.

268
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,358
I don't know how
to thank you!

269
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:29,775
My entire life has been
one continuous struggle

270
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,983
simply not to die.

271
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:35,608
And then you came along and
showed me how to really live.

272
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,483
Yuki and Mio helped, too.

273
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:38,733
You're right.

274
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:41,608
They're good friends.

275
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:44,108
And you know, now that
you have what you need,

276
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:46,608
things will only keep
getting better for you.

277
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:50,400
So please. Be happy.

278
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:51,983
Wait, hold on.

279
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,692
Are you going somewhere, Arima?

280
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:56,775
Someone's waiting for me.

281
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:59,858
They've been waiting for
thousands of years, now.

282
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:02,942
I have to go and see her.

283
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,192
[gasps]

284
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,442
Bye, Kanna.

285
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,025
Thank you so much
for everything.

286
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,275
[grunts]

287
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:47,233
[MIO] So, listen. I've decided
to go study abroad, after all.

288
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,942
[gasps]

289
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,942
I want to get away
from Sakaimachi

290
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:53,233
for a while, you know?

291
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:57,483
It's okay, I get it.

292
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,733
Look. I'm, uh... I'm...

293
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:01,608
Uh?

294
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:05,483
It's, uh...
Don't forget about me!

295
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,108
[MIO]
Uhh...

296
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:09,733
Listen, I know how much you
like the boss and everything,

297
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:12,150
and I get it! But I'm...

298
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:16,108
I'm not ready to give up yet!

299
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,442
[laughs]

300
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:20,442
[MIO] I like that about you,
Yuki! I always have!

301
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:21,900
[MIO laughs]

[groaning]

306
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:47,608
Here we go, it's this way.

307
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,275
[TAKUYA panting]

308
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,692
Yu-No!

309
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,525
Are you okay?

310
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,317
Papa. I missed you so much.

311
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,858
[TAKUYA]
I missed you, too.

312
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:20,608
I was able to touch the
depths of Grantia's mind,

313
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,067
but I couldn't change
fate, no matter what.

314
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,483
So Dela Granto fell right
here, 8,000 years ago.

315
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:33,942
I see. That means... it's
still below Mount Sankaku?

316
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:40,442
[YU-NO] It's thanks to this
that I was able to come here.

317
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:41,983
[TAKUYA]
Yu-No?

318
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:45,942
I have to leave you now, and
merge with the fabric of time.

319
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:47,692
This is goodbye.

320
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:49,108
[gasps]

321
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:52,358
So thank you, Papa.

322
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,650
No. You won't be alone anymore!

323
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,108
[YU-NO gasps]

324
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:04,192
[TAKUYA] Last time,
you had to go on your own.

325
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:07,442
Not this time.
I can't do it again.

326
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:11,192
I won't let you travel to
the end of the world alone!

327
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,275
There's nothing there, though.

328
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:16,942
You will be there.

329
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:19,650
And Sayless, too.

330
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,192
[YU-NO]
Papa!

331
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:01,192
Takuya.

332
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:03,608
I've seen everything
you've been able to do.

333
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:06,025
And so has your mother.

334
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:08,108
To be perfectly honest,

335
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:11,025
I'm more than a little
bit jealous of you.

336
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:12,983
And do you know why?

337
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:16,525
You and Yu-No will travel
the rift between events.

338
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:18,025
You'll see it all.

339
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:21,400
As if looking through a window
into the truth of history.

340
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:24,275
You're the envy
of all historians.

341
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:30,317
Also, as an observer
of the Tree of Vrinda,

342
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,692
I shall continue with my search.

343
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:33,858
[clock ticks]

344
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:35,942
[KODAI]
Now, it's time.

345
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:38,608
I'm glad we got to
have one last talk.

346
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:41,067
I don't know if
we'll meet again,

347
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,275
but I'll be here
dreaming till then.

348
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,608
It's pitch black in here.

349
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:54,567
Yeah, it sure is.

350
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,608
Just the two of us, huh?

351
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:57,733
Guess so.

352
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:00,233
This may be hell for all I know.

353
00:23:00,317 --> 00:23:02,483
I don't think that's true.

354
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:06,567
We're an instant, but
also, we're an eternity.

355
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,608
And now we're traveling
up the stream of events.

356
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:12,108
Hey, Papa.

357
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,025
Look at that.

358
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:19,067
[TAKUYA]
It's sprouting.

359
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,525
[YU-NO]
It's so cute.

360
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,233
[TAKUYA]
It's still just a baby.

361
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:27,400
Yet it remembers everything
about this world.

362
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:30,775
Hey! What would you think
about giving it a name?

363
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:32,733
We should!

364
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:37,025
[YU-NO] Actually, I kinda
already thought of one.

365
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:39,525
Do you know what that name is?

366
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:43,025
Yes. I think I do know.

367
00:23:43,108 --> 00:23:46,317
Good, the name of
this child is...
