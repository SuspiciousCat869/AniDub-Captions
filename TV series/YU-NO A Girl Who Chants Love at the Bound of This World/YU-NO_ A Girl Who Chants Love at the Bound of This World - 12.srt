Ah, yes, I see.

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,708
So you saw the device
that's hidden under

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,500
Mount Sankaku.

5
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,666
I would've greatly
preferred to tell you

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,541
about Ryuzoji in
writing, of course.

7
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,250
But at that time, I still
hadn't become aware

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,916
of the fact that he was
actually something else.

Looks like I made it back.

[MITSUKI]
Hello?

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,833
Hey, Mitsuki.

18
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,791
[MITSUKI] Takuya? What are
you doing calling so late?

19
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,291
Is everything okay?

20
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,791
[TAKUYA]
It's not an emergency,

21
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,375
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

22
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,375
[MITSUKI scoffs] Really? You
wanted to hear it so much

23
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,333
that you had to call me in
the middle of the night?

24
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,250
Uh-huh. I promise you,
that's all.

25
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,250
[laughs] How terribly
romantic of you.

26
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,875
You're just as charming
as ever, I see.

27
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,000
[TAKUYA laughs]

28
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,875
[MITSUKI]
But are you sure you're okay?

29
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,958
You sound awfully tired.

30
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,333
You're not doubting
my endurance, are you?

31
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:38,041
'Cause I'm pretty sure I showed
you what I'm made of.

32
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,958
[MITSUKI]
Okay, okay.

33
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,958
If you can still make jokes
like that, you must be fine.

34
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:46,708
Anyway. Sleep well, okay?

35
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,000
[TAKUYA groans]

36
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,458
Damn you, Ryuzoji!

37
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,250
What are you?

38
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,416
How do I stop this?

39
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,125
[phone ringing]

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,125
[YUKI] This is your
friendly wake-up call!

41
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,541
From the one who's here
in your hour of need.

42
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,916
[YUKI, TAKUYA]
Hero on call. Masakatsu Yuki!

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,291
I know...

44
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,458
Huh? Hold up.

45
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,833
How did you know I
was gonna say that?

46
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,666
No way. We're not, like,
secretly soulmates, are we?

47
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,041
[TAKUYA]
So, hey, I was meaning to ask.

48
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,625
You know a lot about
that "curse," right?

49
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,958
Yeah.

50
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,333
[TAKUYA]
When did all that start?

51
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,458
Was it before Ryuzoji
moved into his mansion?

52
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,583
Well, now that you mention it,

53
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,666
I think it was actually
right after he moved in,

54
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,833
when people started talking
about the whole curse thing.

55
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:14,750
[TAKUYA] I see. You are
a hero. Thanks, buddy.

56
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,083
[YUKI] Ask me anything!
I hear all the rumors!

57
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,666
I know about the
lightning strikes, too.

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,166
Didn't know you were
so excited about this.

59
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,625
[laughs] Is it that obvious?

60
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,791
Shimazu asked me to research
stuff, so I'm the expert now!

61
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,791
--[bell rings]
--[YUKI] Uh. That's the bell!

62
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,208
[TAKUYA] As thanks for all your
help, and because I'm feeling

63
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,125
generous, I'll let you
do my work again today.

64
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,291
I fail to see how
that's generous.

65
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,750
[TAKUYA] Because it'll
give you an excuse to

66
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,000
do more "research"
with Mio, obviously.

67
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,958
Whoa, you're right!
You can count on me!

68
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,416
I'll go over every
last detail with her!

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,916
[TAKUYA]
That's the spirit!

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,291
Well, Mr. Hero, I leave this
task in your capable hands!

71
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,333
I won't let you down!

72
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,291
See you this evening, Mother.

73
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,541
Don't work too hard, now.

74
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,541
Okay, so my theory about Ryuzoji
and this whole curse thing

75
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,125
being connected seems to
be checking out so far.

76
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,083
Sort of.

77
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:17,083
Seeing what I've seen, I know
something is going on at least.

78
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:23,083
I could just walk into his
office and demand the truth.

79
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:27,000
But then he might try that
Niarb thing on me again.

80
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,333
Yeah, and the main
difference with this one

81
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,666
is that while you're in it,

82
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,541
your normal consciousness
remains totally awake.

83
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,833
Listen.

84
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,208
It's kinda crazy, because
since you're awake,

85
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,875
it's like you don't realize
you're being controlled.

86
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,291
Eriko knew about Niarb.

87
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,458
Maybe she knows a defense
against it, too.

88
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,500
Eriko, hey?

89
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,166
[TAKUYA]
Not here, huh?

90
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,083
Damn, she's never around
when I need her.

91
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,916
[TAKUYA gasping]

92
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,000
Just like last time!

93
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,458
[inhales, sighs]

94
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,416
Still warm, too.
The suspect must be nearby.

95
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,583
[ERIKO grunts]

96
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,208
[TAKUYA]
Mm? Eriko?

97
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,500
[TAKUYA]
Where is she?

98
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,166
[ERIKO]
Mm...

99
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:27,458
[TAKUYA] Doesn't look very
comfortable but what do I know?

100
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,750
Where do you sleep
if not in a bed?

101
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,041
I sleep on the floor, of course.

102
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,416
Is that some kind of trend now?

103
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,625
[ERIKO gasping]

104
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,583
Abel, wait.

105
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,500
Del. Midra.

106
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,375
No stop! Abel!

107
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm burning. The flames.

108
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,083
Abel!

109
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,208
Hey! Is something going on?

110
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,375
Eriko!

[panting]

112
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:57,583
Don't leave me.
I swear I'll find them.

113
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,625
So, please. Stay by my side.

114
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,166
Uh...

115
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,708
Abel...

116
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,333
Whoa. Hold on.

117
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,625
I-I, uh. Didn't mean to, uh...

118
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:22,875
[gasps] It's really you!
You came back!

Abel.

122
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,333
[TAKUYA]
U-Uh.

123
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,416
C'mon, Eriko!
Snap out of it!

124
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,541
[ERIKO]
Mm?

125
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,041
Huh? Arima?

126
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,125
Mornin'. How're you, boo?

127
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,958
[gasping]

128
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,041
--I got it on tape. Don't worry!
--[ERIKO screaming]

129
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,416
[BOTH]
Uh?

130
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,666
That sounded like...

131
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,750
We should go check!

132
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,541
Is everyone okay?

133
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,416
Miss Eriko!

134
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,041
[ERIKO grunting]

135
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,333
Uh. What on earth
were you doing?

136
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,125
Arima!

137
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,333
[ERIKO] This is all just
a big misunderstanding.

138
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,583
I assure you.

139
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,416
You say you're innocent,
but you also don't have

140
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,583
any reason to be here and you
say she just happened to be

141
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,125
changing clothes.
But, well, the point is,

142
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,500
there's an awful lot
of buts in all this.

143
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,625
I don't know if a lady should be
talking about butts so much.

144
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,750
Excuse me?!

145
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,791
[TAKUYA]
Nothing, ma'am. You're right.

146
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,625
[MIO]
Be careful!

147
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,875
They made this boy by sticking
arms and legs on a libido,

148
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,750
and covering it with
the skin of a pervert!

149
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,000
He absolutely cannot be trusted!

150
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,125
Just eviscerate me,
why don't you?

151
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,041
So you can't handle the truth?

152
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,833
You do have a track record
with this sort of thing.

153
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,000
[YUKI]
Wait, what?

154
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,125
Do you now?

155
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,750
No, she's making a joke.

156
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,833
[coughs] Bitch.

157
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,375
[KAORI] What are you planning
to do with that thing anyway?

158
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,333
I can't imagine you'd just
sell it to make some cash.

159
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:55,083
Is it academic curiosity,
or something more?

160
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,666
Better not to ask
so many questions.

But still, can't blame me
for being curious, can you?

This is quite the risky

Ow, ow, ow.

318
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,208
Why would you say Mitsuki is
doomed? I can help her, right?

[ERIKO]
What are your plans after this?

320
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,500
Who, me? I'm a busy
man, you know.

321
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,958
[ERIKO]
Okay, totally free.

322
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,166
Good. I'll see you at Cafe
Evening on Central Street.

323
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,250
What's all this about?

324
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,500
There's something important
I need to show you.

325
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,458
Uh. Kanna!

326
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,125
Even their scent
is different now.

327
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,541
Huh? Ryuzoji, you mean?

328
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,500
Yes, and it seems he
wants my necklace too.

329
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:07,416
Rather, he wants the stone
inside of it, quite badly.

330
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,333
You should be
careful around him.

[ERIKO]
I'm in disguise. Obviously.

[ERIKO]
You see those two?

341
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:58,291
Ryuzoji and Kaori Asakura--
Yeah, what about them?

342
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,625
[ERIKO]
Hm. Nothing surprises you, huh?

Yeah, well.

344
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,250
[ERIKO]
So, how much do you know?

345

A thing or two, I guess.

You've done this
cycle before, right?

347
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,958
You would pick up some things.

Hold on a sec, here.
What do you know?

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,208
A thing or two, I guess. Hmph.

00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, that's all I
needed to confirm.

352

Shall we go to our next spot?

353
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,541
Uh. And where's that?

354
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,791
A place where we can learn
the truth about the curse.

355
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,875
[ERIKO] Hey, Arima. You've
played catch before, right?

356
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,875
Huh? And what does that
have to do with anything?

357
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,000
So! Are you ready?

to go inside and grab it!

Uh...

So, please remind me, why
are we trespassing again?

368
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,291
[ERIKO] A certain woman has
promised to give me information

369
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:33,500
on Ryuzoji, but it's something
we have to do discreetly.

"A certain woman"?

Mitsuki, y'mean?

372
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,333
No. Ryuzoji's dear mother.

373
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,125
Uh. Wait. What good will she do?

My ears can hear it
even if yours cannot.

Now listen carefully for
the breath of 400 years.

00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,041
She looked pretty senile,
if you ask me.

377
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,208
That's just an act,
so Ryuzoji doesn't suspect her.

378
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,041
You really didn't know?

379
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,791
Uh!

380
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,208
Anyway, if that woman
hasn't figured out

381

his secret, nobody has.
