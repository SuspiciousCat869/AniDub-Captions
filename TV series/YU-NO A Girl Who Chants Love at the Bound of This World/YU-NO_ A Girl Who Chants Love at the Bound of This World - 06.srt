[laughs] Good morning,

[TAKUYA]
Ayumi... Don't worry,

00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:11,458
soon they're all gonna figure
out that you're innocent.

00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,750
Yeah. Thank you.

I'm going to prove her innocence
and reveal the truth to the

to break into Geotech first.

[ERIKO] It's your penalty
for cutting class yesterday.

20
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,916
This is taking it a bit far,
don't you think?

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,875
Too bad, do it anyway.

22
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,541
Or that free summer you wanted?
It will be spent in a classroom.

23
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,041
Hey, Boss, remember,
summer's waiting!

24
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,583
Just get through
that stack of paper

25
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,250
and we can head
down to the beach!

Oh, good point. It's so true.

What's your problem?

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,833
There's no swimming at the beach
due to the Geotech construction.

33
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,291
Uh?

34
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,250
Okay! Class,

Yep, that appears to be true.

Yuki'll get it done.

[YUKI] U-Uh! I'm not
even in your grade!

How'm I supposed
to know this stuff?!

[TAKUYA]
Yep, I was right.

00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,958
I totally knew it was you.

54
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,416
And I thought I flew
under the radar.

55
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,833
I guess being a popular news
journalist has its drawbacks.

56
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:20,458
[TAKUYA] Mm! What
happened to Toyotomi?

57
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,208
Did you take care of him
like you said you would?

58
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,791
Yeah, of course.

59
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:28,416
Everything's been set in motion
for his departure from Geotech.

60
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,708
My guess is, he'll probably
never bother Chief Arima again.

61
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,333
How'd you pull that off?
You don't work there.

62
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,541
Well, no, but I'm
a journalist, silly.

63
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:41,166
And as such, I've got
lots of juicy connections.

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,250
He's been given a good offer
to work for another firm.

65
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,416
No one will ever
suspect a thing.

66
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,083
So he just gets another
job and that's it?

67
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,000
No, because after
the first few days,

68
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,375
he'll be unceremoniously fired.

69
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,166
He may not do jail time,

70
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,833
but that's a pretty good
punishment, right?

I've still got a solid
plan to save your mom

73

and get her away from this.

74
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,416
And that plan includes
breaking into Geotech

75

smarter than you thought.

because I'm testing you.

Right, right.

you're not breaking in?

This, friend, is a new

Doctor Arima decided

Why did my dad care about it?

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,458
Almost immediately, its strange

Its molecular bonds
are highly unstable.

Just making contact with air is
enough to change its properties.

That's why it needed to be
crystallized, as you see here.

Of course, it seems as though

Hey, I told you,
I'm a journalist.

316
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,875
My job is all about
finding the truth

317
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,833
that's hidden under
the surface of things.

318
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,000
You may not believe it,

319
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,791
but he and I have
very different goals.

320
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,125
[laughs] Yeah, that's a big
load of bullshit, my friend.

321
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,000
You're just an industrial spy!

322
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,000
[KAORI]
Shut up! Don't be rude.

323
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,416
It's true, isn't it?

324
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,166
You blackmail big companies
for lots of money.

325
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,333
Then, you report on them
on your program.

326
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,708
And you honestly call
that journalism?

327
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,458
Hey, tell us. Who was
your employer this time?

328
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,083
Wasn't it someone
from that school?

329
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,625
We're wasting time chatting
when we should be moving.

330
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,208
We need get out of here, now.

331
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,791
Yeah, a fair point.

332
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,708
I want you to know how fun this
was for me, you little prick.

333
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,958
I'm so glad. Because now
you're going to jail.

334
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,333
Look, this is already over, kid.

335
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,833
With all the evidence
against you,

336
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,000
no one will believe
a word you say.

337
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,333
I don't know.
Are you sure about that?

338
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,250
[TOYOTOMI] Oh, God. Are you
getting off on this, you freak?

339
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,666
My!

340
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,291
Nah, I just wanted
to make sure folks

341
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,875
could hear everything
you had to say.

342
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,333
[BOTH gasp]

343
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,958
[TAKUYA]
So I borrowed this baby.

344
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,541
Every guard on duty in
this facility is a witness.

345
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,625
[TOYOTOMI, KAORI gasping]

346
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,083
We heard it all,
you piece of crap.

347
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,208
[BOTH gasping]

348
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,208
Game over, bitch.

349
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,625
[TAKUYA] Because in the end,
the good guys always win!

350
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,958
[TOYOTOMI]
Ah! Don't push me!

351
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,083
Listen, this woman's
responsible for it all!

352
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,416
I want you to call
my lawyer, now!

353
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,833
I'm so grateful.

354
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,375
Thanks to you, I can actually
continue with my research now.

355
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,791
Dad asked you to do it?
Is that right?

356
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,958
Yeah. He wanted me to develop

357
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,875
a crystallization process that
would stabilize its properties.

358
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,625
The light went out of it.

359
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,833
That's because it
touched the air.

360
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,666
We haven't succeeded in
perfect crystallization yet.

361
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,208
I didn't get it.

362
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,958
I never could understand why he
was so obsessed with this stone.

363
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,333
But...

364
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,666
That journal he was always
writing in his study.

365
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:56,583
[AYUMI] I found it one day,
when I was cleaning the room.

366
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,333
[TAKUYA]
What did it say?

367
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,333
It was simple. Despite all
the time that had passed,

368
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,875
he was still very much
in love with your mother.

369
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,000
That's what his
research was about.

370
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,041
It was all for her.

371
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,625
Uh!

372
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,000
What's going on?

373
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,166
It looks like it's time for
you to leave this world

374
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,291
and return to your own, Takuya.

375
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,833
[TAKUYA gasps]
What do you mean?

376
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,708
This was in his journal, too.

377
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,791
He talked about parallel
worlds quite a lot.

378
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,416
I don't know what
world you're from,

379
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,125
and I don't want to know
any details, but...

380
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,750
Return to your path.

381
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,708
The one you really
belong to, okay?

382
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,541
Thank you, Takuya.

383
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,458
[clock ticking]

384
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,916
[TAKUYA]
Dad?

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,750
[KODAI] It's impossible
to resist causality.

386
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,291
This is the correction of chaos.

387
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,416
[TAKUYA]
The correction... of chaos?

388
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,000
It seems that you weren't meant
to be in that world after all,

389
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,625
so a correction must be made.

390
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,458
You will be sent back
to where it all began.

391
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,416
[TAKUYA]
Wait, what are you saying?

392
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,416
It's fairly simple, really.

393
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,083
You'll experience the
same events over again.

394
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,250
Only this time, everything
is going to play out

395
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,000
slightly different than before.

396
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,750
[TAKUYA]
How do know that, though?

397
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,375
I don't understand.

398
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:41,541
All events, whether past,
present, or future--

399
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,458
All that was, is, or will be,
is ruled by the Tree of Vrinda,

400
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:46,750
against which I rest.

401
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:50,541
[TAKUYA]
I knew it. You're still alive!

402
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,916
Takuya, remember this.

403
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,333
Causality rules over
everything in this world.

404
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:00,583
To discover its vast and deep
secrets is to explore history.

405
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,458
[TAKUYA]
What does that mean, though?

406
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,833
Hey! Dad! Answer me!

407
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,958
Answer me!

408
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,750

[YU-NO] Episode 7:
"The Cause of the Curse."
