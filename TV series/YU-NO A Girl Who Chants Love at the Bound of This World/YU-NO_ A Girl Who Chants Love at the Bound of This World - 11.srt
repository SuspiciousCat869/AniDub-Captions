00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:16,025
[TAKUYA]
Uh?

3
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:17,400
[KEIKO]
Takuya.

4
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:18,775
Don't worry.

[gasps]

6
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,983
[KEIKO]
I'm here.

7
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,525
I'm right here beside you now.

8
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:36,775
[KEIKO]
You must help her.

9
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:37,983
[TAKUYA gasping]

10
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:41,733
Don't be afraid to help
the one you love.

11
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:43,358
Mother?

12
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:37,400
Uh?

13
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:38,567
Huh?

14
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,150
Hey, you okay?

15
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,317
What's wrong?

16
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,525
I just had a weird dream.

17
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:48,400
About my mother.

18
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,067
About Ayumi?

19
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,692
No, my birth mother,
actually. Bizarre.

20
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:54,858
Heh.

21
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:58,483
Guess I'm in worse
shape than I thought!

22
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:02,150
In my dream, she was standing
right over there, by the water.

23
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,983
I'll be right back, okay?

24
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,942
[gasps] Wait up!

25
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:22,608
[gasps]

26
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:23,983
What?

27
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,442
[TAKUYA] There's something on
the other side of the waterfall.

28
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:35,858
[MIO]
Well?

29
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:36,983
[TAKUYA]
I was right!

30
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,317
Hold on. I'm gonna grab it.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,692
[MIO]
Be careful!

32
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:49,317
[MIO]
You okay?

33
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,525
Yeah.

34
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,442
How beautiful.

35
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:56,942
It's a jewel.

36
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,608
Was my mom trying to
tell me it was here?

37
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:02,233
Do you know what
kind of jewel it is?

38
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:05,567
It's actually a really
important one.

39
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,983
It was in my dad's last message.

40
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:09,608
An important jewel, huh?

41
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:12,400
Ah! So, you're interested
in family jewels, are you?

42
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:15,525
I'd be happy to show you a
couple more if you'd like!

43
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:18,733
Even at a time like this.
You are seriously the worst.

44
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:21,233
Aww, thanks for that,
now I'm blushing!

45
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:23,067
It wasn't a compliment!

46
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,233
So, what'd your dad say
the jewel was for, anyway?

47
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,733
Okay let's see,
how do I explain this?

48
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:31,150
When a man and a woman love
each other very much,

49
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,317
his " family jewels"--

50
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,483
Not those! Can you
be serious right now?

51
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,858
Sorry about that.
I think it's time.

52
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:42,733
I feel ready to tell you
the truth about everything.

53
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:44,358
Okay.

54
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:48,858
When you were on your way in,
you saw Imagawa's body, right?

55
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:51,650
And I assume you
read her journal, too.

56
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,942
Yeah, of course I did.

57
00:04:57,025 --> 00:05:00,400
Well, remember the Reflector
Device that she wrote about?

58
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,692
This is it.

59
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:04,442
I don't understand.
How do you have that?

60
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:06,858
My dad left it to me.

61
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:09,650
[TAKUYA]
You can actually use it

62
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:12,317
to travel to an alternate,
parallel world.

63
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,442
Huh?!

64
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,150
You can set a certain
time and place

65
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,192
and go straight back to it.

66
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,067
That's unbelievable.

67
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,108
Uh-huh, in fact,
I'm on a repeat trip now.

68
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:25,858
I'm the only one who can
travel when I use it.

69
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:28,692
Otherwise, I would love
to take you with me.

70
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:34,733
Wait, what time and place
is the device set to now?

71
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,900
Mount Sankaku's entrance.

72
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:40,067
Just before we came
inside to look for you.

73
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,358
[MIO] So, then,
if you have to do it again.

74
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:47,942
All this time you
and I spent together,

75
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:50,483
and even that kiss
that you gave me,

76
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:54,442
it'll be like they
never even happened.

77
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:59,608
Uh. Don't worry.
That isn't going to happen.

78
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,067
Because we're gonna get
out of here safely.

79
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,067
Look at this.

80
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,900
The cave goes on
behind the waterfall.

81
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:11,025
I'm thinking it may
lead to an exit.

82
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:13,942
My mom must've wanted
me to see this.

83
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,483
C'mon!

84
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:19,358
[gasping]

85

[YUKI]
Boss!

86
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,900
[sighs] What do I do?

87
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:31,650
I can't believe it's morning.

88
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,983
The construction's gonna
start any minute now,

89
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,525
and then they'll find us here!

90
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,692
They'll probably call
the police on us!

91
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:39,567
[KANNA]
What are you doing here?

92
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,108
They're here!

93
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,775
Oh.

94
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:44,442
Hatano?

95
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:48,067
I told you so many times to
stay away from Mount Sankaku.

96
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,317
Yeah, I know. I, um...

97
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:53,817
[KANNA]
Wait, did someone go inside?

98
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,900
Well, yeah. It looks like
Shimazu went in there yesterday.

99
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:02,025
And now, Mitsuki and the boss
have both gone in to find her.

100
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:06,275
[KANNA]
Not good.

101
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:07,483
If they happen to reach

102
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,192
that location deep
inside the mountain...

103
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:12,108
[YUKI]
Uh, what location?

104
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,233
...they'll be in danger.

105
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:17,317
Okay, back up a sec. Danger?

106

[rumbling]

107
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:22,233
What do you think is
making that sound?

108
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,775
It's coming from deeper within.

109
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,525
[TAKUYA]
What is this place?

110
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,692
It's obviously a mess, but it
looks like it was nice once.

111
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:42,025
Hm?

112
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,275
Amazing, this palace
is 8,000 years old.

113
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:54,442
Not that I wanna
move in or anything.

114

[TAKUYA gasps]

115
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:58,733
What is it?

116
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,525
I guess this was
the hero's sword!

117
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:07,150
Hey, are you positive
that's a good idea?

118
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:11,275
Ha, ha! Yep, it is, 'cause I'm
gonna become the legendary hero!

[grunting]

"It's dangerous to go alone.

Here, take this, for it will
be useful on your quest."

123
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,775
I sincerely hope that we never
have to test that theory.

124
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:28,108
Well, better safe than
sorry, though, right?

125
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:31,025
You should find something
for yourself.

126
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:32,692
I don't know, I'm pretty
sure there aren't

127
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:34,858
any recovery potions
in this place.

128
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:36,483
Yeah, you're probably right.

129
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,525
Know what never needs
a recovery potion?

130

My dick.

[BOTH gasp]

133
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,233
That sound isn't letting up.

134
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:50,233
That's strange,
it sounds like a machine.

135

Uh?

136
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,233
Whaddya think?

137
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:01,067
The only path leads towards it.

138
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,525
Let's go.

00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:18,733
Any ideas on how to open this?

00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:20,400
[TAKUYA]
I got it.

Now we can get through.

What the heck is this?

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,942
[MIO] Huh? What's a machine like
that doing inside a mountain?

148
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:51,817
[TAKUYA]
This is crazy.

What the hell is this thing?

150
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,317
[MIO]
I don't understand.

151
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,983
How could something that
tall fit down here?

152
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,733
There's only one part
of the mountain

153
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,983
where it would be able to.

Don't tell me...

Hurry up!

I need you to get that
stuff out of here!

Hey! Will you wait up a minute?

Why're we running?

00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:19,942
If the device activates,
more people are going to die.

What device?
What're you talking about?

Worse, if the two of them
happen to be below the device,

then it isn't only the

than you're giving me!

That's incredible.

You really think this thing
was built 8,000 years ago?

I would assume that the two

is a lightning generator.

it's morning and Geotech

Yes, very good. You really
are a smarty-pants.

183

When you try to remove
the psychite from this area,

184
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,275
the device automatically
activates and creates lightning.

185
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:39,858
[gasps] The light
blazes from the tower,

Have you been aware of
the device this entire time?

Oh, yes, we were already aware
of the device's existence,

how to get inside.

done here, Shimazu.

Ryuzoji's power has
her totally hypnotized.

So the Legacy hypothesis
belongs to Ryuzoji!

00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:25,483
[YUKI]
Shh! Keep it down!

326
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,317
We're kinda trespassing
right now,

327
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,608
so we can't let him find us.

328
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:32,483
How did you know where
to find us, anyway?

329
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:33,942
It was Hatano.

330
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:35,900
She told me you'd be here.

331
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:38,525
So you knew about it--
the passage.

332
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:39,650
Someone told me.

333
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,608
Uh, Care to be specific?

334
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:43,400
[YUKI]
Anyway, Shimazu.

335
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,775
Uh?

336
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:47,858
I, um, uh...

337
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:51,775
It's just that I owe you
a pretty enormous apology.

338
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,650
I'm the one who hung that stuff.

339
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,275
The flyers!

340
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,358
[gasps]

341
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:00,067
[YUKI] It's just...
I was feeling jealous

342
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,067
of how you and the boss were
getting so close. And I'm...

343
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,025
I'm just really
sorry I hurt you!

344
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,067
I'm really thankful
that you're both safe.

345
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,942
So incredibly thankful!

346
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:20,192
Hey, it's okay, Yuki.
Please don't cry.

347
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:21,317
[YUKI]
Huh?

348
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,483
[MIO]
Mm-hm.

349
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,275
Guess that solves
everything here, then.

350
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:33,942
Uh.

351
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,067
What the hell?
What're you doin', Boss?

352
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,608
It's the correction
of chaos, again.

353
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:42,983
It seems this isn't where you
actually belong, Arima.

354
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,983
You're right.

355
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,817
Sorry, Mio. But it looks
like I won't be able

356
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,692
to use the Reflector Device.

357
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,692
Wait, what about Ichijo?

358
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:53,358
Hey, don't worry.

359
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:56,442
I'll find Ryuzoji
and work it out.

360
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:59,442
In a different time,
in a different place.

361
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,025
I gotta go now.

362
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:02,942
[MIO, YUKI gasp]

363
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:06,275
Try not to freak out
when I disappear, okay?

364
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:07,567
Later.

365
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:10,692
[MIO, YUKI gasp]

366
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,275
[clock ticking]

367
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:18,900
[KODAI]
Ah, yes, I see.

368
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:21,067
So, you saw the device
that's hidden

369
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,317
under Mount Sankaku, did you?

370
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,650
[TAKUYA]
Dad.

371
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:30,150
[TAKUYA] I need you to tell me,
what was that thing?

372
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,775
And what the hell is that
bastard Ryuzoji after?

373
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:36,067
As always, you do nothing
but ask questions.

374
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,150
Maybe you should try using
your own brain, for once.

375
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:42,150
Although I know you,
your ant-sized brain

376
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,775
may not be capable of
intelligent thought.

377
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,483
I would've greatly
preferred to tell you

378
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:52,483
about Ryuzoji in writing
of course, but at that time,

379
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,233
I still hadn't become
aware of the fact

380
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:56,608
that he was actually
something else.

381
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,233
[TAKUYA] What do you mean,
"something else"?

382
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,442
Just that.

383
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,192
He's something
different and beyond

384
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:02,983
what we've ever seen before.

385
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:06,400
As for what that is,
even if I don't tell you,

386
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:08,817
you'll learn the truth
of it soon enough.

387
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,483
You can count on it.

388
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,025
