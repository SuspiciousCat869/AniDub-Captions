[chattering continues]

4
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:23,775
[ERIKO] We can assume
there's some reason

5
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,067
she needs to stay
near Mount Sankaku,

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,650
and that it's most
likely related

7
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:30,317
to whatever reason she had
to keep transferring schools.

[gasps]

00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:36,525
That's why I asked you to
make sure that she was okay.

You've picked up on it,
haven't you?

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,483
The fact that her secret
is deeply connected

12
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:41,942
with your parents.

13
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:43,817

I think you get what you
have to do now, right?

17
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,067
Yeah.

18
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,567
Did you see what
was on the board?

19
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,775
That's crazy.

Are you sure?

00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:03,983
Yeah, I heard she's gonna
be transferring soon.

22

So she's expelled?

00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,483
Is it me or is this
getting outta control?

[rattling]

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,483
Well, what do you want?

33
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,692
You were the one I saw on
the beach when I was a kid.

34
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,817
I know it was you.

35
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:20,900
[TAKUYA] You haven't aged
a bit in 50 years.

36
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,608
That's why you keep
transferring schools

37
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:25,400
around Sakaimachi.

38
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:28,608
So no one will suspect your age.

39
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:31,567
Tell me I'm wrong.

40
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,150
[KANNA]
So, is that it?

41

00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:35,983
Is that all you want to ask?

00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,608
That clears it up for you?

44
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:42,942
I do want to know more
about you than your past.

45
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,400
A whole lot more.

46
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:48,108
I want to know everything
there is to know.

47
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:52,733
When I'm with you, it's like...

48
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:56,233
It's hard to explain,
but it's like I'm with family.

49
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,233
Kinda weird, right?

50
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:03,025
With family? Really?

51
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,150
Just tell me what you can.

52
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,900
Don't say anything
you don't want to.

53
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:13,733
All I'm hoping for... is to
know you, and how you feel.

54
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,900
[KANNA]
Once, there was a young girl.

55
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,900
A girl without a father.

56
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,317
She lived alone with her mother,

57
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,067
whom she loved more
than anything.

58
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,608
[KANNA] Her mother was
more like a sister to her.

59
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:40,025
She was her best friend.

60
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:42,858
But the trouble was,
the two of them couldn't stay

61
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,358
in one place for very long.

62
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:48,567
They simply didn't age
the way normal people did.

63
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,525
So, as the years passed by,

64
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:53,608
both of their appearances
remained the same.

65
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:59,942
[KANNA] Eventually,
her mother passed away.

66
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:05,483
The girl cried and cried,
and she cried some more.

67
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:09,025
She knew she couldn't bear
to go to an orphanage,

68
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:12,817
so she decided to live
on her own from then on.

69
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,067
She soon learned how hard
it was to survive alone,

70
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,483
but she also made a discovery.

71
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,775
Somewhere along the way,
she'd become a woman,

72
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,192
and she craved human connection.

73
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:25,775
But soon it was clear:

74
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,983
that was easier done with
bodies than with minds.

75
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,650
So she sought it out.

76
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:34,233
That connection she thought
would numb the pain.

77
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:37,817
She felt pathetic and
worthless all the time.

78
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,400
Poor fool. She couldn't
forgive herself.

79
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,192
So many times, she thought

80
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:46,400
about leaving all this behind
to be with her mother.

81
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:48,233
But right before she died,

82
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:51,442
her mother had said
something to her.

83
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:54,650
"As long as you don't
die, there is hope.

84
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:59,150
And as long as there is hope,
there is possibility.

85
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,525
As long as there is possibility,

86
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:04,942
you must promise to
continue to live."

87
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,692
So she did as she was told.

88
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,692
She did her best to survive,

89
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:11,692
even though all she
wanted to do was go.

90
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:20,942
One fateful day, she met a man.

91
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:24,483
A friendly man,
who laughed and smiled at her.

92
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:28,317
And the quiet, elegant
woman by his side.

93
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,775
The two were like
husband and wife.

94
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,817
And their home was full
of kindness and warmth.

95
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,108
They told her they'd
take her in.

96
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:40,858
And they gave her love and
affection, like true parents.

97
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:45,400
Heh. So the old bastard
did one thing right.

98
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:48,942
[KANNA] But neither
of them are here now.

99
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,442
Because of that, the girl
was left on her own again.

100
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:57,233
There was really nothing
left for her to do now,

101
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,692
except maybe sit around feeling
sorry for her pathetic self.

102
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:02,275
[TAKUYA]
No! That's not true!

103
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:04,400

Yuki and Mio, huh?

Look, you don't
have to say that.

00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:13,317
I know how you must
look down on me now.

108

like this without judgement?

I'm not doing that!

I can't stay here
with you, okay?

[YUKI] Yo, Boss, you left
this behind earlier!

Oh, sorry. See ya.

Hey, you just got to see
Kanna, didn't you?

00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,525
So? Is it all true?
Is she really leaving school?

132
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:50,942
She seems pretty
set on it, yeah.

133
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:53,692
She also said she's moving.

134

Man, right when we finally
got to know her.

135
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:59,942
Wait, she told you all of
this and then you just left?

136
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,108
She said she couldn't
stay with me.

137
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,442
She actually said those words.

138
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:06,858
There's nothin'
left for me to do.

I've never known you
to give up so easily.

143
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:18,317
Don't say that, you don't
even know what's going on!

144
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,858
It's complicated.

145
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:21,983
True. I don't know a thing.

146
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,983
That's totally fair.
But I didn't think you'd ever

147
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:29,817
walk away from a friend
when they needed you most.

148
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,067
When we were all at the beach,

149
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,775
I don't think I'll ever be
able to forget that day.

150
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:41,025
I didn't know Kanna was even
capable of smiling like that.

I don't know what's
going on with her,

but I do know one thing.

153
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,775
She didn't need you to
leave her alone today.

154
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,983
She was just protecting herself.

155
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:53,192
Sometimes, when people
really care about you,

156
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:56,067
they push you away deliberately.

157

[TAKUYA, HOJO gasp]

He left and went to
a different place.

211
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:47,400
It's a separate
dimension from this one.

212
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,817
[KODAI] By now, you've heard
of Dela Granto, haven't you?

213
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,150
[KANNA] It's where my mother's
from, isn't that right?

214
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,983
Dela Granto exists in an
entirely different universe.

215
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:04,525
However, once every 400 years,
when it approaches Sakai-machi,

216
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:06,400
there's always a
small group of people

217
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:09,400
who cross over
into this dimension.

218
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:12,942
So, wait, are you saying
my mother and Keiko...

219
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,358
Yes.

220
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:15,942
Keiko is...

221
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:17,150
No.

222
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:20,275
I should call her
by her true name.

223
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:23,775
Keitia... is gone.

"I must go on a journey
for the next me."

before she left.

What is that?

228
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:35,775
[KODAI]
She left this here for me.

229
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:39,108
She must've brought it
from Dela Granto.

230
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:41,067
It's not anything that
could've originated

231
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,608
from this world, that's certain.

232
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,317
[KODAI]
History does not repeat itself,

233
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,817
because history
only flows one way.

234
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,358
But the flow of time
is different.

Keitia was the one who
made me certain of this.

That's why I've decided...
I'm going to see her.

the real reason my dad left

00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,233

00:18:18,608 --> 00:18:20,858
[TAKUYA]
It's because of this thing.

323
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:24,400
So, then, if I go back
before it broke...

324
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:27,108
[HOJO groaning]

325
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:32,400
I can't.

326
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,733
Going back won't change a thing.

327
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:36,983
It'll just keep happening.

328
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:46,650
[footsteps]

329
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:55,942
This is really bad--
her fever is worse.

330
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,317
Hey, Kanna,
what is that pendant?

331
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,650
It's quite literally
the flame of my life.

332
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,067
The center is made of psychite.

333
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,775
What Geotech wanted?
The psychite?

334
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:22,067
You're talking about the stuff
under Sakaimachi, right?

335
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,650
They said they hadn't succeeded
in crystallizing it yet.

336
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,442
Remember, this is a
different dimension.

337
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:31,192
The only place where the
stone naturally exists

338
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:32,775
is in Dela Granto.

339
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:34,775
I didn't know it was only there.

340
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:37,025
It's true.

341
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:40,900
It can't be crystallized here,
doesn't work in this world.

342
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:44,192
[TAKUYA gasping]

343
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:46,525
I'm really sorry.

344
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:47,733
I...

345
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,525
I think it's over.

346
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:51,025
Don't say that!

347
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,775
I finally found true friends.

348
00:19:53,858 --> 00:20:00,025
You told me I'm not alone
and wanted to live with me.

349
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,442
[TAKUYA]
I'll get you some psychite!

350
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:03,900
[KANNA exhales]

351
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,483
I promise you!

352
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:08,108
I'll have to go get it
from another dimension!

353
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:09,567
Wait for me!

354
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,817
You just keep holding on!

355
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,692
[KANNA]
I guess it's finally time.

356
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:23,275
Kodai gave me one last message
to pass along to you.

357
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:25,858
So I'll tell you now.

358
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:30,025
[TAKUYA panting]

359
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:32,275
[KANNA]
To go to Dela Granto

360
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:35,942
you'll need eight
jewels in total.

361
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,400
The last jewel is in his study,

362
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:42,483
and it shouldn't be
too hard to find.

363
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:45,233
It's inside the
grandfather clock.

364
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,900
[KANNA] Once you've
collected all of the jewels,

365
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,650
go to the caves under
Mount Sankaku.

366
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,483
[KANNA]
The burial chamber, in the back.

367
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,317
[TAKUYA panting]

368
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:13,025
Here we go, Kanna.

369
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,775
It's time for this to end.

370
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,483
You're gonna be okay!

371
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:40,942
[TAKUYA grunting]

372
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:45,192
[KODAI] You who bear
the seal of the king.

373
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,358
When light and shadow,

374
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:51,608
heavenly being and devil
combine together,

375
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:57,233
the name of the king will
suddenly appear above thy head.

376
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,567
Speak it!

377
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,483
Speak the name of the king!

378
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,442
The name is...

379
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:10,733
