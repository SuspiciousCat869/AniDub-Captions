[AYUMI]
I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:13,483
Takuya, this is very
difficult to tell you,

3
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:16,900
but even if the ritual
succeeds, the priestess,

4
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,858
Yu-No, will most likely
be annihilated.

5
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:20,817
Uh!

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,400
Thank you, that concludes
my presentation.

7
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,192
So, what did you think?

8
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:28,483
Pretty interesting stuff, huh?

9
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:31,525
So, that means the ritual
we all thought was a lie...

10
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:35,025
The priestess and the Divine
Emperor's involvement...

11
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:38,150
It's real. This proves
that all of it was true.

12
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:39,900
We came here with
one major goal,

13
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:43,442
which was to stop that
ritual, but now...

14
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,650
[AI] If that happens, I think
you'll have a big problem.

[AYUMI]
I'm sorry.

22

Details are hard to predict, but
we know some things for sure.

23
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:48,150
She'll be sent beyond
the dimensional horizon,

24
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,900
but there's a chance
she'll be able to survive

25
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:51,817
in another world.

26
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,483
Although, the chance
is one in ten billion.

27
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,358
So small.

28
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:01,233
Takuya, if the ritual doesn't
happen, then both worlds

29
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:03,608
will be destroyed,
do you understand that?

30
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:07,983
It's all up to her!
Only Yu-No can do it!

31
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:11,608
What do I do, though?
How do I tell her this?

32
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,567
[AYUMI] You'll find a way.
I believe in you both.

says she needs our assistance

actually be kinda fun, right?

Well, it's...

It's about that ritual.

83
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,025
So, um. As it ends up, the
priestess has an important job.

84
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:50,567
And, uh, it's, uh...

85
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,692
You see, it's actually
something only you can do.

86
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:57,358
But, the thing is,
afterwards, you'll, um...

87
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:00,150
You might not...

88
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:03,317
Yeah, I know. You're saying
that I might disappear.

What? You already knew?

90
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:08,317
[YU-NO] Mm-hm. But if
I don't do anything,

91
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,692
you and everyone else
will die, right?

92
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:14,817
Well, yeah. Unfortunately,
that's the case.

93
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Then this is obviously
something I have to do.

94

In fact, it seems I was
literally born to do this.

and save me, won't you?

110
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:10,858
[ADVISOR] You went so far as to
ask the resistance for help.

111
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:12,150
I don't understand.

112
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,108
Why do we need
such tight security?

113
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:17,025
[AYUMI] Because we'll be
fighting Ryuzoji. Trust me,

114
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:19,483
normal security measures
aren't going to be enough.

Forgive me, Divine Emperor,

116

but he just escaped from prison,

do you truly believe he'll
come back here willingly?

is pretty incredible, though.

126

Yeah. It's kinda hard to believe

127
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,733
that it's all about to
disappear, isn't it?

128
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:08,567
[TAKUYA] Only if we don't
do something to stop it.

129
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,692
[AMANDA] True. You're right.
I won't let that happen.

130
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:15,233
The resistance is gonna
do all we can to help.

131
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,608

the ritual a success.

[TAKUYA] You're just like her.
Your sister.

When this is over,

134
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:24,942
I would like to bring some
flowers to her grave.

135
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:28,108
Yeah. I'm sure she'd like that.

136
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,067
[AMANDA]
I guess it didn't end up

137
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,233
being my last night, after all.

138
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:37,525
[TAKUYA] No. There won't be
any more "last nights."

139
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:51,233
You're very committed to your
job, Dimensional Inspector.

140
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:53,108
Yep, I'm stubborn that way.

141
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,025
I'll follow you anywhere
to bring you down.

142
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:58,358
[chuckles] I guess I'll
never be safe, huh?

143
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:01,650
Answer me. Why you annihilated
three event trees?

144
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:04,483
Talk! Why did you
stop the splitting?

145
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:07,275
Look, an A-Class dimensional
criminal like me?

146
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:09,900
We're used to dedicated
agents like you.

147
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,608
We know how to deal
with your kind.

148
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:12,942
Are you kidding?

149
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:15,192
That's the reason you wiped
out those timelines?

150
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:17,608
You let those
innocent people die!

151
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:19,442
All life is self-serving.

152
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,358
It just so happens
I'm no exception.

153
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:24,525
Tell me, what's different
about what I do

154
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:27,358
from the way humans breed
cattle to eat their fill?

155
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,608
Pure evil, that's
the main difference.

156
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:33,733
I can't let you run
free another second!

157
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:38,108
[RYUZOJI]
Oops. It's dangerous to show

158
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:40,483
you too much of my
true form, I'm afraid.

159
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,608
[ERIKO] Oh, please do.
Then I can end this!

160
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:47,650
[RYUZOJI laughs] I'm not ready
to die quite yet, Eriko.

161
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,108
What you and Abel were
researching together,

162
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:52,942
the search for the
root of all events,

163
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,608
I happen to be very
interested in that.

164
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:58,067
No. You can't...

165
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:02,108
What're you--?

[MAN A]
Wow, it's time.

170
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:26,400
[WOMAN A] I can't believe
it's almost over.

171
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:27,817
[MAN B]
Our patience and suffering

172
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,775
are finally gonna pay off!

173
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:36,817
[KURTZ whimpers] 'Kay, now
I'm starting to get nervous.

Oh, yeah? Look at me,
the same as ever!

175
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,567
Huh! That's pretty amazing.

176
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,275
[ASCHE]
Heh! Don't be ridiculous,

177
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:44,442
you're scared to death.

178
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:47,692
You think so? Gimme proof!
Go ahead, do it!

179
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:49,858
It's just obvious.

180
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,858
Really? Well, it's obvious
you're drunk off your ass!

181
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:55,317
Would you shut up?
I'm celebrating!

182
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,650
[KURTZ] Guys! We're all
friends here, okay?

183
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,733
Look at them.
Some things never change.

184
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:03,317
That's oddly comforting
right now.

185
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,650
So, this Ryuzoji guy. Do you
think he's really coming?

186
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,608
Yeah, probably.

187
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:14,067
But I won't let him
stop this. I can't.

188
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,817
[CITIZENS murmuring]

189
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,983
[AYUMI] My people,
we shall now perform the ritual.

190
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,775
The bizarre weather events,

191
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,525
the famines they
caused over time,

192
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:39,275
and the attacks by
the strange monsters.

193
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:41,817
We've survived it,
and it's finally time

194
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,358
for all of that to
come to an end.

195
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,858
You have persevered
through this trying time

196
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:49,650
and endured every
challenge it brought you.

197
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,608
And now the moment has come.

198
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:54,983
The ritual to bring peace
to Dela Granto begins!

199
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:58,608

So, is that...?

00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,775
It's Mother.

205
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:13,733
[AYUMI]
Oh, great Grantia! Come to us!

206
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:17,067
Let your mind enter
into our Priestess!

207
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,025
[gasps] You must be Grantia?

208
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:37,025
[GRANTIA] Indeed. I will now
disable the bodily functions

209
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:41,150
of the priestess. This might
hurt you a little bit.

210
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,150
[YU-NO]
All right.

211
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:44,525
[GRANTIA]
Come this way, then.

[MACHINE] Initiating dimensional

Eighteen hundred seconds

00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:56,150
Sounds like it's going
to take some time.

215
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,692
Yu-No, you can do it.

[BOTH gasp]

217
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,817
The event elements are in flux.

Look!

219
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:13,775
What is that thing?

220
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:14,858
[MAN D]
A bird?

221
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:16,442
[MAN E]
No way.

222
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:17,442
This is nuts.

223
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,567
I don't like the look of this.

224
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:24,108
[CITIZENS screaming]

225
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:25,150
Yu-no!

Wait! What was that sound?

227
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,692
So he's appeared, then.

228
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:31,650
[MALE GUARD A]
Don't panic!

229
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,900
Everyone stay calm!

230
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:37,317
[RYUZOJI]
Well, that's a disappointment.

231
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,900
Looks like I didn't even
manage to scratch it.

232
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,442
[gasps]

233

[BOTH grunt]

234
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:43,233
Ryuzoji!

235
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,733
So, he really showed up.

236
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,525
That was one hell
of an entrance.

237
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,275
[AYUMI]
Tell me, why?

238
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:50,983
Why would you stop the ritual?

239
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:54,567
Why are you eager for the
destruction of both worlds?

240
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,817
Well, perhaps it's because
my life is an eternal one.

241
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,983
So, to me, destruction
is inevitable.

242
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,650
No matter how much
people struggle,

243
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,025
the conclusion that awaits them

244
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:07,733
at the end of eternity
is unchangeable.

245
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:10,525
It's simple. I'm just
making that conclusion

246
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:13,275
come a little bit sooner
for them, that's all.

247
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:15,192
With dimensional collision,

248
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,900
which is the ultimate
catastrophe.

249
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:20,942
Truly a pitiful creature.

250
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:24,650
Living forever has ruined you.
How do you not know?

251
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:27,775
Life is beautiful
because it's fleeting.

252
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:28,858
I'll help you.

253
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:31,192
Someone needs to teach
you that lesson!

254
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:33,900
[ADVISOR]
Activate the device, now!

255
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:46,692
You see? We knew you'd
be coming to stop us!

256
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,775
This barrier is strong.
Unbreakable.

257
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,983
You won't be able to leave here.

258
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,858
So, even without a body,

259
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:56,650
the event collision
will destroy you.

260
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,400
[chuckles]

261
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:01,608
I always was convinced that
you were a clever girl.

262
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:04,483
And look, now you've even
managed to take me as a hostage!

263
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:07,817
Whatever it takes,
the ritual will proceed.

264
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,317
I won't let you touch Yu-No!

265
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,692
[YU-NO] Please, Grantia, can you
tell me what's going on outside?

266
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:17,442
[GRANTIA] Priestess,
you must focus your mind.

267
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:20,233
You must try to let
everything else go.

268
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:21,692
[MACHINE]
Fifteen hundred seconds

269
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:24,025
until complete synchronization.

270
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,400
[AYUMI] Nothing will come
of further conflict.

271
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:29,608
If you're willing to be wise
and let the ritual happen,

272
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:31,525
I promise fair treatment.

273
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:35,192
[laughs] You are
very convincing.

274
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:38,900
But you can't hide the fear
in your heart from me.

275
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:41,192
There are 25 minutes left.

276
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,442
If you really think they'll
all pass without incident,

277
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:46,317
then you aren't as
smart as I thought.

278
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,692
Also, as the ritual proceeds,

279
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,650
you'll find that the
events of Dela Granto

280
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,608
will become more
and more unstable.

Women and children first!

Ah! Really wanted
the rest of that!

286
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,442
Do you think Ryuzoji
is doing this?

287
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:10,733
Forget that and focus!
'Cause if you don't--

Everything's shaking.

00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:20,775
Tell me, is everyone in danger?

291
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:23,692
[GRANTIA] You must focus solely
on the ritual's completion,

292
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,775
not the people. Concentrate.

293
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:27,525
But they'll die...

[GRANTIA]
Priestess,

295
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,275
you'd really sacrifice
billions of lives

00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:35,192
just to prevent the deaths
of a few hundred people?

You're the only one who
can save both worlds.

298
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,858
You know this, right?

299
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:40,733
Yes.

you can accomplish from
within this barrier?

If I'm unable to touch
the priestess herself,

305

then I'll just have to
find some other method.

Oh, really? Like what?

Indeed it is.

Only a few can exist

[KURTZ yelps]

Bodiless creatures!
Amanda! Be careful!

318
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,650
Yeah, I know!

319
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:45,817
[RYUZOJI]
Come on, now.

320
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,733
Have you ever seen anything
quite this magnificent?

321
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:51,733
But how? To do something
on this scale...

322
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:53,025
[RYUZOJI]
I'll give you this:

323
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:55,317
it's obvious you prepared
for my intervention.

324
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,942
It's just a shame that you
didn't prepare any better.

325
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:05,775
That horde has lost its home,
so it's up to me to guide it!

326
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:09,817
Now, go! Go forth,
you lost and wandering souls!

327
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,067
Destroy everything
and bring chaos to all!

[gasping]

330
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:26,358
Damn it! There're too many!

331
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:28,442
Take that! Get outta here!

332
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:31,400
[grunts] Amanda!
What's the plan?

333
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:32,942
[AMANDA gasping]

334
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:36,858
We have to fight, but I can't
believe how many there are!

335
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,608
[TAKUYA] Damn it!
We're way too outnumbered!

336
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:40,817
[MACHINE]
Twelve hundred seconds

337
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,400
to complete synchronization.

338
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,442
How is there still
that much time?

339
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:50,233
Wandering souls, listen
to my voice, and obey!

340
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,067
[gasps] It looks like they're
after the barrier device!

341
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,817
Oh, no! We have to protect it!

342
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,442
--Right!
--We're on it, Boss!

[grunting]

344
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,942
The disruption is greater
than anticipated.

345
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:11,775
Its energy is much stronger
than it was 400 years ago.

346
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:15,275
At this rate, the dimensional
walls will collapse.

347

What the...?

350
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:24,817
Holes are opening in space!

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,942
[TAKUYA]
Be careful Amanda!

352
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,400

00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:50,900
[AMANDA] Let me go!
I'll end up taking you with me!

357
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:54,400
Don't say that!
I'm gonna save you!

358
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:59,233
Takuya, it's okay. Just let go.

359
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:01,400
[gasps] No, don't give up!

360
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:04,317
I guess... I won't
get to visit her.

361
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,608
My sister is gonna be pissed.

362
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:08,858
[TAKUYA grunts]
No! Stop this!

363
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:13,192
Takuya. I really am
so glad that we met.

364
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:18,858
Thank you for being with
me on my last night here.

365
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,442
Amanda.

00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:29,858
Amanda!

[TAKUYA gasping]

368
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,942
Is she gone?

369
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:38,817
We lost Amanda?

370
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,067
So, she disappeared beyond
the dimensional horizon.

371
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,483
Or something else
might have happened.

372
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:47,983
She may have been sent to
a different world, like us.

373

[MACHINE] Nine hundred seconds

Fifteen minutes to go.

00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:06,942
I wonder... How many
are going to die?
