1
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:10,692
Kunkun...

2
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:14,692
I want to be one with you.

3
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:17,358
I want to...

4
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:20,442
Will you please...

5
00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,567
...let me do that?

6
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,358
[AMANDA]
It was her last wish.

7
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:28,942
[TAKUYA gasping]

8
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:30,608
Honor that.

9
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:34,025
It's okay.

10
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:37,358
I love you... Papa.

11
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:20,400
[AMANDA] You should really
try and get some rest.

12
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:24,192
We'll need to get
moving by sunset.

13
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:26,775
This is what that
lizard wanted, Takuya.

14
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:29,858
Don't call her that!
Her name's Kunkun.

15
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,192
[AMANDA]
Listen, you had no choice.

16
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:36,692
"As long as there's possibility,
you must continue to live."

17
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,192
Do you know what's killing me?

18
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:47,817
That I didn't get to
say goodbye to Ailia.

19
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,025
Did she ever mention me?
Anything at all?

20
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:55,900
She wondered where you were
and what you were doing.

21
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,483
So, yeah.

22
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:01,567
[AMANDA] Heh. It felt like all
we ever used to do was fight.

23
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,692
And after I ran
away from home,

24
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,858
I never saw her again.

25
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:11,442
That's how families are,
in my experience.

26
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,400
[AMANDA]
It's just that...

27
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:18,192
...she was a knight
of the Imperial City.

28
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:19,567
I think she would've hated me

29
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,692
for being a part
of the resistance.

30
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:25,442
What's funny is
you're both so alike.

31
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:26,317
[AMANDA]
Mm?

32
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,317
You go about it differently,

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,525
but both of you are fighting
for Dela Granto, you know?

34
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:34,858
The only difference is
the size of your rack.

35
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:36,983
[gasps] Now, look...

36
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:40,858
I know my sister's more
traditionally feminine, okay?

37
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:44,858
Still, though. I... can't
believe that stuck-up girl won.

38
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:46,733
What are you talkin' about?

39
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:49,067
You know. You were
her man, right?

40
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,567
Are you kidding? No way!

41
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,358
She woulda beheaded me if I
stepped foot in her bedroom!

42
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,275
Really? Is that true?

43
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:00,275
Yep! So, does this mean
you're still a virgin, or--

44
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:02,025
[AMANDA screams]

45
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,525
Look, I've been very busy
with the resistance, all right?

46
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:06,775
I just don't have any time
for men, that's all!

47
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:07,942
Hey, wait!

48
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:10,650
[AMANDA] It's sunset!
We're heading out!

49
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:21,775
[TAKUYA]
I wonder if everybody got away.

50
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:24,275
I hope Kurtz and Deo
are both safe.

51
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:28,108
I wouldn't worry. They're tough.

52
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:30,650
Damn you! We're gonna
make you pay!

53
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,692
Oh, yeah? Good luck with that.

54
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:34,900
[KURTZ]
Deo!

55
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,817
It's Leader and Boss,
they're both gone!

56
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,192
We searched for them
under the rubble, too.

57
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:42,483
Well, knowing the two of them,
they're probably safe

58
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,858
and already on their way
to the imperial city.

59
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:46,733
Let's head out before the
Divine Emperor comes

60
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:48,775
for the priestess's coffin!

61
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:54,400
[GUARD A] The coffin
hasn't arrived yet, sir.

62
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:55,983
[ADVISOR]
Any word from Bazuku?

63
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:59,150
[GUARD A]
Nothing since last night.

64
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,400
[EMPEROR]
The ritual is close at hand.

65
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:03,233
[ADVISOR] Have someone
sent for it, at once!

66
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:04,567
[GUARD A]
Yes, sir!

67
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:09,317
Wait a minute.

68
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,358
Uh?

69
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,858
[TAKUYA sighs]

70
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,858
That was a little
close for my taste.

71
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:34,483
It means we're getting close
to the capital, so stay sharp.

72
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,150
[TAKUYA]
Wow. Even here?

73
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:51,192
[AMANDA] My guess is, the royal
guards must have killed them.

74
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:54,567
The Divine Emperor is desperate
to keep up the farce.

75
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,317
What do you mean, "farce"?

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,942
It's the Divine Emperor himself

77
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,108
who's been sending monsters
from the border all this time.

78
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:05,025
Fear is his tactic.
He scares people into obeying.

79
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,525
That's impossible.

80
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:08,900
Did you already forget what
happened with Sayless?

81
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:10,150
No.

82
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,442
Your wife was needlessly
killed just to support

83
00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:14,983
the emperor's lies.
That's the real truth.

84
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,150
[growling]

85
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:19,733
The emperor is the root
of our problems.

86
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:22,692
The resistance will defeat
him and reveal his deceit.

87
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:25,525
Even if it's the
last thing that I do.

88
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:29,150
[GUARD A]
Your Majesty!

89
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:32,483
The prisoners are rioting.
They've taken over the quarry!

90
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,942
So, that idiot
Bazuku screwed up.

91
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,400
[GUARD A] We've sent
troops to take it back,

92
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:37,942
but it hasn't gone well.

93
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:40,317
Many have already run away.

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,358
[EMPEROR]
Now that it's less defended,

95
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,900
they'll most likely try
and take the castle.

96
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:46,733
Go, gather up some men.

97
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:50,150
[GUARD A] I would, but we
don't have any left to spare!

98
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,358
[WOMAN]
I will go.

99
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:52,733
[GUARD A, ADVISOR gasp]

100
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:57,025
No, you have a very important
task ahead of you.

101
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:58,192
[EMPEROR]
I'll permit it.

102
00:06:58,275 --> 00:06:59,858
You're sure?

103
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:03,692
[EMPEROR] I am.
This is the will of Mother.

104
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,317
[AMANDA]
The Imperial City.

105
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,067
[TAKUYA]
So, this is where Sayless lived.

106
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,817
[AMANDA] The problem is,
they know our faces.

107
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,817
[TAKUYA]
Maybe we should split up, then?

108
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,275
I'll give you directions
to one of the hideouts.

109
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:18,692
Let's meet up there.

110
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:20,400
Sounds good.

111
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:32,400
This'll do. Though I've
definitely smelled better.

112
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:35,775
Here.

113
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:38,775
[PEASANT C] This is just
as bad as yesterday.

114
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,150
How long do you think
this is going to last?

115
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,733
How am I supposed
to feed my kids?

116
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:45,400
[VENDOR]
Hey now, why the long faces?

117
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:46,900
[PEASANTS gasp]

118
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,900
We're all lucky the Divine
Emperor is looking out for us.

119
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,150
Yes, you're right.

120
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,775
We shouldn't be complaining.

121
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:54,608
Once the ritual's performed,

122
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:59,692
we'll be able to go right
back to our old lives.

123
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:01,025
[TAKUYA]
Um.

124
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:01,900
[gasps]

125
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,108
Could I have some, too?

126
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,650
[VENDOR]
Sorry, but I'm all out.

127
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,233
[sighs] Just great.

128
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:11,733
[VENDOR] Listen,
if you're as hungry as that,

129
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:13,775
go ahead and take mine.

130
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:16,150
Uh. But what about...?

131
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:19,400
When times are tough,
we look out for each other!

132
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:28,983
Some of these are
really good people.

133
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,483
[gasps] That's the wanted
poster Sala had of me!

134
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,817
[GUARD B]
Hey, what are you up to?

135
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,525
Uh. Nothing, really.

136
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:41,067
[GUARD C] Hold on, haven't
I seen you somewhere?

137
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,442
I don't know, have you?

138
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:46,942
[GUARD C]
Hm... Am I imagining it?

139
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:50,442
I'll be going, guys.
Catch ya later, 'kay?

140
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,067
[GUARDS]
Come back!

141
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,608
[GUARD C]
It's the guy from the poster!

142
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:57,775
[GUARD B]
Get him!

143
00:08:57,858 --> 00:08:59,650
[GUARD C]
Stop it, right there!

144
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,900
No I think I'd rather
keep running away!

145
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:02,900
[TAKUYA panting]

146
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:04,525
[GUARD B]
Go to the other side!

147
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:06,483
[GUARD C]
Don't let him get away!

148
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,108
What do I do?

149
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:10,567
[WOMAN B]
This way.

150
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,358
[GUARDS gasp]

151
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:15,567
[GUARD B]
Damn it.

152
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,525
[GUARD C] Where'd he go?
This way! After him!

153
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:25,067
[WOMAN B] Oh, you've put on
a lot of muscle, haven't you?

154
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,483
Wait, I know those curves!

155
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,233
That perfect silhouette.

156
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:33,525
[ERIKO] Ha! I see you
haven't changed a bit.

157
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:34,858
[TAKUYA grunting]

158
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,150
Eriko! It's you!

159
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,025
[ERIKO] That was just
a temporary name.

160
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:43,275
I'll tell you my real name,

161
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:46,275
simplified down to match
your linguistic level.

162
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:49,608
It's Eihriulukwadrol. Got it?

163
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,858
[TAKUYA] Okay, but what are
you doing in this world?

164
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:56,358
Oh, that's right.

165
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:59,692
First things first, let's give
you your memories back.

166
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,233
[gasps]

167
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,192
Now do you remember?

168
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:08,525
[TAKUYA] Yeah, I remember
it all. For instance,

169
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,483
I remember that your
measurements are 33-28-33.

170
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:14,150
At least get it right!
My waist is smaller!

171
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:16,775
Calm down, it was just a joke!

172
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:18,150
[ERIKO]
It's pretty simple.

173
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:19,817
I came to Dela
Granto in search

174
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,025
of the Class A
dimensional criminal.

175
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:24,483
[TAKUYA]
So, Ryuzoji's here, too?

176
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,317
Well, I'm not sure how
he's moving around,

177
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,567
but, yes, I'm 100%
certain that he's here.

178
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,817
And it's my plan to arrest him.

179
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,275
[TAKUYA] You kinda sound
like the time patrol.

180
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:36,942
A dimensional inspector is
pretty different, though.

181
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,733
We're not time patrol.

182
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,150
We can always go back
in time, for instance,

183
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,192
but we can't travel through
the same history.

184
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,858
[TAKUYA] This is starting
to sound familiar.

185
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:49,358
As it should.
There's a man from your world,

186
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:52,567
a well-known German
philosopher, Immanuel Kant.

187
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,150
Ah. Right, everybody's
buddy, Immanuel.

188
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:58,692
[ERIKO] According to him,
our understanding of the world

189
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,650
is formed when the
mind takes the various

190
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:03,525
external stimuli it's given,
and reorients them

191
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:08,317
according to its understanding
of time, space, and causality.

192
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,150
I totally get it, now!
Except that I don't at all.

193
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:13,650
I'm flattered to have
such an eager student.

194
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,275
Well, you're very welcome.

195
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:18,400
Essentially, it's like
Einstein's relativity,

196
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:21,358
Shopenhauer and his
"theory of representation,"

197
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:24,900
and even Heisenberg's
"uncertainty principle."

198
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,942
Causality's all that really
matters. That's the key.

199
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:30,108
Right, causality, I get it.

200
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:33,108
It means the results that come
from a certain cause, right?

201
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,275
[ERIKO] Yes. Events caused
by a certain causal group

202
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:38,692
can create any number
of results groups,

203
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:42,233
depending on what factors
are applied to them.

204
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:47,608
Like roots spreading out
from one central source.

205
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:49,442
The Tree of Vrinda.

206
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,025
[ERIKO]
Indeed.

207
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:54,275
In the beginning, when I was a
new arrival here in Dela Granto,

208
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,567
I observed the flow
of event elements,

209
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,692
and tried to create a predictive
diagram for the Tree of Vrinda.

210
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:03,067
As a result,
I found when the ratio

211
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,317
between the causality
transmission speed

212
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,692
and event viscosity went
above a certain level

213
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:10,858
a phenomena occurred where
certain events became linked.

214
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:13,317
A particular causal
group would be derived

215
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,483
from the results group
that followed it,

216
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:19,233
repeating themselves
as if in a spiral.

217
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:21,942
A causal spiral, you might say.

218
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:24,483
[TAKUYA] In other words, it
doesn't actually go anywhere?

219
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,025
Yes, now you're catching on.

220
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:28,275
Every 400 years
here in Dela Granto,

221
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,483
the same history repeats itself.

222
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:33,025
The 400-year
cycle again, huh?

223
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:36,233
If my dad and Mio hear you
say that, they'd jump for joy.

224
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:38,692
But now I'm curious,
what's repeating?

225
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,608
[ERIKO]
Due to my position as Inspector,

226
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,608
I'm afraid I can't
actually tell you that.

227
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:46,025
What? Then why bring
this stuff up at all?

228
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:47,733
[ERIKO] Regardless,
this world is currently

229
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,775
in a dangerous state.

230
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:52,483
Not to freak you out, but a
collision might be imminent.

231
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:55,317
Okay, not good.

232
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,900
[ERIKO]
I want you to have this.

233
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,483
It's an event
measurement device.

234
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:02,233
It detects disruption
in event elements.

235
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:04,525
[TAKUYA]
It's already shaking in my hand.

236
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:05,650
That just goes to show you

237
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,233
how unstable this
world is right now.

238
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:10,567
[TAKUYA]
But why are you giving me this?

239
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,150
[ERIKO] You have a mission
ahead of you, isn't that right?

240
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:19,983
From here on out, follow
your path without hesitation.

241
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,650
Okay. I guess
I'll be going, then.

242
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:26,858
I do wish I could help
you more, but I'm sorry.

243
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:29,608
My position restricts
any involvement.

244
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:32,567
[TAKUYA] I understand,
but before I go...

245
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,233
Can I say goodbye to the girls?

246
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:35,692
[TAKUYA groans]

247
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:54,567
Give me three nogard's
tears in a shot glass.

248
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:58,775
Yes, I understand, sir.

249
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,567
It's this way, come on.

250
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:08,192
It's down here.

251
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:16,983
Go on.

252
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,733
[REBEL A grunting]

253
00:14:25,817 --> 00:14:27,733
Hey, what's going on?

254
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:29,275
[REBEL A]
You fell for our trap!

255

We know you're a spy
for the Divine Emperor!

256
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:34,400
No! You don't understand.

257
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:35,775
Think you can talk
your way out?

258
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,817
Trust me, son, you don't
even wanna try it!

259
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,400
[REBEL D] You're working for
the masked woman, right?

260
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:44,817
[TAKUYA] Please don't.
I can't take any more torture!

261
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,525
[DEO] Stop it. Let him go,
he's one of us.

262
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:48,900
Boss! We found you!

263
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:51,858
Hey. Good timing, guys.

264
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:55,108
[REBEL A] Seriously? You really
shoulda said something.

265
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,358
Uh, I totally did!

266
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:59,108
Oh, man, Boss!
I'm just so glad you're safe!

267
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:01,442
It's a relief to
see you, too, Kurtz!

268
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,483
The last guy who
called me "Boss,"

269
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,900
things didn't always
turn out so well for him.

270
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,025
Huh?

271
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:09,025
[TAKUYA]
Deo! Glad to see you're okay.

272
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,275
Ha. Well, of course,
don't you remember who I am?

273
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,525
Duh, you're my favorite
porn director!

274
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:16,400
Oh, a porn director, huh?

275
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,567
Hold on, is that a compliment?

276
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,317
[TAKUYA]
Sure thing!

277
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,525
[AMANDA] Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

278

I'm late. Sorry, you guys.

279

--[TAKUYA, DEO] Amanda!
--[REBELS] Leader!

280
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,317
So, it appears that
the Divine Emperor

281
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,233
has chosen another priestess.

282
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:34,650
[REBEL A]
A new priestess?

283
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,983
Per the laws,

284
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,400
one with the blood of her
predecessor was chosen.

285
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:42,067
Wait just a minute.
That sounds like Yu-No!

286
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,775
[AMANDA]
The ritual is in two days,

287
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:47,317
and they're doing all they can
to hunt down the resistance.

288
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,942
Another one of our hideouts
was just completely destroyed.

289
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:52,650
[REBEL A]
It was the masked woman again.

290
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,275
She torched the place.

291
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:57,025
We've lost so many of
our people to her already.

292
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:58,233
Is she skilled?

293
00:15:58,317 --> 00:15:59,817
That's an understatement.

294
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,483
If you run into her, you should
probably just turn tail and run,

295
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,025
you know what I mean?

296
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:08,317
Are you guys bein' serious?
Is now the time to be scared?

297
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,150
You sound like a
bunch of cowards!

298
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,025
So much for the
"resistance," huh?

299
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:15,275
Did he really just
call us cowards?

300
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,442
I'm guessing he
doesn't like us.

301
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:19,317
[REBEL C]
Hmph. The truth is,

302
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,775
we've just been waiting
for our leader's return.

303
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,817
Tomorrow morning,
we will assault the castle.

304
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,775
We end this before
the ritual begins.

[TAKUYA gasps]

313
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:03,025
Is this...?

314
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:05,400
A piece of psychite?

315
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,067
No way! I really did it!

316
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,692
Now, if I can get the
Reflector Device back,

317
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:12,317
I can save Kanna!

318
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,817
[knocking]

319
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,233
[gasps] It's open.

320
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:23,567
Is it okay if I come in?

321
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,442
Sure. Welcome to
my private suite.

322
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,692
You can't sleep?

323
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:36,442
No, I guess I can't.

324
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:40,567
Want me to sing you a lullaby?

325
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,567
It makes total sense
for you to be nervous.

326
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,692
Honestly, it would be a lot
weirder if you weren't.

327
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:50,692
[AMANDA]
Takuya.

[gasps]

329
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:55,525
Here's the thing.

330
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:59,233
This may be our
very last night alive.

331
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:18,900
Takuya. Be with me?

332
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:25,483
You're the only
one that I can ask.

333
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:51,108
[AMANDA]
Per the plan,

334
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:53,150
I'm going to be the
leader of team one.

335
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,692
We'll be entering
through the rear gate.

336
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:57,608
Takuya will lead team two.

337
00:18:57,692 --> 00:19:00,692
You'll be moving in
through the sewers.

338
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:02,275
Is everyone ready?

339
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,775
[ALL]
Yeah!

340
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:09,067
Amanda. You should
use this sword.

341
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,025
It was Ailia's.

342
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:18,233
I'd rather you keep it.
It's better off with you.

343
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:31,025
You're looking tired, pal.
Get some rest, 'kay?

344
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:36,775
[REBEL A chuckles]
Nighty, night.

345
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:39,900
[AMANDA]
Take care of him.

346
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:48,692
Okay.

347
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:59,358
Well? Think we should
take them out, or not?

348
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:02,525
No, we're gonna walk
right past them.

349
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:04,608
[GUARD E]
Hm?

350
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,317
This is the door, here.

351
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:18,317
[TAKUYA grunts]
It won't open.

Hey, stop.

354
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,442
[ALL]
Uh?

355
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,233
[GUARD E]
That place is off limits.

356
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:39,108
Go through the south corridor.

357
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:40,567
[BOTH grunting]

358
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,025
[DEO] This is bad. Do you think
we'll end up stuck here?

359
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:46,108
Seriously? Are you
really that scared?

360
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:49,108
How dare you say that!
What's your proof?

361
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:50,525
[KURTZ]
I only have to look at you!

362
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,108
[TAKUYA]
I don't have a choice...

363
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:54,400
It'll make noise, but...

364
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:58,525
[TAKUYA]
Get back, I'm lighting it up.

365
00:20:58,608 --> 00:20:59,567
[GUARD F]
You there!

366

[ALL]
Uh?

367
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:03,692
I've found you! You filthy rats!

368
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:04,608
It's her.

369
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:07,233
It's the masked woman!

370
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,150
[TAKUYA]
Get going.

371
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,733
[KURTZ]
B-But, Boss.

372
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:13,442
Cool! You handle this.
C'mon, let's go, Kurtz!

[whimpering, splash]

374
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,858
Go and follow those two.

375
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,275
I can handle this.

376
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:20,483

Right!

Why are you...?

Did you completely
forget who I am?
