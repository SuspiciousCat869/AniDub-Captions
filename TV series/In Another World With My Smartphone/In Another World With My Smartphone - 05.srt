00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,375
Why do you all look so glum?

3
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,500
Kohaku just joined the team.
Try and show some enthusiasm.

4
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,833
I'm excited.

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,666
[sighs] We could never be
enthusiastic about this.

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,208
For the record,

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,291
we never would've taken this job
if we'd known it was slimes.

8
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:37,833
They're sending us to a slime
researcher's castle, no less.

9
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,916
How'd we get
ourselves into this?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,458
[GIRLS sigh]

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,208
Why do you hate slimes so much?

12
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,958
They aren't that
dangerous, are they?

13
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,291
[YUMINA] I just instinctively
dislike them.

14
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,166
Especially the green ones.

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,250
They... can melt your clothes.

16
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,833
You hate 'em too, huh?

17
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,791
Well, you can let your elders
take the lead on this one, 'kay?

18
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,041
Their clothes can melt.

19
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,958
So, none of these
slimes have been seen

20
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,708
in the past ten years, huh?

21
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:01,875
That's right.

22
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,208
I feel like we could
just leave them be.

23
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,625
It's not like they're attacking
the local villagers.

24
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,166
Attack or no,

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,458
those poor villagers have had
to live their lives in fear!

26
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,166
Could we call ourselves
true adventurers

27
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,791
if we refused to help them?

28
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:15,958
No, we could not.

29
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,958
I doubt this is
all that important.

30
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,541
What if those slimes were
to attack a village later?

31
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,208
It would be our fault for
not preventing it, right?

32
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,708
[YUMINA] Your motivations
are strictly honorable,

33
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,250
right, Touya?

34

[TOUYA]
Uh... Well, uh...

35
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,333
Yeah, course they are.
You know me.

36
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,250
I'm just in it to
protect the weak.

Are you hurt?!

41
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,333
I thought you said it was
safe in here, Touya!

42
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,125
[TOUYA]
I did, and I meant it.

43
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,583
I'm totally fine.

44
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,500
Touya, look. The basin...

45
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,833
Huh?

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,916
[TOUYA]
A slime?

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,250
Yeah, but I've never heard of
one transforming like that.

48
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,208
I suppose the researcher
here might've created it.

49
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,208
That seems like an
odd thing to make.

50
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,833
Our client said he was
probably dead by now,

51
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,208
but maybe he left notes.

[gasping]

53
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,833
I think this might've
been a book he wrote.

54
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:09,083
But it looks like the slimes
must've eaten the pages.

55
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,875
Yeah, that looks like the work
of a green slime to me.

56
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,750
This one seems to be intact.

Oh, yeah?

58
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,833
[LINZE] I think it's
his research journal.

59
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:20,500
It catalogues the various
slimes he created.

60
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,166
Let's take that with us then.

61
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,625
We can use it to figure out
what we're up against.

62
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,875
We've seen every room
on the first floor.

63

So, let's head up those stairs

I think this guy was trying to
make one slime in particular,

but he mass-produced a bunch
of random ones in the process.

00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,416
I agree. He writes that
it's impossible to tell

have before creating it.

Apparently, their preference is
to accentuate smaller breasts.

164
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Failed again, but I'm close."

165
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,416
Close to what?!

166
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,541
Shred Wind! A Thousand
Blades Born of the Gale!

167
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,916
Cyclone Edge, come forth!

168
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,000
[YUMINA]
I'll grow.

169
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,000
[TOUYA]
Huh?

170
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,375
I'm still developing right now.

171
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,375
Oh. Yeah. Course you are.

172
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,666
Good. This room's safe at least.

173
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,208
[YUMINA]
Huh.

174
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,625
I guess the slime
researcher died here.

175
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,333
Looks like it.

176
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,041
Let's see...

177
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,125
"It's finished.
After years of work,

178
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,291
I've fulfilled mankind's
greatest dream.

179
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,166
Now, I can die without regret.

180
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,416
Yes. I see heaven's light."

181
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,708
The heck is this?

182
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,916
[YUMINA]
Touya, look!

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,166
There!

184
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,375
[YAE] They're transforming,
but into what?

185
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,041
--[TOUYA] Uh?!
--[GIRLS scream]

186
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,375
[YUMINA] Hey! Stop looking,
it's not right!

187
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,833
Help me stop him!

188
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,000
No looking!

189
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,041
[YAE] He can peek
through your fingers!

190
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,541
You have to turn his head!

191
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,333
[ELZE screams]

192
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,958
The land is pure.

193
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,333
Indeed, pure.

194
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,750
Pure as a lamb now.

195
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,541
A roasted lamb.

196
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,541
[TOUYA] So, the "greatest
dream of mankind"

197
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,375
that guy wrote about
was apparently to enjoy

198
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,625
the services of a harem
of naked slime ladies.

199
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,333
Weird guy.

200
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,583
Well, uh. That's off
my bucket list.

201
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,041
[KOHAKU]
Master.

202
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,375
If you wouldn't mind,

203
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,125
I'd very much like to
explore a human city now.

204
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,000
Sure, why not?

205
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,541
But, first thing's first.

206
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,125
Pervy slime dude...

207
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,041
...thanks for comin' through.

208
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,041
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

209
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,458
So much happening in
such a small space.

210
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,875
Yeah, we're pretty much
in the center of town now.

211
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,791
Master, what is Yae doing
to that tiny person?

212
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,500
--[TOUYA] Uh?
--[LIM cries]

213
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,791
Hey, Yae.

214
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,333
What's with the kid?

215
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,833
Good evening, Touya.

216
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:55,875
I just found her. It would seem
that she lost her parents.

217
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,000
Where's my mommy?

218
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,375
[YAE] I've been trying to get
her to tell me her name, but...

219
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,708
...as upset as she is, my
efforts have been for naught.

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,750
[TOUYA, KOHAKU]
Hm...

221
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,583
Greetings, little girl.
What's your name?

222
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,541
Lim.

223
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,750
I see.

224
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,125
Your mom called you that?

225
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:16,833
Uh-huh.

226
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,500
Search: Lim's family.

227
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,750
Did you have any luck?

228
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,333
I'm afraid not.

229
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,708
Search is a cool spell, but it
doesn't have the biggest range.

230
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,666
Enchant... Search.

231
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,291
[TOUYA]
Nice! It worked.

232
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,083
Are you ready to go
see your mom now?

233
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,041
[LIM gasps]
Mommy!

234
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,208
[gasps]

235
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,375
You found me!

236
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,125
Say, if I might ask,

237
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,916
how exactly was your smartphone

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,916
able to help you find
that girl's mother?

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,166
Well, ya see,

240
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,208
search can let me look
for all kinds of stuff

241
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,958
as long as it's nearby.

242
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,333
And this,

243
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,875
has a map of the entire
world I can search through.

244
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,041
But normally, it can only
search for bigger stuff,

245
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,291
like where a shop's at.

246
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,833
Oh-ho!

247
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,500
So by using your enchanting
spell, you were able to combine

248
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,125
the best aspects of
search and your phone!

249
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,541
Yeah, exactly.

250
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,625
Now that I've combined them,

251
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,000
I can search for just
about anything.

252
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,958
Wow! That's amazing, Touya.

253
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,625
Uh! Huh?

254
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,583
Wait. So, in that case,

255
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,791
might you be willing to
find my brother for me?

256
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,875
Don't see why not.

257
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,416
[TOUYA]
So, is your brother missing

258
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
or did you just wanna
know what he's up to?

259
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,208
I haven't seen him
in quite a while.

260
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,833
Not since I left him back
home to go on this journey.

261
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,541
I've kind of been worrying
about him this whole time.

262
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,875
Let's stalk him then.

263
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,083
Could you give me a few
details about your house?

264
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,416
Yes, no problem.

265
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,166
It's right next to
a small shrine.

266
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,416
And there's a lovely cherry
blossom tree in our garden.

267
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,625
[TOUYA]
Hm... Is it in Hashiba?

268
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,875
Indeed it is!

269
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,208
Do you see my brother there?

270
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,541
Well, I can't yet.

271
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,166
First, I'll need
his description.

272
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,625
He has a scar from
battle on his cheek.

273
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,208
Think he's in the dojo.

274
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,625
And he's moving around, so I
guess he might be sparring.

275
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,000
That certainly sounds
like my brother.

276
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,708
He truly loves to
practice with the sword.

277
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,375
Sometimes so much that
he forgets to eat dinner.

278
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,625
Judging from how you talk about
him, you two must be close.

279
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,541
[YAE]
Yes. You have the right of it.

280
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,250
My brother is in equal parts
strong, kind, and generous.

281
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,125
And I love him a great deal.

282
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,375
You know what?

283
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,625
To be honest, you rather
remind me of my brother

284
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,833
in a myriad of ways.
You have his quiet nature,

285
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,833
and you're both quite generous.

286
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,333
Well, if you think I resemble
your beloved brother,

287
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,500
then I'm honored.

288
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,958
You should be honored!

289
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,750
My love isn't-- [gasps]

290
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,166
W-W-W-Wait!

291
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,208
All that I meant to say is that
you resemble my brother.

292
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,708
Okay?

293
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,875
I am in no way implying that
I love you like I love him.

294
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,666
That would be weird!
Who would do that?

295
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,166
Not me! Because I don't.

296
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,208
You just slightly, vaguely
remind me of my brother.

297
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,250
That's all! It's a
simple compliment!

298
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,708
About time our food arrived!

299
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,500
Not that I'm complaining,
everything's fine.

300
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,916
[YAE laughs nervously]

301
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,666
[chewing] Delicious!

302
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,708
[TOUYA]
Yae...?

303
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,583
Yae! Our food budget...

304
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,416
Enchant.

305
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,125
Long Sense.

306
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,416
[TOUYA]
That spell works too.

307
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,833
[TOUYA gasps]
No! No!

308
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,750
Bad! Bad!

309
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,458
[LINZE]
There.

310
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,750
[sighs]

311
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,583
[knocking]

312
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,708
[LINZE]
Touya! Do you have a moment?

313
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,875
Uh! One sec!

314
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,541
'Kay! Come on in.

315
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,333
Is something the matter?

316
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,500
Nope. Everything's
good over here.

317
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,208
More importantly, how are you?

318
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,750
Well, I picked up
some new spells

319
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,291
at the antique shop today.

320
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,041
I've been trying to learn more.

321
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,375
And why might that be?

322
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,083
Remember how at
the slime castle

323
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,375
I couldn't fight with fire?

324
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,750
I'd like to learn more
options next time.

325
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,083
So, I'm studying up now.

326
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,125
I hope to learn a
lot of new spells.

327
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,875
Oh. I gotcha.

328
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,125
Can you help me
with this scroll?

329
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,750
[LINZE]
That bit means "cutter,"

330
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,958
and that's "storm."

331
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,541
This one is "sword."

332
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,583
[TOUYA]
Looks wordy...

333
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,750
[LINZE]
Well, it has several spells,

334
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,333
but a lot of these characters
are in an ancient script

335
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,416
that I'm not familiar with.

336
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,541
Wait...

337
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,416
Modeling.

338
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Enchant:

339
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,125
Reading Ancient Magic Script.

340
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,500
Touya. What is that?

341
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,458
Put this over your eyes
and try reading it.

342
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,166
That's incredible!

343
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,666
I can read everything now!

344
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,166
[TOUYA]
Cool. Any good spells in there?

345
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,291
There's a "Bubble Bomb."
It's a water-based attack spell.

346
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,958
Hm...

347
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,458
Hey, Touya?

348
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,541
I'd like to go give
this spell a try.

349
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,375
Would you mind coming with me?

350
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,750
Come forth, Water!

351
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,375
Ballistic Bubbles!

352
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,416
Bubble Bomb!

353
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,833
It works!

354
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,833
Good. Now to make a big one.

355
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:24,333
[inaudible]

356
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,500
Hey, Linze!

357
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,708
You okay?

358
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,750
Yeah. I'll be all right.

359
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,791
I think I must've...
run out of... mana.

360
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,375
[LINZE]
Come forth, Water!

364
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,916
Ah! Hey! Wh-What are you doing?!

365
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,083
Transfer.

366
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,416
My mana...

367
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,958
It's completely
restored, but how?

368
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,750
So quickly.

369
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,208
[TOUYA] The king's mage taught
me this spell yesterday.

370
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,625
"Transfer." A Null
magic that lets one

371
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,041
pass their mana
into someone else.

372
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,458
[CHARLOTTE] ...the one and
only Royal Archmage Charlotte!

373
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:30,041
[gasps] Thank you very much!

374
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,500
'Kay.

375
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,208
Come forth, Water!
Ballistic Bubbles!

376
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,041
Bubble Bomb!

377
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,250
I know that isn't right, but...

378
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,750
...I just can't seem to grasp

379
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,041
how this spell is
supposed to work.

380
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,458
I see.

381
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,500
If only I'd seen it before.

382
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,708
This would be easy if
I knew what to picture.

383
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,083
Wait. What?

384
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:54,958
Huh?

385
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,416
What's the problem again?

386
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,625
Well, you can't cast a spell
just by chanting its name.

387
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,416
You also have to visualize
what that spell should do.

388
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,666
Well, bubbles are
like foamy liquid.

389
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,416
And a bomb is just a
thing that blows up.

390
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,416
"Blows up"?

391
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,291
Yeah. You know,
like an explosion.

392
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,208
Except, instead of fire,
it's a water bubble.

393
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,875
[LINZE]
An exploding bubble.

394
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,708
Yeah. I'm trying, but
I just don't see it.

395
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,750
Hey, just imagine a soap
bubble getting popped.

396
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:27,208
Only, picture it like a couple
hundred times bigger.

397
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,375
A big soap bubble?

398
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,250
Come forth, Water!

399
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,625
Ballistic Bubbles!

403
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,583
I did it.

404
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,208
It's all thanks to you, Touya.

405
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,541
Thanks for being such
a patient teacher.

406
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,041
I couldn't have done
it without you.

407
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,208
You could've.

408
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,458
That was your own
hard work paying off.

409
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,333
I was just here to
cheer you on a bit.

My poor gauntlet.

00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,666
It's ruined.

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,208
[TOUYA grunts]
It won't break.

I'll handle this!

Guess I'll have to
buy a replacement.

422
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,041
I think you should.

423
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,708
Why not replace 'em both
and get a better set?

424
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,666
I think I will. Wanna
take me to the capital?

425
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,250
I'm not likely to find a
decent set in this town.

[CLERK 5A]
Thank you for your patronage!

Please tell your friends
and come back soon!

[ELZE laughing]
You gotta love the capital.

429
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,958
There's so much stuff to buy.

430
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,291
Although, it's way expensive.

431
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,875
Uh?

432
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,125
These gauntlets are
surprisingly heavy.

Hey, Elze.

434

Let's duck into that
alley and use Gate.

00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,791
You want it?

438
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,583
Huh?! No way! Of course not.

439
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,875
I don't wear frilly stuff.

I just thought that
Linze might like it.

Yeah, that's what I thought.

442
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,791
She'd look great in
something girly like this.

443

I wouldn't be caught dead in it.

[TOUYA]
Oh, yeah?

445

Well if Linze would look good in
it, then I think you would, too.

Wait! Who are you
trying to kid?!

perfectly content with it.

clothes like that.

487
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,333
So, Touya.

488
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,583
Your presence is requested
at the royal palace.

489
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,833
[TOUYA]
Yeah? What for?

490
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,833
As a reward for
saving Father's life

491
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,583
and exposing his
would-be assassin,

492
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,708
you're to be knighted.

493
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,750
[GIRLS]
They're knighting him?!

494
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,208
Is that something I can decline?

495
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,083
[GIRLS]
Decline?!

496
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,708
That's certainly an option.

497
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,666
Although, they'd want you
to state your reason

498
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,458
for doing so in
front of the court.

499
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,208
I gotta go either way.

500
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,416
[YUMINA laughs]

501
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,458
[YUMINA] Looks like
we'll get to visit home

502
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,500
sooner than expected.
