1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,541
Wait.

2
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,125
For real?

3
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,416
[TOUYA] They didn't tell me
it was a friggin' palace!

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,875
So when you turned
down the knighthood,

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,583
the king gave you this instead?

6
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,666
I went to the royal court to
turn him down, like Yumina said,

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,250
and he didn't really
seem that surprised.

8
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,208
Instead, he suddenly
offered me a new house.

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,083
I wonder,

10
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,083
do you think that he was
planning that from the start?

11
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,541
You bet your spell stones.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,375
[TOUYA]
You caught on, too, eh?

13
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:45,333
I think it'll make
a lovely home.

14
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,833
[GROUP gasps, laughs]

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,958
This place is enormous.

16
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,583
How are we supposed to keep
the whole thing clean?

17
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,083
Especially with just
the five of us.

18
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,333
[GIRLS]
Huh?

19
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,791
Huh?

20
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,625
What? Something wrong?

21
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,958
[YAE]
No, but, Touya...

22
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,000
...did you just say you'd like
all five of us to live here?

23
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,291
I thought that was assumed.

24
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,166
I don't think that's what
the king had in mind

25
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,583
when he gave it to you.

26
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,875
He probably meant for you
to live in it with Yumina.

27
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,125
This is a fine home,

28
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,333
but if it's meant to be
your place of bonding,

29
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,875
then it wouldn't be fair
for us three to intrude.

30
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,375
A "place of bonding"?

31
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,250
Well, then why shouldn't
the three of you stay here?

32
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,833
I mean, I like you all the same.

33
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:04,833
Come on.

34
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,958
To me? You're all like family.

35
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,458
Uh!

36
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,750
What's up?

37
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,500
You girls okay?

38
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm gonna go and look
around upstairs, okay?

39
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:19,833
I will also be running upstairs
now to see the attic! That's it.

40
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,791
And I am extremely curious
about the kitchen,

41
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,333
which is why I'm
also running away!

42
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,791
What is all that?

43
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,958
I get it now.

44
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,625
You're not opposed
to starting a family,

45
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,791
your affections
are just divided.

46
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, that's a big step forward.

47
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,625
While I do hope you'll share
your life with me, Touya,

48
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,291
I've no intention
of monopolizing you.

49
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,291
I think this arrangement
could work nicely.

50
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,666
And I suspect that
the others might agree.

51
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,583
I'll talk to them and
feel things out for you.

52
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:52,250
[TOUYA] Huh?! Hold on.
What are you doing?

53
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,708
[KOHAKU sighs]

54
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,208
[TOUYA] Why are they
acting so weird, Kohaku?

55
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,708
[KOHAKU]
Don't ask me. I'm just a cat.

56
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,416
[KOHAKU]
And roll.

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,166
This is a pleasant garden.

58
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,041
You like it?

59
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,541
Yeah! We should stay.

60
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,250
[YUMINA]
Oh, Touya.

61
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,083
So, just to be sure,

62
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,833
you're actually asking all
of us to live with you.

63
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,833
[TOUYA]
Pretty much, yeah.

64
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:20,208
You won't change your mind
later, and kick us all out?

65
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,333
[TOUYA]
Why would I do that?

66
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,041
And Yumina here.

67
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,666
You'll treat all of us exactly
as you would treat her?

68
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,666
Course I will!

All of us will live
here together.

72
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,041
We'll move forward as
we discussed earlier

73
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,083
once you're all sure you've
made up your minds.

00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:36,791
Yeah!

75
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,500
Right!

76
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,208
Everyone's agreed, then.

77
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,208
Made up your minds about what?

78
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm lost.

79

[GIRLS]
It's a secret!

80
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,583
O... kay.

81
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,875
I'm starting to think that your
authority in this household

82
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,375
is rather limited, Master.

83
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,250
My name is Laim, young master.

84
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,708
I'm your new butler.

85
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,750
I've brought on these
ladies of the Maid's Guild

86
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,666
to assist me temporarily.

87
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,500
My name is Lapis, sir.

88
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,583
And my name is Cecile, sir.

89

We're very pleased to meet you.

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,291
These two will handle the
gardens and the kitchens,

91
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,958
and these two shall ensure
the estate's security.

92
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,291
Laim has actually been
my father's chief butler

93
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,833
for as long as I can remember.

94

Huh? Seriously?

95
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,000
Did he do something
to get demoted?

No, sir.

97

I've passed that
duty on to my son.

98

As I have decided to spend
the remainder of my life

99
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,125
serving the man who saved
my younger brother's.

100

Younger brother?

Yes, his name is Liam.

102
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,541
He's currently in the service
of his grace, Duke Ortlinde.

103

Oh! That guy I pulled
the arrow out of.

104
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,916
So, Touya. What do you think?

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,208
If you recommend him, then sure.

Thanks! Glad to have you.

Everyone should
know their duties.

[STAFF]
Sir!

111
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,750
I can't believe the man
who ran the king's palace

112
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,250
is working for us now.

113
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,458
A talented butler is more
helpful than you'd guess.

114
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:07,166
This just goes to show how much
promise everyone sees in you.

115

[LAIM]
Master Touya.

His Grace Duke Ortlinde
and Lady Sushi

118
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,791
[SUSHI]
Touya! I came to see you!

119
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,375
[TOUYA]
Uh-oh, the tickler's here.

120
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,708
I was surprised to hear about

121
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,791
you and Touya's
engagement, cousin.

122
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,000
How'd he woo you?

123
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,666
There wasn't any wooing
that I was aware of.

124
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,375
And here I was contemplating a
marriage between you and Sue.

125
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,875
Well played, Yumina.
You beat me to it.

126
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,000
You should've told me you were
thinking about that, Father!

127
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,250
Oh, well!

128
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,208
It's never too late to
show my feminine allure!

129
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,083
Well, that makes one, yes.

130
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,416
How would a double wedding
please you, Touya?

131
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,000
You know, what would
really please me

132
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,583
is some more of this tea.

133
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,250
Fine. I'll stand down
for today at least.

134
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,750
Thanks for understanding, sir.

135
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,333
I should tell you that I'm
actually here to make a request.

136
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,875
Yeah, what's that?

137
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,708
As you recently became aware,
my brother is contemplating

138
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,541
an alliance with the
kingdom of Mismede.

139
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,958
Naturally, the kings would
like to meet in person

140
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,416
so they may discuss
this matter in depth.

141
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,833
And that's our problem.

142
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,875
Normally, one king would visit
the other at his palace.

143
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,208
But now, the journey
seems too perilous.

144
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,458
And so, I--

145
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,666
You'd like to use
Touya's Gate spell.

146
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,958
That's right, Yumina.
You catch on quite quickly.

147
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,375
[TOUYA]
But, I can only use Gate

148
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,333
to travel to places I've
been to-- Oh, I get it.

149
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,583
Yes. I'm asking you
to travel to Mismede.

150
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,791
That's what I figured.

151
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,750
I am Garen of Mismede.

152
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,458
Well met.

153
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,916
And I'm with the First
Knight Squad of Belfast.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,416
My name's Lyon Blitz.

155
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,375
This journey to Mismede
shall mark the first time

156
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,375
our two kingdom's
soldiers act in unison.

157
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,791
Well, we're glad
to be a part of it.

158
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,208
Getting to travel at a native's
side should be a big help, Olga.

159
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,291
I was about to return to
my homeland, regardless.

160
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,541
We're actually just as excited
to be traveling with you.

161
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,875
Our first stop

162
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,166
will be the city of Canaan,
which is in Belfast.

163
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,958
From there, we will cross
the Great Gau River

164
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,250
to enter Mismede.

165
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,500
Fear not. We shall see that
you get home safely, milady.

166
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,291
I'll be counting
on you, Sir Lyon.

167
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,333
Oh, thanks!

168
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,708
[YAE gasps]
It's this one!

169
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,583
[YUMINA]
Sorry.

170
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,458
Now, let's see about this one.

171
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,291
And... pair.

172
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,416
Nicely done!

173
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,625
Seems I've been
bested yet again.

174
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,583
[TOUYA]
Yae! Why don't we switch out?

175
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,916
You can help Olga here
practice her shogi.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,250
I would love that!

177
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,000
Dolan taught me the basics
back at the Silver Moon.

178
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:42,666
[TOUYA]
Cool.

179
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,708
Hey, Yumina?

180
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,500
Wanna learn blackjack?

181
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,083
[OLGA]
I'm 17!

182
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,291
[TAE]
Yeah, right.

183
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,375
[TOUYA] And so, thanks to
the clever Puss in Boots,

184
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,458
the miller's son was married
to the king's daughter

185
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,625
and they all lived happily.

186
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,833
Yeah, and what happened
after that, Touya?

187
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,250
[gasps]

188
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,291
[GAREN]
What is it?

189
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,791
Armored men approaching.

190
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,916
At least 20.

191
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,208
It's probably a gang of bandits.

192
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,208
Lemme see.

193
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,166
Search for bandits.

194
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,541
8... 12... 20...

195
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,750
I'm counting 28 of 'em total.

196
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,833
Lemme try something real quick.

197
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,125
Enchant Phone: Multiple.

198
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,708
Yeah, this'll work.

199
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,750
Check it out.

200
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,916
I lock on here, and...

201
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,041
Paralyze!

202
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:33,958
[BANDIT 6A yelps]

203

[BANDIT 6E screams]

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,916
What was that?

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,791
I hit 'em with a
paralysis spell.

209
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,125
They should be easy
to round up now.

210
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,041
Huh?

211
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,291
So, what do we do
with these guys?

212
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,583
I'll send a rider to Canaan.

213
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,666
They can send guards
to pick them up.

214
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,583
Thank you, Lyon.
Sorry for the trouble.

215
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,125
Ah! Not at all!

216
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,875
You need not worry
on my account.

217
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm always glad
to be of service.

218
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,916
Pardon, I must make
my men draw straws.

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,416
Ah-ha. So that's how it is, eh?

220
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,708
Oh, to be young.

221
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,416
What a feeling it once was.

222
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,666
I almost miss it.

223
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,250
I barely remember it.

224
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,000
And when did we get old?

225
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,708
It's clear to us that Lyon
has feelings for Lady Olga,

226
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,083
but do you think she knows?

227
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,416
Oh yeah, that girl's
flirtin' hard.

228
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,375
Luckily for him, she's not half
as dense as a certain someone.

229
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,000
Uh? Yeah?

230
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,208
Who's that?

231
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,958
He's certainly slow
to pick up on things,

232
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,958
but he does have a
very kind spirit.

233
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,666
He's super nice to everybody.

234
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,250
Yeah. That does make
up for the dimness.

235
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,916
There's a difference
between being nice

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,625
and leading people on, though.

237
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,083
Do you still not get it?!

238
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,583
Then sit down and think.

239
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,375
But why?

240
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,416

Hey look, it's Lyon. There.

What's up, Lyon?

Hm?

Hey, Touya.

No. I'm... just...
shopping for a gift.

Oh! Nothing romantic though.

249
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,375
I promised my mother that
I'd get her something.

Oh?

Heh!

Pick something, Arma.

253

I'll grab it for you

as a memento of your
time in Belfast.

You've got good taste.

very much, Touya.

Thanks for your business!

likes broaches as well?

263
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,083
[ARMA]
I'm not sure.

264
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,875
It depends.

265
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,041
[gasps] Elius flowers like
this are her favorite!

266

She'd love that.

Well that works out.

Well, see ya later.

with the others now.

Right. Bye.

Very subtle. I'm impressed.

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,125
You figured me out?

273
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,750
Of course. And I think it's
very sweet what you did,

274
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,375
although I would've
liked a present myself.

275
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,166
Sorry about that.

276

Well, the only gift
I really need is

the ring you'll put on
my finger someday.

Thank you, Touya, and sorry.

Don't be. People get sick
on boats all the time.

[OLGA] We could stay
here for the evening

if you don't feel well
enough to travel on.

285
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,916
I'm good. It's just
a carriage ride.

I felt fine once I
got off the boat.

There's no point in trying.

[KOHAKU]
Yes. I felt it, too.

300
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,875
Someone was definitely
observing us,

301
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,541
but they've concealed
their presence for now.

302
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,250
We'll have to keep our
guard up moving forward.

303

[OLGA]
Are you ready to go, Touya?

304
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,541
Yeah, sure!

[TOUYA]
Oh, ho!

306
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,750

hairpiece you're wearing.

00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,166
Yeah? Do you like it?

309

I'm flattered to hear that.

310
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,458
It suits you nicely.

311
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,625
I wish the man I care for
would get me such a gift.

312
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,583
Although, honestly, I'd be
even happier if he displayed

313
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,916
his affection by hugging me
close, or holding my hand.

314
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,416
Welp! Time to go!

315
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,708
It doesn't seem likely

316
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,166
that we'll reach Eld
Village before nightfall.

317
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,125
Then we better find a place
to set camp soon, right?

318
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,458
This forest is full
of magical creatures,

319
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,541
but a party this large
should be safe.

320
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,291
That's a bit
frightening, though.

Kohaku's with us.

00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,666
Those magic beasts
won't even come close.

323
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,958
You're the best, Kohaku.

324
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,625
Yeah!

Hey, are we outta time?

Would you mind if I finished
drying my hair, Touya?

Yeah, but hurry. We don't
wanna make people suspicious.

00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,041
What did we miss?

332
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,375
No one knows,

333
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,916
but the animals seem to be
running from something.

334
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,291
Something big's
heading towards us.

335
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,916
It's flying!

336
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,500
[GAREN]
A dragon.

337
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,291
But what is it doing out here?

338
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,708
This happen often?

339
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,500
No, the dragons normally
stay within the sacred grounds

340
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,041
at the center of our nation.

341
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,791
If the dragons have
left those grounds,

342
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,791
it may be to retaliate
against a trespasser.

343
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,333
You think someone did that?

344
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,916
There is another option.

345
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,500
It's a fairly rare occurrence,

346
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,875
but young dragons sometimes
rampage without cause.

347

[gasps] Uh-oh.

348

straight for Eld Village.
