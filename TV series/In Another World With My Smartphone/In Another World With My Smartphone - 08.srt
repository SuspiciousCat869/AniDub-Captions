Hey everyone, we're home.

[ALL]
It's good to have you back.

00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,916
Hey, Laim, Lapis, Cecil.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,125
How ya been?

5
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,375
[CECILE] Well, with all
of you on the road,

6
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,208
we've been rather lonely, sir.

[chuckles]

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,666
Thanks again for allowing
us to return with Gate

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,625
before you and the others did.

10
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,708
Well, you could hardly be
keeping an eye on Yumina

11
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,125
if you were still stuck
back in Mismede.

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,833
[YUMINA] We brought back
lots of treats and souvenirs!

13
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,291
[LINZE]
Please, help yourselves!

14
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,875
Thank you very much.

15
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:48,583
On the pride of my family, I vow
to cherish these gifts forever.

Ya wanna see
what they are first?

I am beat.

19
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,208
We really need to stop
doing so much.

20
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,666
Yeah.

21
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:05,791
You're right.

22
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,250
No more adventuring, okay?
Let's just be farmers.

[KOHAKU]
Huh?

[TOUYA]
Sorry!

29
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,375
[ELZE]
Look, I'll admit

30
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:51,833
that we probably should've
locked the door,

31
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,041
but I still think you could
stand to be more careful.

32
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,958
If you had the decency to knock
this wouldn't have happened.

33
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:01,458
I know, but I figured that you
girls would've been done by now.

[LINZE]
Touya!

35
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,375
You'll knock, right?

36
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,875
Huh? Oh.

37
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,458
Sure thing.

38
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,166
I have to say, if you'd simply
taken the proper steps first,

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,583
then this wouldn't be an issue.

[TOUYA chuckles]

41
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,166

your lesson, apologize!

[TOUYA]
Good afternoon.

47
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,500
Hail. What do we have there?

48
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,750
Rubber and steel, I'm tryin'
to make a few bicycles.

49
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,750
They're kinda like
mechanical horses.

50
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,625
Ah. I think I see.

51
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,375
Anything I can do for ya?

52
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,916
[ALFRED] For once, no.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,625
I just wanted to thank you again
for your help with Mismede.

54
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,916
But this "bicycle" of
yours intrigues me.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,958
How long will it take
you to make me one?

56
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,666
Well, I'm still figuring it out.

57
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,333
So, I'd guess at
least 30 minutes.

58
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,416
[ALFRED]
I can wait.

I'd rather you didn't.

00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,333

I believe it's my turn now.

[TOUYA]
Kay, now start pedaling.

What do you think, Touya?

How am I doing?

I can ride around
the whole garden now!

Way to go, Yumina.
You're a fast learner.

I just wasn't focusing, ya know?

Fine, but let me get down.

easy to ride, don't'cha think?

My dad's gone.

162
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,333
He went to hunt a magic
beast around a year ago,

163
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,500
and nobody's seen him since.

164
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,750
And my momma...

165
00:08:53,833 --> 00:09:00,083
She died just a little
bit after I was born.

166
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,083
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,666
Renne, would you like
to come work for me?

168
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,166
Huh?!

169
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,000
You'd never have to worry about
food or a place to sleep.

170
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,750
Now, you would have to
do proper work there.

171
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,291
But I'd pay you for it.

172
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,333
So? Whaddaya say?

173
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,208
You'd really let me work
for you? At your house?

174
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,125
On the condition that
you give me your word

175
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,125
you'll never go
back to stealing.

176
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,208
That sound fair?

177
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,708
[RENNE]
Yeah! I-- I won't let you down!

178
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,250
Hey. You clean up good, kid.

179
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,333
Yeah? Ya think so?

180
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,791
From this day forward,

181
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,041
you shall work as a
servant of this household.

182
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,250
Whenever guests are present,

183
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,666
be sure to address Touya
as "sir." Understand?

184
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,375
Yup! I gotcha.

185
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,125
Hi, I'm Cecile.

186
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,750
Come along with me,
and I'll get you started.

187
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,458
I'm off to work, sir.
See you around.

188
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,833
Get to it then.
Have a good time.

189
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:04,958
[RENNE]
Thanks!

190
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:05,916
[door slams]

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,875
Such an unusual girl.

192
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,916
You think?

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,333
By the way, Touya.

194
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,708
Where are the bicycle materials?

195
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:19,083
[gasps] I totally forgot.

196
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,041
[SUSHI]
So, this is Mismede?

197
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,125
I love it.

198
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,416
It was very kind
of you to do this.

199
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,916
I know how badly Sue
wanted to come here.

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,625
Well, thanks to Gate
it's really no trouble.

201
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,208
Touya, let's go home real quick
and grab my new bicycle okay?

202
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,416
I wanna ride it through
town as fast as I can!

203
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,375
That's how you cause accidents.

204
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,208
[YUMINA]
Hey, look.

205
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,833
I think I see Arma there.

206
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,916
What's up, Arma?

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,208
[gasps] Hi, Touya!

208
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,416
Hey. How ya been?

209
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,666
[ARMA]
Good!

210
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,208
I didn't know you two
were visiting Mismede.

211
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,625
We're taking my
cousin out shopping.

212
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,791
Oh. I was shopping as well.

213
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:01,666
[YUMINA]
Oh, right.

214
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,250
Sue, this is our friend Arma.

215
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,958
And Arma, this is Sushi.

216
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,875
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Sushi.

217
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,125
[SUSHI]
Hi! Your ears are super cute.

218
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,125
Can I say that?

219
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,291
[TOUYA gasps]

220
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,833
What's the matter?
See something?

221
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,250
[TOUYA]
Yeah. Look.

222
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,625
Olga's here?

223
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,333
Looks to me like
she's on a date.

224
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,458
So it would seem.

225
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,666
[ARMA]
So, let's follow her!

226
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,666
Wait. We shouldn't impose.

227
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,166
That's why we'll be sneaky.

228
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,291
Wait for me!

229
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,083
Sue, wait! Crap.

230
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,291
[OLGA]
So, at this point,

231
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,375
there was no one left except
the tortoise and the hare.

232
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,958
[OLGA laughs] Do you know
what they were doing?

233
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,125
No, but I'd like to.

234
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,875
That is so adorable!

235
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,208
[SUSHI] Why does the guy
look so awkward?

236
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,791
He wants to hold her hand,

237
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,833
but he isn't sure if that
would be too forward of him.

238
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,750
If he really wants to hold her
hand he should just go for it.

239
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,875
[YUMINA]
Hear, hear.

240
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,666
It's a simple way of
showing affection,

241
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,750
men shouldn't be
so afraid of it.

242
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,916
Don't you agree?

243
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,083
I, for one, think it's
a complicated issue.

244
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,416
[ARMA gasps]
Look, they're going inside!

245
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Ahh.

246
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,041
They're partial to
bananas, you see.

247
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,583
Yeah.

248
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,375
[YUMINA] We can't follow them
in without risking exposure.

249
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,916
[SUSHI] Say, Touya.
Can't you help us out somehow?

250
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,166
Well, I have an idea
that might do the trick,

251
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,708
but I don't really wanna
invade their privacy more.

252
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,541
This is my sister
we're talking about,

253
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,375
and it could be a big
part of her life.

254
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,416
Forget her privacy, I need to
know how this date's going.

255
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,000
[TOUYA sighs]

256

Long Sense.

257
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,125
[OLGA]
Yes, but enough about that.

258
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,833
I hear that you'll be returning
to Belfist in a few days.

259
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,375
Is that right?

260
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,666
Yes. I'm afraid I must, but...

261
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,000
Once the alliance is formal,

262
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,666
I plan to visit Mismede
as often as possible.

263
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,666
Or... As much as my friends
here would like my company.

264

[OLGA laughs]
I for one, quite enjoy it.

I think those two have excellent
chemistry, don't you?

It's so cute!

I need to start going on dates
myself one of these days.

You're much too young
to think of such things.

Even I haven't been on
a proper date yet,

271

and I'm already engaged.

Heh! Well if neither of
us have been on a date,

00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,041
and both of us want to,
let's just go on one together!

It seems Olga's taken a
liking to this Sir Lyon.

Hope the boy's up for the task.
She's quite a woman.

He'll certainly try.

By the way, why are you running
around wearing a hood?

320
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,125
Um, pardon. That is
Touya, isn't it?

321
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,375
[TOUYA]
Huh?

322
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,083
Sorry, you're the only
person I've ever seen

323
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,083
wear a coat like that.
Plus, there's your voice.

324
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,041
[TOUYA]
Well, shoot.

325
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,291
Lyon, you won!

326
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,750
You're not hurt, are you?

327
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,625
King Jamukha...?

328
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,875
Accel!

329
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,708
You coward! Wait,
I can do that! Acce--

330
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:27,583
Why don't you stay a while?
Have a little chat with us?

331
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,416
[TOUYA sighs]
Then let's chat about

332
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,666
why you haven't made
a move on Olga!

333
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,375
It's almost as if you aren't
that serious about her!

334
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,750
[gasps] I am very
serious about her!

335
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,625
But, it's hard.

336
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,208
So you earnestly wanna date her,

337
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,541
is that what you're
trying to say?

338
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,458
Of course I do!

339
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,125
Cool. 'Cause she definitely
heard ya just now.

340
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,500
Uh!

341
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,458
[OLGA]
Lyon, I...

342
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,666
[gasps]

343
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,625
I feel the same way.

344
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:01,041
So, does that mean...
you'll be my girlfriend?

345
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,875
Think so.

346
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,583
[gasps] Yahoo!

347
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,583
[ARMA]
Congratulations, sis!

348
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,541
[OLGA]
Arma? What are you doing here?

349
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,625
--[YUMINA] They're together now!
--[SUSHI] All thanks to us!

350
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,791
[BOTH]
What's going on?

351
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,541
Why were you hiding
in the woods?

352
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,291
[ALL laugh nervously]

353
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,750
[LYON] By the way, Olga.
How old are you?

354
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,958
[OLGA laughs]

355
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:25,958
Hey, we're home.

356
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,875
I hope we didn't miss anything.

357
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,625
Nothing of great importance.

358
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,833
Although, you did have
another guest arrive.

359
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:32,958
Who is it?

360
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,875
[squeaking]

361
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,208
[TOUYA]
Paula?!

362
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,666
That's crazy.

363
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,541
You didn't walk here from
Mismede by yourself, did ya?

364
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,583
[LEEN]
Sharp as ever, aren't you?

365
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,083
No Touya, she naturally
made the trip with me.

366
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,125
Hey, Leen. What's goin' on?

367
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,041
I see you found where I live.

368
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,000
Charlotte assisted me in that.

369
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,166
She seemed rather sure
that you wouldn't mind.

370
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,166
What's going on? Is this
woman someone you know?

371
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,375
Oh yeah.

372
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,208
I don't suppose you
would've met her yet.

373
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,125
This is the elder of the fairy
folk back in Mismede.

374
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,625
She just goes by Leen.

375
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,750
Despite her looks, she's
actually way older than us.

376
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,791
You're one of the fairy folk?

377
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,833
But, wait...

378
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,083
[LEEN]
Oh, that?

379
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,583
I'm concealing my wings
with Light magic is all.

380
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,708
They attract more
attention than I like.

381
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,666
Goodness. I can understand why.

382
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,250
Anyway, what brings you here?

383
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,000
[LEEN]
I heard a rumor about you.

384
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,000
Another one of your exploits.

385
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,291
If you truly defeated
a crystalline beast

386
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,208
a few months ago, then I'll
have questions for you.

387
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,791
Huh?

388
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
Hey. What's with
our dinner guest?

389
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,416
Yumina says that she's a fairy.

390
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,208
That creepy looking witch girl?

391
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,833
There's no way, the fairy folk

392
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,166
are supposed to be
cute, remember?

393
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,041
[LEEN clears throat]

394
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,875
[BOTH laugh]

395
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,333
So, Leen. What do you
know about these things?

396
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,416
A runner came to the
palace from Lairesse.

397
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,250
That's a smaller village
in western Mismede.

398
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,708
They claimed to have
discovered a crack in the sky

399
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,958
just a few days ago.

400
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,625
The sky cracked?

401
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,416
[LEEN]
It piqued my interest as well.

402
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,000
Enough for me to assemble
a platoon of soldiers

403
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:14,333
and investigate. However...

404
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,666
Then, just as I was starting
to research the creature,

405
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,958
I was surprised to hear that you
had managed to defeat one.

406
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,375
So, of course I went and
asked Charlotte about it.

407
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,000
And she tells me that you
can use every Null magic

408
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:33,958
known in this world.

409
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,375
I can't believe you blabbed.

410
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,125
I'm sorry Touya! But I can't
go against my teacher!

411
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,708
Your what now?

412
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,541
Charlotte counts herself very
fortunate to be my apprentice.

413
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,083
I did have to punish her
for keeping secrets once,

414
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,166
but she learned.

415
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,916
That's right.
It was a good lesson.

416
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,916
[LEEN] Here's a sketch of the
magic beast of Lairesse.

417
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,875
Apparently, it squirmed out
of that crack in the sky.

418
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,458
It has a completely
different shape

419
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,333
than the one that we destroyed.
Any clue what these things are?

420
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,875
Just one...

421
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,208
Legend claims that long ago the
world was all but destroyed

422
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:09,083
by demons. Ancient texts
refer to them as Fraze.

423
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,500
They're said to have red eyes
and translucent bodies.

424
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,416
So does that mean you believe

425
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,291
that these crystal
things are Fraze?

426
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,416
[LEEN]
That I cannot say.

427
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,791
Well, then.

428
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,833
Sitting around pondering
won't get us anywhere fast.

429
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,750
A fair point. By the way, Touya.

430
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,500
I'm moving to Belfast soon.

431
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,375
I have been appointed the
ambassador of Mismede.

432
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,083
Needless to say, I'll
be visiting often.

433
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,458
Oh, and one more thing,

434
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,916
I've been told that you're
proficient with Gate.

435
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,291
[TOUYA]
Yeah, but the catch is,

436
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,791
I can only go to places
I've been to before.

437
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,625
[LEEN] There's another Null
spell called "Recollect."

438
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,458
It allows the user to read
someone else's mind.

439
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,125
Use it in conjunction with Gate

440
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,041
and you can jump to places
from the memories you see.

441
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,333
Whoa. That sounds amazing.

442
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,708
There's a distant place I
need to reach quickly.

443
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,291
Would you mind using those
spells to take me there?

444
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,541
I guess that depends on
where you wanna go.

445
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,375
[LEEN]
East.

446
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,416
As far east as one can get.

447
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
The land of Eashen.

448
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,416
Eashen?! Uh?

449
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,375
[LEEN] There's an ancient
ruin in that nation

450
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,000
that I'd like to investigate.

451
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,458
[TOUYA] Do you think it has
something to do with the Fraze?

452
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,041
No, it's nothing like that.

453
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,416
I've always just
wanted to see it.

454
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,458
[TOUYA]
Wait, that's it?!

455
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,375
My master cares for
nothing so much

456
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,750
as indulging her own curiosity.

457
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,250
Th-That was just a joke, okay?

458
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,125
[LEEN] Anyway, this one's
from Eashen, right?

459
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,458
If you were to read her mind,

460
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,375
then we could be there
in five minutes time.

461
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,916
Hey, don't I get a say in this?

462
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,166
My mind is extremely private.
Reading it is not an option!

463
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,000
No need to worry, dear.
Recollect is only capable

464
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,125
of showing memories
you wish to share.

465
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,041
Yeah? But, even so...

466
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,375
The spell also requires
physical contact

467
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,125
between caster and subject.

468
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,000
I hear that the ideal form
of contact is a kiss.

469
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,625
Wait, a kiss?!!

470
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,208
I'm only teasing you.

471
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,250
[TOUYA, YAE groan]

472
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,666
[LEEN]
Yes, good.

473
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,708
Stand here, facing each other.
And clasp hands like so.

474
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,041
[BOTH gasp]

475
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,583
[LEEN] Perfect. Now press
your foreheads together.

476
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:16,541
You should start picturing the
sights of Eashen now, Yae.

477
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,291
Now, Touya. Cast the spell.

478
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,166
Recollect.

479
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,125
I see it.

480
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,750
[LEEN clears throat]

481
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,833
[BOTH gasp]

482
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,458
I'd really like you to
open up that Gate.

483
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:46,583
Would you mind?

484
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,458
Yeah! I know, I'm gonna.

485
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,375
Well. Much as I
would like to stay,

486
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,333
I really should get
back to the palace.

487
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,416
Sure. Good work, as always.

488
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,375
[TOUYA]
She ran...

489
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,250
And Gate!

490
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,291
It's exactly like I saw.

491
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,333
So, we're here?

492
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,250
Yes, I'm sure of it.

493
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,250
This is my homeland.
We're in Eashen.
