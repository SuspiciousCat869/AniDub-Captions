Only that they're called the

I was wondering,

is your country ruled
by a king, or what?

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,708
Well, Eashen does have a king.

16
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,791
But in practice, the lords
are essentially free

17

regions as they see fit.

And which lord controls Oedo?

His name's Tokugawa Ieyasu.

Still up at the castle,

He does love to train.

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,208
I'm afraid your father
had to leave us.

57
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,916
You see, he was called to
battle by Lord Tokugawa.

Well? Who's our foe?

The Takedas.

They attacked out of nowhere
several days ago.

When your father heard the news,

63
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,250
he and Jutaro went to help
defend Kawagoe Fortress.

felt off before.

I'll use Long Sense to find safe
spots between here and there.

Then jump in with Gate
till I reach the fort.

That would be safer
than the direct approach.

102
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:05,541
I need to be sneaky about this.
So for now, I'll go in alone.

Once I've gotten in though,
I'll jump straight back here.

[LEEN]
Perhaps they're magic artifacts.

162
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,875
[TOUYA]
Say what?

163
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,875
You know, objects of power.

164
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,625
Lost relics from
ancient civilizations.

165
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,541
That thing you're holding
is an artifact, right?

166
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,875
Anyway.

167
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,833
I got a pretty zombie-ish
vibe from those guys.

168
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,000
Which should mean that I have
a way to take 'em all out.

169
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,875
You don't mean single-handedly.

170
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,041
[TOUYA]
Sure I do.

171
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,541
Woo. There are quite
a few of these guys.

172
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,250
Oh well. Okay, Multiple.

173
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,333
[INJURED SOLDIER 9G]
What are those?

174
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,250
Touya. How are you--?

175
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,583
Strike true, Oh Light.

176
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,125
Sparkling Holy Lance:

177
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,333
Shining Javelin!

178
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,333
[SOLDIERS gasping]

179
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,416
[SOLDIERS cheer]

180
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,208
All defeated.
That was your doing?

181
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,125
[TOUYA]
Yeah.

182
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,416
Who saw that coming?

183
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Only all of us that know him.

184
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,791
As impressive as always, Touya!

185
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,375
[TOUYA]
Thank you, thank you!

186
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,500
The name's Mochizuki Touya.
You're too kind. Really.

187
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,375
First off, please allow me
to express my gratitude

188
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,500
for your assistance today.

189
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:58,500
I'm Tokugawa Ieyasu,
leader of the Tokugawa clan.

190
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,416
Oh. We were happy
to lend our aid, sir.

191
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,875
My daughter. In a princess'
personal guard.

192
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,125
This is quite a surprise.

193
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,208
I told you I was training hard.

194
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,833
Which of you cast the spell?

195
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,166
The one that saved our fortress
in the blink of an eye.

196
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,416
That would be Touya.
Mochizuki Touya's his full name.

197
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,000
He guards me as well.

198
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,708
But, also, we're engaged
to be married soon.

199
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:22,583
[gasps]

200
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,916
[JUBEI, IEYASHU]
Oh...

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,541
[TOUYA]
Hold on, we're not--!

202
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,791
Er-- Uh. I guess it's
kind of in the air.

203
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,166
Things are complicated.

204
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,750
[YUMINA giggles]

205
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,625
[TOUYA coughs]
Moving on. About Takeda.

206
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,708
Do you think they'll
back down after today?

207
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:44,416
No, if I had to guess, I'd
say they'll attack us again.

208
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,166
You see, between those
undying soldiers,

209
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,000
and the suddenness
of this invasion,

210
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,625
I'm forced to believe
that the rumors are true.

211
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,166
Rumors?

212
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,458
[JUBEI] That the head of the
Takeda clan, Sheengen, is dead.

213
00:10:56,541 --> 00:11:00,666
That his name is being used by
the dark mage Yamamoto Kansukay,

214
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,416
who commands an
army of the dead.

215
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,333
That requires lots of power.

216
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,833
My guess, is that he's using
a strong magic artifact.

217
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,000
[TOUYA] So, what if we captured
this Yamamoto Kansukay guy,

218
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,791
think things would settle down?

219
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,458
I think so.

220
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,375
But he's likely holed up in
some fortress of his own.

221
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,750
And we've yet to
determine which one.

222
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,916
[TSUBAKI] I know where he is.
Allow me to show you.

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,041
Who's there?!

224
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,500
[TSUBAKI] I come with a message
for Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu.

225
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,541
I'm Tsubaki, sent by
Kousaka Masanohbu.

226
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,708
He, of course, is one of
the four great generals

227
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,916
of the Takeda clan.

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,333
[JUBEI]
You're with Kousaka?

229
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,583
Yes. This letter confirms
our suspicions.

230
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,166
And what else?

231
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,250
[IEYASHU] It seems that
every Takeda general

232
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,750
aside from Kousaka has been
thrown into a dungeon.

233
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,375
He asks that we stop Kansukay

234
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,166
and save what's
left of his clan.

235
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,666
He's with Kansukay now.

236
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,708
Obeying him, yet
striving against him.

237
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,750
But he won't prevail
without allies.

238
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,166
We owe nothing to the Takeda!

239
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,625
But, if things continue like
this, we'll be done for as well.

240
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,708
Have anything to suggest, Touya?

241
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,291
We can help you
deal with this guy.

242
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,833
I thank you.

243
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,750
Do you plan to waltz into the
enemy's camp by yourselves?

244
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,083
Probably. But even
though I have Gate,

245
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,875
it'd be a pain to get noticed
too early. Hey, Leen.

246
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,291
You said you used light magic

247
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,458
to make the wings on your
back invisible, right?

248
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,000
Do you think you could, uh--

249
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,541
But of course. I can make the
whole body unseen if needed.

250
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,166
Sweet. That said,

251
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,666
it's probably a bad idea to
sneak in there as a big group.

252
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,583
Let's keep it small.
Me, Leen, and Tsubaki.

253
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,583
Paula's gonna have to stay.
That all right Leen?

254
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,500
[LEEN]
Yes.

255
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,916
I'll come back, Paula.

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,625
Cool, let's get to it.

257
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,958
[ELZE]
Hold on a second.

258
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,250
You're planning to sneak
around in broad daylight?

259
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,750
Yeah, maybe not.

260
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,958
Well in that case, I'd like
to return home for a time.

261
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,000
I need to let Mother know
that everyone's okay.

262
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,541
On a similar note,

263
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,333
if we aren't going home tonight,
I think we should tell Laim.

264
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,625
These men have been
under siege for days.

265
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,250
They need food as
quickly as possible.

266
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,541
You make excellent
points, all of you.

267
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,750
All the undeserved power in the
world won't make you any wiser.

268
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,958
I find it endearing,
you know that.

269
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,708
Well, then. I'll go ready
some horses for you.

270
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,250
[TOUYA]
Thanks but there's no need to.

271
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,791
I've got this...

272
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,666
Tsubaki, can you picture
Kansukay's hideout in your mind?

273
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,125
Yes, but why?

274
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,958
Well, if you'd allow me
to read your thoughts,

275
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,583
I could get us all
there a lot faster.

276
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,625
Then by all means.

277
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,500
[gasps]

278
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,708
[ALL chattering]

279
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,833
[TOUYA]
You're embarrassing me!

280
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,541
Leen. Can ya make
us invisible now?

281
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,333
It's technically more of a
camouflage spell, but whatever.

282
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,000
Come forth for me, Light.

283
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,166
Bend and distort. Invisible.

284
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,333
[TSUBAKI]
You vanished!

285
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,791
[TOUYA] Weird that I can
still see you, Leen.

286
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,333
It's more convenient that way.

287
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,291
I can hear your
voices, at least.

288
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,416
You two ready?

289
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,750
Then, Gate!

290
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,916
Uh! What the...?

291
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,333
We're blocked out.

292
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,000
It would seem our foe has
erected a magical barrier.

293
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,500
[TOUYA]
That's a thing?

294
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,583
Kansukay is a capable mage.

295
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,916
Wait a sec.

296
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,500
Could this barrier cancel
your invisibility spell?

297
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,833
We should be fine.

298
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,083
The barrier's only
meant to negate spells

299
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,166
that target the premises.

300
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,250
I can get inside the complex
without raising any suspicion.

301
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,833
Shall I destroy it for you?

302
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,416
I'd rather you didn't.

303
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,416
If the barrier were destroyed,
it would put our foes on alert.

304
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,791
Good point.

305
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,958
'Kay. Guess we'll just slip
in behind Tsubaki, then.

306
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,458
Long as this spell holds,
we'll get away with it.

307
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,583
Does that work for you, Lee--?

308
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,041
[LEEN laughs]
Goodness Touya,

309
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,666
how can you take advantage of
your invisibility like that?

310
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,875
That's Touya?

311
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,416
Huh?! No way, that's
Leen behind you!

312
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,791
She's the perv. I've been
here this whole time.

313
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,916
No. Hey. Not like that. Ah!

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,375
A fine bosom. So ample.

315
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,375
More than expected.

316
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,125
You conceal it with
those clothes.

317
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,000
[sighs] Wait a minute.
We have a mission to do--!

318
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,791
Huh? Sorry, Touya,
what did you suggest?

319
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,958
"Be more direct about it,"
well, if you say so!

320
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,000
[TOUYA]
I didn't say that!

321
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,083
Stop it, ya lecherous fairy.

322
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,041
Sorry ya had to endure that.

323
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,500
I'll smack her faster
if she tries it again.

324
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:49,583
--Smack me where?
--Shut up and behave!

325
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,208
Touya, you're so mean.

326
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,083
Wha--? But, it wasn't me!

327
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,333
What the hell, Leen?!

328
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,750
We're in the middle of
an operation right now.

329
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,583
Aw, man. I really hope
we make it there.

330
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,000
[LEEN]
May I?

331
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,666
[TOUYA]
Hey. Stop that. Seriously.

332
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,000
Who's there?

333
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,125
Lord Baba. It's Tsubaki.

334
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,250
General Kousaka sent me
here to help you escape.

335
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,000
[BABA]
Kousaka?

336
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,208
In my company, are two
friends of the Tokugawa.

337
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,708
Touya and Leen here are
both capable mages.

338
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,083
They're here to help.

339
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,458
Do you know where Yato's
cell is? Yamagata's?

340
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,833
One level down.

341
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,416
We'll grab them after.
First thing's first.

342
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,000
Modeling.

343
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,916
You're a good deal more
capable than you appear,

344
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,958
young man.

345
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,583
Oh, yeah? Thanks.

346
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,916
[door creaks]

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,708
Baba. How goes it?

348
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,750
Nice day for a stroll, eh?

349
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,791
Ah. I take it this means
that my boredom's

350
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,958
gonna come to an
end soon, right?

351
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,958
[BABA]
Young man. If you would.

352
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,291
[TOUYA]
Right.

353
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,333
Many thanks. What're
we planning from here?

354
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,000
Step one is just getting you
guys out of this dungeon.

355
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,125
Step two is to find the guy who
put you here and kick his butt.

356
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,500
I like that plan.

357
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,083
I'll have to come with you.

358
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,083
I've been planning a little
reunion over the past few days.

359
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,708
You're welcome to join us.

360
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,083
Speaking of, do you
know where he is?

361
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,708
[TSUBAKI] He's usually in the
central quarter right now.

362
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,291
I can't find him.
That dumb barrier.

363
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,208
Leen, what would we need
to do to destroy it?

364
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,791
Find the magic talisman
and it's bound to--

365
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,166
[YAMAGATA] Hey, I saw
a magic thing up there.

366
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,500
We can pick up some
weapons on the way.

367
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,708
There'll be fighting
after, am I right?

368
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,708
That's the relic, all right.

369
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,333
Destroy it and the
barrier should shatter.

370
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,458
'Kay. Everyone ready?

371
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,625
[gunshot]

372
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,416
[YAMAGATA]
Hey, look.

373
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,041
What are those things?

374
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,708
Twice in one day, Touya?

375
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,875
I really don't wanna teleport
into a horde of those guys.

376
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,291
Strike true, Light!

377
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,125
Sparkling Holy Lance:

378
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,083
Shining Javelin!

379
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,291
Hold on. Did all of
that come from you?

380
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,375
Well, yeah.

381
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,833
Very impressive.

382
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,583
I wonder if that could've
taken out Kansukay as well.

383
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,208
No. I only targeted the
Oni mask Soldiers.

384
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,708
Ah. I suppose that I
have you four to thank

385
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,833
for the sudden
spaciousness of my camp.

386
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,458
How did you pull it off?

387
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,666
We didn't come here
to chat, Kansukay!

388
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,916
We came here to kill you!

389
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,125
[BABA]
Oyakata, no.

390
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,791
Oyakata?

391
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,291
Baba called him master. So
that must be Takeda Schingen.

392
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,250
You worthless snake!
Release him or else!

393
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,750
[KANSUKAY chuckles]

394
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,041
Oyakata. Please move.

395
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,958
You can't avenge your lord
without first cutting him down.

396
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,041
It's quite the conundrum,
isn't it?

397
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,625
You vile bastard. [gasps]

398
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,875
Please stop, sir.
I can't fight you!

399
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,708
Well, Touya, what'll you do now?

400
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:26,625
I can't bear it!
To see him like this...

401
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,541
[NAITO] Even if he isn't
in there, we can't.

402
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,000
I knew that you fools would
choose honor over logic

403
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,250
when presented with this choice.

404
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,875
--Now flee like the dogs you--
--[gunshot]

405
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,791
[gasps]

406
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,625
Young man. You just--

407
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,625
[TOUYA] I mean. It's not
like I owe him anything.

408
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,416
Well, I guess that works out.

409
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,750
[KANSUKAY laughs]

410
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,208
I must admit, I didn't
see that one coming.

411
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,333
No matter. For you'll never
beat me while I have this!

412
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,708
He who possesses the
Gem of Immortality

413
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,625
can never be vanquished!

414
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,166
I imagine that it's also
what gave you the ability

415
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,333
to make your masked
soldiers undying.

416
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,041
[KANSUKAY]
Precisely, my dear.

417
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,166
This wondrous artifact gives
me vast amounts of mana,

418
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,250
and incredible power--

419
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,333
[TOUYA]
Aports.

420
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,708
Uh? My gem! How did you--?

421
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,458
Such sticky fingers.

422
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,666
Seems like the fastest
way to end this.

423
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,750
Aw. Well, that's a problem.

424
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,083
This would be a fine toy

425
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,875
if it wasn't cursed to
corrupt its owner's heart.

426
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,833
I'm surprised you can tell.

427
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,583
Live another 500 years and
maybe you'll get there.

428
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,958
No. My gem! Give it back!

429
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,291
An artifact of such power
must be incredibly valuable.

430
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,375
A shame that we'll
have to destroy it.

431
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,000
What?! No, you can't!

432
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,625
[LEEN]
No?

433
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:53,791
[KANSUKAY groans]

434
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,708
[TSUBAKI]
Oyakata.

435
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:18,166
[SOLDIERS chattering]

436
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,708
I see. You're not the first
to seek the Niruya ruins.

437
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,416
Thing is, they're at
the bottom of the ocean.

438
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,250
Bottom?

439
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,875
Also, I've been to an island

440
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,708
that was supposed
to be near them.

441
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,875
And it was pretty far from here.

442
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,125
That's no problem.

443
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,541
We can just use Recall
and Gate again, right?

444
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:40,083
What's wrong? Don't you like
doing it with old men?

445
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,250
[YAMAGATA]
Baba!

446
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,791
How can you touch
him when you have me?

447
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,291
It was good to see
you all. I'm sorry.

448
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:54,041
I'll try to stay longer
next time, but until then.

449
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,458
Take care, Yae.

450
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,166
And Touya, we're in your debt.

451
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,000
And I'll not soon forget it.

452
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,625
You're good. It was
no trouble at all.

453
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,625
Gate!

454
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,583
So cute!
