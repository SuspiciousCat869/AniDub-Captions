00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:12,750
[TOUYA]
Uh-Uh... Uh.

2
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,958
Sorry if this is rude,

3
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:18,166
but why aren't you
dressed... down there?

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm not sure how to answer that.

5
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,708
Duty?

6
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,916
Okay. Your name was
Francesca, right?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,458
Correct. But call
me Cesca, please.

8
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,083
Would you mind putting
something on for me, Cesca?

9
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,791
Sorry, but it's hard for me
to look at you otherwise.

10
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,416
I'm already wearing panties.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,041
Try pants or a skirt!

12
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,291
[FRANCESCA]
Hm?

13
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,708
[exhales] Calm down,
everything is fine.

14
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:46,125
It's just a swimsuit,
that's all, no problem.

15
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,916
Nope, it's not working those
are definitely panties!

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,541
[FRANCESCA]
Couldn't help but glance, I see.

17
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,750
Please forgive me!

18
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,416
Fine. If you really insist,
I'll put on a skirt.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,166
[TOUYA] If you had it with
you, then why was it off?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,541
You don't plan to try anything?

21
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,208
Of course not.
I'm not like that.

22
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,625
Just hurry up and put it on.

23
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,916
You could pretend to trip
on me and see how we land.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,875
No way! Stop being weird!

25
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,375
So listen, Cesca.

26
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,625
I think I've got about
a thousand questions.

27
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:54,541
Do you mind?

28
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,958
No. Ask away.

29
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,375
Well first off, we aren't
underwater still, are we?

30
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,291
This is the Garden of Babylon.
It floats in the sky.

31
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,666
So, we're in the sky now?

32
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,125
Follow, if you please.

33
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,625
We're up there.

34
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,750
Hey, so what's the
purpose of this facility?

35
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:17,875
[FRANCESCA]
Recreation.

36
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,666
The professor was a hobbyist.

37
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,375
[TOUYA]
Wait, what professor?

38
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,666
The one who created all of this.
Regina Babylon, my maker.

39
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,166
Why not say "mom"?

40
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,708
Master, I don't think that
this person is a human being.

41
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,916
I can't sense the flow
of life within them.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,125
[gasps]

43
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,666
[FRANCESCA]
I was designed by the professor

44
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,833
to serve in this place
as its control terminal.

45
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,666
That occurred 5,092 years ago.

46
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,500
[gasps] So, what you're telling
me is that you're a machine?

47
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,833
[FRANCESCA]
That's not entirely accurate.

48
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:51,083
I do have a few organic parts
that were created by magic.

49
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,250
So to speak more precisely,
I'm an amalgamation.

50
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,500
A being of machine and magic.

51
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,458
Whoa. That's incredible. You
look just like a regular girl.

52
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:04,041
I can't produce offspring, but
I am capable of intercourse.

53
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,708
Nobody asked about that!

54
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,708
Hey, stop! Keep that down!

55
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,500
[FRANCESCA]
I'm still in factory condition.

56
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,333
[TOUYA]
That really isn't the issue.

57
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,166
Well, if you should ever have
a need, don't hesitate to ask.

58
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,333
I'm having trouble
understanding this one.

59
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,583
Yeah, that makes two of us.

60
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,833
I still can't believe
that you're 5,000.

61
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,708
So, this goes for you, too,
but if it's been that long,

62
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,458
then wouldn't something
have malfunctioned,

63
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,916
or gotten worn out?

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
[FRANCESCA]
Everything that could've

65
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,291
has been reinforced with magic.

66
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,958
Basic garden maintenance
is done automatically.

67
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,750
And, barring an emergency,
I'm kept in standby mode.

68
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,875
Yeah? Then why're you up now?

69
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,250
This could be described
as an emergency.

70
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,708
The garden's very first
guest has arrived.

71
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,541
Speaking of which,
what's your name?

72
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh. It's Touya.

73
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,458
Or Mochizuki Touya.

74
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,541
You have undergone
compatibility assessment

75
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,000
and been found adequate.

76
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,625
As of this moment,
Unit Number 23,

77
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:56,958
code name: Francesca,

78
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,000
will be transferred
to your command.

79
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,833
Please take good care of her
for the many years to come.

80
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,125
How'd you assess me?

81
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,958
[FRANCESCA] That magic
circle can only be opened

82
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,000
by someone who,
like the professor,

83
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,583
possessed every known
magical affinity

84
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,791
That's crazy.

85
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,666
So there was someone
like me 5,000 years ago.

86
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,791
The professor was determined
to pass us on to someone,

87
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,000
but she wanted to be sure that
they were of a worthy sort.

88
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,083
Which is why she took these
precautionary measures.

89
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,541
That's how I passed the test?

90
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,958
By being able to use
all kinds of magic?

91
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,250
No, that's incorrect.

92
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,583
Huh?

93
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,916
The assessment took place
once you arrived here.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,083
You passed it by telling
me to cover myself

95
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,958
when I approached
you in my panties.

96
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,291
Seriously?! That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard of!

97
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,208
What's it prove?!

98
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,958
Surprisingly, quite a bit.

99
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,291
Let's say you'd given into
your lust and attacked me.

100
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,750
In that case, I would've
taken you by the hand

101
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,958
and tossed you back
to the surface.

102
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,500
Now, let's say you did nothing.

103
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,333
By allowing me to
remain in my panties

104
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,916
for your viewing pleasure,

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,250
you would have exposed yourself
as unworthy in a different way.

106
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,750
So I'd show you the gate.

107
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,458
Huh. Ya don't say.

108
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,750
I never would've imagined

109
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,083
that your reasoning
was that complicated.

110
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,000
The good professor devised
this method as a means

111
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,000
of determining whether someone
had not just the kindness,

112
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,333
but the sense of modesty

113
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,666
that she would want
in our new master.

114
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,000
I mean, I get it, but that
doesn't make it less weird.

115
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,375
Look, I'll be honest.
She sounds crazy.

116
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,750
I can't refute that.

117
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,500
So she is crazy?

118
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,375
While the panty test
was mandatory,

119
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,333
she let us make the final
determination ourselves.

120
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,291
If I must have someone
as my master,

121
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,541
I'm willing to settle for a
repressed pervert

122
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,041
who feigns disinterest.

123
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,791
You may steal a
few lewd glances,

124
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,250
but your lack of
confidence means

125
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,875
you're likely safer than
whoever might come along next.

126
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,041
I'm not a perv, my eyes slipped!

127
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,791
And for the record, I am
the most confident, okay?

128
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,625
Seeing as the formalities
are dealt with,

129
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,666
I truly am in your
possession now.

130
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,291
I humbly ask that you
treat me well, Master.

131
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,000
[sighs] Why do I feel like

132
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,750
I just got myself into
another giant mess?

00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,791
[BOTH]
Hm?

134
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,791
[FRANCESCA]
Oops. I dropped a pen.

135
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,375
Let me just... pick that up.

Hey! Look!

138
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,416
Perhaps I can catch it.

[CHARLOTTE screaming]

140
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:22,916
Are you okay, Charlotte?

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,125
I'm terribly sorry!

00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,125
I'm fine, just a bit cold.

[LINZE]
Whoa.

144
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,500
So that's where the
little guy ran off to.

145
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,166
Why would it crawl in there?

146
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,125
I don't know, but
it can't be normal.

147
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,750
I didn't have
any crab trouble,

148
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,541
but I did get sand stuck
in that area once or twice.

149
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,291
Same story. Also, some
shrimp and a small fish.

150
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,583
[YAE] Maybe our suits
were squeezing too much.

get through the gap.

What are those two
going on about?

Things you and I'll never
have to worry about.

I don't get it either,
but I approve.

Hello, Charlotte.
Could've sworn you told me

156
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,791
that you had urgent work to
finish back at the castle.

157
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,916
But, that wasn't a lie was it?

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,916
My mistake. Guess I'd
better leave now!

00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,041
She's such a mess.

160
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,166
Hey. It's been a while
since Touya swam off.

161
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,916
I'm starting to get
worried, ya know?

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,291
Since he hasn't returned yet,

163
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,125
I imagine things are
going swimmingly.

164
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,375
By the way,

165
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,291
what were you expecting
to find in these ruins?

166
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,083
Nothing. They could
be empty for all I know.

167
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,208
Your information on this
place was incredibly vague.

168
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,500
Yeah, I'm starting to feel like

169
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,083
you brought us out
here on a whim.

170
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,375
Well, it's been a good
time so far, right?

171
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,166
[squeaks]

172
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,916
Sorry for the wait.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,833
[LEEN]
Now then. Shall we?

174
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,708
[GIRLS]
Yeah!

175
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,583
What is this place?

176
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,541
I thought this was
s'posed to be a ruin.

177
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,166
I thought it was meant
to be underwater,

178
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,708
but that's definitely the sky.

179
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,416
At any rate, it's beautiful!

180
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,041
Ah. This structure was
once part of the ancient

181
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,833
Partheno civilization.

182
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,833
I've never heard of 'em.
What were they like?

183
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,041
For one thing, they were
terrifically advanced.

184
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,666
We're still learning
spells they made.

185
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,708
And discovering magic
artifacts they left behind.

186
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:10,083
This garden, for example.

187
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,875
By the way...

188
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,541
Who's your new friend, Touya?

189
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,416
Expanding the harem
yet again, are we?

190
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Of course not, she's
barely an acquaintance!

191
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,583
Is that so?

192
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,833
Of course it is!

193
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,708
If you've nothing to hide,
why so desperate?

194
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,125
I'm not hiding anything!
Her name is Francesca.

195
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,041
She's in charge of
this garden, okay?

196
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,541
Then am I to take it that you're
the owner of this place?

197
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,958
No. I am but a control terminal.

198
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,708
Ownership of the
Garden of Babylon

199
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,291
has transferred to
Touya, my master.

200
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,125
And what do you
mean by "master"?

201
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,541
I mean beloved husband.
The light of my life.

202
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,708
That is not true!

203
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,125
I'm more like a boss
or your proprietor.

204
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,958
Her proprietor?

205
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,750
Odd choice of words.

206
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,583
What's going on here, Touya?

207
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,875
Spill it.

208
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,333
Look, the point is,
this is totally innocent.

209
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,875
I showed Master Touya my panties
before offering myself to him,

210
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,375
body and soul. That's when he
rose up to claim me as his own.

211
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,375
[yells] You put that in
the worst way possible!

212
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,750
Her panties?

213
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,416
What exactly were you doing
while we waited for you?

214
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,416
Nothing! I'm innocent,
I barely even saw them!

215
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,000
Walk over here.

216
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,208
Uh! Yes, ma'am.

217
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:21,875
Drop down!

218
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,333
Right!

219
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,583
First you barged in on us
four while we were changing,

220
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,625
and now this? Just how obsessed
with panties are you?

221
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,333
I'm not. It really was an
accident that time, I swear.

222
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,500
Which would imply that this time
you looked by choice. Right?

223
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,416
That's not what I meant,
it wasn't a choice,

224
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,666
I couldn't help it--

225
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,625
What is your problem?
Seeing us in swimsuits

226
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,666
at the beach all day
wasn't enough for you?

227
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,833
And don't you dare
deny looking then!

228
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,958
Yeah. Well, uh. That was--

229
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,333
Elze and I got matching bikinis,
hoping you would think

230
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,625
it was cute, but I guess
that didn't cut it.

231
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,208
Did you just tell all of us
you were exploring ruins

232
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,416
to keep us distracted?

233
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,166
No, course not.

234
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,083
This seems like the right
time to give into your

235
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,875
constant demands that
I show you mine.

236
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,916
Could you just hush for a sec?

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,250
We were talking.

238
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,083
Would you mind looking at
me when we're talking?

239
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,625
Yeah. Sure.

240
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,375
Good grief.

241
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,583
You honestly look like
you have no idea

242
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,458
why Linze is angry with you.

243
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,625
Huh?

244
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,708
Let the poor boy off
the hook, will you?

245
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,333
You can hardly continue with
these accusations when you've

246
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,208
yet to make it clear where you
stand with him, now can you?

247
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,208
[gasps]

248
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,583
You'd need to be
on equal footing

249
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,916
with our little princess
first, at the very least.

250
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,458
Uh. Yeah...

251
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,000
The same goes for you two.

252
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,333
[ELZE, YAE gasp]

253
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,500
Uh, why would we be mad
at Touya, we don't like--

254
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,458
Yeah, what she said.

255
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,791
Let's take a walk.

256
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,416
We can leave this business
to Leen and Touya, okay?

257
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,583
I don't know about you three,

258
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,625
but I'd love to see
more of this garden.

259
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,083
[ELZE, LINZE, YAE]
A... walk?

260
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,666
I know I should trust him,
but I don't like the idea

261
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,833
of leaving Touya
with that girl again.

262
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,125
There's nothing to worry about,

263
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,000
Leen's still with
them, remember?

264
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,250
Having her there actually
worries me more.

265
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,750
I agree completely.

266
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:11,083
That old fairy is every bit as
devious as Touya is naive.

267
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:16,083
Touya's naive, but that's part
of what makes him so nice.

268
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,416
All right, everyone.

269
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,583
I think it's time the four
of us had a follow up.

270
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,208
You all remember what
I proposed to you

271
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,375
on the day we moved into
the mansion, do you not?

272
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,041
[ALL gasp]

273
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,541
I'll get straight to the point.

274
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,125
Everyone at this table's
in love with Touya, right?

275
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,875
[GROUP gasps]

276
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,791
No! I mean, he may
have a certain charm,

277
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,583
but that doesn't mean I'm
fallin' in love with him.

278
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,208
He's too goofy and unreliable
and soft-hearted.

279
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,916
How could I take him seriously?

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,208
Although, he is pretty different
when he does get serious,

281
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,750
and there's nothing
wrong with being kind.

282
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,958
No! No way!

283
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,750
For someone that isn't
in love with Touya,

284
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,083
you spend a great deal of time

285
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,791
looking at that dress
he bought you.

286
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,458
And I'm not judging you, Linze.

287
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,250
But, I did see you follow
him around the other day.

288
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,291
[gasps] That wasn't
what it looked like!

289
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,166
At first, I just happened
to be going the same way,

290
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,541
but then I got curious! It
looked like he was heading in

291
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,750
the general direction of
a naughty shop, so, I--

292
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,875
As for you--

293
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,416
I have done nothing
of that sort!

294
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,125
Of course you have.
Whenever you get injured,

295
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,583
you invariably ask
Touya to heal you.

296
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,208
Even though Linze knows
healing magic, too.

297
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,791
Well, I have nothing
to say to that.

298
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,166
I should tell you all that none
of this bothers me in the least.

299
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,500
In fact, this revelation
was delightful.

300
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,500
I know that when Touya
goes into battle,

301
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,000
he has three comrades
who support

302
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,750
and believe in him with
all of their hearts.

303
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,333
You're a weird one.

304
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,500
That should definitely
bother you.

305
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,750
Does it have to?

306
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,125
Touya is the kind of man
who only appears once

307
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,541
in a thousand years, and he
clearly cares about all of us.

308
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,750
But one of the things that makes

309
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,208
him so exceptional
is his empathy.

310
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,833
If he knew that
picking one of us

311
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,708
meant leaving the rest
of us heartbroken,

312
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,250
I don't think he'd do it.

313
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,208
I suspect that he'd
rather grow old alone,

314
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,916
and I don't plan to
drive him to that.

315
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,958
So, um.

316
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,833
I was wondering if you three
would like to marry him as well.

317
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,083
[ALL]
Huh?

318
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,541
Look, you can't just propose
on Touya's behalf like that.

319
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:15,541
I, um... I don't... [cries]

320
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,458
Calm down. There's no need
for you to rush the decision.

321
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,500
We can shelve it while we
let your feelings settle.

322
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,041
Oh, that? Well, uh.

323
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,458
You know...

324
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,750
I certainly have been
thinking about it.

325
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,541
That I can't deny.

326
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,958
So, how about it?

327
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,958
Do you feel like your feelings
have settled yet?

328
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,083
Since we spoke, I imagine
you've all become

329
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,291
a great deal more
conscious of Touya.

330
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:44,958
Linze.

331
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,000
[gasps] Yes, Yumina?

332
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,208
[YUMINA]
Your heart is always racing

333
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,833
when you're close to
Touya. Is it not?

334
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,875
Yeah. It is.

335
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,875
Your eyes are always
following him, Elze,

336
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,125
and they're filled
with admiration.

337
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,875
I don't know if I'd call it--

338
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,375
Oh, forget it. You're right.

339
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,833
And Yae, I've noticed you
getting a bit more nervous

340
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,000
around him lately.

341
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,750
Really?! I thought
I was hiding it well.

342
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,875
The only person who wouldn't
have noticed is Touya.

343
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,750
I don't think there's
a reason in this world

344
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,416
for us to let our love
for Touya divide us.

345
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,625
So, I'll make this
proposal once again.

346
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,708
Will you help me make Touya
the happiest man in the world?

347
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,916
Okay, I mean I'd be lying
if I said I never wondered

348
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,291
what it would be like.

349
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,375
It's a happy thought!
It's a really happy thought!

350
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,500
I know that it's still too
soon to commit to this,

351
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,250
especially since the only person
who's proposed so far is you,

352
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,458
but even so!

353
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,500
Oh no, I can see it.
It's too much!

354
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,583
My heart isn't ready!

355
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,708
I can't imagine anyone
I would rather marry.

356
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,166
Although, I would want to have
the ceremony back in Eashen,

357
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,333
of course. Oh, but he would
look so handsome in a <i>hakama</i> .

358
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:01,000
So, I take it that you all still
need some more time to decide.

359
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,666
[ALL]
I love you, darling!

360
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,458
So, Leen, did this place end
up having any of whatever

361
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,875
it was you were looking for?

362
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes. Well, not exactly, since
all I was hoping to find

363
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,083
was an ancient
spell scroll or two.

364
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,250
But this is no disappointment.

365
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,583
Yeah, it is pretty awesome.

366
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,583
[LEEN] A garden that has
flourished for 5,000 years

367
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,750
without so much as a
single flower wilting.

368
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,750
It's incredible magic.

369
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,833
The garden was created by
Professor Regina Babylon.

370
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,500
She must've been a genius
to make it happen.

371
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,166
Although she was also a pervert

372
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,583
who forced her
sentient creations

373
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,375
to expose their
undergarments. [sighs]

374
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,833
Hey, Cesca.

375
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,666
Is there anything in this
place aside from the garden?

376
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,208
I'm sorry Master, but
unlike the other ones

377
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,500
this place is nothing
but a lovely garden.

378
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,333
You'll find no great
treasure in here,

379
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,333
and nothing I would
describe as a weapon.

380
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,166
[TOUYA]
Oh. Well that's okay.

381
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,958
This garden is a treasure
in itself, if you ask me.

382
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,750
[FRANCESCA] I am relieved
to hear that you enjoy it.

383
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,750
I ask that you accept it as my
dowry and me as your bride.

384
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,000
You'll own me either way,

385
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,750
but it would be nice to
pretend I'm not a slave.

386
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,375
Yeah, I don't really know
what to say to that.

387
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,958
Hey, Cesca.

388
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,500
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
you just described this garden

389
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,333
as "unlike the others,"
did you not?

390
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,666
Yes. There should be
a number of facilities

391
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,125
like this one flying around,
each of them controlled

392
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,833
and managed by another
of my sisters.

393
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,125
If they came together,
you'd have Babylon.

394
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,250
Whoa, seriously?

395
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,500
So this Professor,
Regina Babylon,

396
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,541
created not just you
and this flying island,

397
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,666
but numerous others,

398
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,625
with the intention
that you be joined.

399
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,375
Or was Babylon whole at first

400
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,541
and then split into
smaller islands later?

401
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,958
Yes, it was split.

402
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,625
This is way too
out there for me.

403
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,875
I can't wrap my head around it.

404
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,500
[YUMINA] If things like this
were floating around in the sky,

405
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,666
I suspect that it would
make a commotion.

406
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,375
Hey, there. Did you girls
walk or go jogging?

407
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,500
You look kinda flushed.

408
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,833
What?! No they're not, shut up.

409
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,500
Things are perfectly normal.

410
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,750
You must be imagining it.

411
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,250
Okay.

412
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,875
Babylon is protected
by magical barriers

413
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,833
that prevent it from being
visible to the world below.

414
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,750
The spells have been seen
through, but quite rarely.

415
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,500
And just how many of these
floating islands are there?

416
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,416
In addition to my garden,
there's the tower, the workshop,

417
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,625
the library, the castle walls,
plus, the alchemy ward,

418
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,208
the warehouse, the
granary, and the lab

419
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,750
So there were nine initially,

420
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,666
although I can't confirm that
all are still operational.

421
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,833
Personally, I'm drawn to
this library you mentioned.

422
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,541
I suppose it must be packed full
of ancient spells and knowledge.

423
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,541
It's the library of that
professor, so there's a chance

424
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,875
that it's just a mountainous
porn collection.

425
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,875
What's this "porn" you speak of?

426
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,583
Oh, god, it's nothing forget you
ever heard that word, okay?

427
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,833
Please?!

428
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,958
No problem, it's already gone!

429
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,833
Can you not make contact
with the other islands?

430
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,458
At first I was able, but
the connection between me

431
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,833
and my sisters was
severed somehow.

432
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,500
Which means that there's no
way at present for us to locate

433
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,416
the other facilities out there.

434
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,458
You're able to search
for just about anything

435
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,541
with your Smartphone,
aren't you, Touya?

436
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,541
Oh. Yeah, nice thinking Linze.

437
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,083
I'll give that a try right now.

438
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,750
Huh. Uh... Uh. Cool.

439
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,791
Now Search: Babylon.

440
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,541
[TOUYA sighs]
It's probably blocked.

441
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,000
If these islands have been
drifting around for that long,

442
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,416
do you think we're
the first people

443
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,250
to actually set foot
in one of them?

444
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,958
You're the third contact.

445
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:31,250
The first occurred 3,208
ago at the library.

446
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:35,041
The second occurred 985
years ago, at the granary.

447
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,583
I see.

448
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,166
It sounds like the only way to
find the other Babylon sites

449
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,000
is by locating their
teleportation circles.

450
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,250
Say, you wouldn't happen to know
where those circles might be?

451
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,166
Alas, I don't.

452
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,250
Wait, so why did
this island end up

453
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,166
getting broken apart
in the first place?

454
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,333
Yeah. I don't know, the
professor never told us.

455
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,416
Maybe it was just to
aggravate people.

456
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,666
Say what? There's no way.

457
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,083
Hey, Elze?

458
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,583
Your face is really red.
You might have a cold.

459
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,333
I got a lot of sun, shut up!

460
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,791
Sure, if you say so.

461
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,875
So, what's our next step?
What happens to your friend?

462
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,916
I guess it depends
on what she wants.

463
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,666
Hey, Cesca, what do you want?

464
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,916
I would like to stay at your
side, always and everywhere.

465
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,041
To join you in the
morning and at bed.

466
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,333
As well as in the
bathtub, before bed.

467
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:25,000
And here I thought Yumina
was being too forward.

468
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,708
I'm pretty sure she's
just saying this stuff

469
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,291
to weird us out. [sighs]

470
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm starting to think
the right answer

471
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:35,916
is to just walk away and
pretend this never happened.

472
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,583
Hold on, wouldn't it
cause a meltdown

473
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,208
or something if you
left this place?

474
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,250
Or, don't you have to stay close
by in case there's a disaster?

475
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,416
If there were any trouble,

476
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,125
I would be instantly
alerted to it,

477
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,750
plus I have the power to
teleport here at will.

478
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,875
And the garden's maintenance has
been on auto for centuries.

479
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,083
Oh. Ya don't say.

480
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,875
Then I guess I'll
have to accept this.

481
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,958
[FRANCESCA] By the way, there's
actually one last thing

482
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,416
we need to do to complete
your registration.

483
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,791
Oh, yeah? Well, what is it?

484
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,333
If you'll pardon me
for a moment.

485
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,416
[TOUYA gasps]

486
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,750
[GIRLS scream]

487
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,333
[TOUYA muffled]

488
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,583
[screams]

489
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,166
[FRANCESCA]
Mm. Registration complete.

490
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,750
Your genetic information
has been recorded.

491
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,125
Ownership of the garden

492
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,000
has now been fully transferred
to Mochizuki Touya.

493
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,541
What was that?!
What's wrong with you?!

494
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,708
You can't just grab his face,
and then take whatever you want!

495
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,166
I haven't even done
that to him yet!

496
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,000
You stole it from me,
how could you?!

497
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,208
I simply employed the
most efficient method

498
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,333
of taking a genetic
sample from him.

499
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,583
I'm incapable of pregnancy,
but I assume the other method

500
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,208
still would have come
with its various problems.

501
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,458
You're crazy.

502
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,333
Oh, boy.

503
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,541
Hey, Touya.

504
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,416
Uh... Yeah?

505
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,791
I love you,

506
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,916
and I want you to know it. Okay?

507
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,708
Huh?

508
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,791
[TOUYA gasping]

509
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,958
[muffled]

510
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,375
