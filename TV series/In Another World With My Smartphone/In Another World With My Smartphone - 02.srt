[TOUYA]
So, God killed me on accident.

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:19,250
And then reincarnated me
in this mysterious new world.

3
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,500
It's a world of fantasy.

4
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,625
Home to strange magic
and mystical creatures.

5
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,541
Luckily, God gave me a lot of
cool new powers for this life.

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,125
And he let me keep
my smartphone.

00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,333
[TOUYA chuckles]

8
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,041
[TOUYA] Guess we should
find an inn for the night.

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,875
We're still a good distance
from the royal capital.

10
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,041
I wonder. Was this
letter delivery

11
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,708
really the best quest
we could've taken today?

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,875
If we had gone after
that megaslime instead,

13
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,208
we could already be back home.

14
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:44,958
[BOTH]
No way!

15
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,291
Why not?

16
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,625
Because slimes are squishy,
and wet, and flabby,

17
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,125
and moist, and I hate them!
It's instinctive!

[LINZE]
Mm-hm!

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
And worst of all,

20
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,541
some slimes can melt
peoples clothes off.

21
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,541
I'm not risking it!

22

[ELZE whimpering]

23
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,583
[TOUYA]
Yeah. That's understandable.

24
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,958
Let's eat before
we look for an inn.

25
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,875
I sure hope we can find
a place like the Silver Moon.

26
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,458
Wait.

27
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,541
Shouldn't we just use my Gate
spell to go back there tonight?

28
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,250
It'd be cheaper and
we wouldn't have to

29
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,708
waste time looking around.

30

--[BOTH] Of course not!

If you're in a new place,
you should want to look around.

Exploration is the best
part of questing.

Those clothes.

I've never seen
anything like them.

with me earlier.

In that case,
you should thank me.

Oh, cool!

00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,208
So you traveled here to
improve on your martial arts.

101
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,708
Interesting.

102
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,583
My family has produced
generations of great warriors.

103
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,875
And I aim to be one of them,

104
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,708
which means
practicing everywhere.

105
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,958
That makes sense to me.

106
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,875
[YAE] Someday, I shall
become a swordsman

107
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,375
on par with my father
and older brother!

[TOUYA]

109
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,750
[LINZE] So, Yae, where
exactly were you planning

110
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,958
to head after this?

111

[YAE]
Well, for now,

I'm planning to head
for the royal capital.

113
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,750
It seems like a good place
to put my strength to the test.

114
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,083
How fortunate.

115
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,458
We're actually on our way
to the capital as well.

116
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,250
Say, would you like
to travel with us?

117
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,583
You mean it?

118
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,000
I'd love that.

119
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,041
I mean, after the kindness
you've shown me....

120
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,500
...it'd be...

121
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,875
...rude of me to refuse
your good company.

122
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,708
You'll find me an
honorable comrade

123
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,083
and a capable warrior!

124
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,208
You wouldn't mind if she
joined us, would you?

125
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,958
Huh? Oh. The more
the merrier, I guess.

126
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,291
It's settled then.

127
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,666
[TOUYA]
We really might go broke though.

128
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,208
[TOUYA] Where did you learn
to handle horses, Yae?

129
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,333
The equestrian arts were
part of my earliest training.

130
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,583
It'll be nice to have
a third set of hands.

131
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,166
It was kind of difficult
with just me and Linze.

132
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,416
Yup. I am useless.

133
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,875
[LINZE]
Aw, no you're not.

134
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,041
Touya here is a
very talented mage.

135
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,958
He's learning lots of spells.

136
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,791
And not just elemental stuff.

137
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,416
He can also use a whole
lot of Null magic.

138
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,916
You learned her
Boost spell, right?

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,458
So far, it seems like you
can use any spell out there

140
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,916
as long as you know its name.

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,958
And what its
effect is, I assume.

142
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,375
[ELZE]
Good grief.

143
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,000
When someone's that all-powerful
it's just exasperating.

144
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,916
[chuckles] So, uh.
I'm a little confused.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,333
Just how many types
of Null magic are there?

146
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,291
[LINZE] Lots. It's mostly
personal magic,

147
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,333
so the theory is that
there are as many spells

148
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,041
as there are users.

149
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,458
[TOUYA]
That's a lot to try and learn.

150
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,500
You're right.

151
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,958
And not many people
have tried it.

152
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,583
So, tomes like
that one are rare.

153
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,041
Some Null spells have
only ever had one user.

154
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,000
Most haven't been seen in years.

155
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,708
So a few hobbyists study them.

156
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,166
But there aren't too many
other people that do.

157
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,833
Yeah, I can certainly understand

158
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,916
why most people wouldn't
bother learning spells

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,166
they'll never be able to use.

160
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,875
There's a spell that
curls hair into rolls.

161
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,833
A spell that makes
dogs super friendly.

162
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,708
[YAE]
Ooh. That's a good omen.

163
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,875
[TOUYA] Even a spell that
makes tea stems stand.

164
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,500
There's lots, but the
majority are useless.

165
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,625
[ELZE] Uh... Well, you never
know when one might be useful.

166
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,750
So you might as well learn
as many as you can, right?

167
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,583
[TOUYA] God did boost
my memory, but how much?

168
00:07:55,666 --> 00:08:00,083
I might as well try to memorize
an encyclopedia, sheesh.

169
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,166
[gasps] A spell that draws
distant objects to your hand.

170
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,416
Huh. That sounds useful.

171
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,416
Why don't you see
if you can use it?

172
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,041
Aports.

173
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:13,958
That's weird.

174
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,833
Wonder why it didn't work.

175
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, what did you
try to pick up with it?

176
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,791
[TOUYA] I wanted to see
how Yae would react

177
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,625
if she suddenly lost a katana.

178
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,125
Maybe her katana's
too heavy of a target.

179
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,041
Maybe so. It does
say "small" objects.

180
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,625
And that I should picture
it more carefully.

181
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,458
[inhales]

182
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,333
Aports!

183
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,166
[yelps]

184
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,291
Wait, what happened?

185
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,666
What did you try
to take this time?

186
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,000
Just this.

187
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,958
It's the ribbon that Yae
ties her hair with.

188
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,458
The spell does work!

189
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,083
That could be useful
in any number of ways.

190
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,958
Some of which are terrifying.

191
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,375
Terrifying?

192
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,791
You could pick people's
pockets all day with that spell.

193
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,583
Even if someone
felt it disappear,

194
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,000
they'd have no way of
knowing you took it.

195
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,166
Yeah, fair point.

196
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,958
That would be scary
when ya think of it.

197
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,416
I could take all
the money, gems,

198
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,208
and jewelry a guy could
want, if I felt like it.

199
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,916
Are you planning to try it?

200
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,375
You know stealing's
wrong, right?

201
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,291
[TOUYA]
Calm down, I would never!

202
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,500
That said, I wonder if I could
pull off someone's garments

203
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,791
with a spell like this.

204
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,625
[BOTH yelp]

205
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,125
Relax, I was joking.

206
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,125
[YAE]
Um.

207
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,208
Could I get my ribbon back?
My hair's all over the place.

208
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,166
Here's a spell
that can temporarily

209
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,750
reduce friction in a small
area. It's called Slip.

210
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,208
Huh.

211
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,125
Most of this Null magic seems
like it'd only be useful

212
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,291
in a few specific scenarios.

213
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,041
[TOUYA gasps]
Whoa.

214
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,416
Long Sense.

215
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,791
What did that do?

216
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,166
I can sense things
at a distance now.

217
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,166
It mostly seems to be affecting
my sight and hearing.

218
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,250
Another choice tool
for a pervert.

219
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,333
No way, I wouldn't dare.

220
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,166
[sniffs]

221
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,958
It works on smell, too?

222
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,166
What is that? Iron?

223
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,541
No. Wait, it's blood!

224
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,416
[gasps]

225
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,583
It's straight ahead.

226
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,833
Ha!

227
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,333
[roars]

228
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,833
[SUMMONER 2A chuckles]

229
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,375
Come forth, Fire.
Whirling Spiral: Fire Storm!

230
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:44,250
[ELZE yells]

231
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,750
[yells]

232
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,375
[yelps]

233
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,666
Dumb rock.

234
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,791
[LIZARD 2B roars]

235
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,625
[TOUYA]
Friction, begone! Slip!

236
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,083
[sighs]

237
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,791
[TOUYA] I guess these spells
are all about how to use them.

238
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,291
Thanks, Touya.

239
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,958
I'm just glad you're safe.

240
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:10,791
[gasps]

241
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,416
[LIZARDS growl]

242
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,833
[ELZE]
There's still more of them.

243
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,500
[yells]

244
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,791
Wow. Amazing sword work.

245
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,250
[LIZARD 2F growls]

246
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,250
Thanks, Linze.

247
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,500
[LIZARDS growling]

248
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,750
They just keep coming.

249
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,041
How many of these
monsters are there?

250
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,458
Come forth, Darkness.

251
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,708
I seek a scalebound
warrior. Lizardman!

252
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,250
What's that?

253
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,791
It's a dark summoning spell.

254
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,541
They won't stop coming unless
we can take out that mage.

255
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,208
I'm on it. Hey, Slip!

256
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,708
[SUMMONER 2A yelps]

257
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,083
[YAE]
You've been quite the nuisance.

258
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,208
[SUMMONER 2A sobs]

259
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,333
You saved our lives
back there, thank you.

260
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,375
Sure. Was anyone hurt badly?

261
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,916
Seven of my comrades were slain.

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,375
If only we'd reacted a
little sooner, we could've--

263
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,541
[SUSHI]
Someone! Anyone, help!

264
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,250
Leim. Leim no!

265
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,208
Help him. He's been shot!

266
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,375
His chest--the arrow
broke off inside.

267
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,500
[TOUYA]
Linze! Can you heal him?

268
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,708
The arrow's stuck,

269
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,083
and my healing magic
can't remove it.

270
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,333
If I were to heal him as he is,

271
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,125
it would extend his
suffering at best.

272
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,750
Please!

273
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm sorry, my lady.

274
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,791
Leim. No.

275
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,333
[LEIM]
I fear I must bid you farewell.

276
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,458
I'm grateful for every
moment I spent with you.

277
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,083
[SUSHI]
Leim, stop! You can't talk okay?

278
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,500
So, Linze.

279
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,333
He could be healed if the
arrow wasn't there, right?

280
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,291
Well, yeah, but I can't--

281
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,958
All right then!

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,333
Aports!

283
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,791
Whoa. I forgot you
had that spell.

284
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,375
Come forth, Light.

285
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,458
Give your soothing
comfort. Cure Heal!

286
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,833
The pain is disappearing.

287
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,416
[SUSHI]
Leim!

288
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,875
You're okay! Yay!

289
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:15,583
Thank God.

290
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,000
That was amazing, Touya!

291
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,583
[SUSHI] You have our gratitude,
kind adventurers.

292
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,208
Not only did you
risk your own lives

293
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,458
to save us from danger,

294
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,666
you brought Leim back
from the brink of death.

295
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,666
Forgive the
delayed introduction.

296
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,541
My name is Liem, and I am
honored to call myself a butler

297
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,125
in service to
good Duke Ortlinde.

298
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,958
And the young lady before you--

299
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,833
she is the duke's own daughter.

300
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,375
Lady Sushi Urnea Ortlinde.

301
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,208
[SUSHI] Forgive my dear butler
for being so formal.

302
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,541
Pleased to meet you.

303
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,708
Yeah.

304
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,250
[rustling]

305
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:50,666
What'cha doin'?

306
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,083
Take a knee.

307
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,416
When you meet the
daughter of a duke,

308
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,958
you're supposed
to hit the ground.

309
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,666
You know what a duke is, right?

310
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,041
A... noble?

311
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,833
[LINZE] Duke is the highest
rank a noble can have.

312
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,416
In order to be given the title,

313
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,208
you must share blood
with the king.

314
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,500
The king?

315
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,083
[gasps]

316
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,166
[SUSHI]
Indeed.

317
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,166
Not to brag or anything,
but my father,

318
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,791
Duke Alfred Urnes Ortlinde,

319
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,541
is actually the younger brother
of his royal highness.

320
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,625
In that case, I guess
you'd be the king's niece.

321
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,666
Sushi, huh? Should I
call you Lady Sushi then?

322
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,041
[SUSHI]
"Sue" will suffice.

323
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,166
I mean, it's not like
we're at court here.

324
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,208
So why act pompous?
And all of that aside,

325
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,291
I would hardly talk down to you
when I owe you my life.

326
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,458
Okay.

327
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,083
So what's a royal
doing out here anyway?

328
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,958
I was on my way back
to the royal capital

329
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,291
after visiting my grandmother.

330
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,125
And then that
mage attacked you.

331
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,875
Do you think he's just a bandit?

332
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,625
That seems unlikely, right?

333
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,208
I had a little talk with him.

334
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,333
And he told me he was hired.

335
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,666
The client never
gave his name though.

336
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,958
I see. That's a shame.

337
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,958
[ELZE] You can still talk
without teeth, right?

338
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,000
[SUMMONER 2A] Please, miss,
I've told you everything!

339
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,208
You need our help?

340
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,875
[LEIM]
Yes, I think we do.

341
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,250
Lady Ortlinde has been targeted,

342
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,500
and we lack the means
to protect her.

343
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,916
We owe you much already,

344
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
but I must implore you to
escort us to the capital.

345
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,125
You would be rewarded,
of course.

346
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,625
An escort job.

347
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,791
Let's go for it.

348
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,625
We were headed to
the capital anyway.

349
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,500
We shouldn't just leave them.

350
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,375
I don't imagine they would
slow us down too much.

351
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,750
I'm up for it.

352
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,125
We'll make sure that
you get to the capital.

353
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,958
Very well, then.
Let us be on our way.

354
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,916
So, that's the capital.

355
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,083
[LINZE]
Alephis.

356
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,125
Capital city of the
kingdom of Belfast.

357
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,500
The waterfalls you see feed
the great Lake Palette,

358
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,250
which the city was built around.

359
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,375
Alephis is known to some
as the "city of lakes."

360
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,916
[ALL gasping

Hi, Father!

00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,916
[SUSHI, ALFRED laughing]

364
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,458
Thank God you're safe.

365
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,875
When I heard what happened...

366
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,916
I've never been so
worried in my life.

367
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,041
[gasps] Oh-ho!

368
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,291
You're the adventurers that
saved my daughter's life,

369
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,000
I take it.

370
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,250
I thank you.

371
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,708
Please, there's no need to bow.

372
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,791
We only did what anyone

373
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,625
in that situation
would've, honest.

374
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,500
[ALFRED]
Oh! As humble as you are brave.

375
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,875
Let me introduce
myself properly.

376
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,791
I am Duke Alfred Urnes Ortlinde.

377
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,416
[laughs]

378
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,500
So you found her in your path

379
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,583
as you were heading here
to deliver a letter, then?

380
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,791
That's right.

381
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,916
To think, if you had
not taken that quest,

382
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,708
my daughter would be kidnapped,
or perhaps even the unthinkable.

383
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,375
I'll have to thank
your client, too.

384
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,125
Do you have any idea who
might've been behind this?

385
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,375
[ALFRED]
Hard to say.

386
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,250
I'd be a fool to think
I don't have some foes.

387
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,541
And I'm wealthy.
My daughter could be used

388
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,166
for political leverage
or for ransom.

389
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,500
[SUSHI]
Father.

390
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,250
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

391
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,125
Have you spoken with Ellen yet?

392
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,458
Yes.

393
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,625
I don't think there's any
need for us to tell her

394
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,791
about the attack though.

395
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,375
It would only make her worry.

396
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,375
Um. Who is this "Ellen"?

397
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,458
Ah. That would be my wife.

398
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,791
My apologies.

399
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,708
I'd love nothing more than
to introduce you to her.

400
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,000
But she doesn't get
out of her room much.

401
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,291
So is she sick, then?

402
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,750
[ALFRED]
Yes and no.

403
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,791
She survived a terrible
illness five years ago,

404
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,916
but it robbed her of her sight.

405
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,291
You tried magic, right?

406
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,458
[ALFRED] Of course, and the
true damage to her body

407
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:46,625
was healed, but it did
nothing for her blindness.

408
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,833
That, it seems, was
more an aftereffect.

409
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,041
Oh. If only my
grandfather were alive.

410
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,166
My wife's father,
Sue's grandfather,

411
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,166
wielded a very
special healing spell

412
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,291
which enabled him to return
the body to its natural state.

413
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,625
The purpose of Sue's
last journey was to learn

414
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,541
as much as she could about it.

415
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,208
I hoped against hope
that she might

416
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,875
be able to learn that spell.

417
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,291
I'm sorry, Father, I couldn't.

418
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,416
We'll just have to find a
healer and teach it to them.

419
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,291
Sue, your grandfather's healing
was Null magic I'm afraid.

420
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,416
If it wasn't passed to you,
then no one else has it.

421
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,291
At this point, our best hope

422
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,750
is to find someone with
a similar ability.

brought home safely after.

It's the denomination

Each coin is worth

Wait.

Thanks, but we
couldn't possibly.

If it's truly your wish to
become career adventurers,

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,458
you'll want equipment
that can keep you alive.

And for that, you'll need money.

They'll allow you to pass

Which means you'll have access
to the noble districts.

Furthermore, they show that

00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,000
[clears throat] Although
this journey was brief,

482
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,666
I think I understand what
kind of person you are.

483
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,458
You possess great power,
yet you act with humility.

484
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,708
And you constantly strive
to help your fellow man.

485
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,875
To be blunt,
you've impressed me.

486
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,541
I am in training,
body and spirit.

487
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,083
And to that end, I wish
to stay at your side.

488
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,000
Uh... Should I let her?

489
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,208
'Course you should.

490
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,250
Come back to Reflet
with us, Yae.

491
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,583
If you join the guild there,

492
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,666
then we can all start
doing missions as a team.

493
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,291
[TOUYA]
Mm-hm. That sound good to you?

494
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,166
[YAE]
I would be honored.

495
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,583
[LINZE] Good. It would be
a shame for us to part ways

496
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,375
just as we're getting
to know you better.

497
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,500
Welcome to the team
for real this time.

498
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,083
Thank you for having me.

499
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,750
[TOUYA] I might not
deserve these powers.

500
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,750
But if I'm spreading
happiness, who cares?
