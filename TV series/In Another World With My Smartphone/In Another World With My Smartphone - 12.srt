1
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,958
Starting today, I'll
be joining your staff.

2
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,916
Please treat me with kindness.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,625
Sorry to spring this on ya.

4
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,583
Do you think you could
find a place for her?

5
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,708
[LAIM] Yes, sir.

6
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,791
As you can see,
I made my own outfit.

7
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,458
You'll find that my will
to work is second to none.

8
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,625
Although I will be
taking my breaks.

9
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:35,500
Okay. Well, it's gotten pretty
late, let's all get some rest.

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,458
[FRANCESCA]
So, where's our bed?

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,500
Excuse me?

12
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,583
[FRANCESCA]
Service with love!

13
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,083
[LAIM]
Service with love!

14
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:47,125
Well? A-Am I doing it right?

15
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,666
I love you, and I
want you to know it.

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,083
Okay?

17
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,375
[TOUYA muffled]

18
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,333
[knocking]

19
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,791
[gasps]

20
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,750
[YUMINA]
Hey, Touya? It's Yumina.

21
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,833
Good evening, may I come inside?

22
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,083
Yeah. Why not?

23
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,750
So, what's up?

24
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:54,666
[YUMINA]
Touya...

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,666
Yeah?!

26
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,333
[YUMINA]
Do you know why I'm angry?

27
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,083
Because, I was
waiting for a kiss!

28
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,541
Right at the front of the line!

29
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,875
But, you let those two sneak
their way in front of me!

30
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:03,583
That's why?

31
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,166
Obviously!

32
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,166
So, then you're not upset about
Linze's sudden confession?

33
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,666
There was nothing sudden
about that confession, Touya.

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,708
It's plain as day that
she's in love with you.

35
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:14,916
Was it really?

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,333
My bad, I honestly had no idea.

37
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,541
It doesn't matter. So long
as I'm one of them,

38
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,791
I don't care if you
take ten wives,

39
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,000
or even 20 when
you finally marry.

40
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,458
I'd consider it proof
of your masculinity!

41
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,541
However! How... ev... er!

42
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,916
You've been far too careless

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,333
letting others kiss
you all willy nilly.

44
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,958
You haven't even kissed
me, so keep your guard up!

45
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,875
You need to take a thorough
look at your defenses!

46
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,625
And get them up to shape!

47
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,958
Wait, but Yumina.

48
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,083
The thing is...

49
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,791
Don't make excuses.

50
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,875
Okay...

51
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,291
[sighs]

52
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,791
Give me a hug and a kiss now,
and all will be forgiven.

53
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,166
Uh. I think you're setting
the difficulty level

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,083
a little high here.

55
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,333
[YUMINA laughs]

56
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,416
[laughs] So, correct
me if I'm wrong,

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,916
but I'm the first one you
kissed yourself, right?

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,333
Huh? Oh.

59
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,500
Well, yeah. I guess you are.

60
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,916
Now be honest with me.
How do you feel about Linze?

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,166
Honestly?

62
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,583
I think she's really cute.

63
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,458
When she told me how
she felt, I was excited.

64
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,708
But, I haven't even figured
things out with you yet.

65
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,375
So adding her to the mix...

66
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,458
Touya, do you like her or not?

67
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:49,166
Yeah, I like her a lot.
I think she's amazing.

68
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,416
Well, Linze, you heard him.

69
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Come on out.

70
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,916
Huh?!

71
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,291
[TOUYA]
What the--? How?!

72
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,708
What's going on here?!

73
00:04:58,791 --> 00:04:59,958
[YUMINA]
I asked Leen to cast

74
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,500
an invisibility spell on
her so we could do this.

75
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,083
'Kay, but how did you
get in the room? Oh.

76
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,083
I guess you walked
in behind Yumina.

77
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,250
[LINZE]
Mm-hm.

78
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,291
You forced us to do this.

79
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,625
It was very rude of you to
shut yourself in your room

80
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,083
without giving her an answer.

81
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,458
I know, but...

82
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,208
She was crying, you know.

83
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,083
No matter what I said, she
was convinced you hated her.

84
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,166
[gasps] I'm sorry, Linze.

85
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,125
[LINZE]
I'm sorry, too.

86
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,208
I should've been more
considerate of your feelings.

87
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,291
I was... selfish.

88
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,000
No way. Don't worry.

89
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,875
Like I said earlier, I was
happy after what you did.

90
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:40,541
I mean, you're
really cute, and--

91
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,250
Touya!

92
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,750
So, now that you've
both confirmed

93
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,333
your feelings for each other,

94
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,958
why not make this formal
and call it an engagement?

95
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,458
Uh?!

96
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,583
This may seem strange to you,
but it's perfectly common

97
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,208
for more than one person
to get married in Belfast.

98
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,666
And I'm willing to share
as long as you are.

99
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,625
[TOUYA]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

100
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,083
Yes. I am. I would like to
get married to you, Touya.

101
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,333
May I?

102
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,833
Yeah, this is all kinda
sudden, is the thing.

103
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,916
Say yes. Won't you, please?

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,416
[sighs] All right, sure.

105
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,625
If both of you are okay
with it, then so am I.

106
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,916
Thank you, I'm so happy.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,500
We're in the same spot, Linze.

108
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,708
Both of us are
Touya's fiancés now.

109
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,041
Yeah. Anyway, it's late.

110
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,333
I think you two should
get back to your rooms.

111
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,458
Sure. But first I'd like
a goodnight kiss.

112
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,166
Huh?

113
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,583
Um. I'd like one too.

114
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,458
'Kay. Cool if I just
kiss your foreheads?

115
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,666
I can settle for that.

116
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,666
[YUMINA]
Well, goodnight, darling.

117
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,250
[LINZE]
Goodnight, sweetheart.

118
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,625
G'night. Sleep well.

119
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:52,375
[sighs] What the heck am
I supposed to do now?

120
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,375
[door opens]

121
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,500
I didn't wake you up,
did I, Touya?

122
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,083
Yes?

123
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,583
[TOUYA] So, um... Next
time, could you knock?

124
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,458
Eh, nevermind, forget
I said anything.

125
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,125
Uh. Yae?

126
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,583
What are you doing out here?

127
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,708
Waiting for Elze to bring you.

128
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,000
We hear you'll be taking
Linze as your wife.

129
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,291
[TOUYA]
Uh, yeah. Looks like it.

130
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,500
I didn't realize how
close you two were.

131
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,291
Do you actually love her?!

132
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,583
Well. I wouldn't quite describe
it as love, just yet.

133
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,208
But, I care about her, as more
than a friend, I think.

134
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,041
[ELZE]
And she accepted that answer?!

135
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,250
Yeah.

136
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,875
Linze is super timid.

137
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,000
'Cept when it comes to
what counts, apparently.

138
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,500
She really is my total opposite.

139
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,916
I still can't believe
how bold she got.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,375
You and I are quite alike
in regards to this.

141
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,750
Without an inciting event
to trigger my emotions,

142
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,500
I can never make up my mind.

143
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,291
What do you...? [gasps]

144
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,708
Touya. We want you to fight us.

145
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,541
If you win, that'll
be the end of it.

146
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,000
[TOUYA]
Huh?!

147
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,000
But, on the other hand, in
the event that we beat you,

148
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:07,875
well then...

149
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,125
We'll have a request for you,

150
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,166
and you'll have to hear
us out, then answer it.

151
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,041
I've dulled the edge of this
sword so it won't cut,

152
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,958
but it's still heavy enough
to break your bones,

153
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,333
so be careful.

154
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,791
Listen... Couldn't you just
ask the question now?

155
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,333
[ELZE] Take the edge off your
gunblade with modeling, 'kay?

156
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,958
Also, no offensive magic.

157
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,666
In exchange, I'll fight
without my Boost spell.

158
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,416
Look, I'm not agreeing
to any of this

159
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,250
until I know why you
want me to fight you!

160
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,083
People like Elze and I need
something more visceral

161
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,541
to help clear our minds.

162
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,166
Now square up, bucko,
'cause we're comin' for ya.

163
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,958
Why is this happening to me?

164
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,958
[ELZE]
It's now or never.

165
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,125
Fine... Modeling...

166
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,208
It's cool if I use
rubber bullets?

167
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,000
Uh-huh. So, are ya
ready to do this?

168
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,458
Yeah.

169
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,333
Blade Mode!

170
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,375
[yells]

171
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,500
Are you even trying?!

172
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,958
[TOUYA]
Gun Mode!

173
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,166
[YAE gasping]

174
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,750
[ELZE yells]

175
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,541
[TOUYA]
Reload. That's it, you're beat.

176
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,666
[ELZE]
You won't shoot?!

177
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,166
If you're willing to
admit that I win,

178
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,958
then I'd rather not have to.

179
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,375
You're too soft!

180
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,750
How can you protect Linze
when you're so damn nice?

181
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,291
This is who I am.
What can I say?

182
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,416
Yeah, true.

183
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,750
You're just that kind of guy.

184
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,708
It's why Yae and I fell
in love with you.

185
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,500
What the...?

186
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,666
Huh?

187
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,500
That's what she aimed at?

188
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,208
[yells]

189
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,500
We would like you
to put the two of us

190
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,208
in the same position as
Yumina and Linze, okay?

191
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,541
What she's trying to say is that
we would also like to move

192
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,000
this relationsh--
You know what?

193
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,083
Nevermind, you're doing
great Elze, keep going!

194
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,708
You were supposed to
back me up, Yae!

195
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,125
Okay fine, here goes nothing,

196
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,208
the point of order is that
I'm in love with you, too.

197
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,416
I also have feelings
of that sort for you.

198
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,333
You want the same position
that Yumina and Linze have?

199
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,875
Then are you trying to say...?

200
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes, it's what you
think. We would...

201
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,916
We would like to become
your wives as well,

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,125
if you'd have us, that is.

203
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,708
No, you have to!

204
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,125
You lost the fight, didn't you?

205
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,625
You put yourselves through
all this just to say that?

206
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,250
[YUMINA]
I figured it was the best way

207
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,875
to get their courage up.

208
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,416
[TOUYA]
Yumina?

209
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,666
Wait, are you saying
this was your idea?

210
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,250
Yes, I am.

211
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,500
I proposed quite some time ago
that all of us should marry you.

212
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,916
We hammered out all the
details well in advance.

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,708
Wow, that's impressive
and frightening.

214
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,333
[ELZE]
S-So Touya?

215
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,291
What about you?

216
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,083
[TOUYA] Huh?

217
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,291
Hey, did you hear me?

218
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,166
If you have any feelings
for me and Yae,

219
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,375
now's the time to say so.

220
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,541
Well, I like both of
you a lot, of course.

221
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,750
The thing is...
I'm really sorry.

222
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,958
But, could I ask all
of you for some time?

223
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,625
I need to sort out my
thoughts before I decide.

224
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,083
Yes, of course.

225
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,875
We don't want to force
this on you too suddenly.

226
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,500
Thanks, Yumina.

227
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,208
[FRANCESCA]
So, this is where you've been.

228
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,583
Hey, Cesca.

229
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,208
[FRANCESCA] I have a general
grasp of your situation.

230
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,625
What about it do you
need to debate?

231
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,625
I mean, they think I can
make them all happy,

232
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,958
but what if they're wrong?

233
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,666
I'm scared that they'll all
end up dissatisfied.

234
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,666
I assume you mean
while in the bedroom.

235
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,666
The heck got you to that idea?!

236
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,291
I'm just wondering if I can
do my duty as a husband.

237
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,083
Oh, speaking of duties failed,

238
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,416
there was something I forgot
to tell you yesterday.

239
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,250
Is there treasure
here after all?

240
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,500
Someone left a message
for you, Master.

241
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,625
[TOUYA]
Yeah, who?

242
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,458
[FRANCESCA]
Professor Regina Babylon.

243
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,250
[TOUYA]
The professor?

244
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,541
[TOUYA] You mean the professor
who built this place?

245
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,708
[gasps] Uh. Cesca?

246
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,041
What'cha doin'?

247
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,000
[FRANCESCA] No idea.
The professor said that if I

248
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,375
handed this to my new master,
he'd know what to do.

249
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,750
Whoa, it worked!

250
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,041
I see a person.

251
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,625
[FRANCESCA] Yes. That
would be the professor.

252
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,958
Hey there, I'm
Professor Regina Babylon.

253
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,583
A pleasure to meet you,
Mochizuki Touya.

254
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,458
Hold on. You know my name?

255
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,416
What kind of cr--?

256
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,458
[REGINA]
Say no more.

257
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,208
That's an excellent
question, Touya.

258
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,500
It's only natural that you would
wonder about such things.

259
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,166
And I have the answer right
here with me, of course.

260
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,041
Take a good, long look.

261
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,833
This is my very favorite pair.

262
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,000
Like I care!

263
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,583
[laughs] I was kidding around.

264
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,958
Just having a bit of fun.
Try not to let it get to you.

265
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,250
Yup.

266
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,375
You are exactly the person
I thought you were.

267
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,791
Ah... Uh? What's this?

268
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,500
Taking a look at my
aroma pipe, eh?

269
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,625
As I'm sure you've noticed, it's
the same color as my underwear.

270
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,208
How does that make
you feel? Frisky?

271
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,541
Hold on, now! I'll answer
your real question.

272
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,041
I just needed to get that
out of my system, okay?

273
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,583
[TOUYA] One more panty joke and
I'm pullin' this cord for real.

274
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,500
Your question about how
someone from the past

275
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,041
knows so much about you?

276
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,833
It's because I have a tool that
lets me see into the future.

277
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,083
[TOUYA]
Seriously?

278
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,500
[REGINA] Yes, though I
can't choose the era.

279
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,375
That device is what's
allowing me to record

280
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,250
this mock conversation for you.

281
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,291
It's showing me how you'll react
to my words so I can respond.

282
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,625
I've been following
the adventures

283
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,750
of you and the girls
for quite a while now.

284
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,083
Very entertaining.

285
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,416
You mean you've been
watching us this whole time?

286
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,541
No, I was blinded at one point.

287
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,333
The future had been rendered
unstable, you see.

288
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,666
[TOUYA]
Unstable?

289
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,708
Yeah, know what caused it?

290
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,000
The sudden appearance
of the Fraze in our world.

291
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,333
[TOUYA]
"The Fraze"?

292
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,166
[REGINA] I couldn't predict
when they'd appear.

293
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,666
So, despite my
very best efforts.

294
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,041
those monsters brought
the Partheno civilization

295
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,666
to its end.

296
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,041
[TOUYA] Wait. Are you saying
that the Fraze's appearance

297
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,916
caused some kind
of interruption

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,083
in the flow of time
between our eras?

299
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,458
[REGINA]
Well put.

300
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,875
At the time, I assumed that
I wasn't seeing a future

301
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,583
because the world
had been destroyed.

302
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,250
Or was going to be,
I should say.

303
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,166
So what ended up saving it?

304
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,041
[REGINA]
Nothing. The Fraze disappeared.

305
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,333
Every bit as suddenly
as they'd arrived.

306
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,250
I've no idea why.

307
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,333
And thanks to that, you can
now see into the future again.

308
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,083
[REGINA] Uh-huh,
and I've jumped right back

309
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,791
into my favorite drama!

310
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,291
Your current ordeal
with the ladies

311
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,166
has been especially
fun to watch.

312
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,666
Would you mind not peeping
in on my private life?

313
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,208
Come now, what's it hurt?

314
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,208
I'm entrusting you with
Babylon in exchange.

315
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,208
I think that's a fairly good

You told me that you

Um, full disclosure?

471
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,958
He kissed me as well.

472
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,416
Yeah. Just on the
forehead, though.

473
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,166
[TOUYA]
Yeah. Heh, um.

474
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,833
Then you better do
it with us, too!

475
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,666
Just in the interest
of fairness.

476
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,083
Not because we wanna kiss.

477
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,458
I want to! I would
really like to kiss.

478
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,416
It's true.

479
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,000
Well, since you asked.

480
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,333
[gasps] No way!

481
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,000
Too embarrassing!

482
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,291
[groans]

483
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,458
Are you all right?!

484
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,166
That's twice in a day, sis.

485
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,625
Why couldn't you do that
after I took my turn?!

486
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,291
[LEEN laughs] I never grow
bored of watching him.

487
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,666
[FRANCESCA]
According to the professor,

488
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,208
he ends up with a
total of nine wives.

489
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,791
That's a high number.

490
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,541
Hey. I don't recall giving you
permission to enjoy this.

491
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,083
[gasps] Please let me
stay here, Master!

492
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,875
I did all of my chores, I swear!

493
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,125
Say, Leen.

494
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,625
Do you think you could
end up marrying Touya?

495
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,833
[LEEN]
Who knows?

496
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,000
There could be a chance.

497
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,250
[GOD]
All right.

498
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,541
So, you've made a
decision, good for you.

499
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,791
There's no point getting married

500
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,083
until I've become the
man I wanna be, right?

501
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,250
[GOD]
Well, hey.

502
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,333
You're as well-intentioned
as they come.

503
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,166
And you're no coward, either.

504
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,458
Plus, you don't have a big head
about all the powers I gave ya.

505
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,041
[CLERK 12A]
Look, kid.

506
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,250
That might be money somewhere,
but it's no good in this city.

507
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,583
Huh? Sorry sir, but this
is all the cash I have.

508
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:13,625
[GOD]
What's wrong?!

509
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,041
Is someone in
trouble down there?!

510
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,666
Yeah, sorry I gotta go.
Talk to ya later, okay?

511
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,875
[TOUYA]
S'cuse me.

512
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,166
Would it be okay if I
bought that for him?

513
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,291
[CLERK 12A]
Sure, thanks.

514
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,375
Thanks a million.
That's kind of you.

515
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,416
[TOUYA] Sure, always glad
to help someone in a bind.

516
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,791
That's an interesting
shape for a coin.

517
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,166
[ENDE]
You think?

518
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,083
Honestly, I find the
device in your pocket

519
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,291
to be far more interesting.

520
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,958
My name's Mochizuki Touya.

521
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,125
What's yours?

522
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,625
I'm Ende. A pleasure, Touya.
