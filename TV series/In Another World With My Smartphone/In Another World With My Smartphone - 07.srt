1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,083
[LYON] They defeated
a dragon on their own,

2
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,458
and now they're using
healing magic

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,750
on all the wounded civilians.

4
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,875
I am beginning to question
their need for an escort.

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,750
What's more, they donated
the dragon's usable parts

6
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,291
for the village's recovery.

7
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,333
A single pouch of that thing's
scales could fetch ten gold.

8
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,541
[sighs] They are mighty
and magnanimous.

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,875
It's beyond impressive.

10
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:36,791
[GAREN]
Yeah.

11
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,791
Just who are those people?

12
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:39,708
[LYON]
Who knows?

13
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,666
I certainly don't.

14
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,291
My name is Solum.
I'm the village elder here.

15
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,375
I wanted to thank you
for saving my people

16
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,958
from that dragon attack.

17
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,541
And for providing us with the
means to rebuild our village.

18
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,291
We shall remember your deeds.

19
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,250
Your words are kind, but...

20
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,750
...we just tried
to do what's right.

21
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,208
What's this?

22
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,000
[SOLUM] There are few
materials in this world

23
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,875
as light and durable as
the fang of a dragon.

24
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,333
Then... you keep it.

25
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,333
I'm told that you damaged
your sword in our defense.

26
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,375
Take this fang to
a master smith,

27
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,791
and he can forge you
a fine new weapon.

28
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,041
Or else, you can sell it and
purchase one with the proceeds.

29
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,625
That's a good idea, sir.

30
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,083
Thanks for suggesting it.

31
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,750
[TOUYA]
It really is light.

32
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:04,250
[SOLUM] Also, I'd like
to return this to you.

33
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,666
It was found in one
of the dragon's eyes.

34
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,875
I presume it's yours.

35
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,666
[TOUYA]
I wonder...

36
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:27,125
[TOUYA] Kohaku. Did you sense
whoever threw this knife?

37
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,666
[KOHAKU]
Yes.

38
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,708
In fact, I think I sensed two
people outside of our group

39
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,333
hiding in the trees.

40
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,458
At the time, I assumed
they were villagers.

41
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,791
So this is it.

42
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,708
Berge, The royal
capital of Mismede.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,333
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,833
I, Olga Strand,

45
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:00,791
have completed my work
in the kingdom of Belfast.

46
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,916
You have done well.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,708
As have you, Garen.

48
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,875
And you, Knight of Belfast.

49
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,166
I thank you both for
escorting Lady Strand home.

50
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,833
[LYON, GAREN]
Your Grace.

51
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,583
Envoys of Belfast, I'm pleased
to welcome you to Mismede.

52
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,375
I hear that a dragon
attacked Eld village,

53
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,500
and that you defeated it.

54
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,583
Tell me, is this true?

55
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,541
Yes. That's right, Your Majesty.

56
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,166
These four dispatched the dragon
that attacked your village

57
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,333
and can confirm
that it acted alone.

58
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,750
And who are you?

59
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,458
[YUMINA] My apologies for
the delayed introduction,

60
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,166
Your Grace. It's an honor
and a pleasure to meet you.

61
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,458
I am Princess Yumina
Arina Bellfast.

62
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,708
The daughter of King
Tristwyn Urnes Belfast.

63
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,083
Heavens!

64
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,250
And what brings the Princess
of Belfast to my halls?

65
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,125
Please, consider my
presence a sign of

66
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,541
Belfast's earnest hope
for this alliance.

67
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,416
My father penned this
letter in his own hand.

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,708
Read it at your pleasure,
Your Grace.

69
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,625
Interesting.

70
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:05,458
I shall think on the matter,
and respond in the near future.

71
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,458
Until then, please rest.

72
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,958
Enjoy my palace.

73
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,291
A dragon slayer in my halls.

74
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:16,458
Ha, ha, ha! My blood's
not roiled so in ages!

75
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,083
How 'bout it, young Touya?

76
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,333
Would you care to spar?

77
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,750
[JAMUKHA grunting]

78
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,375
[TOUYA]
Oh, my, what big arms you have.

79
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,000
[JAMUKHA grunting]

80
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,208
[GRATZ]
Sir Touya.

81
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,416
His majesty has
long felt compelled

82
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,083
to fight any strong
warrior he meets.

83
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,291
Frankly, we're all
quite troubled by it.

84
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,041
[TOUYA]
Oh, yeah?

85
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,458
So don't go holding back.

86
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,041
Give him a good sound thrashing.

87
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,666
Do it for all of
us who love him!

88
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,708
[TOUYA] That seems a
little counterintuitive,

89
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,083
but I am in another country.

90
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,000
[JUDGE 7A]
Here are the rules:

91
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,708
the match will end whenever
a combatant admits defeat,

92
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,041
or is put into a position
to receive a fatal wound.

93
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,791
Use of magic is permitted,
provided that it's not

94
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,666
offensive magic which
directly harms a combatant.

95
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,750
Fighters. At the ready.

96
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,000
I think we are.

97
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,791
Give it all you've got, boy.

98
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,333
Think of this as a real battle.

99
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,125
Use any and all means
available to beat me.

100
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,750
Yeah, okay.

101
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,541
Very well. Begin!

102
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,833
[TOUYA]
Slip!

103
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,750
[JAMUKHA screams]

104
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,833
Uh?!

105
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,083
[TOUYA]
Well. Guess that's the match.

106
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,916
What the hell did you just do?!

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,833
Hey! Come back.

108
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,541
That's one of my
Null magic spells.

109
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,083
It's called Slip.

110
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,000
He did say it was cool to use
non-damaging spells, right?

111
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,458
[JAMUKHA]
Yeah. Except that one!

112
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,333
A spell like that doesn't
even let a match happen!

113
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,666
Let's go one more time!

114
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,625
Only that Slip spell
is off limits.

115
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,875
No forcing me to trip
this time, ya hear me?

116
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,041
[TOUYA]
Loud and clear.

117
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,958
Begin!

118
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,916
King Jamukha's stronger.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,875
Without magic,
he has the upper hand.

120
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,625
Cast something, Touya.

121
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,708
Come Forth Sand.

122
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:03,583
Obstructing Dust--

123
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,750
Too slow!

124
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,416
Multiple!

125
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,458
Made the king back
off with a bluff.

126
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,458
Clever.

127
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,291
I would expect no
less from Touya.

128
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,958
Now, Boost!

129
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,083
Accel!

130
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,250
[TOUYA grunts]

131
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,541
You managed to dodge that.

132
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,791
Well done.
Consider me impressed.

133
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,583
So quick!

134
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,791
I could barely see a blur.

135
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,708
It must be his Null magic.

136
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,458
[TOUYA]
That ability ya just used.

137
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,291
I'm guessing it's
your Null magic?

138
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,625
That it is.

139
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,291
You can see why I enjoy a
good scrap now and then.

140
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,208
I almost thought
you'd teleported.

141
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,416
[JAMUKHA]
I've yet to fight a man

142
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,750
who could match my
Accel's speed.

143
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,750
But it burns through
my mana fast, too,

144
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,208
so I prefer to use
it in short bursts.

145
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,375
[TOUYA]
I see.

146
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,208
That's an impressive spell.

147
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,875
I know.

148
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,083
So, thank you.

149
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,583
I'm excited to start using it.

150
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,083
Accel!

151
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,041
[gasps]

152
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,375
Did you...? Impossible!

153
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,166
This spell's surprisingly
difficult to control.

154
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,916
Still, I doubt I'll miss again.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,208
Accel!

156
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,875
Accel.

157
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,916
[ELZE]
Well, this fight took a turn.

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,583
[YAE]
I can't see a thing.

159
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,916
You've matched me in speed.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,958
But how will you
match my raw power?

161
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,125
Good question.

162
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,458
Not sure I have an answer,
but here goes.

163
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,125
Accel and Boost!

164
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,583
[JAMUKHA]
Hm? Accel!

165
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:34,666
[swords clanging]

166
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
[JAMUKHA]
Uh...

167
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,541
Looks like Checkmate.

168
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,875
I can't say I understand
what that phrase means.

169
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,750
But, I do concede defeat!

170
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,375
The winner is Mochizuki Touya!

171
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,666
I can't believe he used
two Null magics at once.

172
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,958
Uh?

173
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,541
[JAMUKHA]
I never thought I'd meet someone

174
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,458
who could beat my speed.

175
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,958
Honestly, I think I'd gotten
a little full of myself.

176
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,666
I'll have to take
a lesson from this.

177
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,875
Uh. Yeah? [laughs]

178
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,666
[TOUYA]
And this.

179
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,375
[LYON]
Sir Touya.

180
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,750
Nice outfit. It suits you well.

181
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,666
Thanks.

182
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,000
By the way,

183
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:24,708
you haven't seen Lady Olga
around, have you?

184
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,541
Not yet, but I just got here.

185
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,458
[PARTYGOERS chattering]

186
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,583
[TOUYA]
He is so into her.

187
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,916
[JAMUKHA]
Welcome, Touya!

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,041
You wear our clothes well.

189
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,708
I could almost mistake you
for a nobleman of Mismede.

190
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,833
Yeah? Ya really think so?

191
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,000
[YUMINA] That outfit really
does look nice on you.

192
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,083
So dashing.

193
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:55,916
Yeah.

194
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,166
That is a good look for you.

195
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,750
[LINZE]
It brings out a different side

196
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,166
of your natural charm.

197
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,083
Your normal outfit is
fine, but this wins!

198
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,125
Yeah, well, all of you
look really cute, too.

199
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,041
Hey! Why don't I take a picture?

200
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,833
[MEN groan]

201
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:12,958
What did you do?

202
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,458
Uh? Oh, sorry about that.

203
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,000
This is another one of
my Null magic spells.

204
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,041
It allows me to record
an image of any scene

205
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,791
so I can see it later.

206
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:22,916
Indeed.

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,291
It's like you made
an instant painting.

208
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,750
Can you take it out
of that device?

209
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,208
Why, yes I can.

210
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you have a canvas or a
piece of paper I could use?

211
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,666
Drawing.

212
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,458
[JAMUKHA]
My word!

213
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,458
That's simply amazing!

214
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,083
Tell me, Touya, do you think
you could paint me as well?

215
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,125
Sure, no problem.

216
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,500
[TOUYA]
Cute, cute, cute, and buff.

217
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,416
Cute, cute, cute, and buff.

218
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,333
[sighs]

219
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,500
Whew. I am beat.

220
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,583
[squeaking]

221
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,666
[TOUYA]
Uh, me?

222
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,583
What's this?

223
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,583
You've brought a strange
guest with you, Paula.

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,541
Good evening. Might I
inquire as to your name?

225
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,375
Oh. Yeah, my name's Touya.

226
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,625
Or Mochizuki Touya.

227
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,250
I just go by Touya.

228
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,833
--That will do.
--[door creaks]

229
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,791
So, you're the rumored
dragon slayer.

230
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,791
[TOUYA]
Did that just close itself?

231
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,166
Uh, yeah, that was me.

232
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,166
And you?

233
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,166
Oh, right. Please forgive me.

234
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,500
I'm Leen, an elder
of the fairy folk.

235
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,541
And here,

236
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,833
we have my friend Paula.

237
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:53,000
Despite appearances, I'm
actually far older than you.

238
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,541
You're older than me?

239
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,916
'Kay, by how much?

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,750
Well, it's difficult to say.

241
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,500
Lost track a few centuries in,
but I've seen at least six.

242
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,750
[TOUYA]
Six hundred?!

243
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,333
Older, but it's
a pain to recall,

244
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,291
so let's just go with 612.

245
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,541
[TOUYA]
U-Uh... Uh.

246
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,250
By the way, is your friend here
a summoned beast, or what?

247
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,666
Of course not.

248
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,416
Paula's a teddy bear.
She's filled with bits of fluff.

249
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,791
Must say, I'm surprised
that the sutured limbs

250
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,958
and cute squeaky sounds
didn't give her away.

251
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,291
[TOUYA]
Teddy's don't move.

252
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,958
[LEEN] Now, that's due to
my Null magic, Program.

253
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,416
It allows me to issue
situational commands

254
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,791
to inanimate objects.

255
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,125
For instance...

256
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,958
Initiate Program.

257
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,291
Movement.

258
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,916
Forward, on condition.
Whenever you are sat upon.

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,916
End Program.

260
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,750
[grunts]

261
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,416
I forgot to specify a distance.

262
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,000
But you understand.

263
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,208
If I give an object a command,
then it will do as instructed.

264
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,958
Okay, but, like, what if you
commanded Paula to fly?

265
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,208
Would that make her able to?

266
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,125
The spell isn't quite
powerful enough

267
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,208
to allow that level of freedom.

268
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,125
And the object's form matters.

269
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,291
Paula can do far
more than a chair.

270
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,625
But if I wanted to
make a toy fly,

271
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,083
I'd be better off
programming a model bird.

272
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,000
[TOUYA] Hm... Would you mind
if I tried it out a bit?

273
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,416
Huh?!

274
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,791
Initiate Program.

275
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,583
Movement.

276
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,416
Backwards for two meters.

277
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,541
On condition: Whenever
you are sat upon.

278
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,083
End Program.

279
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,125
[gasps, laughing]

280
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,583
Excuse me. How did
you just do that?

281
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,833
[TOUYA]
Use your spell?

282
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,958
I said the words.

283
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,250
That is a truly spectacular
talent you have.

284
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,541
Aside from Null magic,
which elements can you use?

285
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,333
[TOUYA]
All of them, believe it or not.

286
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,166
Sure, makes sense to me.

287
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,041
You know what, fine.

288
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,833
Let's do it. You will
be my new apprentice.

289
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,166
[TOUYA]
Huh?

290
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,708
[LEEN laughs]
Such a reaction.

291
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,416
Relax. I'll not turn you into
a stuffed bear for refusing.

292
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,583
That said, if you should
change your mind--

293
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,791
Sorry, ma'am!

294
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,250
[TOUYA]
I am so out of here!

295
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,208
[LEEN]
Gone, but not forgotten...

296
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,791
Hey, Master.

297
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,583
Are you as tired as
you look right now?

298
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,166
[TOUYA]
Yeah, I'm beat.

299
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,291
A lot happened today.

300
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,333
Wait a second!

301
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,291
What if I used
Program to make it?

302
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,833
[KOHAKU]
Hm?

303
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,083
[YUMINA]
Touya! Are you heading out?

304
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,333
Yeah, what's up?

305
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,916
We just finished
eating breakfast,

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,666
so we were thinking about taking
a stroll through the garden.

307
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,333
I'm glad you're getting along.

308
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,916
Seen Yae or Elze?

309
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,791
They're both at a joint
training session

310
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,958
with some of Mismede's soldiers
in the arena right now.

311
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,791
[TOUYA]
Yeah. That sounds like them.

312
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,000
Anyway, what were
you planning for the day?

313
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,125
Just a bit of light shopping.

314
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,875
[YUMINA]
You would look so cute in this!

315
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,291
That's not what I had in mind.

316
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,666
[KOHAKU]
This is so much fun.

317
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,125
[LINZE]
Come forth, Water.

318
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,833
Blade both Cold and Clear.

319
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,583
Aqua Cutter!

320
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,583
Will those pieces
be small enough?

321
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,291
Yeah. Thanks a bunch, Linze.

322
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,083
What are you planning
to make with them?

323
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,041
Something way better than

This type of weapon's

On the former condition,
use Modeling to transform

the blade from a dagger

You can use that up

You know what?

374
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,666
A weapon like that needs a name.

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,083
Yeah, I agree.

What about "Brunhild"?

The show ends when she sings.
