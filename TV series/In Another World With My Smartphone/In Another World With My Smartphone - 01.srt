00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,291
[GOD] Better rip off
the ol' band-aid.

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,333
I'm sorry to say
that you're dead.

3
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,125
I was throwing some
lightning around

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,958
and accidentally dropped
a bolt on you.

5
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,583
The guilt is really
tearing me up.

6
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:33,166
It was a freak accident--
hasn't happened to me in weeks.

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,250
Gotcha.

8
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,666
[GOD]
What was it, again? Mochizuki?

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,958
Touya. It's Mochizuki Touya.

10
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,625
[GOD]
Mochizuki Touya. Of course.

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,041
I have to say.

12
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,500
You're taking the news
surprisingly well.

13
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,666
I was bracing myself to
get chewed out a little.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,083
Well, honestly,
this doesn't quite

15
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,541
feel real to me yet.

16
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,291
I'm still half expecting
to wake up from a dream.

17
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,250
But if I am dead,
then that's that.

18
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,333
No point complaining.

19
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,250
That's a mature perspective.

20
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,666
[TOUYA] Still, I was hoping
to live a bit past 15.

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,541
So, is this the part
where you judge me, or?

22
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,041
No, I'm resurrecting you.

23
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,458
You can do that?

24
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,291
[GOD] Yes, but I'm not
allowed to send you back

25
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,375
to the world you were born in,
so I found another for you.

26
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,000
It's kind of like yours.

27
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,208
The air won't choke you,
that's the key.

28
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,250
Oh. Sounds good to me.

29
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,250
Huh? It does?

30
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,583
Looks to me like you're
doing all you can.

31
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,250
I'm just glad I get
to live again at all.

32
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,791
[TOUYA] Grandad always
said to be forgiving

33
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:33,208
of others' mistakes.
I wonder if he's seeing this.

34
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:36,375
You've a very kind heart.

35
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:37,916
Tell me, is there anything else

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,125
I can do to make up
for all the trouble?

37
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,375
Anything?

38
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,000
[GOD] Mm. Anything you'd
like in your next life?

39
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:48,625
Cool. Um. Well...

40
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,791
Could you make it possible

41
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,333
for me to keep on
using this guy?

42
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,666
[GOD]
Your smartphone?

43
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,375
Uh. That's kind of
a dumb idea, isn't it?

44
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,625
I'd have no way to
keep it charged there.

45
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,666
[GOD] Actually,
that won't be a problem.

46
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,750
You should be able to recharge
the battery with magic.

47
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,833
Say what?

48
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,041
You mean you're
sending me to a world

49
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,875
that has actual magic?

50
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,458
[GOD]
Oh, yeah. It's got fireballs,

51
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,041
lizardmen, the works.

52
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,750
I'll endow you
with a natural talent

53
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,000
for using magic, as well.

54
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,458
Still, though. Are you sure
there's nothing else you'd like?

55
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,125
Yeah. Thanks a million.

56
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,250
Oh, I did wanna
ask you one thing.

57
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,291
If I were to bring a
smartphone from my world,

58
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,500
would I be able to
call people from it?

59
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:30,125
[GOD] Oh. No, I can't let
you communicate directly.

60
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:34,416
You'll be able to watch or read
anything you'd like, though.

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,625
Also, I'll set things up

62
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,666
so you can call me
if ever you need to.

63
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,916
I understand. Let's go
with that, then.

64

[TOUYA gasps]

65
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,083
So this is my new home.

66
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,500
[TOUYA]
Guess I'll follow this road.

67
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,208
It should lead to
something eventually.

Oh, good, I got through!

Glad you arrived in once piece.

Yeah, me, too.

[GOD] I forgot to mention
something about your phone.

74
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,500
I changed your map
and navigation

to match the world you're
in now. Try using it.

That'll be a big help.

I was about to just
pick a random direction.

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,208
[GOD]
Yeah, don't do that.

00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,041
No offense, but I'd rather not
see you again any time soon.

Good luck! I'm out.

What am I supposed to do there?

Should've asked God to let me
convert my money somehow.

Wherever did you obtain such
marvelous apparel from?

You must allow me to
purchase it from you!

I'll pay you well.
You won't regret it!

Here. The gold I owe you.

You sure? I appreciate
the gesture, but--

162
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,750
I'm not about to
break your stuff

163

without paying you back.

164
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,625
Then I'd be worse
than those guys.

165

[TOUYA] I only broke it to
try and catch them off guard.

If I'd known that they'd
be so easy to beat,

Hi, I'm Mochizuki Touya.

Mochizuki? That's
an exotic name.

Well. It's my family name.

You can just call me Touya.

Oh. So you introduce
yourself backwards.

to bring them the
Crystal Deer Antler.

202

They seemed a bit dodgy,
but work is work, I figured.

Well, lesson learned.

I really wish you would
listen to me more often.

206
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,208
Yeah, I guess we'd
better quit freelancing

from the guild now.

00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,500
no matter how hard they try.

319
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,041
Interesting.

320
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,500
I mean, I've never done
anything magical before.

321
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,333
But I recently talked
to someone who seemed

322
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,625
very confident that I'd be able
to use magic sometime soon.

323
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,875
And who might that be?

324
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,458
Uh...

325
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,500
Someone old and strong.

326
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,666
[TOUYA clears throat]
So, uh,

327
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,041
what would I need
to do to figure out

328
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,250
what my aptitudes might be?

329
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,916
[LINZE]
These are called spell stones.

330
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,375
They're used to store, release,
and amplify magical energy.

331
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,208
How to do this...

332
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,958
I guess water would be
the easiest to demonstrate.

333
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,250
Come forth, Water.

334
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,458
[TOUYA]
Oh!

335
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,083
Now this is what you
would call active magic.

336
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,416
Watch.

337
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,416
I make a command, channel
energy into the stone,

338
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,625
and it creates this
water in response.

339
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,125
And, by the way...

340
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,041
Come forth, Water.

341
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,791
If you don't have an
aptitude for water magic,

342
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,791
then frankly, you might as well
be talking to a regular pebble.

343
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,333
Wait, so you can't use it
even though your twin can?

344
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,208
It's not something I'm proud of,
so don't be so direct.

345
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,500
On the other hand, Elze can
use fortification magic,

346
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,750
but I never could.

347
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,000
It's not that either one
of us is more magical.

348
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,125
It's just that we have
different aptitudes.

349
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,500
Which is probably a big part of
why we work so well together.

350
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,125
Everyone alive
possesses magical energy.

351
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,708
But aptitudes are what allow us

352
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,875
to channel that
energy into spells.

353
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,916
So if I try to make
water like you did,

354
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,916
we'll know if I
have that aptitude?

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,333
[LINZE]
That's right.

356
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,208
You just need to hold the
spell stone in your hand,

357
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:21,291
focus your mind, and say
"Come forth, Water."

358
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,125
Come forth, Water.

359
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,583
[yelps]

360
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,250
[BOTH]
Uh...

361
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,666
And you had a few more stones?

362
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,166
Yeah, seven total, but--

363
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,083
[ELZE] Maybe we should
go outside first.

364
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:39,916
[ALL screaming]

365
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,125
Come forth, Fire.

366
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,000
[gasps]

367
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,541
[LINZE gasps]

368
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,250
Come forth, Earth.

369
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:52,916
Uh...

370
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,500
[BOTH gasp]

371
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,166
[TOUYA]
Come forth, Wind!

372
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,958
Come forth, Light!

373
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,750
Come forth, Dark!

374
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,416
What? Something wrong?

375
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,916
What the heck are you?

376
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,625
This is the first
we've heard of anyone

377
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,000
who can use all six elements.

378
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,333
I have aptitudes
for three of them,

379
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,916
and that's generally
considered pretty rare.

380
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,166
But you can use them all.
That's incredible.

381
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,916
[TOUYA]
Huh? What's that last stone for?

382
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,708
The seventh stone is used
to channel Null magic.

383
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,000
Null magic is unique,

384
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,000
so there isn't any single
incantation for it.

385
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,333
Huh. So then how
do you activate it?

386
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,958
That depends on
whose magic it is

387
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,291
and what it's doing.

388
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,125
Elze just has to say the
word "Boost" to use hers.

389
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,083
I know of a similar
strength enhancing spell

390
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,666
called Power Rise.

391
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,791
There're also spells like Gate,
which lets the user teleport.

392
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,916
That one's extra rare.

393
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,375
Wow.

394
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,250
I can't even start on how
useful that spell would be.

395
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,666
[ELZE]
I'd prefer my boost any day.

396
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,958
Thanks to that single spell,

397
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,708
every man who's ever
underestimated me

398
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,208
because I'm "just"
a girl has paid for it.

399
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,250
It explains why you're so tough.

400
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,708
That is crazy useful.

401
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:02,958
No doubt.

402
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,333
[TOUYA] So how do you
figure out what kind of

403
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,916
Null magic you can use?
Do you just try everything?

404
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,333
At some point, the name of
the spell just comes to you.

405
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,625
Yeah, that's right.

406
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,833
Null magic is also
known as personal magic

407
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,041
because it's very rare for
any two people to be able

408
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,541
to use the same spell.

409
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,375
So even if I can use Null magic,

410
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,541
I won't be able to
tell for a good while.

411
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,916
[LINZE]
No.

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,166
We can figure out if you
have the aptitude at least.

413
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,000
Just pick up the stone
and try casting something.

414
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,083
Even if the spell
doesn't actually work,

415
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,583
the stone should show
a reaction to your power.

416
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,875
Like it'll glow,
or shudder a bit.

417
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,166
Why don't you try casting
that teleport spell?

418
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,916
Just say the word "Gate"

419
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,916
Yeah. Sounds good to me.

420
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,416
Gate!

421
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,541
[LINZE gasps]

422
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,500
[ELZE]
No way.

423
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,000
Did it work?

424
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,541
Looks like it.

425
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,916
Awesome.

426
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,708
It's the forest where
we fought those wolves.

427
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,541
Specifically, the Gate spell
will allow the caster

428
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,875
to travel to places
they've been before.

429
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,416
Wonder why it took us here.

430
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,791
I guess this place was on
your mind when you cast it.

431
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:21,791
[LINZE, ELZE giggling]

432
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,083
[ELZE sighs]
I still can't believe

433
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,666
that you can use every element.

434
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,791
That's a little
more than unusual.

435
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,083
And with Null magic,

436
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,583
you're like the most
versatile magic user ever.

437
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,125
Wow, Touya. You're amazing.

438
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,500
[TOUYA] I can only do this stuff
because God felt bad for me.

439
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,041
It's kinda weird
getting praised for it.

440
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,041
[MICAH] Hey! Sorry to
interrupt your fun,

441
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,666
but do you have
a second to spare?

442
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,166
[ELZE]
Hey, Micah. What's goin' on?

443
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,000
My friend Aer here
needs some advice.

444
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,541
She's an employee at that café
down the street called "Parent."

445
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,291
I'm hoping to expand
the menu and thought

446
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,875
that adventurers
such as yourselves

447
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,666
might have some ideas.

448
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,625
[MICAH] Or maybe you
tasted something exotic

449
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,958
in your travels that
she could try and steal.

450
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,250
Cool foods? Huh.

451
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,458
Not really.

452
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,500
Nothing comes to mind
at the moment.

453
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,500
What's the food like
in Eashen, Touya?

454
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,625
Anything that'd be
good for a café?

455
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,916
If you had any suggestions,
I'd love to hear them.

456
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,833
I dunno, what kinda food
were you looking for?

457
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,166
Well, we're best
known for serving

458
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,458
a lot of sweets and the like.
Nothing too heavy.

459
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,875
I'd love to come up
with a dessert

460
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,875
that isn't just another cake.

461
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:30,041
I'm sure I've had
some weird desserts.

462
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,250
All I can come up with
are crepes and ice cream.

463
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,125
Hold on. Frozen cream?

464
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,000
Well, it's not totally frozen.

465
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,166
You serve it kinda soft.

466
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,166
How strange.

467
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,875
[TOUYA] I guess ice cream
isn't a thing here.

468
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,916
[LINZE]
Uh... What's that?

469
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,166
Uh.

470
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,083
It's a magical item that
helps me learn things.

471
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,750
Sorry for the rude request,
but I'd be grateful

472
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,708
if you didn't ask me
too much about it.

473
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,833
'Scuse me.

474
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,166
Could you bring out
a piece of paper

475
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,833
and write down what
I'm about to say?

476
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:03,666
Sure!

477
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,083
[TOUYA giggles]
So tasty!

478
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,375
[TOUYA]
Three eggs.

479
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,541
Two hundred milliliters of
heavy cream. And between...

480
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,208
[TOUYA] Food ingredients
are the same here, good.

481
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,375
Oh, right.

482
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,250
Hey, Linze, can you
make ice with magic?

483
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,750
Yeah. No problem.

484
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,041
Ice is just another
type of water.

485
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,125
Sweet!

486
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,500
[ELZE]
What do we do next? This is fun!

487
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,291
Delicious!

488
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,666
Incredible. It melts
in your mouth.

489
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,666
So tasty.

490
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,416
I've never had anything like it.

491
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,166
It's a pretty popular
treat in my country.

492
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,291
Think you might want
it for your café?

493
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,958
Yes, thank you for sharing it.

494
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,416
A treat like this could
make our café famous!

495
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,458
I'll have to try
making it again.

496
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,625
I should learn the recipe, too.

497
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,625
Between this and
that device of yours,

498
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,500
you keep getting weirder.

499
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,541
I'm curious about it, too.

500
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,041
It's a secret.

501
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,916
But, I'm glad I got to use it
to repay you a little bit.

502
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,041
Repay us? For what?

503
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,291
[TOUYA] For teaching me
how to use magic.

504
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,750
Thanks, you two.
