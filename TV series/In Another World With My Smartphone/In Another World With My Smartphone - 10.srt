1
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,375
Wow! It's so pretty.

2
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,416
I haven't been to
the beach in ages.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,250
You're right,
it has been a while.

4
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,291
I'll join as well.

5
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,916
[ALL laughing]

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,125
[YAE]
This sand is hot!

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,916
[TOUYA]
Huh? Ah...

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,416
The ruins are near?

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,625
Yeah. They are submerged,
but I bet I could swim to 'em.

10
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,166
[GIRLS laughing]

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,791
The water here feels
fantastic. Too bad.

12
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:54,375
I'd say we should swim, but I
don't own a suit right now.

13
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,500
Wait a second.
Swimsuits exist here?

14
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,958
We could go back to
Belfast. Buy some.

15
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,250
That's a great idea!

16
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,625
Mind taking us back to Belfast

17
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,541
for a quick shopping
trip, Touya?

18
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,375
We're here to investigate
some ruins, remember?

19
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,083
I don't mind, as long as they're
still willing to help us.

20
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,083
It's but a short delay.

21
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:19,541
Yeah, as long as we're here,
why not enjoy ourselves?

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,541
[gasps] Even bigger
than my bathtub!

23
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,333
Thank you for your kind
invitation, young Touya.

24
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,041
I'm glad we accepted it.

25
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,458
[TOUYA] Well, we were in the
area, so I thought I'd offer.

26
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:09,000
It was an offer I
couldn't refuse.

27
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,875
[TOUYA] I don't think
she wants to be here.

28
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,583
[CECILE]
Oh! It's just lovely!

29
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,583
So, is this the ocean?
I always wanted to see it.

30
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,000
Wait. Where's the other shore?

31
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,250
[MICAH]
We're here! Sorry we're late.

32
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,916
Took us a bit to
close up our shops.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,416
It's good to see you.
Thank you for inviting us.

34
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,083
We should get changed
into our swimsuits

35
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,416
while the sun's still out.

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,666
Hold on. I don't see anywhere
for us to change.

37
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,375
Oh! I'll just make us
some tents with modeling.

38
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,000
[ELZE gasps]

39
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,875
[TOUYA] I went ahead and made
a couple pool toys for us, too.

40
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,208
[ELZE]
I call first one in!

41
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,500
And, no peeping, Touya.

42
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,916
[TOUYA]
I would never!

43
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,458
My, it looks like Linze
must be the older sister.

44
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,708
You're one to talk!

45
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,375
Girls like us are supposed
to stick together!

46
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,416
[ELZE]
Touya!

47
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,583
[wheezes]

48
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,375
Well, do you like our swimsuits?

49
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,958
[TOUYA] Yeah. All three
of you look super cute.

50
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,833
[YAE]
That's wonderful to hear!

51
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,833
Although, I have to confess.

52
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,958
I still feel a bit
strange in this outfit.

53
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,958
[TOUYA]
Elze? What's wrong?

54
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,916
Huh? Nothing! I am
perfectly happy.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,541
Hey, good for you, big sis.

56
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,750
Why are we talking
about me right now?

57
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,125
Let's go swim already.

58
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,375
Okay! I'm good to go!

59
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,416
Well, I suppose we had
better follow the leader!

60
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,208
See you in the water!

There!

You've done it this time!
And now for my revenge!

Hey Linze, get in here!

65
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,833
[YAE] You shouldn't
let your guard down!

66
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:02,666
[TOUYA]
Oh, boy.

67
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,500
You okay?

68
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,375
Weren't you planning
to swim today?!

69
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,166
No. It's kind of embarrassing,

70
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,125
but I was never too
good at swimming.

71
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,375
Ah, I gotcha.

72
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,166
Well, then make sure you
don't get a heatstroke.

73
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,833
Right.

[RENNE]
How's it going Touya?

76
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,250
Let's hear it! Do you think
our swimsuits are cute?

77
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,083
Sure. You both look great.

78
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,833
Just you wait, Touya!

79
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,875
We're gonna make a
huge sand castle!

80
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,875
This beach is awesome!

81
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,375
I guess this is your first
time to visit one, isn't it?

82
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,166
Sure is! I'm gonna take
a bunch of sand back home

83
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,833
with me so I don't forget.

84
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,625
Good idea.

85
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,791
I think this'll help you
to remember it, too.

Oh, hey look, it's us!

Amazing! What is this thing?

88
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,250
It's a tool for
recording things we see.

So cool, so cool, so cool!

can do anything, Touya!

Ha, ha! Of course he can!

92
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,041
I would never settle for
a second-rate fiancé.

Whoa! So you're engaged?

Don't make things up, Sushi.

00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,708
Shoo. Go play.

Right! Let's go Renne!

They seem to get along well.

100
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:22,791
[gasps] Cecile, you
kinda startled me.

101
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,000
[CECILE laughs] Sorry, it's
a habit from my job.

102
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,125
Guess I should expect that.

103
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,625
I've been tasked with keeping an
eye on Lady Sue and young Renne.

104
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,250
But it took me longer than
I thought to get changed.

105
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,208
[TOUYA] Yeah, that must've
been a challenge.

106
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,083
The store we went to didn't
have any swimsuits in my size,

107
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,541
so I had to make do with
what they did have.

108
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,958
This one's a bit on the tight
side, as you can see.

109
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:49,125
I don't really need that
kind of information.

110
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,666
Oh, Lady Sue! Young Renne?

111
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,333
Would you mind if I joined you?

112
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,708
I wonder. Do they really
float at that size?

113
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,250
Enjoying the view?

114
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,166
[screams] Seriously, you two
gotta stop with the sneaking.

115
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,166
My apologies, sir. So,
does what float at that size?

116
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,208
I was referring to
the water donuts!

117
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,333
Just tryin' to make sure
I made 'em right.

be functioning fine.

119

That's good.

120
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,333
Uh. Say, what do you have there?

121
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,333
Even here, I still
have work to do.

122
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,083
I've been serving
drinks to the ladies.

123
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,416
I hope you two will
get to take a break.

124
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,166
[LAPIS] Yes. Cecile and I
have agreed to take turns.

125
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,875
So don't worry.

[KING, ALFRED, LEON grunting]

00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,625
[ALFRED]
Don't expect me to yield

128
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,625
just because you're the king!

129
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,583
[KING] Of course you
won't, little brother.

130
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,708
You'll lose because
I'm stronger!

This is nothing!

you're perfect the way you are.

time I got to it.

00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,375
What do you think?

It looks great. Very cute.

it with you in mind.

Well. Shall we go swimming now?

Uh. Sorry, but I was just about
to go look for those ruins.

soon as I finish.

me as soon as you're ready.

Does Paula plan to go swimming?

I used my Protection
spell to keep her dry.

153
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,833
We wouldn't want
her to get moldy.

Ah. I guess I should
use that, too.

00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,125
I'm assuming that you
aren't gonna swim?

159
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,125
You do know that just
because I'm feline

160
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,625
doesn't mean I'm
afraid of water.

161
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,708
[TOUYA]
What's wrong?

162
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,750
[LEEN]
Hm... That one girl isn't here.

163
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,333
What girl do you mean?

164
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,041
[LEEN] You know. The one whose
chest you groped a few days ago.

165
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,333
Oh, yeah, Tsubaki!

166
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,541
Wait, for the last time,
that was you!

167
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,875
But you wanted to see it, right?
To see her in a swimsuit.

168
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,333
[TOUYA]
There's nothing wrong with this.

169
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,708
I'm a healthy young man.
Curiosity is perfectly natural.

170
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,250
You just imagined it.

171
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,583
What?! No I didn't, you
can't prove anything!

172
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,458
It seems that you're
a red-blooded man

173
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,666
after all, Touya.

174
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,416
You're one to talk, ya big perv.

175
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,916
Moving along.

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,375
I think it's time for us to
start making some progress.

177
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,625
Yeah, what with?

178
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,291
The cop-out you used
on your bride.

179
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,333
We're scouting out those ruins.

180
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,958
[TOUYA]
Oh...

181
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,500
There's nothing for it
but to swim, right?

182
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,583
Yes, I'll be cheering
you on from here.

183
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,791
I have no intention of swimming.
I'd risk getting a sunburn.

184
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,375
Then why bother putting
on a swimsuit?

185
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,625
You threatened me into it.

186
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:17,291
Just what kinda freak show
am I in your mind?

187
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,333
[groaning]

188
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,916
Are you alive?

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,916
Somehow. I was able to
find the entrance, at least,

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,625
but when I tried to get
inside, I ran out of air.

191
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,583
Who could've guessed that
you would run out of air

192
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:59,333
while underwater. All right.
So, how should we proceed?

193
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,375
[TOUYA]
Are there any spells

194
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,625
that let people
breathe underwater?

195
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,250
I've heard of a few,

196
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,750
but I didn't care enough
to memorize them.

197
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,541
Maybe you should've
before we came here.

198
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,666
[LEEN]
Oh, Charlotte. Come down here.

199
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,041
Uh! Of course.

200
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,583
Tell me.

201
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,208
Do you know of a spell that lets
one function underwater?

202
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,416
If... I recall...

203
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,583
[LEEN]
It doesn't look like you recall.

204
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,791
Honestly. It's a shame
that your brain

205
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,708
didn't mature with
that body of yours.

206
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,666
[yelps] What are
you doing, Master?!

207
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,291
You're wearing that suit for the
rest of the day, as punishment.

208
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,833
And, also, you're not permitted

209
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,666
to return to the
palace till I do.

210
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,666
What? But you only asked me

211
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,291
because you don't
remember either, right?

212
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,833
[TOUYA]
That girl is a tyrant.

213
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,708
[KOHAKU] Master. You wish to
function underwater, do you?

214
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,250
Yeah. Do you know
of a good way to?

215
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,500
[KOHAKU]
I'm acquainted with an entity

216
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,125
that has dominion over water.

217
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,208
I believe that they could solve
your problem quite easily.

218
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,458
Who?

219
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,750
Just as I was once known
as the White Monarch,

220
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,916
they are the black.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,041
[GIRLS chattering]

222
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,541
Typically, this spell
would be incapable

223
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,250
of specifying what
spirit it might summon.

224
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,625
But if we infuse my spiritual
energy with master's magic

225
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,583
then he can call them
wherever they might be,

226
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,875
and they'll be too
intrigued to ignore it.

227
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,000
Watch and learn, fairy.

228
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,333
Do as you will, but this
seems a fool's errand.

229
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,166
The Black Emperor's no
force to be trifled with.

230
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,625
I'm still astounded that you're
the White Monarch.

231
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,166
I'm surprised that
you're so worried.

232
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,666
It's not any crazier than
you creating Paula.

233
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,208
Hey, Master. I don't actually
know what they'll ask

234
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,583
you to do before they
agree to forge a pact.

235
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,791
So be careful, just in case.

236
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,166
Wait a second.

237
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,958
You keep saying "they,"
like there's a lot of them.

238
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,333
Did I miss something?

239
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,916
[KOHAKU] The Black Emperor
is two beings in one.

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,416
Don't worry. You'll understand
once you meet them.

241
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,416
Black Emperor.

242
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,666
You who rules not just
water but winter,

243
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,916
and the great northern
mountains. I call upon you.

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,291
Answer my summons and
appear before me.

245
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,291
It looks like they heard you.

246
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,083
[BLACK EMPEROR A] Mm? Ooh!
Well if it isn't good old White!

247
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,375
It's been too long.
How ya doin'?

248
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,541
[KOHAKU] It's good to see you,
Black Emperor.

249
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:39,750
Ah... I told you,
just call me Black.

250
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,250
I thought we were friends!

251
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,000
Anyway. What are ya
doin' with that human?

252
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,875
This is my master, his
name's Mochizuki Touya.

253
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,458
Speaking of, you can
call me Kohaku now.

254
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,083
Your master?

255
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,500
You took a mere human
as your master? My.

256
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,500
Just how far have you fallen?

257
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,166
[KOHAKU]
Say what you will, old friends.

258
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,375
He'll be your master
too, soon. You'll see.

259
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,750
Nonsense.

260
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,250
[KOHAKU grunts]

261
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,875
[BLACK EMPEROR B chuckles]

262
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,458
[BLACK EMPEROR A]
Hmm...

263
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,791
Very well. Touya, was it?

264
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,541
I suppose we can test
to see if you're worthy.

265
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,500
Just to humor our friend.

266
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,541
I'm down. What do
you want from me?

267
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,125
Meet us in battle.

268
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,250
In the unlikely event that you
remain standing with your limbs

269
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:28,333
intact by sunset, you
shall get your pact.

270
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,333
Sounds good. Wanna start now?

271
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:34,000
Touya. Don't get careless and
let them pull one over on you.

272
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,916
Don't worry. I'll manage okay.

273
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,250
You're surprisingly calm.

274
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,583
At the very least,
I commend your courage.

275
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,291
Let us begin.

276
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,000
Then, Slip!

277
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,916
[BLACK EMPEROR A groans]

278
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,083
Enchant with Slip.

279
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,583
Initiate Program.

280
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,541
Begin as soon as the effect
of Slip starts to fade away.

281
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,125
On this condition, cast Slip.

282
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,541
Terminate this cycle upon
the caster's command.

283
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,791
End of Program.

284
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,083
This is crazy! What is
that boy doing to us?

[BLACK EMPEROR B groaning]

286
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,083
You programmed a bullet
to continuously cast slip.

287
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,250
Saving yourself the trouble.

288
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,625
How ruthlessly efficient.

Well. Guess we'll just wait
for them to give up.

determined, huh?

been around much at all.

neither has Leen.

[YUMINA] They said they were
off to investigate the ruins.

So perhaps they're
both out diving.

Maybe. I hope that's all it is.

So much spinning!

314
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,625
The entire world is spinning!

315
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,250
[BLACK EMPEROR B] Please,
no more! We've had enough.

316
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,791
Don't make us fall again.

317
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,833
[TOUYA] Yeah, sorry.
Guess I went overboard.

318
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,541
[BLACK EMPEROR A]
I can see why the White Monarch

319
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,291
acknowledged you as her master.

320
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,416
Mochizuki Touya.

321
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,791
You have proved yourself worthy.
Please forge a pact with us.

322
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,958
Yeah, sure.

323
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,125
If I remember correctly,

324
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,833
that means I need to
give you new names?

325
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,458
[BLACK EMPEROR A] Yes. Please
endow us with worthy names.

326
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,458
[TOUYA]
Hm... 'Kay.

327
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,875
Well, what do you guys think
of Kokuyou and Sango?

328
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,000
Kokuyou?

329
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,375
Sango?

330
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,875
You like 'em?

331
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,833
[KOKUYOU] I will gladly take
the name Kokuyou as mine!

332
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,500
[SANGO]
From this day forth,

333
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,833
I shall be known
by all as Sango.

334
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,416
As you've willed.

335
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,541
Hold it you two. You'll
cause our master trouble

336
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,458
if you lumber around
in that form.

337
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,958
Make yourselves smaller.

338
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,458
Really?

339
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,500
We need to make
ourselves all tiny

340
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,083
like the White-- uh,
like Kohaku here.

341
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,833
We can do that. Watch!

342
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,541
I didn't know you could fly.

343
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,958
We can manage it when
we're at this size.

344
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,458
Although we can't move
all that fast now.

345
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,541
Kokuyou. Sango. Hi.

346
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,833
I, Sango, shall prove
to be very useful.

347
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,791
I'll be just as
useful as her, sir.

348
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,333
[BOTH laughing]

349
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,250
[SANGO] So, you need us
to help you to breathe

350
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,500
while you're exploring
underwater, is that right?

351
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,916
Yeah. Can ya do it?

352
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,166
Yeah, piece of cake.

353
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,666
Cool, let's do it now.

354
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,500
Or, I'd like to do that,
but I can't yet.

355
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,333
Why can't you?

356
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,375
I need to take a quick break.

357
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,250
[LEEN]
Hm. Yes, I agree.

358
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,458
I can't keep you to
myself any longer.

359
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,416
Think I've earned
enough envy as it is.

360
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,000
Say what?

361
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,333
--[TOUYA] Oh.
--[LEEN] Go on.

362
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,500
Play with your friends.

363
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,083
Master.

364
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,333
In that case, Sango, Kokuyou,
and I have catching up to do.

365
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,041
Okay. Have fun.

366
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,125
It's about time
that you joined us.

367
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,500
Sorry, 'bout that.

368
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,833
What were you two talking about?

369
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,333
[TOUYA]
You know. The ruins.

370
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,041
And nothing else? Really?

371
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,541
[TOUYA]
What? You think I'm lying?

372
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,916
[ALL]
Mm-hm.

373
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,541
[TOUYA]
Come on. Where's the trust?

374
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,750
Were you blown away by
Leen in her swimsuit.

375
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,833
Is that why you abandoned
us for so long?

376
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,541
[TOUYA]
Of course not, we were working.

377
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,958
This begs the question.

378
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,541
If not hers, then whose swimsuit
do you think looks best?

379
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,541
Oh yeah. Let's hear it, Touya.

380
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,791
Say... what?

381
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,666
How did we get to this point?

382
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,916
[RENNE] I think we should
make a bunch'a turrets.

383
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,666
Sue's. Yup.

384
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,541
[ALL]
Huh?

385
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,375
Do you mean that? Am I too old?

386
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,750
--[TOUYA] Wha--?!
--Touya, that is not okay.

387
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,500
No! I didn't mean it like that.

388
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:27,041
I'm a normal, healthy guy. I
like my own age group, I swear.

389
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,875
Listen, I--

390
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,875
[YUMINA]
Is that...?

391
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,541
[YAE]
He never took our picture.

392
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,541
Come to think of it,
you haven't!

393
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,791
This is too much for me.

394
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,750
No. You've got it wrong.

395
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,791
I only took this to help them
preserve the memory, okay?

396
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,375
The memory. Sure.

397
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:46,750
[TOUYA]
I told you, it's not like that.

398
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,291
It's okay Touya. If you say
it's not, I believe you.

399
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,791
That said,

400
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,958
I think you had better start
making memories with us now.

401
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,250
Sure. I'd love to.

402
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,958
I know! Let's swim. Follow me!

403
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,166
Hey! Are you coming?

404
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,500
We're right behind you!

405
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,000
[ELZE]
Hey, Touya, think fast!

406
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,583
[TOUYA grunts]

407
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,541
[TOUYA]
Ah!

408
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,083
[GIRLS laugh]

409
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,958
[SUSHI]
My suit got best in show!

410
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,291
[RENNE]
Way to go, Sue!

411
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,791
[TOUYA]
I couldn't decide, okay?

412
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,583
Well, those ruins aren't
gonna explore themselves.

413
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,958
Think I'd better go
solo at first.

414
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,125
If anything happens, come
right back with Gate, okay?

415
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,458
Sure. All right guys. Go for it.

416
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,708
Just leave it to us!

417
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,416
[KOKUYOU] You'll be able
to breath fine now.

418
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,000
Cool.

419
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,208
Awesome.

420
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,750
Not only can I breathe down
here, I can walk normally.

421
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,625
It's almost like I'm on land.

422
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,833
We're able to bend water
to our will with great ease.

423
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,541
I look forward to showing
you our real power.

424
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,916
[TOUYA laughs]
Me, too.

425
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,875
Wonder what's making that light.

426
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,833
Guess we're gonna find out.

427
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,083
What is this thing?

428
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,000
[SANGO] Try passing
some magic through it.

429
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,375
[TOUYA grunts]

430
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,583
[gasps]

431
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,916
[TOUYA]
Think it worked.

432
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,416
What the heck?!

433
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,583
[gasps]

434
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,208
[TOUYA]
Whoa.

435
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,333
Excuse me, master. Do you
know where you've taken us?

436
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,875
No.

437
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,166
Uh.

438
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,625
Who is that?

439
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:00,750
Hm?

440
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,541
[TOUYA grunts]

441
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,125
Greetings, traveler.

442
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,291
I am the terminal that
controls this place:

443
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:10,875
the Aerial Garden of Babylon.
You may call me Francesca.

444
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,583
'Kay, but uh...

445
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,875
You have queries?

446
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,041
Yeah. Why are you...

447
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,208
...naked down there?
