1
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,250
[ALFRED] Our own nobles
may have done this.

2
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,666
There's a powerful faction
which opposes trade

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,125
with the kingdom of Mismede.

4
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,875
Wait, another kingdom?

5
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,291
[ALFRED] It's newly founded.
The king there is a beastman.

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,125
And my brother has
recently been considering

7
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,458
an alliance with this land.

8
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,500
Should he fall,
the crown shall be passed

9
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:34,166
to his eldest daughter,
Princess Yumina.

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,666
If the culprit is of our court,

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,750
he could use her
youth to his gain,

12
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:41,375
assuming power as an advisor.
Or even as a husband.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,541
I get it.

14
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,958
So, how can I help out?

15
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,875
You can foil the
assassin's efforts.

16
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,166
Use your Recovery spell
to save the king.

17
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,375
Count Balsa.

18
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,541
It's an honor, Your Grace.

19
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:43,166
You've come at the perfect time.

20
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,583
Our guards have just captured
the treacherous demon

21
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,375
behind the attempt
on his majesty's life.

22
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,083
What? And who was it?

23
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,791
It was the esteemed
ambassador from Mismede.

24
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,458
Let's cut off her
head and return it.

25
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,791
Quiet!

26
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,625
My brother will be the one
to make that decision.

27
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,125
You think so?

28
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:05,291
I admire your fair spirit,
but its wasted on that beast.

29
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:08,791
And Slip.

30
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,500
[BALSA yelps]

31
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:15,500
[KING grunting, panting]

32
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,000
Stay with us.

33
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,208
He's trying.

34
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,500
That he is.

35
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,000
[door opens]

36
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,375
Brother!

37
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,541
[gasps]

38
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,250
[gasps]

39
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,541
It's good to see you.
But, who is this?

40
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,416
We'll speak later. Go, Touya.

41
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,791
With haste.

42
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,625
Recovery!

43
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,291
Wait. Recovery?

44
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,250
That Null magic can heal
any abnormal condition.

45
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,041
I didn't think anyone
still living could use it.

46
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,833
[grunting]

47
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,000
[ALL gasp]

48
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,333
You're healed.

49
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,041
I was so worried!

50
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,625
I suddenly feel as though
all that suffering

51
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,041
were but a dream.

52
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,625
Oh, thank goodness.

53
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,250
Do tell me, Alfred.
Who's this young man?

54
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,708
Allow me to introduce
the young Mochizuki Touya.

55
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,541
He gave Ellen her sight back.
And now, he's healed you.

56
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:25,583
I see. You saved me.
Many thanks.

57
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,958
No prob.

58
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,750
Mochizuki Touya, is it?

59
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,083
You did an excellent
job, young man.

60
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,000
Very impressive! [laughs]

61
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,458
That's kinda painful, sir. I--

62
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,875
[CHARLOTTE]
Please, General Leon. Calm down.

63
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,416
Though it is exciting to
see Recovery used again.

64
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,833
Makes me wonder what other
secrets you're hiding.

65
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,541
H-Huh?

66
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,375
The name's Charlotte,
by the way.

67
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,166
Official mage of
the royal family.

68
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,708
Tell me, young man,

69
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,833
you don't possess any other
affinities for magic, do you?

70
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,208
Well, uh. Yeah,
I can use a good few.

71
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,791
I bet you can.

72
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,583
I'd love to get you alone
and talk shop sometime.

73
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,333
Yeah. I'll look at my schedule.

74
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,500
[YUMINA] Excuse me. You saved
my father's life, sir.

75
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,916
Our family is in your debt.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,541
Oh. Yeah, of course.

77
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,166
There's no need to thank me.

78
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,083
I'm just glad he's okay now.

79
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,666
[TOUYA]
Uh... Is there anything else?

80
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,333
Do you dislike those
younger than you?

81
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,333
What?

82
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,458
[KING]
I fail to see what Mismede

83
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,250
would gain from my death.

84
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,458
No, this was far more likely
the act of a solitary traitor.

85
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,750
That was my suspicion as well.

86
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,916
But there's proof.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,166
What kind of proof?

88
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,541
Sir.

89
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,708
You collapsed almost
immediately after drinking wine

90
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,708
you received from
the ambassador.

91
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,083
Who else could've poisoned it?

92
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,958
[TOUYA] So he was poisoned
with wine. Interesting.

93
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,375
[KING]
Hm.

94
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,375
Let's speak with this
ambassador. Hear her defense.

95
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,083
[LEON]
At once.

96
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,833
Hail, Your Majesty.
Olga Strand, at your service.

97
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,083
You're Arma's sister!

98
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,041
[OLGA]
You're here?

99
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,375
Oh?

100
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,416
Are you a friend of the
ambassador's, young Touya?

101
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,625
Yeah. Kinda.

102
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,333
I ran into her sister,
Arma, and helped her

103
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,958
find her way home, one time.

104
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,708
By the way...

105
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,791
No one's messed with the room
where the king collapsed

106
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,083
since it happened, right?

107
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,583
Oh. Right. I ordered
none to touch it.

108
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,500
In that case, I bet
I can sort this out.

109
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,041
[ALL but TOUYA gasp]

110
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,375
[LEON]
Here. The wine the king drank.

111
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,666
I might not need it.

112
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,541
Search. Poison.

113
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,416
I think I understand
now. General?

114
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,041
Could you invite the
king's party to join us?

115
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,625
Oh, and also, see if
Count Balsa can come.

116
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,916
[TOUYA]
Elementary, my dear.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,541
[YUMINA]
Uh...

118
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,208
[BALSA]
What's the meaning of this?!

119
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,166
Why have I been
called back here?

120
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,958
Your Majesty!

121
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,583
Fear not, good Count.
I have recovered.

122
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,750
Indeed.

123
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,958
I'm pleased to see
you well, Your Grace.

124
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,708
Well, that's all of us.

125
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,791
I assume you found something
since you called us here.

126
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,208
[TOUYA]
We'll get to that.

127
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,583
Now, everyone who was present
when the king collapsed

128
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:28,041
is currently in this room.
Is that correct?

129
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,583
That's right. All of
us were present.

130
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,833
And therefore...

131
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,291
[ALL gasp]

132
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,625
The culprit is in this room!

133
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,791
[TOUYA] Nailed it! I always
wanted to say that line!

134
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,166
[ALL gasp]

135
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,833
Speak, Touya.
Tell us your meaning.

136
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,166
Yeah. Sorry.

137
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,666
Sure, the culprit's here.

138
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,166
She's standing right next to me.

139
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,791
As each of you observed,

140
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,750
this is the wine his
majesty took a drink of

141
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,625
before his collapse.

142
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,875
He gave a toast,
took a sip, and fell.

143
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,375
Yes. That much is certain.

144
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,416
[BALSA]
Yes.

145
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,791
Which means,
as I've been saying,

146
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,000
this wench gave the
king poison wine.

147
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,083
The wine wasn't poi--

148
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,791
[BALSA]
Be silent, you lowly beastwoman!

149
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,083
[TOUYA]
Now then.

150
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,666
I'd like to verify a
certain suspicion I have.

151
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,875
Verify?

152
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,500
Yeah. First of all,

153
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,791
I've prepared a bottle of wine
that surely isn't poisoned.

154
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,375
I'm afraid that
I'm still a minor,

155
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,791
so I won't be able
to test it myself.

156
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,208
I'll have to ask one
of you to assist me.

157
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,291
General Leon. Would you mind?

158
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,291
What's a "minor"?

159
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,333
I'm not sure what you're trying
to prove here, but sure.

160
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,541
A fine vintage.

161
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,333
Now that we can all
agree beyond a doubt

162
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,541
that this wine is poison free.

163
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,291
I'll pour it into
his majesty's glass,

164
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,000
using the same tray his was on.

165
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,125
[BALSA]
Hm.

166
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,000
Since his majesty
isn't feeling well,

167
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,750
he'll need a substitute.

168
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,916
Now who's regal enough
to fully recreate the scene?

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,458
Ah! Count Balsa, please.

170
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,375
That doesn't seem safe.

171
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,750
'Course it is!

172
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,583
I mean, it's not like
there's a way to poison wine

173
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,083
after it leaves the bottle.

174
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,666
Balsa. What's the matter?

175
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,750
It's just--

176
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,250
You see--

177
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,333
[TOUYA]
What's up?

178
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,583
Does the thought
of portraying the king

179
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,083
give ya stage fright?

180
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,500
I'm sure you'll do fine.

181
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,166
[BALSA]
Release me!

182
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,708
Please! Somebody help me!

183
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,083
Ah! It burns.
I'm dying, damn it.

184
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,416
That's all in your head.

185
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,625
I already washed the
poison out of the glass.

186
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,666
What?!

187
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,875
I wonder.

188
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,458
What made you think
there was poison in here?

189
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,041
[BALSA grunts]

190
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,500
Explain yourself.

191
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,541
Well, it definitely wasn't
the wine from Olga

192
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:54,458
that was poisoned.
As the count clearly knew,

193
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,625
it's the king's glass
that was poisoned.

194
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,250
I see.

195
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,750
He framed me!

196
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,750
[TOUYA] I discovered this
by using my search null magic

197
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,125
to detect it.

198
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,166
[TOUYA] Actually, it seems
all of his highness'

199
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,000
glasses were poisoned.

200
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,916
I shudder at the thought.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,291
Are ya gonna confess now?

202
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,625
[BALSA grunts]

203
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,916
The perfect man.

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,833
[TOUYA]
Uh. What?

205
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,041
You good over there?

206
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,208
It seems that you're
both talented and wise.

207
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,750
[TOUYA]
Huh?

208
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,500
I won't let it end here!

209
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,291
Don't Slip.

210
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,333
[BALSA yelps]

211
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,041
[laughs]

212
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,625
[gasps]

213
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,625
[YUMINA]
I love you.

214
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,500
[TOUYA]
Okay...

215
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,375
[KING] You've done this kingdom
a great service today.

216
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,875
Among several other things,

217
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,208
I owe you a debt of honor
for saving my life.

218
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,500
[TOUYA] Please, think
nothing of it, sir.

219
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,208
My visit to the duke
was more exciting

220
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,041
than expected, that's all.

221
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,416
Uh--

222
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,500
I have an announcement.

223
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,416
A big one.

224
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,166
May I speak?

225
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,208
Of course, Yumina.

226
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,291
Well,

227
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,500
I've been staring
at Touya all day.

228
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,583
So, I--

229
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,583
I think I'll take
him as my husband.

230
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,166
[TOUYA coughs]

231
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,083
[TOUYA]
Yeah?

232
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,375
This handsome suitor would
make me a happy bride

233
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,625
if you'd give your blessing.

234
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,875
Will you, Father?

235
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,125
I might.

236
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,041
But first, I must ask
why you have chosen him.

237
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,708
He's intelligent and he
lives to bring happiness

238
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,041
to those around him.
And, I should mention,

239
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,208
he's quite pleasing to look at.

240
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,166
He's the first person
I've ever felt like

241
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,916
I could spend the
rest of my life with.

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,291
Ah, I see.

243
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,083
Well, if that's how you feel,
I shan't oppose you.

244
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,791
I wish you a happy
life together.

245
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:56,708
[YUMINA]
Yeah?

246
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,083
Well, this is wonderful.

247
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,333
It calls for celebration.

248
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,000
[TOUYA]
Hey! Hold on a second!

249
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,666
What, is something the matter?

250
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,125
No, I mean, yeah, well--

251
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,291
Aren't'cha bein' kinda
quick to accept this?

252
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,000
You met me like two
hours ago, remember?

253
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,875
Normally, I'd be more cautious.

254
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,375
But Yumina's judged you
to be a good man.

255
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,041
And that tells me
all I need to know.

256
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,041
[TOUYA]
Seriously? How?!

257
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,458
It's quite simple.

258
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,500
Our daughter has
mystic eyes, see.

259
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,250
[KING] The Mystic Eyes of
Intuition, they're called.

260
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:27,791
With them, Yumina can see
one's true character.

261
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,666
Yeah, well that's
not the only issue.

262
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,875
I mean, first of all,
how friggin' old is she?

263
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:32,791
[KING]
She's 12.

264
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,750
[groans] Well, there.

265
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,958
Wouldn't that make her a little
too young to get married?

266
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,083
It's common for us
in the royal family

267
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,916
to settle on a partner
before age 15.

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,083
I was betrothed to Yuel at 14.

269
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,833
I only wish we'd
done it sooner. Right?

270
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,708
Yes, I was hoping
that our Yumina

271
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,875
would find someone special soon.

272
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,416
[sighs]

273
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,000
If you dislike me,
it's okay to say so, Touya.

274
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:58,833
[TOUYA]
I'm...

275
00:12:58,916 --> 00:12:59,958
[TOUYA]
It isn't that.

276
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,166
[TOUYA]
...screwed.

277
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,583
Well then, there isn't
a problem, is there?

278
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,333
Men can't get married until
they're adults in my country.

279
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,708
So, marriage isn't an option
for me until I turn 18.

280
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,666
And how old are you now, Touya?

281
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,666
[TOUYA]
I'm about to turn 16.

282
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,416
Well, in that case,
why don't you two spend

283
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,833
the next couple of years
getting to know one another?

284
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,166
[TOUYA]
Huh?

285
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,583
[KING] If, after spending
that much time with her,

286
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,375
you're still unable
to consider marriage,

287
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:29,416
we'll accept your decision,
of course. Will that work?

288
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,541
Sure.

289
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,041
[TOUYA]
Two measly years?

290
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,083
She'll only be 14 by then.

291
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,708
It's settled, then.
That'll give you two years

292
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,833
to win over Touya's heart, okay?

293
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,500
[YUMINA]
And win it I shall!

294
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,958
[TOUYA]
Uh...

295
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,125
I certainly hope you'll
treat me well, darling.

296
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,041
[laughs nervously]

297
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:55,333
[TOUYA groans] Maybe I'm
just having a bad dream.

298
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,750
[phone rings]

299
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,208
[TOUYA]
'Sup, God.

300
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,833
[GOD]
Hey, congrats on the engagement!

301
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,583
You've seriously
been watching this?

302
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:09,958
[GOD laughs] Seems like things
are getting interesting!

303
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,666
[TOUYA]
Please don't laugh at my pain.

304
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,583
I don't even wanna
think about marriage.

305
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,666
Let alone with a 12 year old.

306
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,333
And we wouldn't want that.

307
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,750
Just like we wouldn't
want you to go

308
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,208
to a special place
in hell, amiright?

309
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,208
Say, did you know that

310
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,125
polygamy's a thing
in that world?

311
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,625
[TOUYA] Are you sure you
aren't secretly the devil?

312
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,916
[GOD] 'Course not! I'd hate
to do his job. Too hot.

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,791
Anyway, I'm rootin'
for ya. Later.

314
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,041
[TOUYA sighs]
What the hell, God?

315
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,333
[YUMINA]
Sweet dreams, Touya.

316
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,208
[TOUYA groans]

317
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,791
You've been gone six hours
and you got engaged?

318
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,000
This is quite the surprise.

319
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,875
What were you thinking, Touya?

320
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,500
It's not an official
engagement yet.

321
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,208
My name's Yumina
Airina Bellfest,

322
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,083
and I look forward
to staying with you.

323
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,833
When was it decided
that you'd stay with us?

324
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,625
Well, my father ordered me to.

325
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,541
But you're a princess.

326
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,541
You sure you'll
be okay--? My lady.

327
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,583
Yes, and there's no
need for formalities.

328
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,333
We'll be companions, after all.

329
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,916
I'm a little inexperienced,
but I'll definitely do my best.

330
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,083
So how do I get a guild card?

331
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,666
I'd like to start working
as soon as possible.

332
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,458
[YAE, LINZE, ELZE, TOUYA]
Huh?

333
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,875
Yeah, look, Princess.

334
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,833
Guild jobs are too dangerous.
I can't let you come.

335
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,166
I'll be fine.

336
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,208
Also, please stop
calling me princess.

337
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,791
From now on, it's either
Yumina, or darling.

338
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,458
[YAE, LINZE, ELZE]
Wait. Did she say "darling"?

339
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,000
Darling's not gonna work for me.

340
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,333
Well. Yumina, then. Right?

341
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,083
[TOUYA]
Right. Yumina.

342
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,666
Well done.

343
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,500
Wait a sec. If you two
actually do get married,

344
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,666
does that mean that
you'll be the next king?

345
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,500
[TOUYA]
Uh, me? A king?

346
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,583
No, no, no, no, no.
I-I don't think so.

347
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,833
That's crazy talk, Elze.

348
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,875
In the event that Touya
and I should conceive,

349
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,291
the child born between us
will succeed the throne.

350
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,750
Wha--?

351
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,375
[TOUYA]
All five together!

352
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,875
[ELZE, LINZE, YAE, YUMINA]
Huh?

353
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,333
[TOUYA]
Eh...

354
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,916
You sure you wanna start
with hunting King Apes?

355
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,250
I only wish to
showcase my abilities.

356
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,291
So, a mission like
this should suffice.

357
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,708
Well, if you do get in trouble,

358
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,666
I'm sure your fiancé
will protect you.

359
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,000
[groans]

360
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,208
Don't worry.

361
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,458
I may look fragile,
but I've been trained

362
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,041
in archery and magic.

363
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,541
And I'd like to think
myself capable in both.

364
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,791
Let's get started.

365
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,166
Come forth, Dark.

366
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,625
I seek the proud beasts
wrapped in silver.

367
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,958
Silver Wolf Pack!

368
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,583
Sounds like a summoning spell.

369
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,625
Well. Happy hunting.

370
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,791
They should lure the
apes back to us soon.

371
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,000
Wow.

372
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,208
Summoning magic seems
pretty convenient.

373
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,541
I'd be happy to teach
you how it works later!

374
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,375
[TOUYA] Thanks. Let's do it
after this mission, okay?

375
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,125
Sure!

376
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,500
[WOLVES howl]

377
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,791
Move in!

378
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,750
[roars]

379
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,916
Whirling Spiral.

380
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,833
Please come forth. Fire Storm!

381
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,750
[KING APES roar]

382
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,041
Big Slip!

383
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,416
Let's Boost!

384
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,250
Come forth, Lightning.
Pure Sparking Javelin.

385
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,166
Burning Javelin. Crimson Spear.

386
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,666
Thunder Spear!

387
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,500
Fire Spear!

388
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,916
[roars]

389
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,458
[TOUYA sighs]

390
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,250
Good work.

391
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,041
So, uh. Did I do okay?

392
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,000
Great. That was some
impressive archery.

393
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,583
And you're a skilled
mage, too, so. Yeah.

394
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,666
It's always good to have
support from the rear!

395
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,875
[TOUYA sighs]
If we add her,

396
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,375
that'll make four girls on this
team. And still no guys but me.

397
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,916
And what's so wrong with that?

398
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You might not have noticed,
but we stand out at the guild.

399
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,333
Everyone's always staring at me.

400
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,291
And not in a good way either.
It gets super awkward.

401
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,000
Why do people stare?

402
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,625
Well, they're
jealous, obviously.

403
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,791
Just think about it.

404
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,708
A single guy. With three
super-cute girls.

405
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,208
[GIRLS gasp]

406
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,750
Come on, what're you
tryin' to say, Touya?

407
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,333
You're such a joker!
Calling us cute.

408
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,333
Hey, Touya. What about me?

409
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,583
Am I as cute as
your friends are?

410
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,500
Yeah, I think
you're pretty cute.

411
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,625
[giggles]

412
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,791
[TOUYA]
Uh... Yeah. They're cute.

413
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,833
[BEAST]
Was it you who summoned me?

414
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,333
Cool. Guess I pulled it off.

415
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,291
That was just the first step.

416
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,208
The hard part is forming
a pact with the summon beast.

417
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,791
Wanna make a deal?

418
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,625
[BEAST] You seek to
tame me? How amusing.

419
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,958
I hope you have
flesh on your bones.

420
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,541
[gasps] A white tiger.
I've heard of this.

421
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,916
The White Monarch!

422
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,333
Is that a good one?

423
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,333
It's the highest class of beast
that can be summoned.

424
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,208
Not a magic beast,
but a heavenly beast.

425
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,166
Heavenly? 'Kay.

426
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,125
So, how exactly do I form a
pact with something like that?

427
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:06,083
Show me the class of
magic energy you possess.

428
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,541
Should I find it lacking,
I'll devour you.

429
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,583
Could you not?

430
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,250
[sniffs]

431
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,708
Strange.

432
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,916
I sense a spirit, or perhaps
an even higher power.

433
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,666
Now, come. Let your
magic flow into me.

434
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,958
If you promise not to bite,
I'll give it a shot.

435
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,041
What are you?

436
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,291
So strong.

437
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,958
No, it's too much!

438
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,125
Touya, stop!

439
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:38,666
Huh?

440
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,000
[thud]

441
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,166
[TOUYA]
Wow.

442
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,125
[BEAST]
Mochizuki Touya.

443
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,833
I've deemed you worthy
to become my master.

444
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,875
Pact with me, and
I'll serve you well.

445
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,458
How do I do that?

446
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,208
Give me a name.

447
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,750
That shall be the
proof of our bond.

448
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,583
Lemme think. Um...

449
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,083
Kohaku?

450
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,416
How does Kohaku sound?

451
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,291
Kohaku?

452
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,875
[TOUYA] That's "Ko" for "tiger."
And "Haku" means white.

453
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,750
And the symbol I put beside each
of them stands for "king."

454
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,166
The white tiger beside the king.

455
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,708
Yes, this name fits me well.

456
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,458
I can't believe you pacted
with the White Monarch.

457
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,500
The White Monarch
is my name no longer.

458
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,541
I am now Kohaku.

459
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,291
Understood... Kohaku.

460
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,666
Master. With your permission,

461
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,791
I would like to stand
by your side at all times.

462
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,708
[TOUYA]
Uh. Sorry, but I don't think

463
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,375
I can walk around town
with a giant tiger.

464
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:46,708
I believe that this form
will be far less conspicuous.

465
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,791
Yeah. That oughtta work.

466
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,000
You're so cute!

467
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,041
Get your grubby hands off me.

468
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,458
Just who do you think you are?

469
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh! My name's Yumina.

470
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,916
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I am your master's betrothed.

471
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,708
How did you pull that off?

472
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,083
She keeps on pushing
this wife thing.

473
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,208
What's the fuss?

474
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,750
[YUMINA]
I could just cuddle you all day.

475
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,000
Such a cute kitty!

476
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,750
He's so fluffy!

477
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,916
This is the most adorable
kitten I've ever squeezed!

478
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,333
[KOHAKU]
I'm a tiger!

479
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,375
Please, Master, you have
to make them stop it!

480
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,291
Bear it. They'll calm in time.

481
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,458
[KOHAKU]
No!
