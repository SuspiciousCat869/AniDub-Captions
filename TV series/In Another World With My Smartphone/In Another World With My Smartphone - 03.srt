1
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:16,916
Say.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,333
Since we're in
the capital anyway,

3
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,166
why don't we get
some shopping in?

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,750
[YAE]
A fine idea.

5
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,000
[LINZE]
Mm!

6
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,416
[TOUYA]
Hey.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,458
I didn't notice anyone who
looked like that in Reflet.

8
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,125
Is there a name for that race?

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,666
They're called demi-humans.

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,125
Those are beastmen
you're looking at,

11
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,250
but we use that word to
describe elves, dwarves,

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,500
and fairies as well.

13
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,916
You don't say.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,375
[TOUYA] This world is more
different than I thought.

15
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,208
[ELZE] Hey, Touya? What's
going on with that girl?

16
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,125
[TOUYA]
Hey. Is everything all right?

17
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,958
[ARMA shrieks]

18
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,791
Why? What do you want from me?

19
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, uh. You just looked...

20
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:04,500
It seemed like something
might be troubling you.

21
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:08,708
Actually, I got separated
from my sister in the crowd!

22
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,125
We had agreed on a place
to meet if this happened,

23
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,916
but I have no idea how
to get there from here.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,416
I'll help you find it.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,750
How?

26
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,208
[ARMA]
Olga!

27
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,916
[gasps] Arma!

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,791
[OLGA]
You had me worried.

29
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,250
Sorry about that.

30
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,083
[OLGA]
I'm 17!

31
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,458
[AUDIENCE]
Yeah right!

32
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,000
I appreciate you taking
care of my sister.

33
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,833
No problem. We're
always happy to help.

34
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:40,708
See you around.

35
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,625
Thanks so much!

36
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,916
Now then. There's still
time to go shopping.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,875
It might be difficult to go
everywhere as a group.

38
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,333
Let's split up for a bit
and meet back at the inn.

39
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,416
Sounds good.

40
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,208
I have no objections.

41
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,458
Sure.

42
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,500
I wonder if he was mugged
in some dark alley.

43
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,250
That's the only
excuse I'll take.

44
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,750
I'm sure he just
lost track of time.

45
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,666
Oh, there's the delinquent.
Hey, you're late!

46
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,375
Yeah, sorry!

47
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,916
I lost track of time.

49
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,333
[TOUYA]
Dang, it's 5:25 already?

50
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,958
That device keeps track
of the time for you?

51
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,208
Yeah.

52
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,208
A smartphone's like a
Null magic multi-tool.

53
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:27,291
I see you've equipped yourself
with a rather stylish coat.

54
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,750
Huh? Oh. Thank you.

55
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,958
It's enchanted to make me
resistant to any magic

56
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,875
that I have an affinity for.

57
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,166
The downside would be that
it doubles any damage

58
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,000
from affinities I
don't have, but...

59
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,750
Nice find. It's almost
like that coat

60
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,500
was specially made for you.

61
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,833
And you cut a handsome
figure with it.

62
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,500
[TOUYA] Uh! Well. I guess we'd
better head back to Reflet.

[GIRLS chuckle]

64
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,583
You're still playing shogi?

65
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,958
That's right!

66
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,458
You've been playing non-stop

with all this rain.

00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,833
And there's nothing
you could possibly

70
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,208
be repairing or cleaning
in the meantime, right?

Modeling.

reshape objects

What about your shop, Barral?

Will it be okay without you?

Yeah, my wife is taking
care of things there.

But listen, Touya.

Would you mind making me
another one of these boards

I'd be awfully grateful.

for me to make, but--

By the way, Micah,

00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,458
have you seen
anyone else around?

00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,541
I'm pretty sure that Linze's
in her room right now.

98
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,708
But Elze took Yae down
to Parent's Café

to try that new dessert
they came out with.

who invented it.

Nah, I just showed it to them.

The line was a lot shorter
thanks to the rain.

This treat is quite delicious.

brought some back?

So here's one for Linze.

This one is for me and Yae.
And that one's for the duke.

deliver it, would you?

00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,208
Why me?

Why wouldn't you wanna
share a treat with the duke?

why don't you come
deliver it with me?

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,333
Uh...

124
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,083

It tastes like a cloud of sugar!

[ELLEN] Mind your manners
if front of our guest.

126
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,125
Truly though. This
treat is exquisite.

127
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,541
What did you say it was called?

128
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,833
A roll cake?

[ALFRED]
I envy the people of Reflet,

130
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,666
for they can enjoy this
whenever they please.

131
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,083
If I could use Gate like you,
I'd purchase it daily.

132
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,208
If you'd like me to,
I could give the recipe

133
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,416
to your chef so he can
make it for you here.

134
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,750
That's great!

135
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,333
We can eat it every day
for the rest of our lives!

136
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,625
Now, Sue. That would
be too much.

137
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,875
We shall limit ourselves
to every other day.

138
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,875
[TOUYA] Yeah, that's
probably still too much.

139
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,125
All right, Touya.

140
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,125
You say this game
is called shogi?

141
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,958
Yeah. It's a two-player
strategy game

142
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,125
where you try to capture
the enemy king.

143
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,583
Wanna try it out?

144
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,416
That I do.

145
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,375
No fair, I wanna play, too!

146
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,958
[ALFRED]
Well then, be patient.

147
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,291
You can play as
soon as I'm done.

148
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,833
Fascinating.

149
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,541
So if my pieces advance
across the board.

150
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,125
I can "promote" them.

151
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,458
Right. I like to think
of it as my troops

152
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,708
getting hardened from battle.

153
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,666
Hurry up and stop hogging
the new game, Father!

154
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,666
[TOUYA] You're gonna
knock the board over.

155
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,083
About that, Sue.

156
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,666
This may take a while,
why don't you go play outside?

157
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,291
Because it's raining outside!

158
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:57,500
Touya! Make him give me
a turn, this isn't fair!

159

[laughing]

160
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,333
That tickles!

161
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,541
Yeah, it's fun for now,

162
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,166
but eventually, you'll
break. They all do.

163
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,875
'Kay! You can stop now!

164
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,333
I'm serious!
Agh, I can't take it!

165
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,041
I-I think she has a point, sir!

166
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,875
Please let her play!

167
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,125
[ALFRED]
I quite enjoy this game.

168
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,583
I'll have to show it
to my brother sometime.

169
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,625
One more.

170
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,833
I'm sure we can
make it a quick one.

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,500
[sighs] Goodness.
So much shogi.

172
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,916
I might start dreaming about it.

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,416
[YAE]
Ah.

174
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,666
The royal capital's guildhall
makes Reflet's look small.

175
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,666
[LINZE]
They have more quests here, too.

176
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,166
I'm glad we decided
to check it out.

177
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,041
[ELZE] Hopefully Touya
hasn't lost his touch

178
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,958
from all that shogi
he's been playing.

179
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,416
[TOUYA] It's not like
I wanted to play that much.

180
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,000
Anyway, look at this.

181
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,541
The megaslime quest
is posted here, too.

182
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,708
It must be destiny.

183
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,416
[LINZE, ELZE, YAE]
Any job but that one!

184
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,041
There is no fouler union than
that of sticky and gooey!

185
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,833
[LINZE, ELZE]
Mm-hm!

186
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,291
Doesn't look like
I'm winnin' this one.

187
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,166
[YAE]
Oh, no!

188
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,041
What were you
just thinking about?

189
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,416
Who, me? Whaddaya mean?

190
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,541
Why don't we do this one?

191
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,541
[TOUYA] It's just around
the corner, Yae!

192
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,875
[YAE]
Understood!

193
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,166
Nicely done!

194
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,500
How'd it go with
the horned wolves?

195
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,416
I finished 'em all off.
It wasn't easy though--

196
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,666
there were almost 20
of the stupid beasts.

197
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,166
[YAE]
Elze! Look out!

198
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,291
[ELZE yelps]

199
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,625
Hey, Linze!

200
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,291
I need you to try and
freeze his legs with ice.

'Kay! I'll do my best!

Want your head?

00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,958
[ELZE yells]

204
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,083
Grasping Ice, come forth!

00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,875
Frozen Curse: Icebind!

206
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,291
Ha!

Multiple! Strike true, Light!

Sparkling Holy Lance!
Shining Javelin!

[HEADLESS KNIGHT groans]

210
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,750
Guess that's the end of that.

211
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,416
I am utterly exhausted.

212
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,166
[TOUYA] So these are the ruins
of the old royal capital.

213
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,708
Sure would be cool
if there were a vault

214
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,291
of hidden treasure somewhere.

215
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,541
That it would.

216
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,416
But the capital wasn't
destroyed, it was moved.

217
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,041
I doubt they would've left
anything valuable behind.

218
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,708
Well, yeah, I'm aware of that.

219
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,916
It's just a wistful thought.

220
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,666
Search For Treasure!

221
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,625
[ELZE] How'd it go?
Did you find anything?

222
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,666
We can at least be sure

223
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,916
there's no treasure
near this spot.

224
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,708
Aw, boo. Least we tried.

225
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:53,791
Hold on.

226
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,833
That just means
there's nothing Touya

227
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,125
would see as treasure here.

228
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,291
Try broadening your search

229
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,041
and something might
come up still.

230
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,666
That's a pretty
good idea, Linze.

231
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,458
Search For Historical Relics!

232
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,291
I found something!

233
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,500
Well? Where do you
think it is then?

234
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,375
It's pretty much
straight ahead of us.

235
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,500
And it's big. Whatever it is.

236
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,208
Interesting.

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,041
[TOUYA]
It's underneath all this rubble.

238
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,875
I'm not sure how
we could get to it.

239
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,458
I can take care of this.

240
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,291
Burst forth, Raging Flame.

241
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,333
Great Crimson Inferno. Eruption!

242
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,750
[LINZE]
That should do it.

243
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,208
You might've told us
to take a step back first,

244
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,458
but thanks.

245
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,875
Huh?

00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,416
[TOUYA grunts]
There we go.

[LINZE]
Come forth, Light.

249
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,250
Tiny illumination. Light!

250
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,125
[LINZE]
This place is certainly creepy.

251
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,958
I wonder if it might be haunted.

252
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,291
[YAE]
What?

253
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,291
That is absolute nonsense
and you know it, Linze!

254
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,916
No way is an army of tortured
souls plotting our demise!

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,250
How could you think that?

256
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,125
[ELZE]
Yae's right! Ghosts don't exist.

257
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,500
What's up?

258
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,833
The ghosts're just as likely
to attack from behind.

Shut up and walk!

D'you know what language
it's written in?

I don't. I've never seen this.

264
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,458
I'm familiar with most
ancient magic scripts,

265
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,041
but this is completely foreign.

266
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,041
No sweat. I'll just take
a picture of it for now.

is that smartphone
of yours capable of?

[BOTH sigh]

273
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,416
[TOUYA] Slowly but surely,
they're getting used to it.

[ELZE]
Hey. Come check this out.

275
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,083
Do you guys see that
red rock in the wall?

276
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,333
Oh, yeah.

277
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,500
I'm pretty sure that's
an Earth spell stone.

278
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,250
It's probably designed to
activate a powerful spell

279
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,875
whenever mana's
passed through it.

What kinda spell? Like a trap?

Well, I wouldn't rule
that out as a possibility,

282
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,541
but who knows?

[ELZE] It'll be fine! Pass some
mana through it, Touya.

Anyone care to guess what it is?

[ELZE] Nope, but it
looks pretty magical.

302
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,125
[YAE]
It kind of looks like a statue.

303
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,125
Clear glass, but there's
not enough light

304

for me to see inside.

Not to be rude, Linze.

But just how short
is the duration

307
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,041
of that light spell you cast?

308
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,458
What? I mean, Light
magic is admittedly

309
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,291
one of my weaker affinities.

310

But I can keep a spell like
this up for at least two hours.

Strange. It hasn't
been half that long

is definitely fading.

out pretty fast.

Gate!

322
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,291
Hurry!

323
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,958
What the heck was that thing?

324
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,000
A magic beast?

325
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,833
I've never seen one
like it though.

326
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,500
Hopefully, it's trapped
under all that rubble.

327
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,416
[TOUYA]
I jinxed it.

328
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,458
Burst forth, Fire!

329
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:38,125
Crimson Bolero. Flaming Arrows!

330
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,583
I may have just
made it stronger.

331
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,500
Fine. My turn!

332
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,875
That shell will be
hard to cut through.

333
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,208
[ELZE]
Taste my fist!

334
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,541
Maybe we should try diplomacy.

335
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,583
Fat chance. Slip!

336
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,458
[TOUYA]
Good. Hey, Linze!

337
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,875
It's only able to absorb magic

338
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,875
that's thrown directly
at it, okay?

339
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,500
[LINZE]
Got it! I have an idea.

340
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,625
Now, come forth, Ice.
O' Grand Frozen Mass.

341
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,416
Ice Rock, Fall!

342
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,208
Let's try a full power Boost!

343
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,333
We did it!

344
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,875
You're kidding.

345
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,666
That thing can regenerate?

346
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,375
[yelps]

347
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,750
Elze, no!

348
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,416
[TOUYA]
Yae! Linze! Keep it busy!

349
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,333
[YAE]
We're on it.

350
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,625
[LINZE]
You help Elze!

351
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,041
[ELZE grunts]

352
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,625
Hold still for a sec.

353
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,333
[ELZE]
Thanks. I'm all right now.

354
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,500
You lost blood, so take it easy.

355
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,291
It absorbs magic attacks,
and its shell's crazy tough.

356
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,333
But it has to
have some weakness.

357
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,875
[ELZE] I bet its using
our magic to regenerate.

358
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,166
Then the longer we battle it,

359
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,041
the stronger it'll get.

360
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,625
Heh. Just like a shogi piece.

361
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,750
[TOUYA gasps]

362
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,250
[TOUYA]
That's it! We capture the king.

363
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,041
Hey Elze, listen up.

364
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,041
[gasps] Can you really do that?

365
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,583
I can't be sure,

366
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,000
but it's still the
best chance we have.

367
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,416
I'm with you.

368
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,541
[inhales, exhales]

369
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,791
Aports!

370
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,083
Elze!

371
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,500
[ELZE]
Boost!

372
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,708
You dead now, or what?

373
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,625
[TOUYA sighs]

374
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,500
I think that's a yes.

375
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,333
[TOUYA]
Uh-huh. Thank you, God

376
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,375
How did you figure out

377
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,916
that the red sphere
was important?

378
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,250
It started glowing
when that thing

379
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,041
stole Linze's magic.

380
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,750
So I figured that's where
the magic was stored.

381
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,708
Breaking its body wasn't
working, so I went for the core.

382
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,000
[YAE] You're a perceptive
individual, aren't you, Touya?

383
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,458
Where do we go from here?

384
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,583
I suppose we should
report this to the guild.

385
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,125
[LINZE] Considering that we
found it in the old capital.

386
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,833
I think we'd better report
it to the kingdom.

387
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,041
[ELZE]
Agreed.

388
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,375
Maybe we should talk
to the duke about it.

389
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,666
[ALFRED]
A magic beast,

390
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,041
in the ruins beneath
the old capital no less.

391
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,166
[TOUYA]
Weird, right?

392
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,375
I'll have to send out
an expedition.

393
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,958
See what they find.

394
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,208
Yes. I'll send one at once.

395
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:24,166
[TOUYA] Uh... The thing is,
that dungeon I mentioned--

396
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,666
the whole thing's collapsed now.

397
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,000
[ALFRED]
I see.

398
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,208
[TOUYA] Hold on. I did
take some pictures of it.

399
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,083
[ALFRED]
Pictures?

400
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,000
[TOUYA]
See here?

401
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,083
[ALFRED]
My. What is this device?

402
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,541
[TOUYA] I-It's a type of
Null magic that I use

403
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,750
to record images.

404
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,375
[ALFRED] Hmph. You never
cease to impress me.

405
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,625
It'll take me a little time,

406
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,958
but I can make a copy
for you to keep.

407
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,166
[ALFRED]
Please do.

408
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,166
I think this may
provide us some insight

409
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,250
into the mystery of why
the capital was moved.

410
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,291
That's a pretty big part
of your kingdom's history

411
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,833
to be left blank.
Aren't there records?

412
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,125
I'm sure there were once,
but none remain.

413
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,833
[TOUYA]
That's too bad.

414
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,791
Forgive me, but I
may need to request

415
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,041
your assistance in
this matter once more.

416
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,541
Would you be willing?

417
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,041
Of course.

418
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,958
If your men run into danger,
we'll be happy to help them.

419
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,125
That's most reassuring to hear.

420
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,375
[ELZE] Why do our jobs
never go smoothly?

421
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,250
[LINZE] I'd feel better about it
if we'd found some treasure.

422
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,625
We can go treasure
hunting another time.

423
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,333
I, for one, am beat.

424
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,708
[YAE]
Same.

425
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,625
Let's go somewhere with
better lighting next time.

Whew. Drawing magic.

429
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,333
I thought it might
come in handy.

Hi, fellas.

Oh, no. Looks like he's leaving.

435
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,500
Well met as always, Touya.

436
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,958
It's more than fortune
that you'd arrive

437
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,500
at a time like this.

438
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,041
An act of God, perhaps.

439
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,791
For I am in desperate
need of your aide.

440
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,708
I'll be glad to give it.
What happened?

00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,833
It's my brother.
He's been poisoned.

442

What?
