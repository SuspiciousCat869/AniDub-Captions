1
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,833
All right, real talk. You ever
think of a list of things

2
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,250
you wanna do before you die?
Because I totally have.

3
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,875
What kind of things?

4
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,083
Girl, I've put it out
into the universe

5
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,666
that I'll meet some
foreign hottie.

6
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,250
He'll be wandering around
town like a sexy lost lamb,

7
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,791
bump into me and
ask for directions.

8
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,500
I'll take his hand,
he'll pull me close and...

9
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,375
[CHIO]
Okay, I'm done with this story!

10
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,625
You love it!

11
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,625
Okay, now you tell me.
What do you wanna do?

12
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,875
'Kay! Mine's a good one!

13
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,208
You ever seen those jerks

14
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,125
who toss their cigarettes
out of car windows?

15
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,416
One day, I'm gonna pick one up.

16
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,416
I think you dropped this, bruh.

17
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,625
Then, I'll flick it
back in their car!

18
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,708
[MANANA]
Hm?

19
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,541
Chio, that's stupid
and doesn't count.

20
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,291
Oh, come on! It's so cool!

21
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,916
[MANANA] That's not something
you have to work toward.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,333
It's one of those
things that you can do

23
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,000
when you're bored on your
way to school at any time.

24
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,333
Go do it to that lady.

25
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,083
[CHIO]
Hm, I don't know.

26
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,041
Oh, look. She's
got a phone call.

27
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,458
Thanks for getting back to me.

28
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,208
So, uh, I need you
to do something

29
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,500
about that part-timer.

30
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,333
I don't wanna see
him there on Monday.

31
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,250
[MANANA]
Chio, now's your chance!

32
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,083
[MANANA]
Whoa!

33
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,750
Did she really just
catch that thing?

34
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,416
[CHIO]
Uh-oh.

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
[CHIO groans]

36
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,333
[CHIO]
I think I broke my clavicle!

37
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,583
I'm gonna be paralyzed for life!

38
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,583
She's getting away!

39
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,958
No, wait! Come back!

40
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,583
Let it go! It's not worth it!

41
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,875
Oh! My goodness!

42
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,458
Looks like you took
quite a tumble.

43
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,500
Yep! She's a train wreck.

44
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,833
[MANANA]
So, know what I learned today?

45
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,291
No matter how simple
something seems,

46
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,791
you'll find a way
to make it extreme.

47
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,666
[MANANA]
Wait, did you actually get hurt?

48
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,125
[CHIO]
Spiritually, yes.

49
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,666
And I missed my chance
to throw this in her car.

50
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,583
[gasps] You should probably
throw that thing away.

51
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,125
Why? It's not lit.

52
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,625
Besides, that lady
tossed it, right?

53
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,583
So I didn't steal it.

54
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,041
There's nothing wrong
with keeping it.

55
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,375
As long as I don't smoke it.

56
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,333
[MANANA] This is how
all those stories begin.

57
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,291
They say it was just a prop
to make them look cool,

58
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,916
and then they become
smokers for life.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,916
There was that one time!

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,625
[CHIO] You can tell which
characters are cool

61
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,625
'cause they smoke.

62
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,458
[MAN]
Make my day.

63
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,166
[chuckles]

64
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,250
You know what?

65
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,291
You picked up
someone else's trash.

66
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,458
They were whizzing by
trying to ruin our planet,

67
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,541
and you protected our future.

68
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,458
You're a hero, Chio!

69
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,125
[camera clicking]

70
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,125
Yes! I love this lighting!

71
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,666
Give me duck-face!

72
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,666
Like this?

73
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,958
[MANANA]
Yas, Queen!

74
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,375
Just keep the cig away
from your mouth

75
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,958
so they can't say you smoked it!

76
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,041
Hold that look right there!

77
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,625

79
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,125
So legal. Still legal.

00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,208
Yas, legal!

[CHIO]
How is that me?

84
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,375
I'm freaking out!

85
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,500
Look at my smirk!
I am fierce AF!

86
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,541
[MANANA]
Okay, full body shots! Go!

87
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,083
Oh, that's good! You're a
tiger! You're a socialite!

"Emo summer vacay!" Oh! Love it!

[MANANA] Ah! How is she cool
with me taking so many photos

90
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,125
that would ruin her life
if they got out?

91
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,583
Oh, my god, what if
they did get out?

92
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,916
I wanna post these so bad,
I can't stop drooling!

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,333
[MANANA]
Give me Brooding Assassin!

94
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,291
You just burned down your
husband's mistress's house

95
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,375
with him still in it!

96
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,083
Okay, give me ice queen villain
walking down a dark alley

97
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,916
in a haze of fog
surrounded by crows!

[CHIO] I've never looked
this cool before in my life!

101
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,875
[MANANA yells]

102
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,875
[CHIO]
Let's take some of you now.

103
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,791
Uh, no thanks. I think I'm good.

104
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,125

Do it! Do it!

105

[MANANA]
Have we met?

106
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,750
Like, I'd let her turn
me into cyber trash!

107
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,333
Sorry I value my future!

108

[MANANA]
Hey, boy.

111
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,708
[CHIO] There's a puking cat
photobombing you!

112
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,000
You're trying to be sexy
and the cat's like "Bleh!"

113
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,791
[laughs] This photo
is pure gold!

114
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,291
Oh, the cat's leaving!

115
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,083
Come on, we can try
it again together!

116
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,000
Selfie style!

[CHIO]
Man, that was so much fun!

119
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,916
Sure. How did I end up
getting my picture taken?

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,958
Who cares? I made
you look awesome!

121
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,750
But for real. Yours
came out kinda sexy.

122
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,000
Uh, maybe we should
do another shoot

123
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,375
in my room tonight?

124
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,875
Sure. I'll keep this with me
so we can use it again.

125
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,125
[MANANA] You're just gonna
hold it in your hand all day?

126
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,375
[CHIO] No, but it'll
break if I pocket it.

127
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,875
Once we get to school,

128
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,875
I'll find something to wrap
it in and put it in my bag.

129
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,250
[MANANA]
Cool, cool.

130
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,375
[CHIO, MANANA]
Our mission:

131
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,000
smuggle an illegal
substance on campus.

132
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,583
[CHIO, MANANA]
We'll say it's a toy.

133
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,125
Together we guard it
with our lives.

134
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,666
Our school-day mission
is about to begin.

135
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,708
Let this first step be--

136
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,166
Something is stinky.

137
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,875
But I bathed, and wiped,
and used perfume.

138
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,416
[GOTOU] What is that smell?
It's unbearable!

139
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,958
Everyone, stop where you are!
Somebody here has tobacco!

140
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,583
You can lie to your
parents all you want,

141
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,041
but not to my nose!

142
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,208
[CHIO]
Is he part K9 cop?

143
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,166
How can he smell one
used, unlit cigarette?

144
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,583
I'm getting close.

145
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:27,083
The smell appears
to be growing stronger.

146
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,125
It's you!

147
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,166
No, never mind.

148
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,916
I'm not that bad!

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,916
[CHIO]
This is it. This is how it ends.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,583
Was it peer pressure
or temporary insanity?

151
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,791
What was I thinking bringing
a used cigarette to school?

152
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,375
It's not like
I'd play with a bomb

153
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,291
just because it
hadn't exploded yet.

154
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,333
If he finds this thing,

155
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,416
I'm going to be
in some deep doodoo.

156
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,625
I'll get expelled and end up
with a future on the streets.

157
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,333
Oh, shit!

158
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,041
What if he asks to look

And where did you get this?

165
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,375
I saw some lady throw
it out her car window.

166

So I picked it up off the

I know you're thinking

I'm the one who
smoked it, but I didn't!

[GOTOU]
Hmm? Yeah, I know.

176

I can tell, because whoever
smoked it was wearing lipstick.

177
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,875
And besides, this is
a pretty strong brand.

And someone like you
wouldn't be smoking.

[CHIO] Um, why wouldn't
"someone like me" be smoking?

You don't know that.
I might be a smoker!

do with your life?

got myself a job.

with not being fun.

It's more of a personal
preference thing.

Nope, I'm good.

You handed the papers
to them directly?

Oh, man, I should've warned you.

326
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,666
Delivering a late paper
to anyone from that generation

327
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,458
is conjuring a geriatric wrath.

328
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,708
It's just a newspaper!

laid-back education system

They studied all night long
just to avoid a beating.

333
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,583
If they can't study
current events

334
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,041
to keep up with conversation,

335
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,750
they revert back to their youths
and become violent!

336
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,666
[CHIO] What? No wonder
they freaked out so hard.

337
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,958
Their whole lives revolve around
thinking they're well-informed.

338
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,291
It's not about the mental
conditioning of 80-year-olds.

339
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,791
It's about you being late, dude!

Why are you so frickin' behind?

341
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,541
I guess I never thought
of it that way.

342
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,791
I keep getting into
these annoying situations

343
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,416
in the morning that set me back.

344

Damn cops keep comin' up
to me with questions.

345
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,500
I guess I got a little
irritated with them

346
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,500

Little tip from me to you:
you should try to smile more.

You know, let people see
who you really are.

Yeah, if I'm even a second late,

grunts to himself.

If I have to wait
out here any longer,

When you make the deliveries,

00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,208
Whoa! Oh, my gosh.

473
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,250
This is exactly what happened
to me the other day!

474
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,916
Is she talking to Manana
or the others behind us?

475
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,333
Moment of truth.
What will she do?

476
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,750
[MANANA]
Hey!

477
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,041
Whoa! That's perfect!

478
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,875
We've got joy, surprise,
and a little hesitation

479
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,375
in the eyes and brows.

480
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,375
Lips may or may not be
on the verge of smiling.

481
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,833
She's doing it.

482
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,166
It looks like she's
not responding,

483
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,208
but she actually is!

484
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,250
Hey, what's wrong?

485
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,458
[CHIO] Holy crap, it works.
It's like a social fly trap!

486
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,833
Are you gonna throw up?

487
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,166
[CHIO]
Or not.

488
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,166
She thinks Manana's either
sick or a giant weirdo.

489
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,916
[MANANA grunts]
I don't know!

490
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,875
My stomach has been killing me.

491
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:45,916
[screaming]

492
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,375
Do you think maybe
she's possessed?

493
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,500
Whoa, is she having
some kind of fit?

494
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,208
[CHIO]
They're all coming over here!

495
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,500
[STUDENT 4F]
Are you breathing?

496
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,083
Yeah, it happens all
the time, it'll pass soon!

497
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:55,916
Did you eat?

498
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Should I call an ambulance?

499
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,250
Maybe it's appendicitis!

500
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,125
Oh, that's bad!

501
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,041
You need surgery!

502
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,083
Who's your emergency contact?

503
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,083
[STUDENT 4G]
What if you're dying?

504
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,375
[CHIO]
This sucks.

505
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,958
'Kay, gotta go! Bye!

506
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,625
[CHIO] Next time on
<i>Chio's School Road</i> ,

507
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,625
"Thank You, George,"
and "Mananacchio!"

508
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:41,750
Lookin' forward to it!

509
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:42,916
Gimme my money!

510
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,500
[CHIO blabbering]

511
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,791
...is all I got.
