00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,666
[GIRL 5A]
Are you okay?

161
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,916
You scared the crap out of us.

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,708
I thought you were like
an alien or something.

163
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,166
No human can travel that fast.

164
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,458
Do you need help?

165
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,541
[GIRL 5A] Can you tell us
where you came from?

166
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,583
[CHIO] George! I found you,
you furry little bandit!

167
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,291
I was so worried, I freaked
out when I saw you!

168
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,541
That's right. I had
to jump so high.

169
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,541
I dove into the air to squeeze
your precious little face!

170

[CAT meows]

171
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,708
No, George! We're not done yet!
At least let me thank you!

172
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,791
Only aliens would ever
love cats that much.

173
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,791
I love cats, too.

174
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,541
I wonder why these cat balls
smell so good.

175
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,291
Yeah it smells kinda like
flowers, and olives?

176
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,125
Cats are so weird, aren't they?

177
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,041
[NARRATOR]
But it wasn't a cat toy.

178
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,750
[MAN 1] Wait. That looks like
one of those things

179
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,583
I see rolling around in urinals.

180
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,500
[MAN 2]
What are they doing with those?

181
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,625
[MAN 1] Just seeing it
makes me have to pee.

182
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,083
Good thing there's a restroom
right around the corner.

183
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,708
That's disgusting!
Who does this?

184
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,958
[MAN]
<i>Chio's School Road!</i>

185
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,208
I wish I knew what these were.
They came in handy today.

186
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,208
[GOTOU]
What do we have here?

187
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,666
You kids sensationalize
some new thing every year.

188
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,416
Be sure to leave your toys
at home from now on.

189
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,791
My name is Shinozuka Momo.

190
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,208
I'm the disciplinary monitor

191
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,000
of the Samejima Academy
student council.

192
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,791
Discipline at this school
is crumbling lately.

193
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,416
We've recently received
a number of disturbing calls

194
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,791
from people who live nearby

195
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,708
complaining about
our students' behavior.

196
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,000
The strangest part is,
according to the reports,

197
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,250
it seems all of the incidents

198
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,000
may have been caused
by one person.

199
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,375
Let's be more observant,

200
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,166
and report to me
if you see anything.

201
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,041
[SHINOZUKA]
This is my chance.

202
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,791
I can finally be of use
to Mr. Gotou!

203
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,833
[SHINOZUKA] I decided to take
a detour this morning

204
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,416
and investigate the area

205
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,833
where most of these incidents
are alleged to have happened.

206
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,416
So far, no issues.
It's actually peaceful.

207
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,791
Makes me wonder if these reports
really involved students

208
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:25,916
from our school.

209
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,458
Those two are a great example

210
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,083
of how our students typically
conduct themselves.

211
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,750
They're calm and graceful.

212
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,791
I'm so proud that
Samejima Academy

213
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,708
holds a standard
of high morality.

[SHINOZUKA]
Oh! She's picking a flower.

216
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,208
I wonder if she's planning
to make a bookmark?

217
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,583
How fun!

218
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,041

Wanna try that again?

220
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,000
I double dare you!

221
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,166
[SHINOZUKA]
What's going on?

222
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,958
And why are they doing this?

223
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,750
I can't believe these girls
are from our school.

224
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,125
Oh, I'm real scared 'cause
you wrapped your root!

225
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,875
How the hell'd you do that?

226
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,750
[SHINOZUKA] They're just going
to act as if nothing happened?

227
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,083
Did that whip burn your ass?

228
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,666
Nope. Didn't feel it.

229
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,041
[SHINOZUKA]
I'll, um...

230
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,583
I'll need to investigate
this further.

231
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,541
[CHIO] Just like that.
It'll go way faster. Trust me.

--[MANANA] No, it won't.
--You're not even gonna try?

[SHINOZUKA]
Looks like they've stopped.

234
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,250
And now they're arguing?

235
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,458
Look, if you wanna do it,
fine. But I'm out.

236
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,625
[SHINOZUKA]
I can't really hear them, but...

237
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,250
You know, you're pushin' it.

238
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,875
[SHINOZUKA]
She makes her carry her bag?

239
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,000
[CHIO]
Guard that with your life!

240
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,541
[MANANA]
Yeah, bite me.

241
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,875
[SHINOZUKA] Wait a minute!
That's the parking lot

242
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,958
that connects at
the top of the hill.

243
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,458
No! Could she possibly be...

244
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,083
...trying to take
a shortcut to school?

245
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,958
Why? Why would she even
want to do that?

246
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,916
Is there some kind of
emergency this morning?

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,291
No, look!

248
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,291
It's much faster
to walk normally.

249
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,583
Exactly as expected!

250
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,416
But her friend is
just standing there.

251
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,958
She's not offering to help her!

252
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,125
How's it workin' out for ya?

253
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,500
[SHINOZUKA] Seriously.
What is she doing up there?

254
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:28,791
And more importantly,
these two girls...

255
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,500
Are they really even
friends at all?

256
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,250
It doesn't seem like it to me.

257
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,458
[CHIO panting]

258
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,708
[SHINOZUKA]
She took out some water.

259
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,083
Is she giving it to her friend?

260
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,500
[SHINOZUKA]
Evidently not!

261
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,291
Ah!

262
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,541
[SHINOZUKA]
It's just as I thought.

263
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,791
Okay, here.

264
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,666
[CHIO]

265
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,041
[SHINOZUKA]
This is so beautiful!

266
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,333
She watered the flowers?

267
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,916
She chose the flowers
over her friendship.

268
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,583
Manana!

269
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,291
[SHINOZUKA]
I think she's lost it!

270
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:18,333
[CHIO] You'd let me die
of thirst? Seriously?

271
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,916
[SHINOZUKA] Now they're
back to fighting again.

272
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,541
How can they be students
of Samejima Academy?

273
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,958
[SHINOZUKA] Mr. Gotou
and the student council

274
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,000
should have been guiding them

275
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,166
and nurturing
their minds, but...

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,541
[SHINOZUKA sighs]
How unsightly.

277
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,791
I cannot restrain
myself any longer.

278
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,708
Both of you! Stop that at once!

279
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,166
[SHINOZUKA]
I'm the disciplinary monitor

280
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,416
of the Samejima Academy
student council.

281
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,916
Shinozuka Momo!

282
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,458
You have officially
been issued a warning!

283
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,875
You are hereby forbidden from
hanging out with each other!

284
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,958
Oh, snap, it's that girl.

285
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, the one who's always
clinging to Mr. Gotou.

286
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,416
I realize it was rude of me,

287
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,291
but I've been following you two
for quite some time now.

288
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,708
I saw you beat your
friend with a whip.

289
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,458
You stood by and watched
as she climbed a wall.

290
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,541
Finally, you both
fought over water!

291
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,583
[BOTH yelp]

292
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,791
I'm doing you a favor!

293
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,375
You're horrible influences
on each other!

294
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,791
Listen well.

295
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,708
True friends lift each other up.
They seek righteousness!

296
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,875
They stick up for each other!

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,083
Friends face hardships with you.

298
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,958
They're the only ones
who will have your backs

299
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,541
in life or death situations!

300
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:41,500
[MANANA] Um, I take it you don't
really have any friends, do you?

301
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,708
Whoop, there it is.

302
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,625
Wait, what? How did
you know that?

303
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,958
Because it's only
those without friends

304
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,958
that believe a perfect
friendship could exist.

305
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,708
She's been my best friend
and pain in my butt

306
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,625
since grade school.

307
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:58,166
Oh, and PS: the whole reason
I even wanted to go to Samejima

308
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,125
is because I found out it was
where Chio was applying!

309
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,333
[CHIO] What the what?
I didn't know that!

310
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,916
All right, if that's the case,

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,333
then prove your friendship to me
in a way that I will understand!

312
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,750
If you fail to convince me,

313
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,750
I'll report every destructive
and dangerous activity

314
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,333
I witnessed today
