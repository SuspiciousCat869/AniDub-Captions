1
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,250
[CHIO]
On mornings when I can leave

2
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,958
a little earlier than usual,

3
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,708
I take a stroll
through the park.

4
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,083
There are so many
interesting people around.

5
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,458
[CHIO]
Hm.

6
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,250
--Who parks like that?
--[chattering]

7
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,750
Motorcycle gang. Figures.

8
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,041
What is there to scream
about at this time of day?

9
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,833
So much for a
peaceful stroll. Gah!

10
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,875
Oh, well. This park's big
enough that I can avoid them.

11
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,333
[ANDOU] It was a real deal,
man. I wouldn't lie to ya.

12
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,500
[CHIO]
Brain fart.

13
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,916
What do I have for
first period again?

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,166
[ANDOU]
The name was Bloody Butterfly.

15
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,500
No.

16
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,541
[BIKER 3A]
What? Bloody Butterfly?

17
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,958
That's not a name, bro.

18
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,291
[ANDOU]
Damn straight it is.

19
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,625
It's hers. Had me on the
ground in a single blow.

20
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,333
[BIKERS]
Wait. A woman?

21
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:26,041
[CHIO] Oh, come on!
What's he doing here?!

22
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,500
[ANDOU] That's the reason
I can't stay with you.

23
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,041
I promised Bloody Butterfly

24
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,333
that I'd give up this life
if she'd let me live.

25
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,250
[BIKER 3A]
And that's it?

26
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,666
[ANDO]
I gave her my word.

27
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,291
[CHIO]
Huh? What the crap?

28
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,625
He took me seriously?

29
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,333
How is that even part of
a normal thought process?

30
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,625
[ANDOU]
At first, I thought it was

31
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,750
just some psycho
pickin' a fight.

32
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,166
But then there she was,

33
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,583
smirking like she just
swallowed my soul.

34
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,833
And that was it.

35
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,083
Next thing I know,
I'm trashed on the ground.

36
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,333
That's wicked.

37
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,208
But you're the Demon God.
No one scares you.

38
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,666
[BIKER 3B]
No one except Bloody Butterfly!

39
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,625
[BIKER 3C]
Crazy. Why haven't I ever heard

40
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,541
of this Bloody Butterfly chick?

41
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,750
[BIKER 3A]
I'll bet Bloody Butterfly

42
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,708
is from some underground turf.

43
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,125
[BIKER 3B]
"Bloody Butterfly."

44
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,583
Is it 'cause she kills people
with a butterfly knife?

45
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,125
[CHIO]
Stop saying it!

46
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,000
It's an online handle that is
meant to be seen, not heard!

47
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,458
Of course it sounds stupid
when you say it out loud!

48
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,625
Can I get a pronoun up in here?
Quit repeating it like that!

49
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,000
I can't take it anymore!

50
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,125
That's enough. Some things
aren't meant to be understood.

51
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,250
Bloody Butterfly is a creature
of the societal underworld.

52
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,958
Have some respect.

53
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,416
I learned a lot that day.

54
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,291
After speaking with
Bloody Butterfly,

55
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,833
I finally realized that
we were wasting our lives

56
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,333
with this child's play.

57
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,875
[screaming]

58
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:43,250
I didn't think it was possible,
but I'm glad to know.

59
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,375
Women like Bloody Butterfly
do exist in the world.

60
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,750
[screaming]

61
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,666
Someone so seemingly innocent,

62
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,458
out fighting terrorists,
surviving gang wars...

63
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,166
Bloody Butterfly does it all.

64
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,041
I'm just impressed that there's
someone who impresses you.

65
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,916
--Shit's wild.
--[BIKER 3D] Bull.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,041
This is way too good to be true!

67
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,166
I need to see this
Bloody Butterfly myself!

68
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,666
--Take me to her!
--[ANDOU] You dumbass!

69
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,666
Are you saying you
don't trust my word?

70
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,208
[CHIO groaning]
This cannot be happening.

71
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,000
They need to shut up or
everyone will know who I am!

72
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,458
Look, you're the most
badass guy I know.

73
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,625
That's why we gotta meet her.

74
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,083
Even if it means I
drag her here myself.

75
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,541
I'll help.

76
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,083
She must know some kind of
underground martial arts BS.

77
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,916
Otherwise, how would
anyone beat you?

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,500
[BIKER 3D]
Then it's settled!

79
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,541
We do everything in our power
to find her and learn her trade!

80
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,625
[ALL] Let the hunt for
Bloody Butterfly begin!

81
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,208
[BIKER 3D]
What's the matter? Are you okay?

82
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,791
Don't move! Don't say
a word. Don't breathe.

83
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,458
Don't turn around.

84
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,791
Um... How the...
Where'd you come from?

85
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,875
Bloody Butterfly?

86
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,458
[BIKERS]
What? Oh, no!

87
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:03,541
Bloody... Butterfly!

88
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,708
Wait. That's Bloody Butterfly?

89
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:11,666
But she's just a kid...
with glasses.

90
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,125
[BIKER 3D] I thought she'd
be all leather suited

91
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,666
with blades and shit.

92
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,416
[CHIO sighs] Well, of course
they're gonna be disappointed

93
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,833
after he built me up like that.

94
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,916
At least it makes what I have
to say more believable.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,250
You here for me,
Bloody Butterfly?

96
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,833
You guessed it.

97
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:32,000
You and I need to
have a little chat.

98
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,791
But not here. I wanna
speak to you alone.

99
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,541
[ANDOU whimpers]

100
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,166
[ANDOU] You guys stay put!
I'll be right back.

101
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,458
Where are you going?

102
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,208
[ANDOU]
None of your business!

103
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,583
'Kay. I'm listening. What is it?

104
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,625
I already told you
I'm leaving the gang.

105
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,125
--[ANDOU] I just had to--
--Uh, that's not...

106
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,083
[ANDOU gasps]
I get it now.

107
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,583
Right. You're here to
drag me down with you!

108
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,750
Sorta...

109
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,041
Oh, I'm afraid I may
have misled you somehow.

110
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,875
I've never even held a gun.

111
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,791
--Much less killed anyone.
--[CHIO] Yeah, I know! I get it!

112
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,416
[ANDOU] I don't think I could
handle the guilt of--

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,625
Hey! What I'm
saying is, me, too!

114
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,875
It's all just a big silly lie.

115
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,291
[CHIO]
That is a reasonable reaction!

116
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,458
So, get this...

117
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,125
There's no underground
organization,

118
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,458
no killings, no terrorists.

119
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,583
I'm just your average
high school kid.

120
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,416
More like, below average.

121
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,625
[chuckles]

122
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,416
[CHIO] No, you can't
laugh! I'm not joking!

123
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,833
I was freaked out after burning
my leg on your muffler thing!

124
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,125
Remember when I told
you about guys

125
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,541
being crippled for life?

126
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,833
I was talking about gamer nerds
being hooked on gaming!

127
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,583
That's "the life"
I was describing!

128
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,250
[CHIO]
The face of disappointment.

129
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,583
But I don't regret
clearing this up.

130
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,208
It needed to happen.

131
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,958
And I'm glad he
eventually believed me

132
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,041
even though believing me is
what got us into this mess

133
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,583
in the first place.

134
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,333
Okay. Let's get this straight.

135
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,500
[CHIO]
Yes, let's.

136
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,666
You're sayin' you're
just a normal kid,

137
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,291
and you were making
your way to school

138
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,041
when some hoodlum was
gettin' in your face.

139
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,958
You were able to ward him off
with your talent for lying

140
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,791
and a little bit of dumb luck.

141
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,208
Then you decided to scare
the crap out of him

142
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,750
and make him quit his gang.

143
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,708
And then this dumb
idiot trusted you.

144
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,208
He went around tellin'
his friends about these lies

145
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,333
as if they were true.

146
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,583
[screams]

147
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,916
And now he looks like
a pathetic joke.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,166
Is that what you just told me?

149
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,166
[CHIO]
Holy crap.

150
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,166
He's totally going
to headbutt me!

151
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,833
I can't move!

152
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,291
That's hilarious!

153
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,708
[CHIO]
Huh?

154
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,208
[ANDOU laughing]
Frickin' genius.

155
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't even know what to say.

156
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,000
[laughing]

157
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,000
[ANDOU] Oh, man, I hope
they didn't hear me.

158
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,125
This whole damn time,

159
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,291
you were just a
normal nerdy kid.

160
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,833
Exactly how you look.

161
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,958
[laughs] Ridiculous.

162
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,333
Man, I guess knowing that

163
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,125
explains why that name
of yours is so lame.

164
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,208
"Bloody Butterfly." [laughs]

165
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,333
I actually said that name
out loud with a straight face!

166
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,791
"Bloody Butterfly." [laughing]

167
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,083
Can we not talk about it?

168
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,416
The point of this awkward convo

169
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,208
is that I don't want
it to spread anymore.

170
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,875
[ANDOU]
I know, I know!

171
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,875
Well, if I fell for that,

172
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,208
I have no regrets
about quitting.

173
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,875
Man, you totally got me!

174
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,375
It's their turn.

175
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,666
Let's see this through
to the bitter end.

176
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,458
Come on. We're headin' back.

177
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,875
[CHIO]
"We," as in you and me?

178
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,250
[ANDOU] It'll be fun.
Just follow my lead.

179
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,125
Should we check on him?
It's been awhile.

180
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,791
[BIKER 3B] Nah, he's fine.
Andou can handle himself.

181
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,958
--[ANDOU screaming]
--[ALL gasp]

182
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,583
[BIKERS]
What happened?

183
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,958
Go! Now! Bloody
Butterfly got me!

184
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,375
She's dangerous!
Go save yourselves!

185
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,916
Andou, look at me.

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,333
Oh, shit!

187
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,750
This is it! She's gonna
kill all of us!

188
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,125
She's a monster!

189
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,875
[CHIO]
Slower. Walk slower.

190
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,333
She's totally unarmed.

191
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,125
She beat his ass
with pure strength!

192
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,416
Damn. Looks like
we're all screwed!

193
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,791
[ANDOU yelps]
Butterflies!

194
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,083
That's the sign she gives

195
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,375
when she's about to use
her special attack!

196
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,916
Soon everyone for miles

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,250
will be bloodied,
or dead, or something.

198
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,166
This is the end!

199
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,041
Here she goes! Run!

200
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,583
[screaming]

201
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,291
You must erase her
from your mind

202
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,291
and tell no one of this day!

203
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,166
Don't try to provoke her!

204
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,083
What are you doing? Run!

205
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,541
I will not run!

206
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,166
I will end you, Bloody
Butterfly, you hear me?

207
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,750
Andou, you're my friend, and
I'm willing to die for you!

208
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,500
I told you to run!

209
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,416
Go or I'll kill you!

210
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:47,291
[BIKER 3D screaming]

211
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,000
[ANDOU]
Well, that should do it.

212
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,208
Did ya see the looks
on their faces?

213
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,791
What cowards.

214
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,125
Look at this.

215
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,875
They call themselves
a biker gang,

216
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,208
and they ran away on foot.

217
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,833
Um, thank you for the adventure!

218
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,125
[ANDOU]
Hm?

219
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,250
Here. This is for your face.

220
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,541
[ANDOU]
No way.

221
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,083
If I take that, things'll
only get more complicated.

222
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,208
See ya, Bloody Butterfly!

223
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,041
Dude, you have to
stop calling me that!

224
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,458
Hey, do you remember that time

225
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,958
I told you about
some skanky girl

226
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,666
who came to school
on the back of a bike

227
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,166
with a motorcycle gangster?

228
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,666
Uh... I mean, barely.

229
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,250
Okay, you're not
allowed to ask how,

230
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,083
but I totally know
who this girl is!

231
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,000
I've never seen her around,
but she calls herself

232
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,666
"Bloody Butts and Thighs"
or something.

233
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,125
Or maybe it was "Butterfly,"
that sounds familiar.

234
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,500
Huh?

235
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,875
I'm having gaming flashbacks
for some reason. Hm...

236
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,333
[CHIO]
Um, I used to play you

237
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,458
under that name
all the time, dummy.

238
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,541
Does it ring any bells for you?

239
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,708
Not even a little bit.

240
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,583
[CHIO] That settles it.
She's the next to go.

241
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,833
[CHIO]
<i>Chio's School Road</i> !

242
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,333
[CHIO]
He said my handle was lame?

243
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,083
Let's see how great
his gang's name is!

244
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,500
Found 'em!

245
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,916
He didn't even try
to make it intimidating.

246
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,541
It's actually really cute!

247
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,750
[CHIO grunting, yelling]

248
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:22,833
Hey, Manana, be a pal and stick
your arm out real quick.

249
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:23,833
Hell no!

250
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,208
[CHIO]
Rude!

251
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,333
I wanna see if I'm doing
all my CQC moves correctly.

252
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,083
Oh, okay, let me just
sacrifice my limbs for you.

253
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,625
If this is about a video game,
you need an intervention.

254
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,166
Man, you don't even know.
That action is awesome!

255
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,916
You wouldn't believe how
good the cut scenes are.

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,125
Damn, you're really wasting your
life away with that crap, huh?

257
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,500
Who hurt you?

258
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,583
[CHIO]
Check me out!

259
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,208
Face block! Punch!
Roundhouse! Block!

260
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,583
He's comin' from the left.

261
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,750
[MANANA] You just look like
you're really determined

262
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,750
to kill flies. It's so...

263
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,750
[CHIO]
And... twist!

264
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,750
Give me the password
to the secret pics

265
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,500
hidden on your computer,
and the arm lives.

266
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,458
Bite me, you're insane!
Just break it!

267
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,375
I hope there's some entity
you praise nightly

268
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,708
for giving you these
athletic skills

269
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,375
you don't deserve.

270
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,125
Aw, crap, that reminds me.
Our fitness test is tomorrow.

271
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,791
I'm guessing you haven't
prepped for it?

272
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,750
Fake it till you make it, bruh.

273
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,458
Chio, you're actually athletic
and in a sports club.

274
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:19,458
It doesn't make sense for you

275
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,208
to keep blowing
these things off.

276
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,375
Yeah, it does! Once they
know your true skills,

277
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,625
they start forcing you into
sports festivals and tournaments

278
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,333
and I'm not about that!

279
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,666
I like being a nobody.
It's peaceful, okay?

280
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,041
I forgot, you're the
patron saint of lame-o's.

281
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,541
If some sports star messes up,
the whole country knows.

282
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,208
If I mess up, shoulders shrug.

283
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,791
Fine, you wanna work that
fitness, girl? Come on.

284
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,791
Let's see how many of these
side squat jumps you can do

285
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,125
without looking ridiculous!

286
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,500
--Fight me!
--[MANANA] Not yet.

287
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,125
I'd like to go back to
the part where you said

288
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,958
"work that fitness" as if
it's your everyday lingo.

289
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,583
Hurry up! Fast as you can!

290
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,125
Like some crab waitin'
in line to pee!

291
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,750
I dare you to do it faster.

292
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,375
Check it out! Can't even see me!

293
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,625
Oh, my god! Do that and say
"kabaddi!" really fast.

294
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,500
--Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi!
--[MANANA laughing]

295
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,125
I can't! You look just
like those weirdos!

296
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,875
You're even making
the face they make!

297
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,208
I think I broke my ribs!

298
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,458
I had no idea you loved kabaddi!

299
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,583
--And you know all the moves!
--[CHIO] I didn't even know

300
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,833
it was a real thing before...

301
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,083
Good morning! Did I hear
you mention kabaddi?

302
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,791
Have I got a surprise for you!

303
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,125
[CHIO, MANANA]
Huh? What is it?

304
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,708
A kabaddi expert!

305
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,833
[MADOKA]
Hi there. I'm Kushitori Madoka.

306
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,583
Captain of the Kabaddi Club.
Nice to meet you both.

307
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:31,125
[BOTH]
Wait, it's a real club?

308
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,375
Shit.

309
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,916
[MADOKA] So you wanna
know how to play, huh?

310
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,541
Want to learn all the moves?
That's what it sounded like.

311
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,458
Isn't this so exciting?

312
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,833
[BOTH] We, uh...
We're sorry about that.

313
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,083
But why?

314
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,750
It's not like you were
making fun of it, right?

315
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,750
[BOTH]
Right!

316
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,000
[MADOKA]
You just admire the sport

317
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,666
and were praising the athletes.

318
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,916
Uh, yeah.

319
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,375
[MADOKA] You were trying
to figure out the rules

320
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,333
so you could play one day.

321
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,666
[BOTH]
Yep.

322
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,791
Great! Well, I'm more than
happy to teach you both!

323
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,916
We'll have more room over here.

324
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,458
Isn't this fun?

325
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,500
[CHIO] Sure, if FUN
stands for F'd Up Nonsense!

326
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,750
Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi,

327
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,708
kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi,
kabaddi, kabaddi!

328
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,125
If you're in the
raider position,

329
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,500
you keep yelling "kabaddi"
while in the enemy circle.

330
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,125
[CHIO]
Wait, they actually say that?

331
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,333
And here I thought
that was just a joke.

332
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,125
[MADOKA] The object is to
touch your opponents

333
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,666
and run back to your side.

334
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,250
Once on your base,

335
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,375
you get points for everyone you
touched on the opposite team,

336
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,666
and the ones who were touched,
of course, are then out.

337
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,625
Got it! So everyone takes
turns being a raider,

338
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:29,958
and whoever isn't a raider

339
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,791
has to avoid getting
touched, kinda like tag?

340
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:33,875
[MADOKA]
Correct.

341
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,916
[CHIO]
Wow, I so totally don't care!

342
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,291
How is this my life?

343
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,541
"Sorry I'm late. I was
forced into kabaddi lessons

344
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,833
against my will!"

345
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,000
I wish she'd just let us go!
I got stuff to do!

346
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,208
[MADOKA]
The biggest difference, though,

347
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,166
is the defense has
a way of scoring, too.

348
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,500
If you're on defense,

349
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,458
try to tackle and capture
the raider like this.

350
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,291
Your team gets the point
if you completely stop

351
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,208
their movement in their tracks.

352
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,916
It sounds like a lot,
but just remember:

353
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,916
raiders touch, defense catches.

354
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,375
Well, I sure learned
a lot today!

355
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,875
Me, too! This was great!

356
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,583
Good to hear! Now let's play!

357
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,833
If you lose, you join
the club. Deal?

358
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,541
Sweet! That'll help us out

359
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,041
'cause, once all the
third years graduate,

360
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,958
the club will be
short on members.

361
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,791
You have no idea
how stoked I was

362
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,333
when I heard some first years
were so interested in the game!

363
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,791
Well, define "interested."

364
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,375
--Unless...
--[CHIO] So close.

365
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,041
...there's been
a misunderstanding.

366
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,083
I asked before if you were
making fun of my sport

367
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,875
and you said no.
Is that still true?

368
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,083
[CHIO]
I get it.

369
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,708
This was revenge
by guilt-splaining.

370
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,458
She wants to prove
it's not a joke sport.

371
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,958
Ugh! If she wasn't a
third year, I'd be out.

372
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,666
But I can't risk being
noticed by haters.

373
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,416
Fine. Let's hurry
and get it over with.

374
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,541
All right, you two
are the raiders!

375
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,958
I chose you, Manana!

376
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,083
Wh-Why me?

377
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,750
'Cause you're so good at it!

378
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,500
Uh... A-hem.

379
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,416
Kab-kabaddi. Kab-kabaddi.
Kab-kabaddi. Kab-kabaddi.

380
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,833
[MADOKA]
Just touch them and turn back.

381
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,291
As soon as you stop struggling,
I can let you go.

382
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,375
[CHIO]
Hold the phone!

383
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,250
This is not what
she described earlier!

384
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,125
This is good! Keep
trying to get away.

385
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,666
We'll continue to hold you
down until you give up.

386
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,250
I give up! Get off!

387
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,333
[CHIO]
She is not messing around!

388
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,625
[GAME ANNOUNCER]
Manana is out!

389
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,875
So, there's no rush or anything,

390
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,208
but you never said how we're
supposed to end this game.

391
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,708
That's a very good question.

392
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,958
Usually, it's timed

393
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,291
and players go out and
back in until it ends.

394
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,291
But we all have to get
to school eventually,

395
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,625
so I think we should just play

396
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,041
until one side is
completely eliminated.

397
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,166
[CHIO] Huh?! Wait!
Now it's them against me,

398
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,875
and if I get jumped, we lose?

399
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,583
I wanna be the raider
for our team next!

400
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,250
[CHIO] So if Hosokawa touches
me and then blasts off,

401
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,708
we become members
of Awkward Tag Club?

402
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,958
I guess I'll try to catch her,
but I have to be cautious

403
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,791
or she'll end up touching me
when I'm not expecting it.

404
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,791
Whoa. "Touching me when
I'm not expecting it."

405
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,833
Kabaddi's deep!

406
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,916
I think I'm having
an "a-ha" moment.

407
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,625
Being in a club
no one knows exists

408
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,875
instead of the Tennis Club
might make my school life

409
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,708
frickin' magical.

410
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,666
[CLASSMATE 4A]
It's nice to meet you!

411
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,666
[CLASSMATE 4B] I love the
first day of class! Don't you?

412
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,750
What clubs are you in
this year, Miyamo?

413
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,166
Oh, I'm in the Kabaddi Club!

414
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,333
--Kaba...
--D?

415
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,166
[CLASSMATE 4C]
Awesome! Kabaddi, kabaddi!

416
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,875
--Oh, no, I'm scared!
--[CLASSMATE 4C] Tackle!

417
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,375
[laughing]

418
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,083
--You got me!
--[CLASSMATE 4C] I win...

419
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,958
Stop making fun of kabaddi!

420
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,500
Also, the one who chants
is the raider, idiot!

421
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,708
You don't chant when you
tackle someone! That's defense!

422
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,458
Um, he didn't mean it?

423
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,083
[CLASSMATE 4C]
Out of my face, freak.

424
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,333
[CHIO]
That's a big old nope!

425
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,791
I don't need the drama!

426
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,208
Impressive. Looks like she's
actually got some skills.

427
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,541
[gasping] I'm out of breath.

428
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,291
[CHIO] Ugh! No clue
how I got past her.

429
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,125
Does that mean I'm
the raider now?

430
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,083
What kind of animals
can handle this?

431
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,083
My stamina bar's depleted.

432
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,750
But I must not let
this become my fate.

433
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,208
[MADOKA]
What the...?

434
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,000
[CHIO] My below-average life
depends on me taking this

435
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,000
weird, violent playground
game spin-off seriously.

436
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,125
But it's so hard.

437
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,541
Game brain, activate!

438
00:17:55,625 --> 00:18:00,083
I'll treat kabaddi like a
PvP game and bust some ass!

439
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:04,166
And now, everyone I touch
will turn into ticking bombs.

440
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,791
My mission, turn both
enemies into said bombs

441
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,625
and then escape
before they explode.

442
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,750
If captured, I'll be
tortured and killed!

443
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,958
I'll need to perform a spell

444
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,416
in order to activate
my special ability.

445
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,416
Kabaddi.

446
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,333
[CHIO]
Yes! It's working!

447
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,708
[CHIO]
Kabaddi, kabaddi...

448
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,333
[MADOKA]
Careful, Yuki! Stay close.

449
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,833
Something's changed.

450
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,583
I don't trust that girl.

451
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,041
[CHIO]
Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi!

452
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,041
[gasps]

453
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,583
[MADOKA] Her strong skills
don't hide the fact

454
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,833
that she's still a noob.
She's too deep in our territory!

455
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,416
Even if she manages to touch us,

456
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
there's no way she'll be able
to escape once we capture her!

457
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,000
I've got her back!

458
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,708
Now! Run, Yuki! Tackle her

When the enemy grabs you, twist!

It'll throw them off balance
and give you an advantage!

Nice move, but I'm
not letting go!

463

straight for me with no tact.

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,125
[gasping]

469
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,000
Um, does this mean she won?

470
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,333
Um...

471
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,500
[YUKI]
Okay! I think Miyamo's leaving!

472
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,625
Uh...

473
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,916
So, Kushitori, can
you move your hand?

474
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,458
[CHIO]
Mission complete.

475
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,750
I tagged you both
and made it back.

476
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,250
I win. I'm outta here.

477
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,875
[MADOKA] No. First tell
me how you did that.

478
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,750
So, um, about your hand?

479
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,666
I saw the twinkle in your eye
when you attacked Manana.

480
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,416
I recognized it and used
it to my advantage.

481
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,541
You're a sucker for the ladies.
Nothin' wrong with that.

482
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,625
And then, when
Hosokawa was raiding,

483
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,750
you got completely distracted
looking up her skirt.

484
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,583
I wish you could've seen your
face. Full-on pervy smirk.

485
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,333
[YUKI]
Wait, what?

486
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,166
So I knew what to do
when you grabbed me.

487
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,500
I twisted your hand toward
her perineum, and you froze,

488
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,583
allowing me to make
my final escape.

489
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,458
I guess you could call
that a win-win sitch.

490
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,791
Also, you should just be real.

491
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,583
You don't have to pretend to
like kabaddi to wrestle girls!

492
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,250
[MADOKA] You don't know what
you're talking about, Miyamo!

493
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,916
I love this sport, okay?

494
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,250
Nothing and no one else moves
me the way kabaddi does!

495
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,916
You take it back!

496
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,250
If you can remove your
arm from her crotch

497
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,041
and play another round.

498
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:35,666
[YUKI whimpering]

499
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,750
[MADOKA]
I can't!

500
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,375
Just thinking about
accidentally groping her again

501
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,666
is making my body
totally tense up!

502
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,541
I can't! I can't move!

503
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,666
[YUKI] Kushitori, please,
you're grabbing my butt!

504
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,666
[MADOKA]
I admit defeat. I lose.

505
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,708
Please let go of me!

506
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,125
It's starting to get weird!

507
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,291
[MADOKA]
I guess I should thank you.

508
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,250
You helped me realize
how unprepared I was

509
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,750
as a kabaddist today.

510
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,500
And, sorry for, you know,
the other things that happened.

511
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,083
Eh. No big!

512
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,541
Hi. Since we're kinda friends,
can I please ask you a question?

513
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,875
Sure.

514
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,916
How can I get my jugs
to be as big as yours are?

515
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,500
[CHIO] Of course.
Of course she would choose

516
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,875
to ask something completely
random and horrifying.

517
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,458
That girl is sick in the head.

518
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,000
[MADOKA] Actually, I was
just thinking about that.

519
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,250
It's strange.

520
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,708
I wasn't always like this.

521
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:28,083
I had a normal body until
I started playing kabaddi.

522
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,458
You think that's related?

523
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,750
[MADOKA]
If you didn't know,

524
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,708
Kabaddi originated
over in India.

525
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,541
I read somewhere that
a lot of the moves

526
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,958
were created with
yoga as a basis.

527
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,458
I think that's it, because
of the yoga involved,

528
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,750
my body started changing in ways
I never could've imagined.

529
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,458
[CHIO, MANANA]
Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi...

530
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,500
[whistle blows]

531
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,750
[MADOKA]
<i>Chio's School Road</i> !

532
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,083
[MADOKA]
I want more.

533
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,416
I must devote myself to the
ways of kabaddi even more!

534
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,583
For it let me touch Yuki's butt!

535
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,583
[CHIO, MANANA]
Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi...

536
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,916
[MADOKA laughing]

537
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,583
[YUKI] Next time on
<i>Chio's School Road</i> ,

538
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,958
"Smoke on a Sailor,"

539
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,500
"Taking the Cherry
Blossom in Your Hand,"

540
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,958
and "Manana's School Road"!

541
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,875
Looking forward to it! Kabaddi!
