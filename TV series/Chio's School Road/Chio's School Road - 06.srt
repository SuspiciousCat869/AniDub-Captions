1
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,708
[CHIO] No way! Did you see
the message from Hosokawa?

2
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,250
--Weird! Like...
--[MANANA] Yeah! What?

3
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,083
[MANANA] So the kabaddi crazy--
I mean, captain is missing?

4
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,458
[CHIO]
Creepy, right?

5
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,666
Do you think maybe she
got mugged and abducted?

6
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,541
Uh, no, because it's
not a video game.

7
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,791
[rustling]

8
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,666
What's that? Is it some
mysterious quadruped?

9
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,875
Maybe.

10
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,208
[yawns] I hope it's a Samoyed.

11
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,791
[panting]

12
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,375
[CHIO, MANANA]
Senpai located.

13
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,416
[panting]

14
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,208
That sucked. One more.

15
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,625
She's up to something.

16
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,250
--[MANANA] Shh.
--Rude.

17
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,500
[MADOKA]
One more set!

18
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,416
Kabaddi! Kabaddi!
Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi,

19
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,583
kabaddi, kabaddi!

20
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,833
[MADOKA pants]

21
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,500
Too low. That tackle's
never gonna work.

22
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,291
[MADOKA]
Okay, I got this!

23
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,125
Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi...

24
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,500
[MANANA]
Hm? What the hell is this?

25
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,500
[MADOKA]
...kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi...

26
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:54,583
[CHIO] She's been here...
the whole time?

27
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,791
[OLD MAN] Looks like
somebody's workin' hard.

28
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:58,625
Master!

29
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,125
[CHIO, MANANA]
"Master"?

30
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,875
[OLD MAN] I brought you some
fresh water from the stream.

31
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,208
[OLD MAN]
You've had quite a rough week.

32
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,208
But I'm impressed.

33
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,916
You seem to be adjusting
very well out here.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,708
Yeah, thanks to you.

35
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,083
When the mountains called to me,

36
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,666
I knew I must answer.

37
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,416
I was a warrior seeking truth.

38
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,250
I never expected
to find food or shelter.

39
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,583
Or another soul alive
in these woods.

40
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,125
[CHIO]
So... this is a park.

41
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,041
Give it a minute.
You'll see some souls.

42
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,125
What about school?

43
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,625
You sure you don't
need to get back?

44
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,916
Yes. I promised myself I'd
stay and perfect my technique.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,958
You have no idea
what you started.

46
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,916
Just you wait.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,083
I know who that's about.

48
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,500
It's 'cause you
wrecked her at kabaddi

49
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,541
and then shattered
her sense of identity.

50
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,458
Yeah, right. She doesn't
care about that crap.

51
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,833
I'm not competition,

52
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,333
and we had a really
heartwarming chat afterwards.

53
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,291
[MADOKA]
Your time is coming.

54
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,125
You're gonna pay.

55
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,791
[CHIO]
That looks like... me.

56
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,666
Do you want me to say
"I told you so" now, or later?

57
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,250
Anyway, I guess we
should go talk to her

58
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,875
about coming back to school.

59
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,416
I'm sure Hosokawa
is getting worried.

60
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,000
[CHIO] Maybe we
shouldn't interrupt her.

61
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,708
She looks like...
Oh, she kicked me.

62
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,375
This looks like a job
for someone whose effigy

63
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,083
isn't hanging from
a tree and getting beat.

64
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,666
So, time for you to put
on that sweet charm!

65
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,708
--[MANANA] Don't touch me!
--[CHIO] Ammo fully loaded.

66
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,708
Manana Rocket, fire!

67
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:40,041
[MANANA screaming]

68
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,125
Oh, I'll kill her.
Oh, there you are!

69
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,583
I've been looking for you!

70
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,791
I heard your voice and...
And then I came here.

71
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,958
Uh, you okay? Sure you are.

72
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,666
[MANANA] Say something!
Don't just spit words!

73
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,000
You're so much better than this.

74
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,708
You shouldn't be
starving in the woods

75
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:58,125
over some rando sport no one
likes or even knows exists.

76
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,541
[MANANA]
Am I right?

77
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,625
[CHIO]
Oh, she gonna die.

78
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,791
[laughs]

79
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,916
I think she thought that
would make you feel better!

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,416
How sweet!

81
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,916
You've got some nice classmates,
but they sure are strange.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,875
Know what I mean, Kushitori?

83
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,416
[MADOKA]
I just realized

84
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,083
it's been a whole week
since I've abstained.

85
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:27,041
Stay strong!
She's so close! Drool.

86
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,875
Uh, are you about to puke?

87
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,500
[OLD MAN] We've got room
if you need a retreat.

88
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,291
[MANANA]
Thanks, but I like to bathe.

89
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,875
[MADOKA]
That was close. I almost failed.

90
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,333
The feelings,
they're fighting me.

91
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,625
Keep it down.

92
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,583
How do ya feel about lizards?

93
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,083
Ugh, I knew you
were about to puke!

94
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,500
[MADOKA]
Stay away from me!

95
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,000
"Thrust out worldly desires."

96
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,625
I don't want these
lusty thoughts

97
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,083
to haunt me anymore!

98
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,708
I'm devoted to the only
love I can have, kabaddi.

99
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,958
Just don't look. Don't look!

100
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,500
My body isn't listening.

101
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:07,041
My hand is reaching out.
It wants to grab. It needs to!

102
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,291
It's reaching. Reaching for...

103
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,625
Grabbing. Grabbing.

104
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,541
[CHIO]
When the enemy grabs you, twist!

105
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,541
It'll throw them off balance
and give you an advantage!

106
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,541
[MADOKA]
Grabbing...

107
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,708
Nice move, but I'm
not letting go!

108
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,250
[MADOKA]
Grabbing!

109
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,791
[MADOKA]
Grabbing!

110
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,333
[CHIO] I got a move
for that too, biatch.

111
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,416
Switch!

112
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,041
[MADOKA]
Grabbing!

113
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,291
[MADOKA]
Grabbing...

114
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,583
[MADOKA]
Grabbing!

115
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,416
[YUKI]
Does this mean she won? Um...

116
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,041
[MADOKA]
Grabbing!

117
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,125
[YUKI]
Okay! I think Miyamo's leaving!

118
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,500
So, Kushitori, can you
move your hand?

119
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,208
[MADOKA]
On that day...

120
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,375
...when I grabbed Yuki's ass
accidentally on purpose,

121
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,166
it felt wonderful!

122
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,541
Uh, can I go?

123
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,791
[MADOKA laughing]

124
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,208
[MADOKA]
Oh, no! Stop!

125
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,125
Stop!

126
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,000
Stop it! [laughing]

127
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,583
No!

128
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,916
[MADOKA]
I can't help it!

129
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,416
[MADOKA]
Don't do it!

130
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,375
[MADOKA]
I'm not... I won't!

131
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,000
--[MADOKA] Shut up!
--I'm not saying anything!

132
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,416
[MADOKA]
You're wrong!

133
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,750
I'm not playing kabaddi
just so I can touch girls.

134
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,208
[OLD MAN]
Mm!

135
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,583
[laughs]

136
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,875
I understand why
you're here, now.

137
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,166
It makes sense.

138
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,333
What are you talking about?

139
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,083
[OLD MAN] Gather around
and let me tell ya a story.

140
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,166
Let me see.

141
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,250
It was about 20
some odd years ago,

142
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,125
and I was what ya might
call a corporate warrior.

143
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,916
Over time, the job reduced me
to just a cog in a machine.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,541
I had plenty of money,
but no time or motivation

145
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,791
to spend it on
anything fulfilling.

146
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,416
I was always exhausted
and at my wit's end.

147
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,916
One morning,

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,125
I noticed couple of sweet
high school girls on the train.

149
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,000
They were laughing and smiling

150
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,500
and just enjoying
their young lives.

151
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,333
I felt as if some of that joy

152
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:21,250
was charging right through
me for that moment.

153
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,125
It was electric.

154
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,333
[OLD MAN]
I felt renewed.

155
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,583
I thought if I could
have one more minute

156
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:34,375
to absorb that youthful
energy, I could keep living.

157
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,541
If I could breathe that
breath, feel that spirit,

158
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,250
if I could touch her.
I would have her energy.

159
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,375
[door creaking, slamming]

160
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,333
After that I lost everything,

161
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,750
but it gave me this
place in return.

162
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,750
Wow, I had no idea.

163
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,750
[OLD MAN]
I'm glad I met you, Kushitori.

164
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,666
You're everything
I wish I could be.

165
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,333
Ya know why?

166
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,666
The only creatures on Earth

167
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,625
who can get away with
touching high school girls

168
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,041
are other high school girls!

169
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:09,500
We are of the same mind.
You can tell me how you feel.

170
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,250
I'm feeling like... I need...

171
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:18,208
No, I want... I really want...

172
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:29,416
[MADOKA] ...to grope asses
more than anything.

173
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,375
--[whistle blowing]
--[CHIO DOLL] And she scores!

174
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,041
[CHIO]
Okay.

175
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,708
I wish I knew what
they were saying,

176
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,208
but it looks like
it's all gravy.

177
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,416
Good job, Manana.

178
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,583
Almost done.

179
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,583
Now to let Hosokawa know
everything's fine

180
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,625
and take that sweet street cred.

181
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,458
[CHIO]
I mean, this is a huge deal.

182
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,958
We're talkin' major
bestie points!

183
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,833
That there was beautiful.
Do you feel better?

184
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,958
I'm proud of you for confronting
your feelings that way.

185
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,625
You've made room for
a clearer perspective.

186
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,583
So, uh, are you still
talking about butt grabbing?

187
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,333
Whoa! What is this tingling
sensation I'm feeling?

188
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,333
It's pulsating through
my whole body.

189
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:13,416
My blood feels like it's
boiling, hotter and hotter!

190
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,125
[yells]

191
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,458
[CHIO]
Huh?

192
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,791
[MADOKA] Finally. I understand.
I have the answer!

193
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,125
Whoa.

194
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,000
[MADOKA] I have discovered
the Way of Kaba is to grope!

195
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,541
[laughing]

196
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,750
How 'bout that?

197
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,291
She took the Way of Kaba
and made it her own!

198
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,875
[MANANA]
The what now?

199
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,083
[MADOKA] I must give thanks
to my master and Nonomura.

200
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,833
Thank you for showing me
the way and opening my eyes.

201
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm not in this.

202
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:52,250
I know the true technique,
the real kabaddi.

203
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,291
Nonomura!

204
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,666
Oh, what now?

205
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,500
[MADOKA] I invite you to
experience my new technique.

206
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,000
No! No, that's okay!

207
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,541
[MADOKA]
I promise I won't hurt you.

208
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,000
But I must try it.

209
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,625
You ready?

210
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,750
Miyamo would love to try it!

211
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,291
She's waiting in the
bushes over there!

212
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:12,375
Oh, no! Traitor!

213
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,791
[CHIO]
Wow! It doesn't hurt at all!

214
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,291
Actually, it kinda feels
like I'm being snuggled

215
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,333
by a pillow monster.

216
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,208
She knows who she is
and she's okay with it.

217
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,416
[MADOKA]
At last, I've perfected it,

218
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,958
the ultimate tackle.

219
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,666
Miyamo! You're here! Thank you!

220
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,458
It was a stupid match,
okay? I'm sorry!

221
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,750
[MADOKA]
I'm over that!

222
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,125
But if you'd like to
contribute to my healing,

223
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,583
then just hold still.

224
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,041
I'd love to, but unfortunately,
I gotta get to school!

225
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,875
[MADOKA]
Not yet.

226
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,416
[MADOKA sighs]
With every glorious grope,

227
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,833
it's as if I'm standing
at the top of Mount Fuji

228
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,500
breathing in crisp,
minty mountain air.

229
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,750
[sighs] It makes me
wanna play kabaddi

230
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,250
so that I can manually explore

231
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,750
the bountiful bottoms
of the other girls!

232
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,083
U-Uh...

233
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,375
Look at that.

234
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,333
Have you ever seen a
more beautiful friendship?

235
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,250
[CHIO] There has to be
a way out of this.

236
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,041
The message! It's almost time!

--[CHIO] Yes!

[YUKI panting]
You're really here!

239
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,833
Miyamo said so,
but I wasn't sure!

240
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:14,958
[MADOKA]
Oh, Yuki.

241
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,916
Why are you holding
Miyamo like that?

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,791
Do I need a reason to hold
someone like this, Yuki?

243
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,750
There's a track meet!
Hosokawa's been training!

244

I bet the junk in her trunk
is absolute perfection!

245

Probably rock hard from
all those squat-jumps!

246
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,500
Go check it out!

247
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,833
Rock hard? Squat jumps?

Ugh!

253

Hosokawa can outrun a cheetah;
she'll be fine, but you...

[yelps]

255
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,041
You're a traitor!

Can't hear you when
you talk out your ass!

[OLD MAN laughing]

258
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,500
So sweet.

259
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,000
They're always radiant,
passionate, and energetic.

260
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,750
Some things never change.

261
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,833
I'm startin' to remember

262
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,750
those feelings of joy
I had long ago.

263

High school girls are the best!

[OLD MAN]

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,500
I never would have forced you
to be my scapegoat like that!

267
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,750
I know, right? You're
the worst friend ever!

268
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,125
[CHIO]
It was a fight or flight moment,

269
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,916
and I sprouted wings! I'm sorry!

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,333
It's totally okay.
I forgive you.

271
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:37,041
In fact, I kinda enjoyed
playing tag with Kusihitori.

272
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,458
[screams]

273
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,875
[CHIO] What am I supposed
to say to that?

274
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,083
The only life I've ever known

275
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,291
is Manana's permanent
state of annoyance!

276
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,791
Th-Thank you?

277
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,541
[CHIO] Oh, man! That game
was so worth the wait!

278
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,833
Three years is nothing,
and sleep is for losers!

279
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,416
As an enemy spy,
I infiltrated the base

280
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,958
and obliterated an
entire terrorist group!

281
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,541
It's true. I saved
America last night.

282
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,166
Why is it that
these overseas games

283
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,875
are always based upon scenarios

284
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,500
where they have to save
their own country?

285
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,041
Anyhoo, I think east
is in that direction, maybe?

286
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,541
Gonna say it's over that way.

287
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,916
That's right, America!
You're welcome!

288
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,916
[CHIO]
It's happening again.

289
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,833
Day-after-gaming anxiety.

290
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,541
Always seems to take over
on my way to school.

291
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,916
Who's there?

292
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,625
They could surround me
on both sides at any moment,

293
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,750
so I must proceed with caution.

294
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,666
Stay calm. Stay focused.

295
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,041
Huh?

296
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,000
[CHIO]
No enemies.

297
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,416
Good. Swift left turn!

298
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,125
Don't be a pansy, Chio.
Guard up, bad guys down!

299
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,625
Safe.

300
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,750
All good on this side, boys!

301
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,958
Do you read me? Path is clear!

302
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,083
Over.

303
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,708
[chuckles] Uh, well,
Takkun, did you see?

304
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,250
It's important to look both ways

305
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,208
just like that
young lady did, right?

306
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,541
Right!

307
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,250
Oh.

308
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,958
[CHIO]
Yo, it's Manana.

309
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,583
[CHIO]
Hey--

310
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,750
[CHIO] Press pause!
I know this terrain!

311
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:30,000
It's like that one narrow path
you get in infiltration games!

312
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,208
It seems the enemy
hasn't noticed me.

313
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,625
Perfect!

314
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,000
[CHIO]
Manana!

315
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,625
[MANANA]
Huh?

316
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,791
What the... I could've sworn
I just heard Chio squawk.

317
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,583
[CHIO chuckles]
Squawkety-squawk!

318
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,291
Stay right there, Manana!

319
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,708
Don't move a nose hair.

320
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,625
[CHIO]
It's gonna be awesome!

321
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,458
I've got a surprise for you!

322
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,000
I cannot wait
to see her freak out!

323
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,000
[MANANA]
Guess I'm hearing things? Huh.

324
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,875
[CHIO]
Uh, okay.

325
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,125
This is a lot harder
than it looks.

326
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,333
Whoa! That water actually
looks pretty deep!

327
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,500
[MANANA]
Hmm... Over it.

328
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,083
[CHIO]
Games lie!

329
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,166
There's no way
to get any further!

330
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,791
I'm gonna fall!

331
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:23,833
Falling options!

332
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,750
If I fall from here,
I won't get hurt

333
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,625
but I will get wet,
and I hate that!

334
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,208
If I'm wet, then my bag
and books will be, too!

335
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,375
That can't happen!

336
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,666
No more sideways.

337
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,208
I've still got a good grip.
I can climb this!

338
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,541
Or maybe not.

339
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,375
I can't tell how tall
that railing is from here!

340
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,041
Hey, Manana! Help me!

341
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,458
Okay that time
I know I heard it,

342
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,666
but no one's there!

343
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,958
It's a ghost!

344
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,458
You wanna possess me?
I ain't afraid of no ghost!

345
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,458
Don't you make me pull
out my sage stick!

346
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,875
I will send you to
the light stupid fast!

347
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,916
Don't be angry at us just
because we're still working

348
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,291
to become something
in this life!

349
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,833
You do you in the
clouds, you got that?

350
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,125
Just leave us alone!

351
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:12,833
Boom!

352
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,000
This bridge has been cleansed!

353
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,000
[CHIO]
You didn't exorcise anything!

354
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,875
[MANANA]
That better not be...

355
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,000
[MANANA]
Seriously?

356
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,625
[CHIO]
Help me up! My arms are dying.

357
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:29,458
[MANANA]
Hm... Hm?

358
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,458
[CHIO] Are you pondering
whether or not to save my life?

359
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,750
[MANANA]
Well, that's the thing.

360
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,583
It wouldn't kill you to fall.

361
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,625
It might actually
be good for you.

362
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,500
[CHIO]
Huh?

363
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,666
[MANANA]
I believe what we have here

364
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,958
is a total prank fail.

365
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,625
So many choices in life,

366
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,500
and this is the path
you've selected.

367
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,041
We may as well prepare you now

368
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,833
for the life of pain
you'll endure in the future.

369
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,666
[MANANA]
I'm doing this for you!

370
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,791
Sometimes the best
love is tough love!

371
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,375
And I love you so much!

372
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,583
[CHIO]
Why do you have your camera out?

373
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,916
[CHIO]
Is she serious?

374
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,875
A real friend would've been
terrified to lose me

375
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,583
and realized the value
of our friendship!

376
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,041
I see now who you really
are, and you're right.

377
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,833
This is good for me.

378
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,666
I've been blind
for way too long!

379
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,125
I need to show you,
the depth of my love.

380
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,416
You're coming with me!

381
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,541
[MANANA]
Huh?

382
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:27,583
[CHIO] Got you! If I jump,
you jump, right, bestie?

383
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,375
[laughs]

384
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,416
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

385
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,208
Get off of me! I don't
like you that much!

386
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,125
You broke my ovaries!

387
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,333
Where do you get the energy
to make my life hell?

388
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,666
It's adrenaline caused from
the fear of abandonment!

389
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,583
I can't live
without you, Manana!

390
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,583
[MANANA]
This bitch.

391
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,208
Why couldn't it
have been a ghost?

392
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,833
What the hell are we
supposed to do now?

393
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,916
[CHIO] The strength of our
love will pull us through!

394
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,166
I shouldn't have to
"pull through" anything!

395
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,375
This is your mess, Chio!

396
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,708
And yet again, you're
making me sit in it!

397
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,125
I'm done with that!
Get off me!

398
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,208
And don't you dare tell me

399
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,416
this is about some
stupid game again!

400
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,041
You know what, gamer?
You're one life away

401
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,375
from a Game-Over IRL!

402
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,875
You know how stupid that sounds?

403
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,958
That's what I deal with!
Grow up, Chio!

404
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,041
Quit acting like a dumb kid

405
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,750
playing pretend
in a grown-up world!

406
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,125
If your brain still works,

407
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,541
try using it to think of
someone other than yourself!

408
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,666
[crying]

409
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,625
[MANANA]
Oh, come on. She's crying?

410
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,375
[CHIO]
Manana...

411
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm so sorry.
Please don't hate me.

412
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,625
I just wanted to jump out
and make you laugh,

413
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:33,083
but then I got stuck
and couldn't pull myself up.

414
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,750
Okay, fine. Stop crying.
I'll help you.

415
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,833
Except I have no
idea what to do,

416
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,541
so you'll have to tell me.

417
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,291
[CHIO] Well, first, could
you please take my bag?

418
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,541
It's so heavy!

419
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,375
Ugh! Of course you're
still holding it. Here.

420
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,083
Thanks, Manana!

421
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,541
[MANANA]
Got it. Okay, now what?

422
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,541
Can you climb up?

423
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,958
Grab my arm, please.

424
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,500
[MANANA]
Like this?

425
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,500
[CHIO] Don't let go! I don't
want this to be the way I die!

426
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,000
I've got you, okay?
Don't be dramatic!

427
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,583
Now pull hard!

428
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,375
[MANANA]
Ready, and...

429
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:26,333
[CHIO panting]

430
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,041
I think that's good.
I'm gonna live.

431
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,125
[sighs]

432
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,375
You saved me. Thank you
so much, Manana!

433
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,750
Even if your prank sucked,

434
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,250
you at least managed to
scare the crap out of me.

435
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,000
[CHIO]
Oh, yeah!

436
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,750
Guess we better jet.

437
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,708
Whoopsie! I'm goin' down.

438
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,000
Remember me.

439
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,291
Manana, what are you doing?

440
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,500
I said I got you.

441
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,375
And I'll never let go, Chio.
If you jump, I jump.

442
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,958
I appreciate that,

443
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,916
but you're gonna have
to pull me back up.

444
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,791
Like, now.

445
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,666
[MANANA] I'm using all
the strength in my knee caps

446
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,750
just to hold you up.
I don't know if I can.

447
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,166
I think my legs
are about to snap.

448
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,875
[CHIO]
That can't be a thing.

449
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,916
You're the only one
who can actually move.

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,166
Try harder.

451
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,541
[MANANA]
Huh?

452
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,541
I'm sorry. Was the way

453
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,000
I saved your life
not good enough?

454
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,166
I'm still hanging off a bridge!
You haven't saved me!

455
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,166
Then I'll let you go so you can
find someone to do it better!

456
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,750
You think I won't
pull you down with me?

457
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,958
Try it!

458
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,833
My legs are securely
braced! I ain't scurred!

459
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,833
[CHIO]
Then do it!

460
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,041
[MANANA]
Quit bluffing, Chio!

461
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,166
You know I will if you
piss me off enough!

462
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,791
[MAN]
Uh...

463
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,541
[BOTH]
Please help us!

464
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,291
[WOMAN]

465
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,166
Thank you so much for saving us!

466
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,875
[MAN] You could've gotten hurt.
That was very dangerous.

467
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,666
You're from Samejima
Academy, right?

468
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,166
What're your names?

--[CHIO] Nono...
--[MANANA] Miya...

470

[YUKI] Next time on

"Convenience Store Chio,"
"Chio and the Duel,"

473
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,416
Looking forward to it!
