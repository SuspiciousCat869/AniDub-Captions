1
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:40,541
[CHIO panting, laughing]

2
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,791
[CHIO] It's that time
of the month again!

3
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,375
The day my favorite hardcore
western game mag goes on sale!

4
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,125
I refuse to wait until
after school to read it!

5
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,541
[STORE CLERK]
Good mornin'!

6
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,875
[CHIO]
What?

7
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,583
Shut up.

8
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,625
They just moved it!

9
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,208
It's here somewhere!
It has to be!

10
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,750
This is the only
place that sells it.

11
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,750
Do not do this to me!

12
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,375
How are they sold
out this early?

13
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,875
Wow. When did they start
selling this magazine?

14
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,833
This is a boys love book.

15
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,625
'Kay. I get it.

16
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,541
They want some more
diverse customers,

17
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,250
but why they gotta
sacrifice my vices?

18
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,333
"Love is love."
That includes gamers.

19
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,125
[CHIO] They traded my doom
and gloom for dude-[bleep]-dude!

20
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,333
I am not okay.

21
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,875
[NARRATOR]
She's actually much better off

22
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:33,250
when you consider the types
of western games Chio enjoys.

23
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,916
The protagonists are usually
old thugs with guns,

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,541
and the heroines
are typically junkies.

25
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,083
The best part is when the aliens
start operating on his legs

26
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,708
with a buzz saw and you can see
all the veins spill out!

27
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,500
[NARRATOR]
They're full of violent images.

28
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,916
These genres aren't
popular in Japan.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,416
But, the few fans that exist

30
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,125
suffer regularly
for their passion.

31
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,916
[CHIO] No localized version
for a game this popular?

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,250
[NARRATOR]
Japanese versions can cost

33
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,291
almost double the normal price.

34
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,750
They're taking advantage
of my weakness!

35
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,791
Fine, I'll buy it!

36
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,166
[NARRATOR]
Happens every time.

37
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,041
And so we arrive at
moments like these...

38
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,458
This game sold over 10,000,000
copies around the world,

39
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,041
but it's stupid
impossible to find here

40
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,375
and I need to know why!

41
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,708
Am I the only one in Japan
who understands quality?

42
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,250
Get on my level!

43
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,208
Just so you know,
everyone overseas thinks

44
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,333
JRPG characters are gay AF.

45
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,583
Look at their design!
I mean, why?

46
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,333
That kid handles
a weapon that huge?

47
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,750
Is it supposed to be a metaphor?

48
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,333
And that's not a battle uniform!

49
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,958
That's a profile pic
for a hook-up app!

50
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,208
[NARRATOR] And other displays
of unjustified local resentment.

51
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,583
What's wrong with dudes
who brood and don't shave?

52
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,458
Can't we give them
a chance to be a hero?

53
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,083
Then I could stop
buying Japanese packs

54
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,416
and save for college.

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,375
We must demand equality.

56
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,458
For both Japanese
and western games.

57
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,166
Ultra-violence, for world peace.

58
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:56,208
[BENEDITO] Aren't you interested
in my thick, full lips?

59
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,625
Whoa.

60
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,250
[CHIO] Hmm. I have
to say, I'm impressed

61
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,166
with the variety of characters.

62
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,375
Considering the genre,

63
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,750
I figured they'd all be
skinny pretty boys.

64
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,250
[BENEDITO] To think there's
a place in this country

65
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,291
that's even hotter than my home.

66
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,916
[CHIO]
Damn!

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,916
This is way more intense
than I expected,

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,750
and I don't mean
the gaming part.

69
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,583
How are they allowed to sell
this in a convenience store?

70
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,000
[FUKUYAMA]
I only know of hell.

71
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,666
[CHIO]
Is this from the same game?

72
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,875
This old guy looks more
like a badass assassin,

73
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,125
but here he is.

74
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,958
I would never
imagine him in here.

75
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,833
He must be undercover.

76
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,875
[FUKUYAMA breathlessly]
Heaven. I'm in... heaven.

77
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,375
[CHIO] I've got 750.
It's for a good cause.

78
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,666
My... education.

79
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,583
Boys love doesn't
do anything for me.

80
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,958
I'm just heightening
my awareness

81
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,500
of other types of gaming.

82
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,708
I'm cultured and worldly and
a GD role model for society.

83
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,375
I'm buying it for research.

84
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,000
So much for trying to pay
for it face-down.

85
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,250
Barcodes ruin lives,

86
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,208
and I'm not in the mood
for judge-y cashiers.

87
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,416
At least I don't
know anyone here.

88
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,208
Great idea on this hot day!

89
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,333
CUSTOMER]
Uh, thanks.

90
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,291
Come back again soon!

91
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,333
[screams]

92
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,583
Frickin' Andou! What the
hell is he doing here?

93
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,500
What happened to slingin' news?

94
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,583
Maybe he's working
both jobs now.

95
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,000
This is a gateway
to awkward conversations.

96
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,458
I'll preserve my
life of anonymity

97
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,958
and come back later.

98
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,250
Shut the front door!
When did that happen?

99
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,125
It must've bent when I slid.

100
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,375
Oh, great.

101
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,416
I broke it, now they're
gonna make me buy it.

102
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,458
Fine!

103
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,458
I got money to spend
in this store.

104
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,041
Their rent's not gonna judge me!

105
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,166
[CHIO crying] But I am!
I'm judging me!

106
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,208
This is wrong!

107
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,208
The only games
I like have corpses!

108
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,750
And what's this ad about?
There's no product!

109
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,125
What if there's
security cameras?

110
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,791
I can't just leave it!

111
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,250
I got this!

112
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,041
I know the perfect way to
get it through the register!

113
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,083
Camouflage style!

114
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,833
[CHIO] It's a technique
used by dude-bros

115
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,250
and passed down for generations

116
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,250
when preparing
to choke the chicken.

117
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,250
You take the [bleep] mag,
cover it with some Shonen junk,

118
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,750
leave the barcode out,
and walk toward the light.

119
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,958
Yay! Shonen whatever-
the-[bleep] is out!

120
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,708
But that means
I have to buy both!

121
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,583
Crap! I only have
about two 210 extra!

122
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,125
That's not enough!

123
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:36,041
[CHIO crying] I'll have to find
another way buy the BL one.

124
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,875
I just finished convincing
Andou that I'm normal.

125
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:42,750
Somehow, I'd rather him see me
as a criminal than a BL fan!

126
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,208
I'm gonna have to face
this task head-on.

127
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,166
Hey.

128
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,625
Welcome.

129
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,500
Looks like someone
got a new job!

130
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:58,083
Oh! Miyamo! I'm happy to
see you! It's been too long!

131
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,875
Oh, uh, yeah, I work
here once a week now.

132
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,375
Oh. That's cool.

133
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,833
[CHIO]
So far so good.

134
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,958
Just hurry and scan the code,
and no one gets hurt.

135
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,083
Hold on!

136
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,458
--[CHIO] Why?
--You can't buy this.

137
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,750
[CHIO] But the sign
said please take one.

138
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,208
It's a free pamphlet
for driving schools!

139
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,250
--[CHIO] Yeah?
--You're too young for a car.

140
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,333
That mean you're gettin' a bike?

141
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,083
Uh... Sure.

142
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,041
[CHIO]
Ah! He's completely exposed!

143
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,000
[muttering incoherently]

144
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,708
[CHIO]
Shit! I don't know anything

145
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,750
about fricking driving school!

146
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,125
I owe it all to you!

147
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,625
Riding on your bike the
other day gave me the itch!

148
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,000
You changed my life.

149
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,041
[ANDOU]
Miyamo, listen.

150
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,041
I think I know
what you want and...

151
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,791
[ANDOU] No. I'm the man.
I should be the one to...

152
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:47,958
So, can you look through this

153
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,125
and tell me which one
I should go to?

154
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,458
Oh, okay!

155
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,166
[ANDOU]
That was close.

156
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,375
[CHIO] While you're providing
your expert advice.

157
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,750
I must find a way to conceal
the Pecs of No Purpose.

158
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,666
[CHIO] Chocolate! Thank you

That should do it!

No! How did I manage

Crap!

[CHIO] Scratch that.
It was better before.

Wait. Un-scratch that!

Leave it to me.
I won't let you down.

Your change. Don't spend
it all in one place.

Thanks! I don't need a bag!

188
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,500
I'll just carry it.

Hang on, Miyamo!

197

00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,791
I can't read this part.

Do these first two letters

It's BL, okay?

00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:56,750
Okay.

It's fine, but you might
not wanna walk around

Huh?

Look, don't take it
the wrong way.

210

It's natural for you to
wanna look at cute boys.

211
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,875
It's just, that magazine's
got a reputation

212
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,666

Also, reading while walking
can be dangerous.

Okay. Where'd you learn that?

one question for me?

316
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,125
Why are you so into butt stuff?

317
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,791
Would you ask two sumo wrestlers
why they wear thongs

318
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,916
and jump on top of each other?

319
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,041
Wait. Seriously?

320
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,125
That's so not the same.

[CHIHARU]
Fine.

322
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,791
I will never forgive
the dumb girls

They're the worst.

325
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,208
I started with you because
you looked the most tragic,

326
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,666

to sound threatening?

'Cause I'm about to piss myself!

She's like, "You're weak!

Here, serve me my ass
on a pitch fork!"

[BOTH]
Bitch!

333
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,958
[CHIO] You know, she kinda
reminds me of an evil doll.

I'm sure she's part demon.
We're gonna need back up.

I bet we could make everyone
she knows hate her!

336
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,583
We can start by
telling her school

337
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,000
that she's a hoodlum.

338
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,750
Then her parents'll get
involved and she'll be toast.

339
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,791
Ooh, and we should post
a fake medical degree

340
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,458
around her school grounds!

341

[MANANA]
Like she's a proctologist?

342
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,166
What kinda tools
does an ass doc use?

343
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,208
We'll put 'em in her locker.

00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,375
For real.

freakish flexibility.

You're about to have
a lot more in common

in the middle of the park?

is gonna save your ass?

Shut up! Just chill out.

to all your plans to probe me

00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,791
and call my parents?

362

Right, about that...

This does not look good.

368
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,041
I'm playing butt games
with a child.

Come on, gimme your ass, kid.

think I'm a criminal.

A pervy criminal who likes
tying little kids up.

00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,375
Got her.

377
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,458
Now I'll build momentum
and fly us out.

378
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,208
What kind of dance
were they practicing?

379
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,958
No clue.

380

We're away from all the ears.

the woods and kebab her!

I'll go ahead and
finish you off now.

but could you please tell
me your motive, first?

And why me? Am I just lucky?

know? I'll tell you.

But how did you
find me out here?

I heard the cries
of a lady in distress,

Don't hurt another woman.

You mustn't be so reckless
in your advances,

steel, and glass
right over them.

474
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,333
Before anyone even notices.

475
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,916
[CHIO] Excuse me, ma'am?
We were wondering,

476
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,708
would you like
some company today?

[OLD WOMAN]
Aw, shit! I broke my streak!

481
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,083
[EMPLOYEE 7A] Hey! How many
times do I have to tell you

482
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,000
not to sit here
and mooch our WiFi?

483
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,166
I don't wanna be like this,

484
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,250
but that service is
for our customers.

485
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,416
Would it kill you to come in
and have a cup of coffee

486
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,583
while you use it at least?

487
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,208
Screw you! Shut the
door and go to hell!

488
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,458
That's fine.

489
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,041
We'll just make sure
we block your device

490
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,083
if you try to come back!

491
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,041
[laughs]

492
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,291
You do what you want.
I'll hack back into it.

493
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,416
[OLD WOMAN laughs]
Stupid, dumbass kids!

494
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,416
See ya tomorrow!
