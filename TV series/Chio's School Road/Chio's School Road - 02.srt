1
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,541
Oh, great. I've got indigestion.

2
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,208
Probably a symptom
of sleep deprivation.

3
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,958
But I guess it's better
than getting in trouble

4
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,166
for falling asleep
in the bathroom.

5
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,458
And... here we are again.

6
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,875
I stayed up all night
being a badass online.

7
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,041
I was only gonna play
for 30 minutes.

8
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,166
I gotta go to bed.

9
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,625
[computer beeping]

10
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,958
[CHIO] Oh, cool. It's that
foreign kid who was just on.

11
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,916
Throw this thing in the
translation app, and...

12
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,166
Hm.

13
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,750
Really?! You can't hit me from
there, you frickin' cheater!

14
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,458
You asked for this, dumbass!

15
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,083
[CHIO] It's not my fault
I was provoked.

16
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,000
Morning came outta nowhere.

17
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,375
It's okay, Chio.

18
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:19,000
I know you're trying.
That's what counts.

19
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,333
[grunting]

20
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,041
[CHIO]
Uh, who's that guy,

21
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,625
and what's he doing?

22
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,875
Maybe he just finished a ride
with his motorcycle gang.

23
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,875
[CHIO] It's totally fine.
He wouldn't waste his time

24
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,708
trying to fight someone
peacefully walking by, right?

25
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,208
I mean, I'm a high school kid.

26
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,875
I guess he could
take my homework.

27
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,583
Oh! No, seriously?

28
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,041
What a jerk!

29
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,958
He's trying to force me to
walk closer to the gangster

30
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,500
because he's scared!

31
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,166
Dude looks like he's got
some important job, too.

32
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,750
Yet despite whatever his
title is, he's a total wuss.

33
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,083
But enough about that.

34
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,583
What kind of ape parks
his bike on the sidewalk?

35
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,833
Just a little bit further.

36
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't you dare push me, old man!

37
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,750
[NARRATOR] The exhaust
pipe next to the wheel

38
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:07,958
is called the muffler.

39
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,958
After riding, it
becomes extremely hot,

40
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,000
over 200 degrees Celsius.

41
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,958
If you were to touch it,
this is the sound you'd make.

42
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:20,000
[screaming]

43
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,791
[CHIO]
Crap, I think he heard me.

44
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:34,250
[ANDOU] You better have a good
reason to scream like that, kid.

45
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,541
[CHIO]
He's really big!

46
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,166
[ANDOU]
I take it you wanna fight?

47
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,000
[CHIO] No! I don't! I touched
something really hot

48
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,583
and it made me...

49
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,166
I can't speak!

50
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,333
[laughs nervously]

51
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,708
You must think
you're tough shit,

52
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,041
laughin' in my face like that.

53
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,500
[CHIO] No! It's just what
I do when I'm nervous!

54
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,791
[ANDOU] You know, I've got
a little code I follow.

55
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,666
If you say you wanna fight,
then I won't let you down!

56
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,750
[CHIO] I'm off the ground!
He's gonna kill me!

57
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,166
Help me, you coward!

58
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,250
[ANDOU groaning]

59
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,666
I can't! I've got a part-time
job interview I can't miss!

60
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,500
I'm a winner!

61
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:19,000
Gotta find a way out of
here before he wakes up.

62
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,041
That's what bit me.

63
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,625
Someone else is gonna run
into it and get burned.

64
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,458
I should move it out of the way.

65
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,708
I'll def need both my
muscles to do this.

66
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,833
Or maybe it'll just
glide outta here.

67
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,958
[whimpers]

68
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,208
[CHIO] Chio, what the hell were
you thinking moving a bike?!

69
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,541
I suck! I suck! I suck!

70
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,583
And now anything that
happens is on me

71
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,625
because it's coated in my DNA!

72
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,500
[groaning]

73
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,000
[CHIO] Of course he
decides to wake up now!

74
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,583
I have to do something!

75
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,875
Let's not forget this
is all his fault!

76
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,375
[ANDOU grunts]

77
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,875
So, you're finally awake.

78
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,125
[ANDOU groaning]
Damn bitch.

79
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,333
That's my bike.

80
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,166
What the hell do ya
think you're doin'?

81
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,875
[CHIO] He can totally tell
which school I go to

82
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,041
by my uniform.

83
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,333
And if I were to run,
he'd catch me

84
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,666
in a matter of seconds.

85
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,291
I just felt like resting
my ass on a piece of junk.

86
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,666
What?!

87
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,958
[CHIO] That might not have
been the smartest thing

88
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,041
I could've said.

89
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,833
But there's no turning back now!

90
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,583
Gonna ride this
thing to the end!

91
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,166
Oh, I know exactly
what I'm doing.

92
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,750
I decided not to
kill you earlier

93
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,666
so we could get
to know each other.

94
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,666
How sad would it be
if you never got to feel

95
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,333
the sting of having
your ass handed to you

96
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,916
by something that looks
like a school girl?

97
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,583
[ANDOU]
What the hell is she then?

98
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,166
She looked like a kid
when she was laughin'.

99
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,625
Fine. But tell me who you are.

100
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,166
Huh, you wanna know my name?

101
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,416
[CHIO]
Aw, man, picking names

102
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,708
is always the hardest
part of starting a game.

103
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,291
I guess I'll just
use my usual one.

104
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,333
Bloody Butterfly.

105
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,166
You made that up! No one's
called "Bloody Butterfly"!

106
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,458
Get over yourself!

107
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,041
[CHIO] Of course, <i>you've</i>
never heard of me!

108
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm on a level you
didn't know existed!

109
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,875
While you're out there
with your buddies

110
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,500
playing motorcycle gang,

111
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,958
I'm packin' heat
and shootin' it out

112
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,625
with foreigners all night long.

113
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,333
Eight days a week.

114
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,583
That so?

115
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,000
You're talkin' proxy
wars in the night now?

116
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,625
Oh, no! Don't kill me, eh?

117
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,791
You've lost your mind if you...

118
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,750
[CHIO]
You're lucky I'm in a good mood.

119
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,500
I'm gonna let you go as long
as you throw out this tricycle

120
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,041
and leave the gang.

121
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,791
It's a waste of time.

122
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,375
Here you are, day after day,
fightin' gang after gang,

123
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,083
and for what purpose?

124
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,083
Where does it lead you?

125
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,541
Let me tell you what
I know about this life.

126
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,916
My nights are filled
with the screams

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,625
of terrorized jerks
who deserve death,

128
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,666
but my days are
filled with regret.

129
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,000
I've forgotten who I was
before I chose this path.

130
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,041
I've seen guys end up
crippled for life.

131
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,666
You want that? You
wanna wear a diaper

132
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,916
'cause you can't stop
pissing yourself?

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,291
Crippled?

134
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,666
I'm tryin' to do
you a favor here.

135
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,500
Don't end up like me.

136
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,291
If I could do it over,
I'd shoot for below average.

137
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,791
It might be a boring life,

138
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,791
but at least then,
you'd have peace.

139
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,041
[ANDOU]
This is absurd.

140
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,291
It's absolutely insane,

141
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,875
but she's so convincing,
I believe her.

142
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,541
You could ignore my
advice if you want,

143
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,041
but what good would it do you

144
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,833
when all you have left
of your masculinity

145
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,333
is this busted pink scooter
some girl destroyed

146
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,375
along with your pride?

147
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,041
[groaning]

148
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,416
[ANDOU grunts]

149
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,291
[ANDOU screams]

150
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,083
[ANDOU]
Okay. You win.

151
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,583
I'll start my new life today.

152
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,166
On one condition.

153
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,583
Before you go,
grant me a final wish.

154
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,166
Would you please join
me for one last ride

155
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,750
as a symbol of our pact,
at least as far as your school?

156
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,416
I did not sign up for this.

157
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,125
It turned out to be a
bigger deal than I thought.

158
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,208
Looks like we're here.

159
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,500

Wait.

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,875
I've never heard that name.

165

So, uh, are you sure
you're at the right school?

00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,500
[in foreign accent] Yes, sir,
I am. It is first day

<i>Chio's School Road</i> !

170
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,833
Hey, Chio, doesn't it seem like

171
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,958
there are a lot more
couples around lately?

172
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,416
[CHIO]
Hm? Oh, yeah. Weird.

173
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,166
Oh, my gosh, everywhere.

174
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,583
When did that happen?

175
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,250
The saddest part is that
they're all first years.

176
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,416
So you know what
that makes them?

177
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,375
Relationship noobs.

178
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,000
[NARRATOR]
"Noobs" is the term gamers use

179
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,541
for "beginner" or "amateur."

180
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,125
First-year students tend to have
a delusional outlook on love

181
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,625
which leads them
to declare themselves

182
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,958
"in a relationship" with,
well, whomever will agree to it.

183
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,750
But the illusion
eventually fades.

184
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,833
Friends stop calling.

185
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,750
Social media likes
hit single digits.

186
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,916
Then most relationship noobs
break up over summer vacation.

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,250
I kinda feel bad for them.

188
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,250
They have no idea
what they're doing.

189
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,958
Just hurling themselves
into battle

190
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,541
without any training
or strategy.

191
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,750
I don't know--what are
your thoughts on all this?

192
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,375
Do it in December.

193
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,916
I'm almost afraid to ask.

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,833
You only need to
have one relationship

195
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,583
in your entire
high school career.

196
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,875
If you go out with
more than that,

197
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,291
then it just sounds
like you couldn't keep

198
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,500
your junk to yourself,
and no one will ever love you

199
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,875
when you grow up.

200
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,791
You can't do it anywhere
near the end of high school

201
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,791
because you gotta
focus on graduation.

202
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,000
You wanna aim for the
holiday and event season

203
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,833
when it's more fun to
have someone around.

204
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,666
So, December of your first year
to summer of your second year.

205
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,625
And then you're done. After
that, you focus on your studies

206
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,916
and you never hear
from them again!

207

00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,083
I've been trying
to surround myself

319
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,708
with a different
kind of crowd lately.

320
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,125
One less superficial.

321
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,833
I wantna be friends
with this girl, Miyamo.

322
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,000
She's in my class.
The one with the glasses?

323
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,333
We walk to school
together sometimes...

324
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,708
[CHIO] Holy crap,
she's talking about me!

325
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,333
[HARUKI]
Oh, nice!

326
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,708
[MANANA]
Wait, what?

327
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,458
So you've been friends with
Hosokawa this whole time

328
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,375
and just forgot
to mention it to me?

329
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,041
No, that's not it. She just...

330
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,833
We walk to school
together sometimes.

331
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,375
It's really no big deal.

332
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,666
Yeah, I heard her say that,
and it is a big deal, so talk!

333
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,333
Um, okay.

334
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,333
I threw myself in the garbage
and then we walked to school...

335
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,875
[MANANA]
I see how it is!

336
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,791
I'm the comfort zone friend
until Hosokawa fully accepts you

337
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,625
into the pretty,
popular girl ring, right?

338
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,166
[CHIO]
That's not... Uh...

339
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,458
[CHIO]
Manana, shut up!

340
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,333
Can you have a psycho
breakdown later?

341
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,541
Worst timing ever!

342
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,666
[BOTH gasp]

343
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,500
[YUKI]
Oh, my gosh.

344
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,375
Shh.

345
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,291
[gasping]

346
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,291
Whoa, that was so close!
You think they saw us?

347
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,333
Also, how do people breathe
when they're kissing?

348
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,375
Their mouths are
usually fully covered!

349
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,916
Our lips didn't
actually touch, right?

350
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I mean, we were
just standing there.

351
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,708
I don't think so.

352
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,625
Stop blushing.
You're creepin' me out!

353
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,458
[MANANA] What is the matter
with you? That hurt!

354
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,208
[CHIO chuckling]

355
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,125
Hey, Chio! Get some
sleep last night?

356
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,791
Morning, Miyamo! How are you?

357
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:07,041
[gasps] It's too early in the
morning for this weirdness!

358
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,541
In what dimension do you ever
hang out with Hosokawa?

359
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,875
In all of them!

360
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,250
I was waiting for you, goober,

361
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,541
and she was passing by
on her way to school.

362
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,875
Hi. You're popular.

363
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,375
Good morning! I recognize you!

364
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,666
You're Miyamo's friend, right?

365
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,000
Uh, maybe?

366
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,833
Great! Is it okay if I
wait here with you, then?

367
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,250
Heck, yeah!

368
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,541
--Thank you! My name's Hosokawa.
--[YUKI] That was it.

369
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,833
And now we're walkin'
to school together.

370
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,583
I mean, is she even real?

371
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,166
She's nice to everyone!

372
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,250
[giggles] Girl!

373
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,916
[ALL laughing]

374
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,208
[CHIO]
It's not a dream.

375
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,625
We're actually all
walking together!

376
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,916
[MANANA]
Hey, Hosokawa,

377
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,375
now that we're
like quasi-friends,

378
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,458
can I ask you a question?

379
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,666
Sure! You can ask me
anything you want!

380
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,666
[MANANA]
Okay! Are you a virgin?

381
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,541
Uh...

382
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,375
[screaming]

383
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,625
Damage control! Shut your face!

384
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,875
Why would you ask her that?

385
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,125
Well, um, I've never actually
had a boyfriend before, so...

386
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,125
What?

387
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,125
Impossible. You're so popular!

388
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,750
Someone even told me that
Haruki guy asked you out!

389
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:11,833
Already?

390
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,000
It was just yesterday.
That was fast.

391
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,458
[CHIO] You're the one spreading
it around, you liar!

392
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,833
[clears throat]

393
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,750
Okay, so you know
I haven't done it,

394
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,958
but were you asking
because you have?

395
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,750
[BOTH]
Of course not! Just look at her!

396
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,000
[laughs]

397
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,791
Really? Then have you
ever been kissed before?

398
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,291
[CHIO]
That's a no. A solid no.

399
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,791
We agreed that our
lips never touched.

400
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,333
It was just awkward standing.

401
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,208
Yeah, I have.

402
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,208
It was just awkward standing!

403
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,666
It was this hot
college guy I met

404
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,083
when I was still
in middle school.

405
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,250
You started early!
Look at you go!

406
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,916
I grew up fast. We met online,
of course. Like you do.

407
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,250
[CHIO]
What?!

408
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,666
And she never
told me about this?

409
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,708
I thought we were friends.

410
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,958
Something's weird.

411
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,958
It's like she's
a different person.

412
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,958
Is she ignoring me because
of my online V-card?

413
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,916
You can basically
have an entire society

414
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,458
with just three people.

415
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,666
I'm definitely the central
being in our group,

416
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,375
the one they both
have in common.

417
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,875
I figured that would
give me the ability

418
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,375
to shape our dynamic.

419
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,166
Hey! What adventures do you
think I should have today?

420
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,333
[YUKI] I believe it's time
for you to do your homework.

421
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,708
Yeah, I don't wanna.

422
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,500
[YUKI] Surely you've heard
that youthful pursuits

423
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,750
become lifelong habits.

424
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,875
No one says that.

425
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,916
It's from <i>Heroides</i> .

426
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,083
It's the book of poems by Ovid.

427
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,416
[YUKI]
Oh-ho.

428
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,083
Might I presume you're
well-versed in literature?

429
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,916
Before my fall,
I majored in Latin

430
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,833
and read several
other languages.

431
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,250
[YUKI]
Oh, I see.

432
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,708
How about <i>Metamorphoses</i> ?

433
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:32,750
Yes, I know it.

434
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,041
<i>Icarus</i> was my favorite.

435
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,333
--And <i>Narcissus</i> ?
--[cries] Stop it!

436
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,208
[CHIO] I don't understand
what you're saying!

437
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:42,083
--These grapes are yummy!
--[YUKI] What about Shakespeare?

438
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,958
[CHIO]
Manana?

439
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,500
I could show you how to
do it if you want me to.

440
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,083
[CHIO]
Oh! I get it now!

441
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,625
She's just been using
me this whole time

442
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,416
to get close to Hosokawa!

443
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,750
I should've seen the signs!

444
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,541
Red flags were flying!
She betrayed me!

445
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,916
Curse you, you ungrateful slave!

446
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,083
[MANANA] I'm glad you
finally see it, Chio.

447
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,958
You were an excellent boost
on my way up the social ladder.

448
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,958
Now all I have to do
is use my connection

449
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,666
to my bestie, Hosokawa,

450
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,291
and join forces with all
the elites at our school.

451
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,333
I doubt you and I will ever
speak to each other again,

452
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,166
but I did enjoy
our time together.

453
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,666
Goodbye, Chio. Much love.

454
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,250
I'm impressed. You've already
done so much, Nonomura!

455
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,125
I was pretty advanced for
my age. Cried a lot of tears.

456
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,458
But at least now I know
how to pick a man.

457
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,000
Like, for example,
that guy over there,

458
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,500
He'll probably work some
blue-collar job all his life

459
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,375
--and never go anywhere.
--[YUKI] You think?

460
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,541
You should never trust
a man who has no idea

461
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,166
how the rest of
society views him...

462
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,166
--Morning, Yuki. How are you?
--Morning. Nice to see you!

463
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,625
Uh... Wha...?

464
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,333
Well, I don't mean to interrupt.

465
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,083
I just wanted to say hi.

466
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,750
I'd like you to meet
my friend, Ushida.

467
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,083
His office is just down
the street from our school!

468
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,916
Hi. Yuki's my running coach.

469
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,375
She's been whipping
me into shape.

470
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,583
[MANANA] Does she know
everyone on the planet?

471
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,125
[USHIDA] She came up and
talked to me one night

472
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,708
as I was out for a jog.

473
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,125
Excuse me.

474
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,750
The way you're landing is
hard on your knees. Watch.

475
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,000
[USHIDA]
She teaches me something new

476
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,708
every time we run
into each other.

477
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,791
Turns out real running shoes...

478
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,916
[MANANA]
So he's dressing that way

479
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,875
because Hosokawa told him to?

480
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,291
--[YUKI] ...to the office again?
--Yep.

481
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,958
--[MANANA] "President"?!
--Can't be president of a

482
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,291
company and not set
an example, right?

483
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,500
But I do feel bad for them.

484
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,875
I usually wipe off
the sweat and go in.

485
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,583
I'm thinking of adding showers
to the office, though.

486
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,208
No way.

487
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,833
Is that really you?

488
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,375
I remember when you used to be
in the normie group with me!

489
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,625
Oh, no! I'm so sorry! I didn't
mean to creep you out!

490
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,625
I know you're
allergic to my kind.

491
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,708
I've never seen
anything like it!

492
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,875
Step away! Your face
is blinding me.

493
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,375
I've been trapped in the
prison of your great beauty!

494
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,208
Gosh, you elites
sure are gorgeous!

495
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,083
I mean, flawless!

496
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,416
You're practically airbrushed!

497
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,083
You must go to a lot
of cool parties

498
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:55,916
'cause you're cool!

499
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,291
Oh, I almost forgot, bitch!

500
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,916
Tell me again, bitch,
about middle school, bitch.

501
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,291
And how you kissed a college guy
'cause you're so advanced!

502
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,125
Bitch, bitch. I wanna
learn from you, bitch!

503
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,041
Make me cool!

504
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,375
It was a lie!

505
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,083
I made it all up.

506
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,708
I never kissed a college guy
in middle school, or ever.

507
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,958
I just read that story in
a magazine, and went with it.

508
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,041
I see.

509
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,458
Well, thank goodness.

510
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,875
I'm glad some perv who seduced
a middle schooler online

511
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,041
wasn't your first kiss.

512
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,916
You deserve so much
better than that.

513
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,333
Thank you.

514
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,708
[CHIO]
Welcome back.

515
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,458
I've missed you.

516
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,583
[BOTH giggle]

517
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,208
[MANANA] Turns out that
old guy I made fun of

518
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,333
is kind of a big deal.

519
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,583
[CHIO]
Yeah, I heard.

520
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,333
But he looks more like
a grunt than the prez.

521
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,666
I know, right?

522
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,416
[MANANA] Just saying,
if I were some old dude

523
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,583
and hot Hosokawa ran up
to me in short shorts

524
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,000
asking about my job,
my brain would melt.

525
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,083
Uh! Yeah, I have a great job!

526
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,500
I'm a...

527
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,291
I'm the president of a company
right by your school!

528
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,916
[BOTH]
It all makes sense now.

529
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,333
Excuse us!

530
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,833
We heard you were the
president of a major company!

531
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,958
Could we ask you some questions
about what your job is like?

532
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,333
You have to forgive
my weird friend.

533
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,833
--She loves economics.
--[YUKI] I'd absolutely die

534
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,083
if you had a business card.

535
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,500
Don't you want to know
about his job, Hosokawa?

536
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,416
Sure.

537
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,916
[USHIDA]
I was lying about everything!

538
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,333
I'm sorry!

539
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,458
I'm just a blue-collar guy
who'll never go anywhere,

540
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,000
and I was trying to be cool!

541
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,166
It's fine! We totes get it!
You know, there are some women

542
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,916
who'll read about
other people's romances

543
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,291
and say it happened to them.

544
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,208
--[MANANA] Shut up.
--Everyone tells fibs!

545
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,375
You know, there are still times
when I don't feel like running

546
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,583
and I'll say I'm sick
to get out of it.

547
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,833
Ushida, the most important thing
I know about you is true.

548
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,583
The distance you've been
running has improved a lot!

549
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,625
So whenever we feel bad,
we should just go for a run!

550
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,250
[CHIO]
Uh, where are we going?

551
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,333
And do we have to run there?

552
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,416
[CHIO] I thought Hosokawa
only cared about running.

553
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,541
But there was more
to her than that.

554
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,750
It turns out we were having fun.

555
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,583
Plus, I got a sense of what
she really liked about it

556
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,416
and realized what others think
of you isn't always right.

557
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,708
Huh?

558
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,708
[ALL laughing]

559
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,875
Huh, they're not supposed
to be running around

560
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,375
in the street like that.

561
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,541
But look how happy
it makes them.

562
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,916
Who the hell is that old guy?!

563
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,458
[MANANA] Next time on
<i>Chio's School Road</i> !

564
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:42,708
"Bloody Butterfly Effect Two"
and "The Kabaddic Four"!

565
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,666
Looking forward
to seeing you there!

566
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,416
It's gonna be awesome!
