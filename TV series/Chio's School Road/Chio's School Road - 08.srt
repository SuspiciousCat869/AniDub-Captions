1
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,833
Yeah, then what?

2
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,166
Well, obvi. You kick off
and make them eat dirt!

3
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,208
Except they never eat the dirt,
they just spit it out.

4
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,625
[YUKI]
Is that you, Chio? Hi, Manana!

5
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,541
[CHIO]
Oh, look, it's Yuki.

6
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,291
Good morning!

7
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,875
[BOTH]
Hey!

8
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:10,916
[YUKI panting]

9
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,791
You've got your bag
and your shoes.

10
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,375
Were you running late?

11
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:21,541
[YUKI]
I've just been so excited

12
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,083
about the track meet
this weekend,

13
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,458
and I wanted
to stay motivated.

14
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,041
You guys ready
to head to school?

15
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,041
[yelps] This is a joke, right?

16
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,041
--[whispering] No.
--[CHIO] Did you happen

17
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,375
to look in the mirror?

18
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,541
[YUKI]
Hm?

19
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,208
I mean...

20
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,375
[CHIO] Nope, no craps
are being given today.

21
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,708
And why would they be?

22
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,250
She's got abs for days
and legs that won't quit.

23
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,875
Plus that's her track uniform.

24
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,125
She wears it all the time.

25
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,916
You, um...

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,083
You're rockin' that!

27
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:53,916
I know!

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,458
[MANANA]
What a kiss ass!

29
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,958
[MANANA] Damn. I didn't know
Yuki was so free spirited.

30
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,375
It's cool that she and I are
on a first name basis now.

31
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,041
We've walked to school
a few times, so, we tight.

32
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,541
Our new level of friendship
also means I can call her out.

33
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,000
I mean, that outfit.

34
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,250
She says it helps
her get excited

35
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,416
about track season but...

36
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
She's not the only one!

37
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,541
What is Chio's problem?

38
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,541
She's being so fake right now.

39
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,416
Luckily Yuki also
has a real friend

40
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,833
who will tell her what's what.

41
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,916
Thanks to Chio, I know how
to conquer embarrassment.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,375
[CHIO]
Huh? Huh? Huh?

43
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,458
[MANANA] Plus it seems Chio
forgot she hates standing out

44
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,000
and is fine being on parade
with half-naked Yuki.

45
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,583
But someone's gotta drop
a truth bomb up in here.

46
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,208
Hey, Yuki!

47
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,750
Can you come with me
to pick up some things

48
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,375
from that store over there?

49
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,875
I'd love to!

50
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,958
[MANANA]
Right near the train station!

51
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,541
I hate coming here
because the lines

52
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,458
are always stupid long,
but duty calls.

53
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,916
--[YUKI gasps]
--Look how many people are here!

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,625
[MANANA] This is called the
"I Thought I Looked Cute Enough

55
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,583
To Leave The House, and They
Were Nice To Me at the Store,

56
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,916
so I Went Downtown and Then

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,375
Learned the Cold Hard
Truth Via Looks of Shame"

'Kay, bye.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,208
[MANANA]
Let the plan commence!

61
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,083
Check out the stems
on that one.

62
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,166
A swimsuit?

63
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,250
[MANANA]
Lovin' the comments.

64
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,166
Eye rolls work, too.

65
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,833
[YUKI humming]

66
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,583
Did you find what
you were looking for?

67
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,083
[MANANA] Yeah, bread is
so in this season!

68
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,208
[MANANA] Feel that, Yuki?
It's called "Judgment."

69
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,375
[YUKI]
Aw.

70
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,000
[MANANA groans]
Screw the penguin!

71
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,958
You've got pervs tryin' to
snatch a peek at your snatch!

72
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,458
Are you done now?

73
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,875
[MANANA] This isn't working.
I'm gonna have to be direct.

74
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,000
Here's the thing.
Everyone's staring at you...

75
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,375
[yelps]

76
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,291
...and it's because
of what you're wearing.

77
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,666
[YUKI]
Huh?

78
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,875
Hm...

79
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,750
Awesome! That's so exciting!

80
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,125
It makes me feel like
I'm at a track meet!

81
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,208
[MANANA]
'Scuse me?

82
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,666
Yeah, you can wear it
at a track meet

83
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,625
because it's a track meet,
not where innocent people go

84
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,000
to pick up their breath mints!

85
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,625
Could she be an exhibitionist?

86
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,041
She's on a whole other level.

87
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,458
No wonder she and Kushitori
are such great friends!

88
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,791
You may have told me before,

89
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:07,916
but what's your favorite event?

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,083
The 1500-meter run!

91
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,833
Hey, do you see Chio anywhere?

92
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,583
She said she was going
to the restroom. Typical.

93
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,708
--[CHIO grunts]
--[BOTH gasp]

94
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,583
Sorry that took so long!

95
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,250
[YUKI gasps]

96
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,500
I love your tennis skirt!

97
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,833
So what's that for?

98
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,541
I have a match after school.

99
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,750
[MANANA] Why would she
bother getting into

100
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,916
full sports garb this early?

101
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,208
[MANANA gasps]
Could this be...?

102
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,625
Am I witnessing the selfless
act of a caring friend

103
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,125
wishing to make life a little
less awkward for her squad?

104
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,875
Well played, Chio.
I raised you well.

105
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,333
What do you call a pen that has
a long smile on its face?

106
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,666
[MANANA]
Huh. What's goin' on here?

107
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,333
[YUKI] Here's a hint.
It was inside that store!

108
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,958
[MANANA]
Oh, so busted!

109
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,000
She's trying to hide
her face behind her visor!

110
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,666
She doesn't want
anyone to notice her,

111
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,833
but she also won't risk
offending the popular girl

112
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,875
by taking a different
route to school.

113
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,916
This way she can still mooch
off of Yuki's status

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,833
while half-ass disguising
herself in her tennis outfit.

115
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,416
Just goes to show ya,
one woman's March of Glory

116
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,541
is another woman's
Walk of Shame.

117
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,041
Ooh! That's good!

118
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,125
[MANANA]
In her never-ending quest

119
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,833
for a peaceful
high-school existence,

120
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,291
Chio goes to extremes
to avoid drama.

121
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,625
Ironically, that's
what makes it

122
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,625
the Art of Being Below Average.

123
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,375
[MANANA] Since it works
so well for you...

124
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,875
I have a surprise, Yuki!

125
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,333
Okay. What is it?

126
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,708
[MANANA]
You said you love running

127
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,625
the 1500-meter, right?

128
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,916
Oh, yeah, for sure.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,625
Well, take a look
at this road map.

130
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,125
I just happened to check it.

131
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,625
And it happens we're
1500 meters to school.

132
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,916
Cool, huh?

133
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,625
[MANANA]
And... she's ignoring me? Why?

134
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,125
--[YUKI] Yeah!
--[MANANA] There she is!

135
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,208
[MANANA]
Exhibitionist or not,

136
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,958
running is her
number-one obsession.

137
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,625
She's on the edge right now!
All I gotta do is push!

138
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,125
Wow.

139
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,500
Do you feel that breeze?

140
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,250
What perfect weather!

141
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,125
Don't you wish you could
just run to school

142
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,583
and feel that soft wind
caressing your face?

143
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,291
If only I was dressed
in running gear...

146
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,666
[MANANA]
It's working!

147
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,875
You know what you
have to do, girl,

148
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,916
don't waste this moment.

149

--[YUKI gasps]
--[CHIO] Huh?

[CHIO]
That's not gonna work!

151
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,708
If she takes off,
then I'll look like

152
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:28,000
the crazy friend in tennis gear
next to the normal one!

[CHIO]
Manana!

156
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,208
Hold on, if you leave,

157
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,333
it'll completely destroy the
chi of our walk to school,

158
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,791
and possibly our friendship!

159
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:40,958
Our chi's just fine.

Do you want me
to hold your bag?

161
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,250
Abrupt changes in routine
cause stress! Don't do it!

162
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,750
Guys. My arms hurt!

picked up at the store earlier?

--[CHIO] What now?
--[YUKI] Huh?

00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,125
And, get set...

--Take this for me!
--[MANANA chuckles]

Hey, sexy.

175
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,000
Nice tennis skirt you have on.

176
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,750
Please don't talk about it.

177
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:23,916
[MANANA]
Well, I guess we should

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,958
--probably get to school.
--[CHIO] Right.

179
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,125
Can we go back
to the store first?

180
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,541
I think I need to change.

181
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,583
[MANANA] Oh, no! I don't
think we have time!

182
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,458
[CHIO]
How brave was Yuki, though?

183
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,708
[MANANA]
I wouldn't call a complete lack

184
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,666
of social awareness "brave."

185
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,000
--[CHIO snickers]
--What's funny?

186
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,166
Oh, just the fact

187
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,041
that the pot is
calling the kettle black.

188
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,708
Remember that time we
met up to go swimming?

189
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,208
--[MANANA] Hi, Chio!
--Uh-oh.

190
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,541
It's pool time!

191
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,750
We're supposed to change
when we get there, dummy!

192
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,250
[CHIO]
You were either really excited

193
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,041
or awkwardly rebellious.

194
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,208
And when we got to the pool...

195
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,458
[MANANA]
Nothing happened, shut up!

196
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,000
I do not wanna talk about it!

[YUKI panting]
<i>Chio's School Road</i> .

198
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,041
You do know we have
a regular tennis club, right?

199
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,916
So why do you play
soft tennis instead?

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,708
Because I like it more?
What a waste of a question.

201
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,208
[MANANA]
But why?

202
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,625
Either way, you're hitting
a ball over a net and grunting.

203
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,083
[CHIO]
They're totally different!

204
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,583
Soft tennis balls
are made of rubber.

205
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,583
so you can tuck it into
that space on your racket.

206
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,958
And then when you
swing really hard,

207
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,666
the ball goes flying into space!

208
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,791
It's the best!

209
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,416
[MANANA]
That's it?!

210
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,583
[CHIO] Being born in the age
of digital reality is awesome.

211
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,125
--So, like last night...
--[MANANA grunts]

212
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,000
The action scenes in this game
I'm playing are ridic!

213
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,208
Yeah?

214
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,041
You're not even listening to me.

215
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,333
[MANANA]
Huh? Yeah I am.

216
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,625
An action game. Ridic.

217
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,208
[CHIO]
You don't even know!

218
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,000
What do you think they do when
they get stuck in a tight alley?

219
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,625
We're talkin' dark
and no doors!

220
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,291
I mean, what would you do?

221
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,666
You ready for this shiz?

222
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,166
You hold out both your arms
and legs to brace yourself

223
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,083
and then, you just
spider on up and--

buddies, don't you remember?

[USHIDA] Cut back on
carbs and avoid sugar.

and giggling about diets.

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,416
I'll be up here
straddling the alley

Take your time.
I'm great.

Maybe if I keep
climbing upwards,

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,333
I'll just kinda fade
out of view.

Lurking in the shadows
and concealed by darkness,

You got it.

You're just
spraying over them.

00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,291
and sprout wings
to freakin' get there.

320

[MANANA] I probably shouldn't
draw attention to her.

all the way up there?

Guess she didn't wanna say.

I remember that age.

Those teens.

353
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,750
[CHIO] I climbed the side

Super hero selfie!

something bad's
about to happen!

What? What's happening?

371
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,583
[CHIO] I was so scared.
You're not athletic,

372
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,541
you barely run, and you
made that huge jump.

373
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,500
I thought I was
gonna lose you!

Hold on!

00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:54,625
[CHIO] You risked your life,
just to come looking for me.

378
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,541
Ah, I see.

379
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:02,166
The rare, epic reward I found
at the top was friendship.

380
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,208
Okay.

381
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,791
[CHIO] Considering she came up
through that building,

382
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,208
it's probably the safest route.

383
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,458
We're in.

384
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,791
Whoa. Is she okay?

385
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,708
I saw her come in
to bring her dad's lunch.

386
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,500
[CHIO]
Her dad's what?

387
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,333
Oh, that was her cover story.

388
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,458
I hope she'll be fine.
She's the oldest of ten

389
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,416
and helps her folks
raise them.

390
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,166
The family's been going through
some tough times lately.

391
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,500
She's been lying
to the teachers

392
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,875
and saying she's on a diet

393
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,041
so she can take school
lunches home to her family.

394
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,416
She texted me from the restroom
saying she felt faint.

395
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,625
She probably hasn't
eaten in days.

You should probably delete that
picture you took on the roof

401

so they don't bust our asses.

take one. So...

Ah!

This water tastes good!

407
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,125
[GIRL 8B]
Careful. It's still tap,

408
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,125
so we shouldn't drink too much.

409
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,000
[SHINOZUKA]
Actually, it's perfectly fine!

410
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,625
I'm sure you're worried about
the chlorine levels, right?

411
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,583
I was, too, but there's much
less in our water here in Japan

412
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,083
than in the rest of the world!

413
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,125
It also helps that our
building is fairly new,

414
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,083
so the pipes are still strong
and in great condition--

Good morning!

00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,958
[SHINOZUKA] Now, there's
something I don't understand.

421
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,916
That student isn't making
any kind of effort

422
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,583
to follow the dress code.

423
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,041
So why doesn't Mr. Gotou

424
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,833
say anything to him
as the student counselor?

Good morning, sir. How are you?

I'm well, thanks.

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,208
[SHINOZUKA]
I'll start fresh today.

428
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,208
The other day was
a learning experience.

429
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,750
I bet it looked like
I was showing off

430
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,500
instead of trying
to be friendly.

431
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,083
I'll work harder to show
everyone I mean well.

432
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,375
Well, that's all
I've got today.

433
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,791
Does anyone have any
comments or questions?

434
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,250
I do!

435
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,958
[TEACHER]
Yes, go ahead, Shinozuka.

436
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,458
I noticed that our
class as a whole

437
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,750
received considerably
lower scores on the last test

438
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,291
than the other classes did.

439
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,083
So I put some ideas
down on paper

440
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,500
about how to study
at home more effectively.

441
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,791
This is the method I use

442
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,875
and I was hoping others
would find it helpful.

443
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,166
The key factor in this method

444
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,541
is to schedule a specific
time every day to--

445
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,875
[BOY 8C]
I'm out!

446
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,083
Sorry, but I have a club
meeting I have to get to.

447
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,583
Yeah. Same.

448
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,958
[GIRL 8C]
Call me later, all right?

449
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,750
[GIRL 8D] Who studies
in their free time anymore?

450
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,708
[GIRL 8C giggles]
What was that about?

451
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,500
[GIRL 8D] Her new plot
to annoy us, I guess.

452
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,416
[BOY 8D]
Shinozuka's so lame.

453
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,625
Um, sorry.

454
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,041
[TEACHER]
It's all right.

455
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,208
But you have to understand
that our lesson-plans here

456
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,000
follow very specific
curriculum guidelines.

457
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,250
So if there is a concern
about our teaching methods,

458
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,916
please let me know...

459
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,000
[SHINOZUKA] There's so much
I don't understand.

460
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,833
Why? Why? Why? Why?

461
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,666
[GOTOU]
Hold it.

462
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:28,541
[SHINOZUKA]
Why? Tell me.

463
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,416
Tell me why
I am the only one!

464
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,250
Actually, I stopped you

465
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,750
because it seemed like
you wanted me to stop you.

466
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,208
You look like you could
use someone who'll listen.

467
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,458
These are some great ideas.

468
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,250
I think creating groups
based on clubs

469
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,666
is a good way to find
strengths and weaknesses.

470
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,333
Granted, there are some things
here that seem a bit biased,

471
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,083
but overall, I agree with you.

472
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,416
I'm impressed with
your intentions

473
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,666
to help our students succeed.

474
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,583
So much that I'd like to suggest

475
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,541
you join the
disciplinary committee.

476
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,375
It would be easier to implement
your ideas as a member,

477
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,916
and I think the
whole student body

478
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,375
would benefit from
having you on board.

479
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,916
[SHINOZUKA] Thank you. But I'm
sure there are others like me

480
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,291
who'd be interested.

481
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,916
Well, we don't need others
"like you" on the team,

482
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,291
we need you, Shinozuka.

483
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,791
No, I-- I'm not--

484
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,416
[SHINOZUKA]
Are-- Are you sure?

485
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:40,166

486
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,750
[MANANA] Next time on
<i>Chio's School Road</i> ...

487
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,125
"Chio Changes Her Image"
and "Flat Cut."

488
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,458
Looking forward to it!

489
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:36,708
Oh, and next time,

490
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,916
we finally have scenes
where I do this,

491
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,541
and even some of this.

492
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,500
I'm gonna show you everything!

493
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,833
[moans] Please watch!

494
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,166
Pfft, you wish.
