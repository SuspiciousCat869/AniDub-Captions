00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,750
And then you said they'd be
worth more if we flattened them.

161
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,500
No, I said they'd
be easier to carry!

162
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,666
Okay, stop screaming, Four Eyes.

163
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,875
This was your mistake

164
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,666
and you need to take
responsibility for it.

165
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,166
--Apologize.
--Wasn't me.

166
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,916
I'm gonna need you to speak up.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,791
Hey. Don't put all this on me.

168
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,333
You could've just
looked it up yourself.

169
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,750
And it's a written
assignment, right?

170
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,750
So just write that you sold
all the aluminum ones

171
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,458
and don't mention
anything about steel!

172
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,708
I mean, duh. It's not
like I... [sobs]

173
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,458
[CHIHARU]
No way. Are those tears?

174
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,291
Are you actually
crying about this?

175
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:21,375
Yes, I am! 'Cause we
only made 50 yen!

176
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,166
Wait, seriously?

177
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,625
Hey, cut it out.

178
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,041
We can use the money to buy
you some chocolate, okay?

179
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,833
[CHIHARU]
Damn. One thing I did learn

180
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,750
is that she was never
Mayu's girlfriend.

181
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,041
She's too much of a
wiener to hang with him.

182
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,541
I'd say that was
worth today's trouble.

183
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,375
All right, suck it up.
We're in public.

184
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,625
[CHIO] 'Kay. What's that
line for? Is there cake?

185
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,916
[MANANA gasps]

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,250
[CHIO]
Whoa! Manana!

187
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,166
[MANANA]
Hey. Andou's sister?!

188
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,625
[CHIO]
What are you doing here?

189
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,500
[MANANA] The shop up ahead
is having a psychotic sale.

190
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,875
Come take a selfie with me!

191
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,083
[CHIO] What?! Are you
dropping out of school now?

192
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,250
Nah, I'm not. Just skippin'.

193
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,875
--We never discussed that!
--Ow!

194
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,250
--I'm not walking by myself!
--That's my arm skin!

195
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,333
Am I just supposed to hang out

196
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,875
and talk to myself
at lunch, then?

197
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,708
Grow up! You can sleep
at your damn desk!

198
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,875
Do you even know that store?

199
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,208
How are you gonna buy anything?

200
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,291
It's bougie as hell and
your allowance is nothing!

201
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,083
You'd end up standing
in that line all day

202
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,750
just to maybe buy a
coaster for 200 yen!

203
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,166
I could get two coasters.

204
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,583
Manana! You're coming with
me or I'm telling on you!

205
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,208
What, like, you're nine
years old? Stop pulling me!

206
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,583
Don't make me lose my spot!

207
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,416
If I have to leave then I'm
selling my place in line

208
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,458
before I go!

209
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,458
[CHIHARU]
Ah!

210
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,791
Someone's gotta
buy me out first!

211
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,666
You're not gonna ruin this
for me this time, Chio!

212
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,541
[SHOPPER 12A]
I'm interested!

213
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,791
I'd love to buy that spot
from you. How much?

214
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,458
I would buy it
for a thousand yen!

215
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,125
[SHOPPER 12A]
I'll pay 1,500 yen!

216
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,958
[SHOPPER 12B]
Fine. What about 2,000 yen?

217
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,500
[SHOPPER 12A]
How about 2,500?!

218
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,583
Why does it feel like
someone just paid bank

219
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,875
to take my place in line?

220
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,250
Oh, that's right,
because they did! Baller!

221
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,583
Being a line agent would
cost nothing to start

222
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,125
and would only require standing.

223
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,250
Even I could do it!

224
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,000
It's perfect.

225
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,083
[MANANA]
Hm?

226
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,208
It's perfect!

227
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,625
Quit smiling at me.

228
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,208
Turns out you're amazing!

229
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,125
Yeah. I know.

230
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,125
[CHIHARU] And she's the one
who knocked my brother out

231
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,875
with one punch before, too.

232
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,500
She's the real badass!

233
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,791
--[CHIO mumbling]
--We gotta bail.

234
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,125
Something is up
with Andou's sister.

235
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,833
More than usual.
She was almost nice,

236
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,083
and I don't trust that bitch
as far as I can throw her.

237
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,458
--Uh, are you mumbling?
--And that means I need Manana--

238
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,208
I was thinking out loud
and you owe me...

239
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,541
...my cut of the line money.

240
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,875
Huh?

241
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,625
You're kidding, right?

242
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,000
If I hadn't been walking
by and approached you,

243
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,666
you'd still be in line

244
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,416
and you never would've
sold your spot.

245
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Come on!

246
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,833
[CHIO]
I'll settle for half.

247
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,666
[CHIHARU] She was involved
for maybe two minutes

248
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,041
and wants that big of a slice?

249
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,125
[MANANA]
No! Get out of my face!

250
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,500
Fine! Then just give me a third!

251
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,291
You have to admit I
earned some of it, too!

252
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,291
Come on, Manana!
Don't be a stingy-mingy!

253
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,208
[CHIHARU] She may be older than
me, but she's not any wiser.

254
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,875
She thinks she's so smart,

255
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,750
can't accept blame
when she messes up,

256
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,125
and she's shady when
it comes to money.

257
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,416
Man! How could I have
been so stupid?

258
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,375
To think this pathetic
four-eyed worm

259
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,500
is anyone my brother
would have ever liked.

260

[YUKI]
<i>Chio's School Road</i> !

261
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,250
Why's it so hard
just to turn some coin?

262
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,541
'Cause you're not a pimp.

263
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,083
You should do one of
those nerdy streams

264
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,583
where they pay to watch
you play video games.

265
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,958
Won't work.

266
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,416
If it's not a game
that's popular,

267
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,958
it's hard to monetize it.

268
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,041
Also, way too much competition.

269
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,166
Does that mean you've tried it?

270
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,375
Nope.

271
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,666
Yeah, right.

272
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,916
Don't look me up.

273
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,458
I was curious about the word
"streak" in "kill streak,"

274
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,625
so I did a search.

275
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,958
[MANANA] I woulda looked
up the whole word.

276
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,291
What the hell's a "kill streak"?

277
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,708
[CHIO]
It's--whatever.

278
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,250
The point is that I ended up
on the word "streaking."

279
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,458
[MANANA]
So?

280
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,791
[CHIO] So it's this
societal protest thing

281
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,333
where people run around
the city completely naked!

282
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,333
It was a really effective way
to make a point in the '70s.

283
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,500
They took their clothes off

284
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,875
when they wanted to
be taken seriously?

285
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,125
Man, people back then
were total idiots!

286
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,458
Were they? I dunno.

287
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,458
Can you imagine how
great that would feel?

288
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,916
[MANANA, CHIO]
Nope. Not interested.

289
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,541
So you wanna be a
modern-day streaker?

290
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,333
[gasps] No, I was just thinking
about the tingling feeling

291
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,875
that covers my body when I run.

292
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,458
I wanna become one with the wind

293
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,000
and feel it all
over my bare skin!

294
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,625
[CHIO]
One with the wind?

295
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,250
[CHIO] You're that girl
that has to strip

296
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,375
when she gets to her room, huh?

297
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,750
Oops. I didn't know
I admitted that.

298
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,916
[CHIO]
I knew it!

299
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,958
[CHIO] You didn't before.
I just... Yeah.

300
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,166
What? Oh, no!

301
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,541
Should I not have said
anything? Is it bad?

302
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,916
I mean, at least I wear
an apron when I'm eating!

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,416
[MANANA, CHIO]
Cool. Aren't aprons supposed to

304
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,458
protect your clothes?

305
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,708
[CHIO] So, either she eats
her meals in her bedroom

306
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,083
or she's wandering around
her entire house in the nude!

307
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,583
I knew something was up.
No one is that perfect!

308
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,958
[CHIO gasps]

309
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,625
Did you tell anyone else
in our class about all this?

310
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,666
No, it's never really
come up before,

311
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,625
but that's not a bad idea!

312
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,416
I'm pretty sure there
are lots of people

313
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,208
who'd be into the naked life.

314
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,458
Sounds like she's
a bad influence.

315
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,583
My parents love
this lifestyle, too.

316
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,291
And so are her parents!

317
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,041
Hey guys! Whatcha playing?
Think I can join you?

318
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,916
Sure! It's a game
called Ghost Blitz!

319
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,916
[CHIO]
Even though Yuki's

320
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,291
the most popular
girl in our class,

321
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,541
she's always down to hang out

322
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,541
with the below-average
girls like us.

323
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,416
And that keeps me from being
harassed by the normies.

324
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,916
Because she plays a big part
in my day-to-day survival,

325
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,625
it's important that I keep her
as a defe--as a friend!

326
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,375
I've gotta stop her
from telling the world

327
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,583
so Toms don't start peeping
outside her window!

328
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,875
I know it might
hurt her feelings

329
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,500
and she'll think
I'm judging her,

330
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,166
but this is called
tough love, damn it!

331
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,083
--Okay. Here's the thing.
--I was about to tell her...

332
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,125
At last someone gets it!

333
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,583
I'm always naked at my place!

334
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,666
She doubled down on her
desperate ass-kissing,

335
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,250
traitor-bitch, lying game!

336
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,458
[MANANA laughs]

337
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,791
[MANANA] And by "always"
I mean every time I

338
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,250
get out of the bathtub and
walk to the towel rack.

339
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,250
Is that true, Manana?

340
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,458
Tell me. Honestly.

341
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,000
[MANANA gasps]

342
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,291
[YUKI] You wouldn't happen to
be making fun of me, right?

343
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,541
That would be... unfortunate.

344
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,416
My parents raised me to love
my body the way it was made.

345
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,583
We weren't created with
clothes on, you know.

346
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,875
It's fine if you
don't understand.

347
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,500
But I've been taught
that it's also fine

348
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,875
to stand up for myself.

349
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,541
So... I can trust you, right?

350
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,916
You walk around the house as
nature intended, like I do?

351
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,708
[stammering]

352
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:30,875
[MANANA]
Shit piece!

353
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,416
Yeah, I totally agree with you!

354
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,458
I mean, what are we even
doing? 'Cause after all,

355
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,333
these clothes are just
forcing us to live in denial!

356
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,125
I mean, I just wish
I could, uh...

357
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,666
I wish I could at least stop
wearing underwear to school.

358
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,625
[CHIO]
Girl, hope you're prepared

359
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,333
to sit in that mess
you just made.

360
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,958
--[gasps]
--[CHIO] Huh?

361
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,916
Oh, my god! That's my
wish, too! [giggles]

362
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,291
[MANANA]
Wait. Where we going?

363
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,750
--[YUKI] This'll be so fun!
--I peed before I left--

364
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,333
[MANANA] Never realized
how itchy this material was.

365
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,000
It's riding up my crack.

366
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,708
Thanks for waiting!

367
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,583
You're free-ballin', aren't you?

368
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,833
[CHIO] Bitch! You're literally
stripping for likes!

369
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,041
--[BOYS laughing]
--[YUKI] You ready to get going?

370
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,000
--[BOYS laughing]
--[MANANA] Oh, yeah.

371
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,958
[MANANA gasps]

372
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,000
Eep!

373
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,041
That was funny, wasn't it?

374
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,541
You're fine.
I'm proud of you, friend.

375
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,458
For what?! This is way scarier
than I thought it would be!

376
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,041
You took control today!
Now work it hard!

377
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,000
Huh? Look, a cockroach!

378
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,041
What? Where?

379
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,750
Right there. You see it?

380
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,458
No! Is it on me?

381
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,708
Looking good, girl!

382
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,250
Wait, there was no roach at all?

383
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,208
If you think that's funny,
wait till you see this!

384
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,583
It's called a wind wedgie,

385
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,166
custom designed
for jerks like you!

386
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,208
[YUKI laughing]
It tickles!

387
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,416
[MANANA] At least some
kid's not running by!

388
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,916
[MANANA, YUKI laugh]

389
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,666
It's not bad when
you get used to it.

390
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,000
Right?

391
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,208
Yeah. I think it's important
to have ventilation.

392
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,541
It's making me walk with my
legs closer together, too.

393
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,000
Like the most feminine
baby deer you've ever seen.

394
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,125
I love how free the
wind makes me feel!

395
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,750
I may start running
at any moment!

396
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,333
Eh. Don't do that.
Everyone will see your muff.

397
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,500
And running that much is
super bad for your knees.

398
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,708
Do you really think so?

399
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:12,958
Sho' nuff!

400
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,000
[CHIO] Are they, like,
bonding over this? Rude.

401
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,083
Don't you dare, unless
you want it done to you!

402
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,625
You let go first.

403
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,208
Like I would trust you after
that cockroach stunt you pulled!

404
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,083
Butt slap!

405
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,708
Uh...

406
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,000
Um, I don't appreciate being
touched by someone like you

407
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,333
so please respect my space.

408
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,500
Something wrong?

409
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,500
[MANANA]
Nah, just gassy.

410
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,791
[CHIO]
What the hell?

411
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,291
So, if one of them bungee
jumped off a tower,

412
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,791
does that mean the
other would, too?

413
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,791
And just because I don't,
that makes me the boring one?

414
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,958
Wait! Cancel that.
I'm adventurous, damn it!

415
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,083
I need a different analogy!

416
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,916
[CHIO]
See? Now this is exactly it.

417
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,666
Like two slaves
giggling to each other

418
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,291
about how cute and fun their
chains on their legs are!

419
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,708
Who does that?

420
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,541
My chains really are the cutest.

421
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,416
I just got mine yesterday.

422
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,875
[CHIO] And then they
start judging the one

423
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,375
who values their independence!

424
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,750
Look at that chainless loser!

425
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,291
[YUKI]
Poor thing.

426
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,250
Ugh! You're slaves in captivity!
This is not "hashtag goals"!

Bitch, I'm fun, too!

00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,916
[CHIO] Sorry I didn't ditch
my drawers to be like Yuki.

432
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,083
How does airing out your
cooter make you superior?

433
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,750
Undies are like a conscience.

434
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,208
They restrain your wild side

435
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,125
so you don't end up
arrested or pregnant.

436
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,291
If you throw them away, then--

437
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,916
then you're welcoming
new life experiences!

438

Good morning.

I didn't think about
running into Kushitori

we'll never get to school!

Thank you! It's a benefit of
being a first-year student!

464
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,708
We're still too young
for our skin and spirits

to have been destroyed
by our poor life choices!

always had a savory glow.

I know! Let's play kabaddi!

470
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,875
[CHIO]
Hell no!

471
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,375
Listen, that spark from within

472
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,458
is coming from an abundance
of unused energy!

473
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,458
If you don't get it out,

474
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,041
you'll turn rude
and get wrinkles!

475
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,625
If you won't play kabaddi,
which sport will you play?

476
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,000
--E-sports?
--Or sumo?

477
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,875
Wrong! The answer's kabaddi!

478
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:06,958
Sounds like fun!

479
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,791
[MANANA, CHIO scream]

480
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,500
All right. This is our line.
As always, ladies first.

481
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,041
--We're gonna take you down!
--Slow your roll!

482
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,208
[CHIO] Whoa! Don't forget
not all lines are secure!

483
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,958
Looks like Yuki's the
raider. Bring it on!

484
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:22,958
Okay!

485
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,041
[CHIO, MANANA gasp]

486
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,875
[CHIO, MANANA gasp]

487
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,000
[CHIO yells]

488
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,291
Hell yeah!

489
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,625
Nice tackle, Miyamo!

490
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,166
For someone who complains
as much as you do

491
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,541
about kabaddi, you--[gasps]

492
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,041
Hey! You're out of bounds!

493
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,708
[MANANA]
Sorry, Kushitori! We held it in

494
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,541
for as long as we could,
but we gotta find a restroom

495
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,416
before we flood the streets!
Thanks for understanding!

496
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,583
[MADOKA] That means one of them
could've burst in my presence

497
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,750
at any moment.

498
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:52,125
Explains the electricity
oozing from their pores today!

499
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,416
[CHIO]
Oh, come on!

500
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,208
You have to be
more careful, Yuki!

501
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,458
How was I supposed to know

502
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,791
that was out there for
the whole world to see?

503
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,375
You shouldn't have
told her we'd play!

504
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,625
Yeah, I get that now.

505
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,583
Holy crap.

506
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,416
So, there's a story about
someone being fined 300,000 yen

507
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,750
for showing their junk
on the street recently.

508
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,083
That's so much!

509
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,208
[YUKI]
Hm...

510
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,625
[YUKI gasps]

511
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,916
That's VR scrilla!

512
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,833
[YUKI]
So, wait, that's all it costs?

513
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,416
[CHIO, MANANA]
Huh?

514
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,291
[YUKI] I've been holding onto
my New Year's money for a while.

515
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,375
I bet I have enough to
pull it off at least once.

516
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,583
[BOTH]
But why?!

517
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,708
[ALL]
<i>Chio's School Road</i> !

518
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,458
[MADOKA] I can't stop
thinking about that moment.

519
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,833
It's like I missed something
important, but what?

520
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,583
Which sport will you play?

521
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,666
--E-sports?
--Or sumo?

522
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,916
[echoing] Or sumo?
Sumo, sumo, sumo...

523
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,291
[MADOKA gasps]

524
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,125
[MADOKA]
Women's sumo wrestling?

525
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,166
Why didn't I say yes to that?!

526
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,500
[NARRATOR]
Uh, we've got some extra time,

527
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,333
so how about some previews?

528
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,666
[CHIO]
If this is a hunt,

529
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,208
then I'll be the hunting-est
hunter that ever hunted!

530
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,625
[CHIO] Freeze. Just where
do you think you're going?

531
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,416
I love you!

532
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,166
Why, Mayu? What about me?

533
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,416
That bastard shouldn't
be screaming from pipes

534
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,958
this early in the morning.

535
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,875
One thing's for sure, you know
how to hold your liquor.

536
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,416
I see what you did there.

537
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,625
Which sports?

538
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,500
She escaped again!

539
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,375
Huh. You idiot.

540
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,875
Marina, look down!

541
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,291
[MARINA gasps]

542
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,000
Go ahead and act polite,
but I can see your true colors.

543
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,958
[MARINA gasping]

544
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,583
[MARINA shrieks]

545
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,708
That was your last peon.

546
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:40,083
The Seven Spears are
now all that remain!

547
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,666
I'll come for you in a week!

[NARRATOR]
Mad Dog: Andou Chiharu.

549

I'll win it all for friendship!

558

[ALL]
Thanks for watching!

559
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:22,166
[CHIO] Name's Miyamo Chio.
I'm a first-year student

560
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,333
and a fierce member of
the Soft Tennis Club!

561
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:30,458
There's nothing I hate
more than standing out.

562
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,541
[MANANA]
Oh, man, you were so close!

563
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,791
[YUKI]
Chio, can you hear me?

564
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,333
[CREWMEMBER 12A]
Miyamo, can you sit up for me?

565
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,583
[CHIO]
Don't you dare push me, old man!

566
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,791
[CHIO screams]

567
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,750
[ANDOU] You better have a good
reason to scream like--

568
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:45,000
[laughing] What the hell?

569
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,916
[DIRECTOR 12A]
All right, cut.

570
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,291
I'll wait.

571
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,250
[YUKI]
Oh, my gosh!

572
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,208
[BOTH gasp]

573
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,708
Let me know if I'm not...

574
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,708
--[MANANA] Sorry! I swear!
--[CHIO] Dude, stop that! Ew!

575
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,875
--I didn't mean to.
--Cut?

576
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,208
And now he looks like
a pathetic joke.

577
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,333
Is that what you just told me?!

578
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,833
[CHIO] Holy crap. He's totally
going to headbutt me!

579
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,041
--[ANDOU grunts]
--I can't move!

[ANDOU groans]
I'm so sorry!

581
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,083
[DIRECTOR 12A] Cut! Someone
fly in a first aid kit.

582
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:20,875
[ANDOU]
Oh, man. Please forgive me.

583
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,083
[MANANA] The one you
were telling us about?

584
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,833
Spending all my money
on deadbeats!

585
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,208
[MANANA]
Here she comes!

586
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,375
[ANDOU, CHIO groan]

587
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,541
Whoa! Damn, Chio.

588
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,291
[CHIO] Hey! Rude.
Are you calling me fat?

589
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:36,083
You didn't exorcise anything!

590
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,541
[MANANA gasps]
Seriously?

591
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,291
[CHIO]
Help me up! My arms are dying!

592
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,291
Seriously! Remember me!

593
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,250
--[MANANA laughing]
--[DIRECTOR 12A] Cut!

594
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,791
Do we need to wipe the railing?
What's the problem?
