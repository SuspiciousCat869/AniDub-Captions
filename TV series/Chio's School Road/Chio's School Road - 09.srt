and turn the volume up!

161
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,541
[FEMALE VOICE]
Peek-a-boo.

162
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,458
Dear God!

163
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,166
[sighs] Well, my work
here is done.

164
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,291
No need to thank me.

165
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,750
Yeah. Quite a change.

166
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,750
So, am I beautimous?

167
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,500
[ROSHI]
How do I answer that?

168
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,250
[ROSHI, MANANA whimper]

169
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,541
[CHIO]
Huh?

170
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,000
[ROSHI, MANANA]
What a mess. Mission failed.

171
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,083
[MANANA] Dude! What's with
the dead grandma hairstyle?

172
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,791
It's a classic! I didn't know
she had no bone structure

173
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,291
under those glasses.

174
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,333
I was hoping to highlight
some kinda features at least!

175
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,875
[MANANA] And how are you
gonna explain that to her

176
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,708
when she asks to look
in the mirror?

177
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,125
How are you gonna explain
your finger paint explosion!

178
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,875
I was just experimenting!
I never claimed

179
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,750
to be a miracle worker
like some people!

180
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,333
Huh? Experimenting?

181
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,916
Some friend you
turned out to be!

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,708
Are we done yet? What are
you guys talking about?

183
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,291
[ROSHI]
All right, enough blaming.

184
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,083
We have to figure out what to do
with that sad little monster.

185
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,208
[MANANA]
Yeah. I'm lost.

186
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,708
[ROSHI]
I guess we could start over?

187
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,541
[MANANA] We don't have that
much time. School. Remember?

188
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,041
[ROSHI] I should've
listened to my instincts

189
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,541
about the blonde wig.
It didn't feel right.

190
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,666
[MANANA] Yeah, I knew
that was a mistake.

191
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,458
We have to remember Chio can't
change how homely her face is.

192
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,041
I mean, it's her face.

193
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,541
I always forget and just pile on
the makeup when I do it for her,

194
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,291
but we can't fix
nature's mistakes.

195
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,583
[ROSHI] I know. Let's put
the horse mask on her

196
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,083
and make a run for it!

197
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,625
[MANANA] If I didn't have
to see her at school,

198
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,750
I totally would.

199
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,333
[MANANA gasps]

200
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,708
There's our answer!

201
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,750
You're brilliant!

202
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,166
That'll compliment
her plain face

203
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,541
unlike the gunk
you smeared on it!

204
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,666
[MANANA]
Chio!

205
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,416
Hold still! We need a mulligan!

206
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,291
Let's make a miracle!

207
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,083
[FEMALE VOICE]
Hello.

208
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,791
[BOTH]
It looks good!

209
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,125
[ROSHI]
We've finally found it.

210
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,208
The hairstyle that brings
out your true beauty!

211
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,750
I can't believe I never realized
what a foxy lady you are!

212
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,083
It's absolutely perfect!

213
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,625
No way! Are you serious?

214
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,125
My image is totally improved?

215
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,125
--[ROSHI] Heck yes, it is!
--[laughs]

216
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,333
And I don't look weird?

217
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,666
[MANANA]
No, girl, you look weird AF!

218
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,583
But, do you think
I look sexy at all?

219
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,958
Weird sexy?

220
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,958
[MANANA] Crap. That was
the whole point, wasn't it?

221
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,041
Sure, why not?

222
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,250
Well, uh, look, Miyamo.

223
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,291
If we're bein' honest,

224
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,791
I could see you in a nudie mag.

225
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,083
[gasps] I'm on
a whole new level!

226
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,666
Not a way to compliment her.

227
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,916
It wasn't a compliment.

228
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,708
Just saying that's how
they do their hair.

229
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,666
[MANANA]
That's not the point.

230
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,083
Also, that hair doesn't go
with her uniform like, at all!

231
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,041
[CHIO] I see this kind of thing
in movies all the time,

232
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,833
but I never thought
it would happen to me.

233
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,833
You're both such gems.

234

I'll just be too busy
stealing hearts.

every single night.

handle the new savory, sexy,

--[ROSHI] Shit.
--[MANANA] What do we do?

I've always had!

Manana?

263
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,666
[MANANA] Hm? Yeah,
it's a subtle difference

264
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,416
so it's not so shocking and--
It's totally the same.

265
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,208
So, check it.

266
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,750
We're trying to show you
that you're beautiful

267
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,833
just as you are.

268
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:07,750
Below-average looking,
but a superior human being.

269
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,250
[CHIO] And you think I should
be in a dirty magazine?

270
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,750
[ROSHI]
Well, I just meant

271
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,125
that if those losers at your
school don't appreciate you,

272
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:19,000
somewhere in the world,
there's a need for your type.

273
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,166
Yeah, that makes sense.

274
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,583
What I've learned from this...

275
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,708
...is that you jerks
wasted my time!

276

What better way
to start the day

than playing dress up
with high school girls?

They're delightful.

trying on the wigs.

they add to playing pretend.

how to pole dance?

[CHIO] Some girl workin'
it at this pervy bar

in a game I was playing.

Since I was bored, I decided
to memorize her moves.

Aw, man.

00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,166
Gotta admit, I'm kind of
obsessed with these water pipes.

298
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,666
I'm sorry, what?

299
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,125
I mean, just look at this fence

00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,000
With its sleek and
slippery surface.

301
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,625
They cared so much
about its beauty

302
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,791
that they made it difficult
for people to walk across.

303
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,375
[MANANA] No one's supposed
to walk across it.

[MANANA] Not even close
to what that's for.

306
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
It's like those strong
and dominant men.

307

They look tough but have
gentle hearts underneath it all.

Nope, I sure don't.

and lusting

to get up in that.

Or maybe...

Chio with a boyfriend
is weird enough,

The steering wheel is
usually on the left side

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,958
without my help.

472
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,666
[CHIO]
Huh.

473
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,291
Ya know how we've
been coincidentally

474
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,750
running into Andou?

475
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,916
Do you think he likes me?

476
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,666
Huh? Why? Do you?

477
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,208
I dunno. He's also been
messaging me randomly.

478
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,916
[MANANA] What? When did they
exchange email addresses?

479
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,333
Why is this the first message
she's telling me about?

480
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,166
Are they already that close
without consulting me?

481
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,083
--I get it.
--[CHIO] Hey. We gotta go!

482
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,583
[MANANA]
Chio's trying to abandon me

483
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,250
for a guy on this school road.

484
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,708
After all I've done for her!

485
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,333
[gasps] That shadow.

486
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,833
Probably Andou with chocolates
and an entire rose garden!

487
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,791
[CHIO, MANANA]
Hm?

488
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,291
Hm?!

489
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:26,041
--[ANDOU exhales]
--[BOTH] Hm?!

490
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,916
[ANDOU]
Yes! I nailed it!

491
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,125
Ever since that day I found out
Miyamo was into BL games,

492
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,916
I knew what I needed to do.

493
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,041
I've been playing
those things non-stop.

494
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,458
And the ones I couldn't play,
I researched online.

495
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,583
Bet you recognize this move,

496
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,833
don't you, Miyamo?

497
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,416
[MASAOMI]
I love you, Shouhei.

498
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,166
I can do this!

499
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,833
[ANDOU]
The foot slam is a classic move

500
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,916
from a wildly popular
game called <i>Endor</i> .

501
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,250
I even got my buddy
to help me out.

502
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,708
[ANDOU] You're the only
one I trust, man!

503
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,000
'Kay fine, just
because it's you.

504
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,000
You sure you want me to do this?

505
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,125
Yeah, put all your
weight on top-a me.

506
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,750
[BOTH groaning]

507
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,041
[ANDOU]
I got this.

508
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,083
It'll all be worth it!

509
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,625
Omigod isn't that the super-hot
foot slam from <i>Endor</i> ?

510
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,541
I love BL games so much!

511
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,250
[ANDOU]
Just to see her smile...

512
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,833
[ALL groaning]

513
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,375
[ANDOU]
Please. Recognize it!

514
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,583
Hurry!

515
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,666
[whispers] Manana.

516
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,458
What exactly are we looking at?

517
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,208
[MANANA gulps]

518
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,750
Nice to see you again.

519
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,166
I'd like you to
meet my boyfriend.

520
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,833
We're so in love
and we don't care...

521
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,416
[MANANA]
...who knows about us either.

522
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,958
Also, did you happen to notice
how flexible my legs are?

523
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,291
Holy crap!

524
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,250
[MANANA] Yeah, that's totally
what's goin' down.

525
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,166
[MANANA] 'Kay, well don't
wanna interrupt.

526
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,833
--[CHIO] See ya later.
--[ANDOU gasps]

527
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,166
What? Hold on!

528
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,833
Wasn't that the foot
slam from <i>Endor</i> ?!

529
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,000
[GIRL squeals]

530
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,791
I mean, they're already
into it this early?

531
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,666
Makes sense now why we
kept running into him.

532
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,416
His boyfriend must live
around here somewhere.

533
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,333
What? Your face got all tragic.

534
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,125
[CHIO]
I just feel stupid.

535
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,625
This whole time
I was thinking...

536
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,666
...maybe Andou actually
liked me because, well--

537
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,500
Gah! I'm such an idiot!

538
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,416
Why would anyone be
into someone like me?

539
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
There's at least one
person who digs on you.

540
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,541
[CHIO]
No there's not!

541
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,083
Unless they're blind
and desperate!

542
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,083
I'm so humiliated!

543
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,583
I'm sure that's not true.

544
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,625
Trust.

545
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,791
[ANDOU]
Damn it!

546
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,750
How the hell did I manage
to mess that up?

547
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,791
This sucks!

548
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,375
I'm sorry about that, man.

549
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,041
I know this was
awkward for you.

550
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,416
It's fine.

551
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,166
Actually, I kind of enjoyed
playing your boyfriend.

552
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,458
[ANDOU gasps]

553
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,166
[MANANA]
<i>Chio's School Road</i> ! Bam!

554
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,750
She gave me her email address;
that has to be a sign!

555
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,375
Today I'll man up and
ask her on a date!

556
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,375
Not too forward, but still
a clear invitation.

557
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,625
At least I hope.
I guess we'll see.

558
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,041
[CHIO] If you consider
the cost and value,

559
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,916
you're actually better off
if you chomp on some juice

560
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
you chilled in the freezer.

561
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,958
She rejected me!

562
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,333
[YUKI] Next time on
<i>Chio's School Road</i> !

563
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,250
"Shinozuka, Sugar Content,
and the Press Conference."

564
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,750
"Thousand Spring,"
and "Andou and George."

565
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,791
Hope you're ready
for a real head rush.
