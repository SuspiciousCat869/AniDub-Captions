1
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,250
It all started with the smoker.

2
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,875
--My dad's wanted one forevs,
--[MANANA] Right.

3
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,875
so he decided to
build one out back.

4
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,541
First thing we did
was smoke some salmon

5
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,083
and that brought all
the cats to the yard.

6
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,583
--[MANANA] Whoa.
--I mean, like 50.

7
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,625
Um! 'Scuse me!

8
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,083
Jeez, Momo. You scared
the crap outta me!

9
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,375
I know this is a bit
sudden. But um...

10
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,041
[CHIO, MANANA] You really wanna
talk to us about something?

11
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,958
Well, um, thing is...

12
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,166
I thought that you two
might be the only two

13
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,458
who would understand.

14
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,583
Uh, are we gonna talk about
your crush on Mr. Gotou?

15
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,250
No! I mean yes!

16
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,541
But it's not what
you're thinking!

17
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,041
Did you go to pound town?

18
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,708
[whispering] No! I just, uh,

19
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,541
need you to help me
buy some sweets.

20
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,583
[BOTH]
Huh?

21
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,833
I'm sure we can do that,

22
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,083
but what does that have
to do with Mr. Gotou?

23
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,000
[SHINOZUKA]
Well, you see...

24
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,500
How strange.

25
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,291
I found a whole bunch
of different sweets

26
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,500
piled up in a corner
in the courtyard.

27
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,458
Honestly, they should have
just gone to someone's house

28
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,458
if they wanted to
eat them together.

29
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,208
What's the point of
consuming them all at school?

30
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,875
Makes a lot of sense to me.

31
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,708
Think about how you always wanna
sleep in during the week,

32
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,083
but you're excited
to wake up early

33
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,125
when the weekend rolls around.

34
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,250
Right. I see.

35
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,625
But I didn't get it.

36
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,708
I pretended to know
what he was talking about,

37
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,250
but I was so confused.

38
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,666
[CHIO] Well, yeah,
because the analogy sucked.

39
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,125
So, I thought about it
for the rest of the day.

40
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,666
And I think what
he was trying to say

41
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,333
is that I would probably
understand the students better

42
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,833
if I invested some time

43
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,375
in breaking a few
rules like they do.

44
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,791
I won't eat in the courtyard,

45
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,833
but maybe I could
while walking to school.

46
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,791
Would that be easier?

47
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,000
Still, I'm kinda scared.

48
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,291
I thought it might help if
I didn't have to do it alone.

49
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,708
We've got your back.

50
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,291
Consider us your
partners in calories.

51
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,291
This is so cute.

52
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,666
I hope Mr. G sees
how amazing you are.

53
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,208
Abandoning your beliefs just to
show him how much you care.

54
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,708
You don't have to say it
like that, Miyamo!

55
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:45,875
I'm not... I'm not as much of
a goody-goody as you think I am.

56
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,000
Where should we go? Inoyama?

57
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,333
Sounds good.

58
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,000
[CHIO, MANANA sucking]

59
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:58,750
Stop! Nonomura,
Miyamo, sorry but...

60
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,083
...that qualifies as vandalism!

61
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,250
You must leave other
people's flowers alone!

62
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,666
[CHIO]
What?

63
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,000
We've been picking these
flowers since we were little.

64
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,000
Haven't been arrested yet.

65
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,666
[MANANA]
It's so yummy!

66
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,500
Right?

67
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,916
No prob, I'll go ask them.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
'Kay, it's all good!

69
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,625
I, um... Hold on.

70
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,125
Did you...

71
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,250
[BOTH]
Heh.

72
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,625
Come on, Momo.

73
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,708
I know you're jonesin'
to try one, too, aren't ya?

74
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:24,791
Nuh-uh!

75
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,583
Open wide and prepare
for the ride!

76
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,416
We're pre-gaming
this sugar binge!

77
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,208
I don't think I can!

78
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,333
Well, ya don't have to.
We're forcing it on you,

79
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,458
which means you don't
have any choice!

80
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Ah! It's so sweet!

81
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,208
[BOTH]
Um, are you gonna be okay?

82
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:47,000
Wowzers! I never knew the nectar
from flowers tasted this good!

83
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,625
I can't get over the smell,
and the flavor is so profound!

84
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,208
I feel just like a honey bee!

85
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,958
No. What a disgrace I am.

86
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,041
[CHIO] Whoa. What was
with her voice just now?

87
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,750
[CHIO] You've got a sweet tooth
that demands respect, Momo.

88
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:08,708
Who'd have thunk it?

89
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,291
Yes, but it's far beyond that.

90
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,208
You saw what happened.

91
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,958
My family is ashamed.

92
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,708
That's why I'm only allowed
to eat sweets at home, alone.

93
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,833
[gasps]

94
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,708
[CHIO]
Oh, to be a fly on her wall.

95
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,916
That's the real reason
I needed you two here.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,916
I need you to keep me from
embarrassing myself, okay?

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,041
After I buy the sweets, it could
take over without warning.

98
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,208
Uh, do you have something
against crackers and nuts?

99
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,000
[MANANA] Guess she prefers to
suffer for her personal growth.

100
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,083
[CHIO]
There it is. Perspective awaits.

101
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,750
Cool thing is, it's not
on the way to school,

102
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,458
so you don't have to stress
about running into anyone.

103
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,750
You can pick whatever you
want and eat it here, too.

104
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,416
[SHINOZUKA] Wow, I've never
been to such a place!

105
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,083
No, I told you I'm watching
the shop for Grams today.

106
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,500
Yeah, it opens at
butt-crack-of-dawn o'clock.

107
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,458
[SHINOZUKA]
Excuse me.

108
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,791
Ugh. Call you back in a minute.

109
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,166
Can I help you?

110
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,166
You can. I want these.

111
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,958
[WOMAN] Someone is serious
about their morning chocolate.

112
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,041
I'll take these.

113
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,916
[WOMAN]
At least she has normal friends.

114
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,916
For the very first time,

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,666
I will now consume sweets
right after buying them!

116
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,000
[BOTH]
Cool!

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,875
[SHINOZUKA]
Mr. Gotou, please forgive me.

118
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,625
I'm ready to proceed!

119
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,208
[WOMAN] I've never seen anyone
treat a wrapper so delicately.

120
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,875
Crazy!

121
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,125
I'm trusting you.

122
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,708
You must stop me
if I start to lose control.

123
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,916
Promise me you will,
no matter what it takes.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,375
Even if you have to hit me.

125
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,833
[BOTH]
Gladly!

126
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,541
Let's see. It's not bad.
It tastes a little different.

127
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,791
[high-pitched] So good!

128
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:05,875
The way the sweetness hits

129
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,666
before the aroma
of slightly bitter cacao

130
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,125
is a flavor adventure
that ends way too soon!

131
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,791
[yelps]

132
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,583
Plus, it's only ten yen
and has a cookie inside of it,

133
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,083
and that's just the beginning!

134
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,666
It finishes with a buttery
texture that lingers

135
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,500
long after the last bite!
Even when swallowed!

136
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,583
Ah!

137
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,833
I've missed getting caramel
stuck in my teeth! Ah!

138
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,791
It's been way too long!

139
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,708
[CHIO]
This is in-frickin-tense!

140
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,791
We're finally seeing who
she really is... I think.

141
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,458
If I start to lose control,
you must stop me.

142
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,166
[CHIO]
I'm having flashbacks.

143
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,583
I remember the time a Western
horror game was released,

144
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,375
and the stupid Japanese
distributor decided to censor it

145
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,833
so all of the violent scenes
were completely black.

146
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,333
How do they know we
didn't wanna see that?

147
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,916
Could've been the best part.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,166
Just because Momo doesn't
like this side of herself,

149
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,333
doesn't mean others won't.

150
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,833
[CHIO]
So, then...

151
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,791
[BOTH]
Wow! This shit is frickin' good!

152
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,083
You gotta take
a bite of this now

153
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,708
or you'll hate yourself!

154
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,833
What? Really?

155
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,291
Just eat it!

156
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,708
[SHINOZUKA]
What? What is this?

157
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,916
It's sweet and sour!

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,708
--[CHIO] Yeah!
--Hurry! Try another one!

159
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,250
[WOMAN]
Okay...

160
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,791
The contrasting textures
of cream and wafers.

161
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,041
It's superb!

162
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,750
[MANANA] I am living for
these banana thingies!

163
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,875
I know! I love those, too!

164
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,125
And I've always wanted to try

165
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,208
the three-flavors-
at-once technique!

166
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,375
[SHINOZUKA] It's like there's
an earthquake inside my mouth

167
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,250
kicking up flavor debris!

168
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,291
Emergency!

169
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,958
We're about to
run out of sweets!

170
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,583
Right! Well, then you must
purchase some more immediately!

171
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,333
Uh...

172
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,416
Um, hi. I want these.

173
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,125
[WOMAN]
At least she's not screaming.

174
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,125
[CHIO] All right!
I come bearing relief!

175
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,458
Excellent work!

176
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,875
I love soda powder!

177
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,208
That should be enough, and...

178
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,750
Now, the perfect
soda is complete!

179
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,291
[SHINOZUKA]
It's so sweet and delicious!

180
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,875
You have to try this!

181
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,291
Stop twisting my arm!

182
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,208
Oh, god, that's sweet!

183
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,750
I know!

184
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,041
I think I should win some kind
of prize for this invention!

185
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,041
[MANANA]
Agreed!

186
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,291
[BOTH] You win the
Nobel Fizzy Drink Prize!

187
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,625
What an honor! Thank you!

188
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,541
Congratulations!

189
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,250
Thank you, everybody! I'm proud
to be this year's recipient!

190
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,375
That's Shinozuka Momo!

191
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,375
[BOTH] Is she staging
a press conference?

192
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,791
Please tell us how you imagine
the future of this product.

193
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,125
Well, you see,

194
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,666
I'll develop it further,
to better our future.

195
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,583
By that time,
I'll be Mrs. Gotou!

196
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,458
[SHINOZUKA]
Why? Why didn't you stop me?

197
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,458
You mean why didn't we stop you
from being happy and having fun?

198
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,375
What did your first
consumer binge feel like?

199
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:04,166
[SHINOZUKA] It was like, like,
um, the most fun I've ever had!

200
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,875
I'd never know
by looking at you.

201
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,125
It's just that thinking about
never doing it again is...

202
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,000
[CHIO]
That's an easy fix!

203
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,125
We'll bring the loot
to your place next time!

204
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,625
[SHINOZUKA]
Really? You'd do that?

205
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,833
I apologize for
the short notice,

206
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,750
but would it be okay
to request that day off?

207
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,458
Sure. It's good to let loose.

208
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:34,166
Well, I, uh... I understand now.

209
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,291
Why does it smell
like chocolate, caramel,

210
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,000
and soda over here?

211
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,791
[CHIO]
<i>Chio's School Road</i> !

212
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,916
So, we were wondering how you
feel about mint chocolate?

213
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,916
You mean the way it tastes?

214
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,083
It's one of those flavors

215
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,166
most people don't know
how to appreciate.

216
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,166
But I find it
really refreshing.

217
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,000
[BOTH] We've found the
one person who likes it!

218
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,875
Oh, great. It's
that little creep!

219
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,166
[CHIO]
Manana's gonna freak.

220
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,000
[CHIO]
Huh? Where's she going?

221
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,083
Definitely not anywhere close
to the Eihei Girls Academy!

222
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,083
She's up to something.

223
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:33,583
Ugh! Come on. There's
still tons left in here.

224
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,541
Think, people. This thing
could explode in the truck.

225
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,875
Bottles don't go
in here, either.

226
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,458
Well, I can't talk.

227
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,333
I can barely remember
to take my own trash out.

228
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,375
Bottles and cans.

229
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,625
Uh, who would throw
this guy out?

230
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,541
Plain Jane. Hell, yeah.
Wonder if it still works.

231
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:59,291
Looks fine, guess we'll see.
Ugh, I can't do it.

232
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,250
Maybe if I mute it!

233
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,708
No, get back in the trash!

234
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,291
What the...

235
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,708
Chiharu! What are
you doing here?

236
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,666
[CHIHARU] I could ask you
the same question, Mayu.

237
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,833
Well, what's it look like
I'm doin'? I'm workin'.

238
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,458
You're not supposed to work!

239
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,958
You're supposed to be the most
badass motorcycle gangster

240
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:19,833
in the world!

241
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,208
Yeah, about that...

242
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,916
Jobs are for losers!
Stop working right now!

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,625
You used to be so cool riding
around with your gangsters,

244
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,375
smelling like blood,
sweat, and motor oil!

245
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,708
You were my hero!

246
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,583
Now look at the pathetic
shell you've become!

247
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,333
You've never even taken
the garbage out at home

248
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,166
and now you're trying
to make a career out of it?

249
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,208
--[ANDOU] Stop!
--Why am I in private school?

250
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,916
'Cause you didn't want me to
see the loser you've become?

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,291
[CHIO]
Oh, hey, Andou.

252
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,041
Do you, uh, happen
to know this kid?

253
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,833
I do. She's my--

254
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,083
--[BOTH yelling]
--[ANDO] Uh, no! Down! Bad!

255
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:54,375
Anyway. She's my sister.
Introducing Andou Chiharu.

256
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,041
Wait. Four Eyes, how the
hell do you know Mayu?

257
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,416
[ANDOU] Hold up, you two
know each other? How?

258
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,208
She randomly tried to stick
her fingers up my ass.

259
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,333
What? What the hell
is wrong with you?

260
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,375
It wasn't "random."
It was ass-to-ass combat.

261
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,500
We do it every day
during our lunch period.

262
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,458
Loser cleans after
flower arrangement class.

263
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,083
[ANDOU] I can't tell if
that's vulgar or democratic.

264
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,208
Who cares. Why'd you
go after Miyamo?

265
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,666
You really wanna know?

266
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,000
I needed bait
to locate your woman.

267
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,958
It didn't make any sense
why you'd wake up

268
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,458
and decide to leave your gang.

269
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,666
So I decided to
find out the truth.

270
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,000
[BIKER] The hell do
you want, stupid brat?

271
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,916
[CHIHARU]
I'm Andou's little sister!

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,791
[BIKER]
Huh?

273
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,875
Tell me what happened to him!

274
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,541
Spit it out!

275
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,791
Uh, Samejima...

276
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,666
Dumbass! You'll get us killed!

277
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,833
Oh, right.

278
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,708
I'm sorry. We can't say more.

279
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,250
[CHIHARU]
Samejima?

280
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,458
So it's a girl from
Samejima Academy.

281
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,833
That's all I need to know
to find this bitch.

282
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,625
And kill her!

283
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,541
[CHIO]
Uh, kill who?

284
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,791
I targeted Four Eyes
here to be my pawn

285
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,750
and help me find the skank since
they go to the same school.

286
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,375
Miyamo's not a pawn. Listen.

287
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,625
I figured it out.
You don't have to hide it!

288
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,916
[CHIO]
She's only kinda figured it out.

289
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,958
It sounds like she was looking
for me and didn't realize it.

290
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,666
Everything that happened back
then with Andou is in the past.

291
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,458
So telling her won't
do us any good.

292
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,541
So, not my problem.

293
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,416
He can take care
of this on his own.

294
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,875
Okay, here's what's what.

295
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,875
I get it. I know you.

296
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,416
But is she that amazing?

297
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,750
[ANDOU]
Well, yeah.

298
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,875
So amazing that you decided
to change your life?

299
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,708
All for [bleep].

300
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,625
[CHIHARU]
I bet she's gross, Mayu.

301
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,000
Probably some kind of succubus
operating out of a Love Hotel.

302
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,250
You talking about me?!

303
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,250
Your defensive reaction
tells me you must be his woman!

304
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,125
Not true! And I'm
still a virgin!

305
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,375
Chiharu, where'd you learn
to talk like that?

306
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,666
[CHIO]
And who the hell is Mayu?

307
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,083
You hearing voices now?

308
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,000
[ANDOU]
That's me! My name's Mayuta.

309
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,625
[CHIO]
Oh, cool!

310
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,333
This one? You got
KO'd by Glasses?

311
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,416
When was that?

312
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,125
[ANDOU]
Appearances can be deceiving.

313
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,416
I ended up losing
a duel against her.

314
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,791
Quitting was what she
demanded as her prize.

315
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:08,708
Isn't that right?

316
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,708
Uh, yeah.

317
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,375
Just sounds weird
when you say it.

318
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,125
I don't believe you, liar!

319
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,541
[ANDOU]
Look at me!

320
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,833
Look me dead in the eyes
and tell me I'm lying to you.

321
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,083
I... I don't know yet. So then,
prove it! Prove it to me!

322
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:29,166
There's no way this limp noodle
took you out with one punch!

323
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,250
I wanna see her do it
again in front of me.

324
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,791
I don't see how
those scrawny arms

325
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,250
could possibly knock you out!

326
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,166
[ANDOU]
Hey, now!

327
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,625
Why would she wanna
watch Miyamo hit me?

328
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,375
Uh, Andou?

329
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,000
Miyamo.

330
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:43,708
Let's go!

331
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,625
Whoa. We're doin' this?

332
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,958
[CHIO]
Sure looks like it!

333
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,666
I'm not gonna walk away
from here with your sister

334
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,958
thinking I'm a stank-ho.

335
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,875
Get movin', slut-box!

336
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,625
Hold still. It won't hurt much.

337
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,000
[ANDOU]
All right.

338
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,916
[CHIO] I dislocated his jaw
last time. It was easy.

339
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,708
Here we go!

340
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,333
[CHIO]
Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry!

341
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,916
I got so nervous in the moment
and it threw off my aim!

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,291
[ANDOU groans]
It's okay.

343
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,125
One more?

344
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,666
[ANDOU]
Yeah!

345
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,833
[ANDOU] This time I'll watch
where she's leading from

346
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,125
and lean into her.

347
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,083
You ready?

348
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,625
Yeah. Bring it.

349
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,250
[ANDOU]
She got me on the other side!

350
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,791
Why? Why the left?

351
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,541
Sorry! It's because my
right elbow still hurts!

352
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,083
Liar! I knew it!

353
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,125
Final round!

354
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,750
You got this!

355
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,750
[ANDOU] I'll have to recreate
what happened that day.

356
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,416
Which means in order
for it to work,

357
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,708
I'll have to scare her.

358
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,250
[ANDOU]
All right, come on!

359
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,375
What the... Mayu?

360
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,333
I, I, I, I, I-- Um...

361
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,875
Um, sorry!

362
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,541
'Kay, so, um...

363
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,708
How, uh, was it?

364
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,666
Huh? How was what?

365
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:01,500
[BOTH shouting]

366
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,250
Slow down! What are you saying?

367
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,083
[MANANA]
Out of the way!

368
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,625
I finally found you,
you little shit.

369
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,375
Wanna play your favorite game?

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,833
[CHIO] That's right.
That blond praying mantis

371
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,291
was all up Manana's
ass that day, too.

372
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,833
Ooh, she pissed.

373
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,541
[CHIHARU]
Um, Mayu, are you okay?

374
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,125
[CHIO] I can tell because
why else would she hit Andou?

375
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,541
Wait. She took him
out with one hit.

376
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,666
So, that means...

377
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,916
[CHIHARU] ...she's the one
who beat up my brother.

378
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,125
--Is she Mayu's real woman?
--[MANANA] Kill her. Kill her.

379
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,166
I'll pull your intestines
out from your ass,

380
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,083
and then pickle them in a jar.

381
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,833
You wanna come for me, bitch?

382
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,541
What the hell are
you waiting for?

383
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,250
Stop! Don't taunt her!

384
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,458
She's psychotic when
she's actually pissed off!

385
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,625
If she could ever
get a boyfriend

386
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,875
and he cheated on her,

387
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,916
she'd chop him up
and feed him to piranhas!

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,291
[CHIO]
Fine, ignore me.

389
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,333
If this shit explodes,
I won't be able to stop it!

390
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,000
Someone gon' die!

391
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,500
Hey! Put me down!
Why are you up?

392
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,541
I thought she knocked you out!

393
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,000
[growling]

394
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,583
[ANDOU]
Stop this!

395
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,708
Lay a finger on my
sister and I kill you.

396
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,875
[CHIO]
She won't stop.

397
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,708
She knocked him out--
she ain't scurred.

398
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,625
I have to save
Manana. I got you!

399
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,458
Right. Cool. I'm just
messin' around.

400
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,583
[CHIO] Why'd she stop?
That's not normal.

401
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,958
Right. I keep forgetting

402
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,291
Andou used to be
a good-for-nothin'.

403
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,166
If we think about the
schoolyard caste system,

404
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,875
he ranked above even
the baddest of the bad!

405
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,416
We below-averagers
couldn't stand up to that!

406
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,916
Meanwhile,

407
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,208
Manana can be cruel AF
to people who are below us.

408
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,500
Like grade schoolers.

409
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,125
[MANANA whimpering]

410
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,000
[CHIO]
She's scary.

411
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,916
Not right now, but usually.

412
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,333
[CHIHARU] It looks like
he's still unconscious.

413
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:56,041
Which means he
subconsciously protected me.

414
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,083
[MAN 10A]
There you are!

415
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,666
Do we get a discount for
ringing ourselves up today?

416
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,500
[ANDOU] I'm so sorry!
I'll be right there!

417
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,208
[MAN 10A] Does that mean
now or an hour from now?

418
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,791
That ended well, I think.
We're all in one piece, so...

419
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,750
It's like that saying!
How's it go?

420
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,333
--"All's good that ends good?"
--[CHIHARU] Yeah, shut up.

421
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,166
I guess if either one
of you was his woman,

422
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,791
he wouldn't have, um, helped me.

423
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,416
I'm sorry about that.
Have a good day!

424
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,208
See, he looks cool
working, too, right?

425
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,250
Shut up, dumbass!

426

[CHIHARU] You think you have
the answer for everything! Shit.

428
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,333
So, you recovered, yet?

429
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,541
Gangsters freak me
the frick out! [crying]

430

That's a no.

do anything and I froze.

433
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:52,875
I don't know about that. I mean,
you did punch Andou in the face.

434
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,416
But neither of you
seem to remember that.

435
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,000
Well, damn. That explains
the tingly knuckles I had.

436

Mystery solved. Sweet relief.
