how to turn it off!

And now she'll lecture me

I made sense.

I blasted them all,

OMG!

I just realized I practically
have a PhD in being a gangsta!

95
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,500
I bet I could make
this kind of money IRL!

would be gone!

[CHIO] "Is it possible to commit
bank robberies in this country?"

99
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,041
"It is not. Most transactions
with bank tellers are automated,

100
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,625
and banks usually only have
a few million yen on site.

101
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,791
If there were someone planning
to rob a bank in this country,

102
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,875
they'd have to be an idiot

or video games."

Okay, fine.

I admit it's possible
to do things in games

that are impossible IRL.

But then...

110
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,625
...why are there still wars

111
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:04,041
when we can see how it all
ends in war video games?

Uh, crap. I'm looking
at it upside down.

into any nonsense on the way!

I'll have plenty of time!

00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,458
[CHIO]
Huh?

124
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,416
It's four o'clock in
the morning, damn it!

125
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
What's with the screaming?
Are you all right?

[CHIO stammers]

127
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,958
There was a cockroach!

128
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,333
It scared the crap out of
me while I was sleeping!

129
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,916
So you got up and started
puttin' on your school clothes?

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,458
[CHIO]
Uh...

131
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,625
I wore them to bed so I could
wake up with school spirit!

[CHIO'S MOM]
Chio...

133
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,708
Uh, is your head
feelin' all right?

134
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,666
[CHIO]
Crap, she's actually concerned.

135
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,500
[CHIO'S MOM] Stay home today
so I can take you to the doctor.

136
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,458
[CHIO] Mom, you're tired.
Go to bed, 'kay?

137
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,000
You don't feel dizzy?
How've your stools been?

138
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,208
[CHIO]
Oh, my god! I'm fine!

139
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,291
[inhales]

140
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,625
[CHIO]
I'm gonna die.

141
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,666
Ugh, I can't believe
I misread the clock!

142
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,041
[CHIO] And now I sit facing
an all-too-familiar dilemma,

143
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,416
which is:

144
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,750
to sleep or not to sleep?

145
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,208
Now that I've been
clock-blocked, I'm wide awake,

146
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,791
so if I try to sleep now,

147
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,750
I'll have to wake up right when
I get to the deep sleep stage.

148
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,500
I am the worst when it comes
to sleeping through alarms.

149
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,125
There are even times
I'll fall asleep

150
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,208
during shootouts in a
game and can't wake up.

151
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,625
Pretty sure Mom was serious

152
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,500
when she said she
wouldn't wake me, too.

153
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,916
I guess I need to figure out

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,583
what the worst-case scenario
in each sitch would be.

155
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:56,000
[CHIO]
Crap! I totally overslept!

156
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,625
Hey, Yuki, what's up?

157
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:01,375
[YUKI] What? I thought you
were staying home today.

158
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,875
[STUDENT 11A]
Where do you think she was?

159
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,916
[CHIO] Everyone always gets
strangely suspicious

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,541
when someone comes to
school in the afternoon.

161
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,416
[CHIO]
I literally didn't sleep at all.

162
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,416
[YUKI] Oh, my gosh,
you must be so exhausted!

163
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,541
[CHIO] Nope! I feel refreshed,
weightless, and free!

164
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,625
[blabbering]

165
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,791
[CHIO]
Whatever happens,

166
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,875
I just don't want to
stand out in class.

167
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,041
The peace and harmony
of my social isolation

168
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,791
is feeling threatened.

169
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,416
I need to make a decision
before the sun does.

170
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,166
[CHIO]
Uh?

171
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,166

[tapping]

173
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,750
[CHIO] Let's meet up
at the shrine tomorrow.

174
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,375
The same time as usual.
Make sure you're not late.

175
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,541
[MANANA] Oh, please,
when have I ever been late?

176
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,166
Nice black dress
you have on, kettle.

177
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,166
4:22 in the morning?

178
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,708
Why was she up texting me
about where to meet so late?

179
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,125
Probably some new video game.

180
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,875
Damn, did she sleep at all?

181
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,000
Huh? Since when does Chio
show up before me to anything?

182
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,041
[gasps]

[MANANA  groans, sighs]

[MANANA]
Lord, if you hear me,

185
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,333
please be any other weirdo
but Chio under there.

186
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,250

[CHIO groans]

190
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,916
And the angel opens her eyes.

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,458
Good morning,
my precious bag hag.

192
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,041
[CHIO] Man, I slept like
a sloth in a hammock.

193
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm so glad I had
you wake me up.

194
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,000
So hold up, you actually
slept out there

195
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,458
with that bag over your face?

196
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,125
Way to not stand out, dork.

197
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,375
The thing I learned from my game

198
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,958
is it doesn't matter
if people look,

199
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,583
as long as they never figure out
you're the one under the mask.

200
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,708
--Owie.
--What happened?

201
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,791
My head just started
throbbing out of nowhere!

202
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,916
What is this? I can't
take it, it hurts so much!

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,625
Please fix it, Manana!

204
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,458
[MANANA]
Probably from not sleeping.

205
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,625
[CHIO]
You think so?

206
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,041
Ugh, I gotta stop
staying up all night.

207
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,125
Ow!

208
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,916
[MANANA]
It's what you get.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,166
[MANANA] So, basically
nothing you do matters

210
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,583
as long as no one finds out.

211
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,666
I think I get it.

212
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,541
Wake up, Chio,
it's time to greet...

213
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,083
[MANANA chuckles]
No one will ever know.

214
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,708
[MANANA]
Wake up, you little bastard.

Okay, fine.

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,750
What would you do
with 700 million yen?

218
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,041
[MANANA]
Uh, a lot. Why?

219
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,000
[CHIO]
Because that's how much...

220
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,083
Hey, Shinozuka.

221
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,291
Yes, sir?

222
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,666
What would you do if
you suddenly received

223
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,291
700 million yen?

224
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,583
[SHINOZUKA gasps]
Well, I uh... I...

225
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,625
[SHINOZUKA] Saying I'd put it
into savings is so cliché

226
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,416
and I don't want him
to think I'm dull.

227
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,625
I need to come up
with something funny.

228
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:07,458
I think if I had that much,
I'd probably pay my taxes off.

229
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,166
[SHINOZUKA groans]
"I'd probably pay my taxes off"?

230
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,708
[GOTOU] Ah, I think everyone
would be much better off

231
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,416
if the local government's
budget were increased.

232
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,333
Just the answer
I'd expect from you.

[TV SALESWOMAN 11A] And now,
for our special coverage

00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,583
of how you can cover
up your body odor!

Listen up, smelly people.

I'm so glad I don't
have to deal with that--

[TV SALESWOMAN 11A] You may
think you don't have a problem,

239
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,541
but studies have shown
that most people

240
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,833
don't even notice their own BO.

not just the men, ladies.

243
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,541
More and more women
are discovering their pH

244
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,791
might not be so balanced.

245
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,291
I'm sure many of us plan to

dress for hotter
weather this season,

247
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,083
but some lighter fabrics can
actually exacerbate the issue,

[MANANA]
I'm being serious here!

I heard on TV yesterday
that 60 percent of people

beef and onion soup

That can't be me, Chio.

We've been hanging out together

to her smell from a distance.

Are you okay?

[MANANA] It's all starting
to make sense now,

even Chio's obsession
with being below average.

311

It's really like she was
forced to be a loner

Yeah, I'm free! Count me in!

315
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,250
[FEMALE PEER 11A] No, I gotta
wash my arm hair. Cancel it.

316
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,250
[MANANA] She must've
been rejected constantly

317
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,291
because of her stench.

318
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,000
[MANANA] I feel like a
bad friend. Poor Chio.

319
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,916
I wish I noticed how
ripe she was earlier.

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,291
Manana, what's wrong?

321
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,291
[MANANA] It's been
this way... the whole time,

322
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,791
and I've been with her
and never noticed.

323
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,166
[MANANA]
Here, Chio. This is for you.

324
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,958
No way! You're really
giving it to me?

325
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,500
I was just getting thirsty, too!

326
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,208
It's like you can read my mind!

327
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,250
[MANANA]
Wait. Hold on.

328
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,541
I've been around her
the entire time.

329
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,125
So that could actually mean...

330
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,458
...her stank glands
are affecting me, too!

331
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,375
[gasps] Oh, my god,
it's all making sense!

332
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,208
[MANANA] There was a guy I was
kind of into named Makiyama.

333
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,166
I was pretty certain he was
digging on me, too, 'cause, duh.

334
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,291
Next thing I know, he's hanging
out with some bob-headed

335
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,375
plain ho with no cheekbones!

336
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,458
Something was up.

337
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,583
I know he liked me first.

338
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry, it's just
that I'm already

339
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,375
kinda talking to someone I like.

340
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,791
Is it that Nonomura
girl from our class?

341
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,750
That's so unfortunate.

342
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,750
I guess that means...
no one's told you about her.

343
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:29,583
[MAKIYAMA]
Huh?

344
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,333
That's okay. I'll tell you.

345
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,583
Here it goes.

346
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,708
She's best friends with
that girl, Wild Game.

347
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,708
The one with glasses that
everyone makes fun of

348
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,041
who smells like dirty
feet and wild animals?

349
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,041
[FEMALE STUDENT 11A]
The very same. They're BFFs,

350
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,291
which is why other
girls stay away.

351
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,125
The smell is so strong that if
you're hanging around Nonomura,

352
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,750
it might rub off on
you really badly.

353
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,583
Then you'll end up
smelling like Wild Game.

354
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,458
Eww.

355
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,583
Man, that was a close one!
I was falling hard for her, too!

356
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,083
Thanks for the save!

357
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,458
You got it! You're a
good person, Makiyama,

358
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,208
and I didn't want you to
have to suffer like that.

359
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,500
Why can't this be your
crushed orange skull, Chio?

360
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,416
[CHIO] What the hell?
Your hormones are whack, girl!

361
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,750
Manana, do you read me?

362
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,333
[MANANA] It's because of
her--because of Wild Game!

363
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,291
Everything was going just fine.

364
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,166
But then it happened--
she happened!

365
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,708
Snap the hell out of it!
What's going on?

366
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,333
I already told you, you're fine!

367
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,583
Your pits are all in check!

368
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,916
[MANANA] It's not about
my pits! It's about you!

369
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,625
You're Wild Game!

370
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,041
[MANANA] I can't stop thinking
about what you've been through

371
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,083
and how lonely your
life will always be.

372
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,541
[MANANA crying]

373
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,958
[MANANA]
God, you frickin' reek!

374
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:45,000
But even though you're probably
ruining my life, I still...

375
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,208
I can't help it!
Wild Game, I love you!

376
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,625
[CHIO]
Wild what? Game?

377
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,750
So she loves the meat
from wild animals or...

378
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,916
The hell? Did she
eat some skunk meat

379
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,291
and think it'll make
her stink or what?

380
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,666
Is she that dumb?

381
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,458
That settles it. Mind made up.

382
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,416
I'm with you for
life, Wild Game!

383
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,375
[CHIO] So... she wants to
become a hunter or something?

384
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,666
My vow is to never
leave your smelly side!

385
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,875
If society judges you,

386
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,416
then it shall judge
the both of us!

387
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,833
Uh, hey, Yuki? Sorry for
the random phone call.

388
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,416
I think Manana has
rabies or something.

389
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,083
[MANANA]
Huh? She called Yuki? What?

390
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,500
That's perfect, actually.

391
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,833
If anyone will be honest
with Chio, it's her.

392
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,583
She'll do it in a
sweet, smiley way

393
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,416
that won't send Chio into fits.

394
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,083
Look out, for the day
of reckoning is nigh!

395
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,916
Yeah, and please hurry.
We don't have much time.

396
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,250
Hey, you guys! I made it.

397
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,166
--[CHIO] That was fast!
--Everything good?

398
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,208
[MANANA laughs]
Well, look who's here.

399
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,875
The self-esteem assassin.

400
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,875
It's everyone's favorite
smiling reaper.

401
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:04,125
Well, well, well. I'm so glad
you could join us this morning,

402
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,125
Death Scythe Hosokawa!

403
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:06,958
[CHIO]
See what I mean?

404
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,500
[YUKI]
Poor thing.

405
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:12,250
Yuki, there's something I would
like you to confirm for me.

406
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,458
It will require you to
be 100 percent honest.

407
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,333
It's fine. I actually
can't smell anything.

408
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,625
[CHIO]
Huh?

409
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,666
[CHIO]
What the crap?

410
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,875
You need to learn the difference
between nice and honest,

411
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,791
'cause I only asked you for one!

412
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:30,000
[YUKI] I'm being honest!
I don't know how to lie!

413
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,125
Yeah right. Chio,
lift up your arm!

414
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,125
[CHIO]
Excuse you?

415
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:38,583
[MANA sniffing]

416
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,583
She's right! You don't
smell like death!

417
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,041
Of course I don't!

418
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,208
Dude, I swear there was some
kind of bear burping toots

419
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,000
from underneath
your arm earlier.

420
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,375
You have got to be kidding.

421
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,500
'Cause when you smelled before,
you said... [sniffs]

422
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,333
What the--?!
What is under there?!

423
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,250
My nose is still
on my face, right?

424
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,416
Why is it only this arm
that reeks so bad?

425
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,041
[gasps]

426
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,000
[CHIO]
I wonder if that's what it is.

427
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,916
Good morning, Chop!
Who's an energetic baby today?

428
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,208
Who is it?

429
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,833
[CHIO laughs]

430
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,083
Hey, cut it out! That tickles!

431
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,541
Dial it back, pupper.

432
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,500
[CHIO]
Chop and his rank breath.

433
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,250
Wow, I had no idea
that doggies...

434
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,166
[MANANA]
Okay, so Chio doesn't stink.

435
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,458
She just lets her dog
lick her armpits.

436
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,208
Weird.

437
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,916
Well, the good news is Wild
Game never actually existed.

438
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,666
[MANANA gasps]

439
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,041
[MANANA]
But if that's true then...

440
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,291
...why didn't Makiyama
want to go out with me?

441
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,500
[CHIO]
I'm gonna go wash my pits

442
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,958
in the convenience
store restroom!

443
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,083
Good call!

444
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,500
[MANANA]
Oh, hey, do you happen to know

445
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,458
that total cutie-patootie named
Makiyama from our class?

446
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,041
Yeah, I think I do.
Do you mean Kensuke?

447
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,916
[MANANA]
Bitch, you first-namin' me?

448
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,416
Yeah, I thought I heard a rumor

449
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,333
that he has, like, a serious
girlfriend now or whatever.

450
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,958
It's kinda dumb, 'cause...
I was pretty into him

451
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,125
and, you know, uh,
thinking of asking him out.

452
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,291
That's awesome!

453
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,541
But I hope this means

454
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,291
you haven't asked him
out just yet, have you?

455
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,791
Um... no, I haven't.

456
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,666
[YUKI]
Oh, thank goodness!

457
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,625
Since that one would've hurt.

458
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,125
Kensuke only likes pretty girls.

459
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,416
How nice of you to
save me from that!

460
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,875
[MANANA]
Ah, Death Scythe Hosokawa.

461
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,458
You are a piece of work.

462
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,208
--[CHIO] I'm back!
--Part angel, part a-hole.

463
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,458
[MANANA]
I get it now!

464
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,125
If Makiyama only
likes hot girls,

465
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,541
it means I didn't
do anything wrong!

466
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,708
[MANANA] I'm just not his

Hey, Momo.

470
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,750
What do you, uh, smell like?

Or show us.

Mr. G, since you're always

enjoy the natural scent
