Okay, think positive!

No big. I'm here, and
school's not even that far!

Uh, I have plenty of time
to just barely make it!

That's what you call
being a boss assassin!

19
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,375
It took me forever
to get this far!

Ugh, they're still comin'?

Just because I killed
their stupid boss!

23

It's a dead end!

Holy crap!

[CHIO] Huh. I'm being punished
for all-night gaming.

30
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,666
That's fair,
I guess, considering.

31
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,750
But now I'll definitely be
late, and they'll whip me

32
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,166
and make me stand
in front of the class

33
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,208
with the other late-sters!

34

Even if they don't beat me,

35
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,583
everyone will be looking at me,
and that's even worse!

36
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,208
Should I still try to go?

00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,000
Which way? Mm?

38
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,333
[CHIO] I could totally
just climb this pole,

I just need a drain
pipe to slide down.

If I jump into
a crowd of people,

And then just die two
feet closer to the wall.

00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,833
on the telephone pole.

322
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,125
I don't think that
place actually exists.

323
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,500
Or maybe it closed down
right away and I missed it.

324
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,708
But then why would
they still be paying

325
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,916
to advertise a failed business?

326
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,041
Oh, maybe because it's
one of those smaller stores

327
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,541
in a back alley and no one
knows it's shut down.

328
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,625
So now, when some kid
goes to buy school supplies

329
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,458
at his favorite shady stationery
store, he'll be really confused

330
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,791
because everything
around it has changed.

331
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,125
But eventually, he'll find it

332
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,041
boarded up and covered
in out-of-business signs.

333
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,791
He just stands in front of
the shop, tears in his eyes.

334
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,083
Then a sweet old lady
comes out and says...

335
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,416
This little froggy

336
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,375
sure did grow into a
handsome prince, didn't he?

337
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,416
[CHIO]
Stop!

338
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,916
This is not the time
to disassociate!

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,083
What's wrong with me?

340
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,250
Below-average kids
deserve friends, too!

341
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,250
Maybe we won't end up
being best friends,

342
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,500
but I've always
wanted to lean in

343
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,708
and laugh at inside
jokes like this.

344
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,916
I just have to get to school

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,416
without her knowing
how weird I really am.

346
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,458
But, then, even if we have
the appearance of real friends

347
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,375
on the walk, as soon as
we get to class,

348
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,125
she'll be swarmed
by worthy humans

349
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,333
and I'll melt back
into loserville.

350
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,458
Damn it, brain!

351
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,416
Stop being so negative!

352
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,791
[CHIO] When normal people
wanna be friends,

353
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,583
they talk about things
they have in common.

354
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,541
Pretty sure that's not
a thing in this case.

355
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,041
Oh, wait, sports clubs!

356
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,083
Cough, cough.

357
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:56,875
Uh, ya know how you...
you do that club?

358
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,708
I do, too.

359
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,750
[YUKI]
Mm?

360
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,416
[CHIO] What the hell is that
even supposed to mean?

361
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,583
"Do that club"?
How do you do a club?

362
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,625
I meant what do you
do in your club?

363
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,541
"We run."

364
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,750
Oh, neat.

365
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,416
Well, that was a great convo.

366
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,750
[CHIO]
Uh, uh...

367
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,541
[GIRL 1F]
Hey, Yuki! Good morning!

368
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,333
[YUKI]
Oh, hey, you guys!

369
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,958
[CHIO]
Her friends are here!

370
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,958
Angels of Mercy
and Social Anxiety,

371
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,500
I think I'm saved!

372
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,500
At last, she's
completely distracted.

373
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,291
Now's my chance!

374
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,958
SWAT turn!

375
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,375
[NARRATOR]
As you may have guessed,

376
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,708
a SWAT turn is a term
Chio has learned

377
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,166
from one of her many
all-night gaming sessions.

378
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,208
It can only be accessed by
awakening her inner game-brain.

379
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,250
Quite impressive, isn't it?

380
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,375
[lock clicks]

381
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,958
[panting]

382
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,583
I did it. I got away.

383
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,250
Now I just need to
stay calm and quiet

384
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,083
until right before class starts.

385
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,166
[CHIO] Honestly, I'm just
avoiding the inevitable.

386
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,708
Since her real friends
have shown up,

387
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,416
I'll just disappear
in her mind anyway.

388
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,250
[CHIO]
I'm actually doing her a favor.

389
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,041
She doesn't want random
losers hanging around.

390
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,708
I'm like a free sample
you get on the street

391
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,708
that somehow falls
out of your bag.

392
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,000
You don't miss it.

393
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,333
Ah, the comfort and solitude
of a convenience store restroom

394
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,166
is the best-kept secret
of all awkward kids,

395
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,458
and it's totally possible

396
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,333
I might be the most
awkward kid in existence.

397
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,416
[toilet flushing]

398
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,250
[CHIO]
I think it's been long enough.

399
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,041
I know it was risky
to do the SWAT turn

400
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,583
without practicing
it in real life,

401
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,500
but I frickin' nailed it,
play of the day!

402
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,208
Now to continue along
my path of darkness.

403
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,458
Oh, sweet! A new <i>Gaming News.</i>

404
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,208
[CHIO] I'll skip to the new

[CHIO]
Thank you!

407
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,958
About time they came out

408
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,833
with a localized
version of that!

409

[CHIO]

00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,000
[STORE CLERK]
Thank you. Come again.

411
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,166
How are you still here?

412
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,375
I saw you leave in
a swarm of adoration!

413
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,625
You and I never finished
our conversation, silly.

414
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,041

She's lost her mind!

415
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,833
What about your normal friends?

416
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,291
They kept walking.

417
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,833
I suddenly have to pee again!

418
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,166
It's okay!

419
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,791
You don't have to hide it!

420
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,458
Shh.

421
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,083
You have stomach issues, right?

422
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,291
I promise not to say anything.

[CHIO]
I wanna die.

424
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,875
She thinks that's why I was
in the bathroom so long?

425
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,291
And she waited for me,

426
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,208
even though I ran off
without saying anything,

427
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,291
hung out on the toilet forevs,
and read a frickin' magazine!

428
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,833
Why am I the absolute worst?

429
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,958
Are you okay, Miyamo?

430
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,916
Totally fine. Let's go.

00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,000
We have to hurry!

Oh, my gosh, you're right!

What is wrong with me?

436
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,166
I don't deserve friends!

437
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,541
She went out of her
way to be kind,

438
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,750
and all I did was hurl
myself into some garbage

439
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,958
while questioning
her mental state.

440
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,166
I wanna be friends
with her, too!

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,916
So why was I running away?

442
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,083
You better hurry up!

[CHIO]
Oh, no, we're already at school!

I know I completely lost
my chance back there,

but something in me
is still dying to tell her.

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Like, before we get to class.

00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:25,416
Before everyone surrounds her
and we get separated again.

Wait! Hosokawa!

said it earlier,

00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,041
but I just got so nervous!
