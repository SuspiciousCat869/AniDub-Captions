Whaddaya mean
Aoi disappeared?

[KYOUICHI] I'll give you
the details later.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.943
I've already told
Daigo about this.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.071
Hey, listen.
Kozunu's on the move,

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.364
so watch your back, all right.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.657
Did you say Kozunu?!

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.158
Tell me what the hell
is going on here!

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.452
Is Aoi okay?
And what about Kisaragi?

[KYOUICHI] Shut up!

[ANKO] It was just her left

No, it's okay. Bye.

so he won't be able to
come out here and get us.

[TATSUMA] Yeah.

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:46.953
[SAYO] There have
always been a lot of

sweet pea farms
around this area.

Everything is exactly
as how I remember it.

My best memory is how I'd
come out here with my parents.

[TATSUMA]
I know what you mean.

Someday when I'm older,

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.865
I want to have
a farm like this one

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:27.911
and I'm going to grow
lots and lots of sweet peas.

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:29.871
Can I ask you
something, Tatsuma?

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.790
Huh?

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:35.585
[SAYO] When that time comes,
do you think we can...

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:55.814
Hm?

It's all right.

[KYOUICHI] No.

Where in the hell is she?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.760
Don't you know?
Kozunu has her already.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.387
What did you just say?

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.305
What the hell
is going on here?!

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:54.641
Why would he take Aoi when
he could have any of us?

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:56.059
And if you know he's got her,

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.477
then what are you
doing out here?

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.853

she must be stopped!

that I really get it, either.

But he wanted me to get
that nasty thing for him.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.108
Poor thing. Sucks to be you.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.029
You must've thought
you were just moments away

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:16.366
from spooning with your
cute little girlfriend.

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:19.077
I'm afraid that
wasn't meant to be.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.916
Oh, don't cry. It wouldn't
of worked out anyway.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.543
You see, she's dead.

[TENDO] More specifically,
she's a corpse demon.

She's been dead
for quite some time.

[SAYO gasps]

[gasps]

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:22.932
I gave her some extra
time back among the living.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:25.518
She knew it was only
a temporary thing.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.769
There's no blood in her veins,

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.397
and her flesh is rotting
right off her bones.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:31.316
And she brought you to me

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:34.194
[TENDO] so she could get her
pathetic little life back.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.945
He told me...

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:39.073
he he'd bring my mom
and dad back to life.

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.534
He told me that he would
bring everybody back.

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.454
That's why... That's why...

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.916
[SAYO] I'm sorry...

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.792
I'm so sorry!

Huh?

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.504
Huh?

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.139
[TATSUMA]
I've known all along.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.854
Now this is why
I just don't like you.

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:12.232
Nothing I say fazes you.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:15.318
[TENDO] That poker face of
yours makes me wanna puke.

[KOMAKI grunts]
[YUUYA groans]

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.034
[TENDO] Well, let me
tell you something:

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.411
your little girlfriend
belongs to me.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.871
And right about now,
your friends

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:28.206
should be mine as well...

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.499
Not Misato!

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.625
[TENDO] There you go.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.002
Now that's the expression
I wanted to see.

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:35.630
My intension was to have
this girl keep tabs on you,

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:38.967
but she also kept you away
from the girl I wanted.

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:41.552
A delightful show,
my pretty thing.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.845
Uh.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:46.099
[TENDO] Now you're
the only loose end left.

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:54.440
[TATSUMA groans]

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:57.026
So why don't you just tell
me who the hell you are?

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.320
You're on my last nerves,
you little shit.

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:01.447
You will tell me the truth.

[groaning]

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.827
Because you'll see,
my quiet friend,

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:08.705
I will get the truth
with or without your help.

Manabu... How could you...?

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.908
[TENDO] You're wrong!
You're wrong...

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.744
I am Kozunu!

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:33.706
I am Tendo Kozunu!

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.425
I get it.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.969
Now I understand why
I was so concerned

00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:49.263
about you all this time.

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:50.932
[TENDO] Because you...

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.017
Because your people
are the ones...

Die!

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.493
[yells]

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:17.917
[TATSUMA yelling]

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.211
[laughs]

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.963
I am just so grateful
that we were fated

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:23.714
to run into each other
here and now,

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.842
aren't you, old friend?

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:28.553
[TATSUMA groaning]

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:40.940
[TATSUMA continues groaning]

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:43.818
[SAYO] Stop it!

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.195
Please, don't do this!
I'm begging you.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.614
You can do whatever you want
to me, but please just...

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:49.949
[SAYO] leave him alone!

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:51.409
[TENDO chuckles]

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:58.082
[SAYO gasping]

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.087
[SAYO groaning]

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.755
[TENDO laughs]

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.175
If you've really gotten
to like him that much then

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:10.136
why don't you go to
the other side together?

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.429
[SAYO sobs]

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.182
[groaning]

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:17.685
Don't look.
Please don't look at me!

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.939
This is where the story ends.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.193
Uh! You little--!

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.986
[SAYO screams]

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:34.869
[monsterous screams]

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.246
The balance between the sun
and moon has been altered....

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.540
What have you done,
you stupid little bitch?!

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.292
[SAYO] Uah!

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.588
Sayo, no!

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.761
Tatsuma...

00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:01.354
[SAYO] Tatsuma...
The sweet peas...

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:04.565
let's... let's both...

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:18.871
Try to focus your minds.

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:19.789
[grunts]

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.290
[KISARAGI]
Don't listen to their song.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.959
They're chanting a curse!

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.221
[gasps]

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:46.232
Someone doesn't
know when to die.

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.404
Kozunu...

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:55.074
[TATSUMA] Kozunu Tendo!

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.002
[TENDO grunts]

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.461
[TATSUMA yells]

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.969
[TENDO] You! Because
of you! You're the one!

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:19.223
Because of you, the Kozunu
family... my mother...!

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:25.730
You killed her.
You killed my mother!

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.235
[TENDO]
Give my mother back to me.

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.322
Give my mother...

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:36.741
[TENDO] back to me!

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:40.953
[yells]

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.174
[snickers]

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.141
[exhales]

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.022
[YUUYA] Sakurai, no!

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.650
Sakurai! Sakurai...!

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:11.901
[KISARAGI chanting]

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:13.527
Just hang in there!

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:17.698
[YUUYA and KOMAKI groaning]
[KISARAGI continues chanting]

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.783
[YUUYA groans]

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:21.494
[KIRASAGI] Even the
Netherworld Hymn is of no use.

00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:24.830
Is this of the
Bodhisattva Eye's power?

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.957
[KOMAKI] Aoi!

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.379
[CLAIRE] Hmm. Come on.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.215
Hurry up and
finish this already?

00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:35.383
Huh?

00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:42.973
[chanting]

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.143
[grunts]

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:47.895
[YUUYA] Hey.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:48.938
Tell us who you are.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:49.980
Is that...?

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.149
[YUUYA] It's Raito Uhmon!

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:55.361
I see you guys are
goofing off as usual.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:56.987
How's it goin', short 'n ugly?

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.698
I'm surprised you're
out this late, kid.

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:00.366
It's way past your bedtime!

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:03.160
[CLAIRE]
Why you... Why you...

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.662
bed-head freak!

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.209
Wow. Well that wasn't
too shabby there...

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.627
short 'n ugly.

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:14.964
Uh! One more of you
doesn't make any diff--uh!

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.886
[BOTH coughing]

00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:22.304
[KOMAKI] What's going on?!

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:23.931
I hate the smell of incense.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:26.016
[HINANO] Lady Komaki!

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:28.644
I think you should kindly
withdraw from this place.

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:32.398
Hinano? What...
are you doing here?

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.858
[CLAIRE] Ew...!

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:37.570
It stinks! Kill them,
Bodhisattva Eye!

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.745
You're here too, Yukino?!

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.788
It'll be all right,
we'll get you out quickly!

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.956
But we--

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.499
[RAITO yells]

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:52.626
[grunts]

00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:02.011
Oh... poopy pants,
they ran away.

00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:05.097
I bet it was that
scary face you're making.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:16.901
[distant engine running]

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.944
[tires screeching]

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.572
[KYOUICHI] Hey, Tatsuma!

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:41.217
[TENDO laughs intensely]

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.636
[KYOUICHI] What the hell?

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:45.763
Hey, Tatsuma?

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.973
I-I couldn't protect her...

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:49.475
What's that?

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:50.643
[TATSUMA exhales]

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:53.813
Huh. Hey! Tatsuma!

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:56.106
[KYOUICHI] Hey, Tatsuma!

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:58.192
Damnit... Just hang tight.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.820
We'll get you over
that old bag's place!

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.992
[AZUMABASHI] Hm. Can the
bike carry three people?
