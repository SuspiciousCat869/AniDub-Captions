00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:06.781
Die!

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.493
[yells]

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:17.917
[TATSUMA yelling]

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.211
[laughs]

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.963
I am just so grateful
that we were fated

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:23.714
to run into each other
here and now,

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.842
aren't you, old friend?

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:28.553
[TATSUMA groaning]

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:40.940
[TATSUMA continues groaning]

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:43.818
[SAYO] Stop it!

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.195
Please, don't do this!
I'm begging you.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.614
You can do whatever you want
to me, but please just...

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:49.949
[SAYO] leave him alone!

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:51.409
[TENDO chuckles]

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:58.082
[SAYO gasping]

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.087
[SAYO groaning]

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.755
[TENDO laughs]

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.175
If you've really gotten
to like him that much then

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:10.136
why don't you go to
the other side together?

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.429
[SAYO sobs]

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.182
[groaning]

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:17.685
Don't look.
Please don't look at me!

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.939
This is where the story ends.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.193
Uh! You little--!

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.986
[SAYO screams]

00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:34.869
[monsterous screams]

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.246
The balance between the sun
and moon has been altered....

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.540
What have you done,
you stupid little bitch?!

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.292
[SAYO] Uah!

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.588
Sayo, no!

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.761
Tatsuma...

00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:01.354
[SAYO] Tatsuma...
The sweet peas...

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:04.565
let's... let's both...

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:18.871
Try to focus your minds.

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:19.789
[grunts]

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.290
[KISARAGI]
Don't listen to their song.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.959
They're chanting a curse!

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.221
[gasps]

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:46.232
Someone doesn't
know when to die.

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.404
Kozunu...

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:55.074
[TATSUMA] Kozunu Tendo!

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.002
[TENDO grunts]

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.461
[TATSUMA yells]

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.969
[TENDO] You! Because
of you! You're the one!

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:19.223
Because of you, the Kozunu
family... my mother...!

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:25.730
You killed her.
You killed my mother!

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.235
[TENDO]
Give my mother back to me.

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.322
Give my mother...

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:36.741
[TENDO] back to me!

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:40.953
[yells]

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.174
[snickers]

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.141
[exhales]

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.022
[YUUYA] Sakurai, no!

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.650
Sakurai! Sakurai...!

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:11.901
[KISARAGI chanting]

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:13.527
Just hang in there!

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:17.698
[YUUYA and KOMAKI groaning]
[KISARAGI continues chanting]

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.783
[YUUYA groans]

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:21.494
[KIRASAGI] Even the
Netherworld Hymn is of no use.

00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:24.830
Is this of the
Bodhisattva Eye's power?

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.957
[KOMAKI] Aoi!

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.379
[CLAIRE] Hmm. Come on.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.215
Hurry up and
finish this already?

00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:35.383
Huh?

00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:42.973
[chanting]

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.143
[grunts]

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:47.895
[YUUYA] Hey.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:48.938
Tell us who you are.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:49.980
Is that...?

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.149
[YUUYA] It's Raito Uhmon!

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:55.361
I see you guys are
goofing off as usual.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:56.987
How's it goin', short 'n ugly?

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.698
I'm surprised you're
out this late, kid.

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:00.366
It's way past your bedtime!

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:03.160
[CLAIRE]
Why you... Why you...

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.662
bed-head freak!

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.209
Wow. Well that wasn't
too shabby there...

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.627
short 'n ugly.

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:14.964
Uh! One more of you
doesn't make any diff--uh!

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.886
[BOTH coughing]

00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:22.304
[KOMAKI] What's going on?!

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:23.931
I hate the smell of incense.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:26.016
[HINANO] Lady Komaki!

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:28.644
I think you should kindly
withdraw from this place.

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:32.398
Hinano? What...
are you doing here?

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.858
[CLAIRE] Ew...!

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:37.570
It stinks! Kill them,
Bodhisattva Eye!

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.745
You're here too, Yukino?!

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.788
It'll be all right,
we'll get you out quickly!

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.956
But we--

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.499
[RAITO yells]

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:52.626
[grunts]

00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:02.011
Oh... poopy pants,
they ran away.

00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:05.097
I bet it was that
scary face you're making.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:16.901
[distant engine running]

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.944
[tires screeching]

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.572
[KYOUICHI] Hey, Tatsuma!

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:41.217
[TENDO laughs intensely]

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.636
[KYOUICHI] What the hell?

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:45.763
Hey, Tatsuma?

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.973
I-I couldn't protect her...

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:49.475
What's that?

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:50.643
[TATSUMA exhales]

00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:53.813
Huh. Hey! Tatsuma!

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:56.106
[KYOUICHI] Hey, Tatsuma!

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:58.192
Damnit... Just hang tight.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.820
We'll get you over
that old bag's place!

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.992
[AZUMABASHI] Hm. Can the
bike carry three people?
