[ANSWERING MACHINE] We are
not available to take your call.

Please leave a message
after the tone.

[machine beeps]

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:15.302
[AOI ON MACHINE] Hisui?
This is Aoi. Where are you?

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:16.803
Are you all right?

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:28.607
[AOI'S MOTHER] Thank you
very much, Mr. Kisaragi.

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.359
Oh, my, and who is this?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.153
This is my grandson, Hisui.

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:36.198
I brought him along
to introduce him to you.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.491
[AOI]
Mom?

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:46.667
[AOI'S MOM] Ah, you're just in
time. Introduce yourself, Aoi.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.835
[AOI]
Sure, mom.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.797
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Aoi Misato.

Aoi!

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.640
Good morning, Aoi!

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.225
Good morning.

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:06.019
Huh... How are you doing?
Is everything okay?

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.813
You seem a little down...

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.523
Oh, no... I'm alright.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.733
[KOMAKI] It's nice to know that
even you get a little depressed

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.735
at the beginning of a new term.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.404
I'm really disappointed
that we didn't get to hang

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.572
out at all
over the summer break.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.200
But we get to spend time
together here at school.

[GRANDFATHER] Mrs. Misato,
please accept my apologies.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.996
You clumsy child!

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:08.540
[AOI'S MOTHER] Please,
Mr. Kisaragi, it's all right!

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.459
Everyone makes mistakes.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.711
I believe you, yourself
have said that we grow

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.713
through our mistakes.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.883
[GRANDFATHER]
Of course... Hisui,

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:21.970
apologize again to Mrs. Misato!

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:25.474
[KISARAGI] I'm really sorry...
Mrs. Misato.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:38.653
[MARIA] All right, Miss Misato,
read this section. Miss Misato?

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.530
Y-Yes?

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.784
[MARIA] Starting from the sixth
line on page 25, please.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.920
Come on. Let's go, Hisui!

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.677
[KYOICHI] What's the matter,
Miss Honor Student?

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.346
What's up with the
staring off into space

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.431
and not taking any notes?

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.266
[TATSUMA] You're no where
near as bad as Kyoichi.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.142
[KYOICHI]
Huh?

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.561
Will you look at this,
well now, here's something

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.063
you don't see every day.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.816
Mr. Horaiji and Miss Misato
chatting during school hours?

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.693
Did something happen
over summer vacation?

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.321
Hah! With "Snooty-Little-Miss
Student-Council"?

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:24.741
[KYOICHI] Actually,
I prefer more mature women.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.409
So whaddya say, Maria, Sweetie?

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:27.994
Wanna hang out
with me some time?

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.372
[MARIA] Well, you haven't handed
in your summer homework yet,

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.748
have you? So how about we

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.375
"hang" out for some remedial
work after school?

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.836
[KYOICHI] W-What?
Sorry, I can't hear you!

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:36.711
[MARIA]
Remedial work.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.213

This is my secret place.

in trouble for tearing

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.742
one of my father's scrolls.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.160
[KISARAGI]
Huh?

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.747
[AOI] I know
exactly how you feel.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.792
Here.

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:50.911
[GRANDFATHER] Hisui, as
members of the Kisaragi family,

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:54.497
we have a very
important obligation.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.961
Our family has served the
Misato family through the ages,

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:03.423
and have also served to protect
this city of Tokyo,

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:06.676
since as far back
as the Edo period.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:10.931
I have told you this many times
and you must always remember.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:11.932
[KISARAGI]
Yes, sir.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:16.853
Hisui, listen to me carefully.
It is about time that you also

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:22.400
learned of our family's "other"
mission, which we must uphold!

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:28.925
Hisui, I heard...
about your grandfather.

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:34.931
You're worried, too, huh?

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.060
Oh, that's right. My mom told me
that we just got some really

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.938
good fruit from the market.
I'll go get some for you.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.940
[KISARAGI]
You needn't trouble yourself.

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.109
[AOI]
Just wait right there.

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.158
[KISARAGI]
Lady Misato...

00:08:56.161 --> 00:09:00.165
To think that those creatures
had been revived...

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:11.134
[TENDO] God of Kotoshiro, god of
Naohi, god of Furumita...

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:14.554
Come now to those who serve and
venerate you in this shrine;

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.682
we implore you, hasten,
heal our ills...

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.645
I have now taken it on...

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.356
I've taken on
all your resentment!

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.817
[KOMAKI]
What? Kisaragi?

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:10.693
[AOI] Yeah... And the
shop has had its shutters

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.779
closed the whole time.

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:15.907
[KYOICHI] Shit...
what the hell is he up to?

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.992

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.327
[KYOICHI]
Huh?

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.955
[TATSUMA]
We're in for a storm.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:25.125
[ANKO] Are you sensing
something troubling?

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.502
[KYOICHI]
That voice...

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.340
Well, you needn't worry, now
that the Kyoko Tono is here!

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.008
Look, the latest digital camera!

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:34.926
With this, I can...

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:36.302
Who asked you to come?

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:37.720
Simply awful!

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:39.472
Is this any way to
treat the newest member

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.057
of the Demonbuster Club?!

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.642
Demonbuster Club?

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.477
[KYOICHI]
This ain't no damn school club!

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.813
[GIRL]
Hey, who's that?

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.565
[GIRL'S FRIEND]
Huh? Where?

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:50.150
[STUDENT] Wow, he looks
like a model or something!

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:53.069
[GIRL'S FRIEND]
He's totally yummy!

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.363
Who's that?...

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.366
[ANKO]
The antique guy!

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:00.660
It's Hisui!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.083
How does he keep going?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.921
These are from Hokkaido.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.846
[car idling]

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:22.557
[AOI] Oh my god, Hisui,
what happened to you?

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:24.851
[YUUYA] Hey!
How about saying something?

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.063
[TATSUMA]
Kisaragi, you're wounded.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.690
[YUUYA AND KOMAKI]
Huh?

00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:34.360
[KYOICHI] Wake up.
Stay with us, Tatsuma.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:35.612
Uh, Hisui...

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.113
[KYOICHI] Please don't
tell us that you fell down

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.365
a flight of stairs.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.914
[KISARAGI] I thought the chain
of all the strange incidents

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.916
that have occurred had
been due to some disturbance

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:51.753
in the Dragon Stream...
But I was wrong.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.838
Someone has been deliberately
causing these events

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.174
by practicing the Dark Arts.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.134
[KOMAKI]
The Dark Arts...

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:01.429
[YUUYA] That's right. "Crow Boy"
said something about that?

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:04.557
[KISARAGI] "Dark Arts" is a
general term to denote sorcery,

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.935
which lies in opposition
of all that is righteous:

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.812
religion, heaven, humanity,
and the Earth itself.

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:12.023
There is something
known as the Demoniacal Art,

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:15.109
the path of the demonic, which
is one of the Dark Arts.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.779
The Demoniacal Art is a
dreadful form of sorcery,

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.614
which is used to awaken
the souls of the dead

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.616
and summon demons.

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:24.035
There was a certain clan who
used the Demoniacal Art to

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.454
incite a rebellion
against the Tokugawa

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.373
in the last days
of the shogunate.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.751
[KYOICHI] "Shogunate"?
What era was that again?

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:34.295
The Kurama Tengu era, right?

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.714
...Tengu? Those aren't demons!

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.217
[KOMAKI] You're thinking
about the TV show, you idiot!

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:42.887
[KISARAGI] I don't know
their reason for revolting,

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.889
but it is said that
this clan augmented their power

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:49.018
through the Demoniacal Arts,
summoning demons using the

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:54.565
souls of those who died with a
grudge against the Tokugawa.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:13:00.905
They called themselves...
the Demoniacal Horde.

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.865
What?

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:07.078
It appears as if something
fun is about to start.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.621
[YUUYA]
What does this mean?

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:12.375
The Demoniacal Horde
has been revived.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.961
[TENDO] Now all we need
is the bodhisattva eye.

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:17.005
[CLAIRE]
Bo-dhi-satt-va eye?

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.341
[KISARAGI] If the Demoniacal
Horde has been revived,

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.176
then it's most likely
that their head family,

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:23.886
the Kozunu clan
too has revived.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.848
[KYOICHI]
They're like the head of a gang?

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:27.974
[KISARAGI]
Correct.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:31.728
They're trying to wreak havoc
upon this world once again.

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:35.356
By using the darkness in
people's hearts...

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.319
What? They're still pissed over
the end of the shogunate?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.446
Talk about a fuckin' grudge!

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.208
[AOI]
Hisui?

00:13:54.876 --> 00:14:00.423
[KISARAGI] I... I will
fight the Demoniacal Horde!

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.717
This obligation is
my soul duty as a member

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.927
of the Kisaragi family.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.305
Even if I am alone,
I must fight...

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:09.599
...even if it means my death.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:15.313
But you do not have to do this.
You have no reason to fight.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:17.774
If you feel a need to withdraw
from this, I will not hold it

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:21.903
against you.
It is not too late.

00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.238
Now that we know we're up
against the Demoniacal Horde,

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.075
I cannot guarantee
you're safety.

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:30.203
Is that acceptable to you?
Are you prepared to lay down

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:33.081
your life for all this?

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.752
[AOI]
I'll fight too.

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:40.129
I will fight.

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:44.675
[KOMAKI]
Me, too.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.056
Komaki!

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:54.811
[KYOICHI] What, you're
still all worried about that?

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:56.270
Hey, Dungeon Master-

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:57.397
[KISARAGI]
What?

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.065
[KYOICHI] So basically
if we take out all these

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:01.234
Kozunu assholes, that be it?

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:03.027
Then there won't be anymore
people turning into demons

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:04.529
and monsters, right?

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.031
[KISARAGI]
Yes, that's right.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.700
Hey there, Captain,
get all that?

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.013
[KISARAGI]
Lady Masato?

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:33.224
Is something wrong?

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:36.727
[AOI] Oh, I'm sorry,
my mind was just wandering...

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:40.106
I was thinking about
something from long ago.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:44.193
That time you and I snuck away
to see the fireflies?

00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:52.785
They're such nice memories...

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:58.916
Lady Masato. Please forgive me.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.628
I shall protect
you without fail.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.338
Oh, Hisui...

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.016
[YUUYA]
Whoa. This place is...

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:16.684
[KOMAKI]
Amazing.

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.102
[KYOICHI]
It's a bit dreary.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.730
[KISARAGI] These are the sacred
grounds of the Kisaragi family.

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.773
Those who would trespass
upon it shall be cursed.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.358
[KOMAKI]
Huh...

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.235
[KISARAGI]
Just a silly legend.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.029
We had reason to make sure
people kept their distance

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.656
from this place.

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:35.036
[KISARAGI]
Just a silly legend.

00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:38.247
[TATSUMA]
You don't sound like him.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.171
[KISARAGI]
I knew it.

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.547
[AOI]
Hisui!

00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:00.019
[KYOICHI] So, is that
the shogunate bastards.

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.146
[YUUYA] I knew it.
It's the ones from before.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.940
[KOMAKI]
It's those two again.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.945
[TATSUMA]
The Demoniacal Horde...

00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:12.615
[TENDO] So, you've finally come.
I've been waiting for you.

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.369
The Demoniac Verses.

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:19.539
It is a collection of dark
spells used to summon demons.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.832
My clan had sealed it away,
it appears as if...

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.168
[YUUYA]
You guys no longer have it?

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.254
[KOMAKI] And you came
here to be double check.

00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:28.673
[KYOICHI] For cryin' out loud...
keep your valuables in a safe

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:29.507
or something!

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.175
Y'know?

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:36.138
[TENDO] A simple barrier
like this can't keep me out.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.891
I have thus been able
to revive the Demoniacal Horde

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:40.601
without trouble.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.980
Thank you so very much,
Kisaragi descendant.

00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:50.027
[KISARAGI] You bastard...
Tell me your name?!

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:55.700
Kozunu...
Tendo Kozunu.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:59.328
Tendo...
Kozunu...

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.872
[TENDO]
Kill them.

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:22.602
[screaming]

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:25.229
[KYOICHI]
Shut the hell up!

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.439
[KISARAGI]
No... This is...

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.357
Ah!!

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.028
Aoi!

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.448
[KOMAKI] What...
What is this?!

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.034
Stop it!

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:41.829
[KYOICHI]
Damn it.

00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:55.926
Are you my enemies?!

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.388
[KISARAGI] I, Hisui Kisaragi,
shall not make the same

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.515
mistake twice!

00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:07.355
[all screaming]

00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:17.615
[KYOICHI]
Shit!

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.450
[TATSUMA]
Kyoichi!

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:23.079
[TENDO]
Not bad!

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.123
So tell me, where is it?

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:29.251
I found the Demoniac Verses
easy enough...

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:32.296
but I haven't had the same luck
with the "other" thing.

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:34.590
Come, tell me.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:38.427
That's the only reason
I let you live before.

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:50.606
You know what they say,
what goes around comes around.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:54.777
[TENDO] Now then,
what to do, what to do...

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.987
I've grown weary of you.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:20:01.492
Guess I'll have to kill you all,
and look for it at my own pace.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:03.828
[KISARAGI]
Lady Misato...

00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:15.965
What are you...
looking at?

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.719
I don't care for
the look in your eyes.

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:36.193
What was that?!

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:39.447
[CLAIRE]
Boooring...

00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:43.451
You all get out of here!

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:54.920
[TENDO] Sealed in a tube? That
explains why I couldn't find it!

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:58.466
In any case,
that is what I need.

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:01.510
The Eight-Hands-Breadth Sword...

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:05.890
What do you plan to do
with the ten sacred treasures?

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:12.146
[yawns]

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:23.657
Not again...

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:28.996
[CLAIRE] This dress was a gift
from a very special person!

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:34.210
You shall all die!

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:37.546
[people screaming]

00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:50.518
[YUUYA] You knew they'd come.
Didn't you, Kisaragi?

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.727
[KISARAGI]
Yes.

00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:54.855
[KOMAKI] Huh?! Then you knew we
could have been killed?!

00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:56.649
[KYOICHI]
Get a grip, Sakurai!

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.067
[KOMAKI]
But...

00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:00.694
If we couldn't handle what just
happened, then we'd be no match

00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:03.405
for the Demoniacal Horde, right?

00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:06.116
So then this
was all a test, huh?

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.327
I had to make sure.

00:22:08.369 --> 00:22:10.412
Pft, that's nice.

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:11.789
Komaki?

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:12.706
Hmm.

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:15.751
[KISARAGI] The five of you
did a good job tonight.

00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:18.629
So I'll treat
you guys to dinner.

00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:20.631
I recall you mentioning your
favorite ramen establishment

00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.174
was around here somewhere?

00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:23.801
[KYOICHI] Hey, now you're
speaking my language,

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:25.219
Dungeon Master!

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:27.304
Okay, I'll have a
large miso battered kimchi

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.514
roasted pork ramen!

00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:29.557
[KISARAGI]
I'm not paying for yours.

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:30.683
[KYOICHI]
What?! But you...

00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:31.600
[KISARAGI]
Not paying.

00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:32.601
[KYOICHI]
You just said...!

00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:34.353
[KISARAGI]
Not for you!

00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:39.233
[RYUZAN]
The time has come.
