Please, don't do it!

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:23.106

Stop!

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:29.321
No, please don't do it...

No, don't!

Please help us.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.070
Until recently, a viral agent
has been the suspected cause

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:17.614
behind a string of incidents in
which have left some high school

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:19.866
students in a comatose state.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.952
[NEWS ANCHOR] But, according
to some new information

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.078
we just received,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.580
all of the victims of this
strange affliction, apparently

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:28.583
all went to the same private
middle school in Tokyo.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.420
Authorities are now questioning
the faculty and staff members of

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.839
the private middle school.
As well as, focusing their

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.383
investigation on previous
interactions the victims

00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:38.385
might have had with one another.

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:48.061
[YUUYA] Is this that crazy
"spiritual healing" stuff?

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.981
Yeah. But after seeing demons
and all that other crazy shit,

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:54.109
we should be the last
people to doubt her powers.

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:01.408
It appears that your friend has
had her consciousness imprisoned

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.454
in someone else's mindscape.
Someone with considerable power.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.788
Mindscape?

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.749
[IWAYAMA]
Very powerful mental powers.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.333
This person seems
to have an extremely

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.586
strong hold on your friend.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.337
[KYOICHI] That sure doesn't
sound like you're average person

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.298
off the streets, huh?

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.175
[YUUYA]
Which means...

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.886
[TATSUMA]
It's someone who has the Power.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:23.930
Who the hell would do this?

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.601
[IWAYAMA] In any case, if she
remains in this comatose state,

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.728
her body will break down and
she will die.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.438
Her life is in danger.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.733
Come on, you can do something,
can't you?! I mean, I believe

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:38.528
that's why we came to this
freakshow of a hospital!

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.698
[IWAYAMA] Well! Seems you've
learned to use that mouth

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.409
of yours quite well.
I remember a certain little

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:47.829
brat, who used to come to
me whining and crying.

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.707
No need to bring up
stupid stuff from the past!

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.335
[IWAYAMA] Alright, settle down,
the important thing right now is

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:56.755
for you to find out how to save
your friend, is that right?

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:58.673
Unfortunately, all
we can do right now

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.842
is provide
emergency treatment.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.552
So, what do you mean?

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.888
The only thing I can do is to
attempt to stop the other

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.183
person's thoughts from fully
imprisoning her consciousness.

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:10.268
[IWAYAMA] To save her,
you'll have to find whoever

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.105
is behind this and stop
that person yourselves.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.441
And you'll want to do that
as quickly as possible.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:19.611
What if this person
really does have the Power?

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.613
We have to
stop whoever this is,

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.156
even if it means
we have to kill 'em.

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.617
[KOMAKI] But at
this rate, Aoi could...

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.537
Hey, have you been able to get
ahold of Kisaragi yet?

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.413
[KOMAKI] I've
called him a dozen times!

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.499
Where the hell could
he be at a time like this?

[MAIKO]
Look! A doggie...

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.466
It was just there in front of
the hospital.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:24.718
[KYOICHI]
Huh? A dog?

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.678
[IWAYAMA]
Oh, don't mind her.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.973
Maiko sees all sorts of
spirits and other things.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.309
Do you mean,
like, ghosts and stuff?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.728
[MAIKO]
Mmmhmm.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:43.653
I sense that he really wants to
see her pretty badly.

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.575
[ANKO]
Hmmm...

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:51.870
In the city... a baffling string
of unexplained comas...

[ANKO] Hello, I'm with

Alumni Association.

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:22.442
In fact, I'm a
graduate of Kagura myself...

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.736
I was hoping to ask you a
couple of questions about our

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.154
old middle school days.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:27.489
[ANKO'S MOM] Kyoko!
Where do you think you're

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.990
going at this hour
of the night?!

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.784
[ANKO] I'm going
out for a walk, Mom!

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.036
[phone ringing]

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:39.417
[KOMAKI] Anko?
Aoi's is still unconscious.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.753
We're at the hospital right now.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.464
Huh? What?

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.803
[YUUYA] So... Anko said
to meet her in Tsukimidai

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.221
as soon as possible.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.764
[KOMAKI] She didn't tell
me any details, but she said

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.976
it's got something to do with
what's going on with Aoi.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:59.312
I want to find
out what's going on.

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.772
[KYOICHI] No worries!
Princess will be fine as long

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.358
as The Old Lady
watching over her!

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.954
[IWAYAMA] We must make sure
this holds until they find

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:18.623
the location
of the spell caster.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.291
[MAIKO]
Right!

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.840
This is the guy! This is
the guy who's responsible

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.300
for putting Aoi in a coma!

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.095
Uh... Who's he?

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.931
[ANKO] Reiji Sagaya. He's the
one who's behind all those

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.434
high school students
falling into comas!

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.686
[YUUYA] H-How do
you know all this?!

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.397
[condescending laugh]

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:50.822
[ANKO] I am the soon-to-be
journalist phenom... Kyoko Tono.

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:54.868
When it comes to
students in the Tokyo area,

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:58.955
I know all about them!
I know their test scores,

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.999
I know everything
from what's in your lunch,

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.709
right down to the
holes in your socks!

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.086
What?...Really?! Wow.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.094
[ANKO] All of the students
who've fallen into comas

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.930
were bullies from Kagura
Middle School.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:19.184
And their main target of their
bullying was Reiji Sagaya.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.561
Rumor has it that they were
pretty mean and ruthless

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:25.899
with him. It's surprising that
none of this was discovered.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.236
[groans]

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.587

[muffled screaming]

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.656
[ANKO] Sagaya hasn't set
foot outside his house

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.199
since middle school.

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:19.536
But, since last spring,
rumor has been going around,

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.996
among the guys who
used to bully Sagaya,

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.289
that he's going
to come after each and

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.626
every one of them and get
even... in their dreams!

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.545
His parents even treat
him like some kind of monster

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.839
or something.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.632
[KYOICHI]
This past spring?

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.342
In their dreams, huh?

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:37.720
If he really is another person
with this Power we all have what

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:40.014
you're saying can really happen.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.725
But why is he after Aoi?
Why is he involving Aoi

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.103
and making her go
through all this?

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:48.523
[ANKO] I don't know...
But, Aoi also went to

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.316
Ka-gu-ra Middle School!

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.735
There's gotta be
some kind of connection.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:54.737
[KYOICHI] Okay, then we have
to find out where he lives!

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.531
[ANKO]
Hold one second!

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:58.992
Why do you think
I've called you all here?

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:04.789
This is where he
lives! Unit #504.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:05.832
Thank you, Anko.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.458
Alright, let's do it!

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.257
[KOMAKI]
Kyoko...

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:15.717
I'm sorry.

00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:18.553
I thought you...

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.849
No need to say it, I know!
Even if it would be the scoop

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.976
of the century,
your secret's safe with me,

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.937
so don't worry, okay!

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.689
[KOMAKI]
Huh?

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.984
A secret team of
justice fighters battling

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.111
the forces of evil,
now that's hot!

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.779
Do you think I'd let
anyone else in on that?

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.698
From now on,
I'm going to devote my time

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.575
to covering your story.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.536
Don't worry! No one will know
it's you guys! But in return,

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:47.749
I get exclusive rights on the
story. You see, Komaki,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.587
I do remember how all of you
guys saved me that night.

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:58.635
When Aoi regains consciousness,
tell her I'm sorry, okay?

00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:01.304
It's not that I was afraid of
you guys. I was just a little

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.723
thrown off
guard, that's all.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:06.184
[ANKO]
Tell her I said sorry.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.811
If that's how you feel,
why not tell her yourself?

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:11.689
We're going to
protect Aoi no matter what!

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.486
Keep an eye on her
while we're gone, okay?

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.865
Leave it to me!

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:31.125
There was no reason.
They simply enjoyed watching

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:37.632
me suffer over and over.
I was a toy to them.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:45.348
[SAGAYA] But then you,
you appeared one day.

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.615
[SAGAYA]
Please stop!

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:04.575
[BULLY] I hear that you
and Aoi Misato have been

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.703
feeding this mutt.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.748
Yeah, who do you think you are
hanging around girls?

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.959
[SAGAYA]
No! Don't!

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.421
No! Don't!

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.506
[SAGAYA] It's been
three years since then

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:20.216
and not a single day went by

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:25.930
when I didn't think of them.
Then one day, I got my chance.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:29.267
[strained groaning]

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:33.730
You were the only
one who was different.

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.524
Aoi, I will
always protect you.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.611
Let's stay here
together in this world.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:14:00.298
Aoi... Why won't you
please open your eyes?

00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:08.431
I get it. There's someone
holding you to that other world,

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:09.974
isn't there?

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:13.978
[SAGAYA]
Let's go, Tiny.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:28.034
Oh, come on.
It was just getting good.

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:44.342
[KISARAGI] Just as I thought,
all the seals have been broken.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:55.937
[EVIL MALE MASK] You...
are a Kisaragi descendent?

00:14:57.647 --> 00:15:00.233
[IWAYAMA] O-in-shi-chi-ri
kya-ra-ro ha-u-un-ken so-wa-ka,

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.692
O-in-shi-chi-ri kya-ra-ro
ha-u-un-ken so-wa-ka,

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:06.030
--Aoi... please hang on!
--ha-u-un-ken so-wa-ka.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.206
Breaking the barrier
and getting in the perimeter

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.791
is quite impressive.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:20.294
The doggie looks a little
different from earlier.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.928
I won't hold back on anyone who
tries to take Aoi away from me.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.847
A vengeful spirit?

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:33.182
What powerful hatred.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.191
[TATSIMA]
It's okay, he's alive.

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.568
[KOMAKI]
This woman is okay, too.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:46.279
It's as if they're sleeping.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.865
[KYOICHI] I've got
a bad feeling about this.

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:50.950
[YUUYA]
He might be in there?

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:54.287
[TATSUMA]
What's that?

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:04.881
[SAGAYA]
Someone's getting too nosey.

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:07.592
Tiny, you take care of this.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:11.804
It appears that our young
friends have located the body.

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:16.851
[SAGAYA]
Welcome to My Dream World.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:25.776
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:27.653
Let go!

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:29.238
Aoi!

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.823
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:34.118
[SAGAYA] I'm sorry, but Aoi is
mine. I won't hand her over

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.078
to just anyone.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.747
You bastard!

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:40.291
Newsflash, asshole
she doesn't belong to you.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.919
So get your hands
off her, freak!

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:47.840
You have no idea what you've
got yourselves into, do you?

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:51.260
[SAGAYA] If you die in this
world you die in the real world.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.721
And the four of you will die.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:56.682
[reverberating footsteps]

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:00.061
[KYOICHI]
Wh-What in the hell?

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.108
[all scream]

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.906
[IWAYAMA] Oinshichiri
kyararo hauunken sowaka,

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:13.616
Oinshichiri kyara...

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:15.076
[ANKO]
Aoi!

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:18.496
[Inwayama screams]

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.418
[ANKO] Let me tell you
something about journalists:

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.671
We'll risk our lives anytime.

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.467
and I'll never give
Aoi over to you!

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.600
Daigo, Sakurai...
you guys alright?

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.311
[YUUYA]
Yeah! We're okay!

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:53.197
Hey guys! This is just a dream!
Focus your minds!

00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:00.329
N-No way! This is my dream!

00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:03.332
[KYOICHI] Too bad for you,
we're pretty "strong minded."

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:07.712
So we're not gonna fall
for your little freak show.

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.215
[IWAYAMA]
Takamizawa!

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.686
[MAIKO]
Please... stop this!

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:41.245
You were very sad, weren't
you? And full of so much pain.

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:10.608
Fu-ru-be, yu-ra-yu-ra...

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:21.786
You're free now.
You mustn't let the hatred

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.621
within you hold you forever.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:27.249
Understand?
Now return to your true self.

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:30.419
[MAIKO] Go and save the
people who are dear to you.

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:32.922
[IWAYAMA] Release this
departed soul, begone.

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.341
Release this
departed soul, begone.

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:40.346
Release this
departed soul, begone. Now.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:02.743
If they keep coming back like
this, this will take forever!

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.208
[KYOICHI]
Tatsuma!

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:21.679
--Tatsuma!
--Hiyuu!

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.025
[KYOICHI]
Tatsuma! Get him!

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:36.777
Kyoichi...

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:52.793
Tiny? Why did you
come back? What about Aoi?

00:20:52.835 --> 00:20:55.421
Why didn't you
bring Aoi with you?!

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:59.675
[dog whining]

00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:10.978
[AOI]
Reiji, please stop this.

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:16.442
Doing this won't
save you or Tiny.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:17.401
Aoi!

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:22.823
[AOI] This isn't
really what you want.

00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:26.035
You should know
better than anyone.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:30.998
I don't want anyone, especially
a friend to go through such

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.044
sorrow ever again! I can't
forgive people who harm others

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:37.713
just for amusement,
or who would take the life

00:21:37.755 --> 00:21:40.424
of an innocent, little creature.

00:21:41.342 --> 00:21:45.721
Be strong and courageous.
Put aside your hatred!

00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:47.473
Be better than they were.

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:58.108
No. I... I don't care what
happens to me! But I at least...

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.111
I wanted to protect
Tiny at the very least!

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:06.575
[SAGAYA] Tiny! I'm sorry
I couldn't protect you.

00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:08.327
I'm so... sorry.

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:16.335
I wanted to be strong... enough
to protect the ones I care for.

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:18.170
I wanted to be strong!

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:22.341
[AOI] You can change.
I know you can.

00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:25.970
Use this power to
protect people instead.

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:34.228
[KYOICHI]
Great, what now?!

00:22:35.563 --> 00:22:38.649
[TATSUMA]
Your dream world is collapsing.

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:44.113
[SAGAYA]
Thank you... Aoi...

00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:51.537
[REPORTER] A follow-up story,
the high school students who had

00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:55.165
unexplainably fallen into
comatose states five days ago

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:57.585
have all made a
full recovery as of...

00:22:57.626 --> 00:22:59.753
[IWAYAMA] They seem
to be doing just fine.

00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:03.591
We'll take care
of him here for a bit.

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:05.759
[KYOICHI] Look at him with that
peaceful smile on his face...

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:08.596
It seems like
his soul is saved now.

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:18.647
[ANKO] Aoi!
Oh, thank goodness!

00:23:32.703 --> 00:23:36.373
The "Dream Master"...
What a joke.

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:39.209
None of these
"people" are of any use!

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:43.005
Well... now getting back
to my brave little friend.

00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:47.760
[KISARAGI]
So I was right... It is them.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.978
[TENDO]
I'm sorry to say this concludes

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.314
our business for today.

00:24:00.356 --> 00:24:02.483
Until next time.
