WEBVTT

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.358
The time for revenge
has arrived.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.289
[engine noise]

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.874
[CLAIRE gasps]

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:45.379
[cat squeals]

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.799
[CLAIRE]
Hello, Lord Yagyu.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.343
[YAGYU]
So, what's he up to?

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.886
[CLAIRE]
He has control of some girl

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:55.889
who's supposed to have the
Bodhisattva Eye or something.

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:57.724
He's making some
kind of plan...

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.685
[YAGYU]
Let him do as he likes.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:03.272
[CLAIRE]
Huh? Are you sure about that?

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:06.358
It'll be worth watching...

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.111
to see how the Vessel reacts...

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.170
It's quiet lately.

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:53.131
Sure is. Nothin' at all
going on around here.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.634
But... no news is
good news, right?

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.970
Yeah, well, it's
making me nervous.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.514
[RYUTA] Huh?

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:08.188
[INUGAMI] Repeating the same
things all over again, huh?

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:14.361
Some people just don't learn;
that much seems obvious...

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.374
[AZUMABASHI] So do ya think
that guy is gonna be all right?

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:30.127
Yeah, Tatsuma's not gonna
bite the dust without a fight.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:31.336
Thanks for your help tonight.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:35.757
Yeah, well, don't be a stranger,
boss, call me anytime!

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.677
All right. See ya around!

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.612
So it looks
like you're back

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.990
with your batteries
fully charged.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.783
That stunt you pulled
back there by the shrine

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.785
must've been
pretty impressive.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.163
If that was any indication,
you and your buddies

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:09.166
seem to be better at
using your powers, too.

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.752
So tell me, what the hell
are you doing back here?

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.255
It's almost like
you're not grateful

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:17.591
that I saved your
asses out there.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.927
Don't you worry. I got
no business with you.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.679
I just figured that
if I followed you around

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.098
long enough I'd be
able to find him.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.767
"Him" who?

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.519
[MAIKO]
Oh! Oh, Houraiji! Oh.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.645
[KYOUICHI] Hey.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:31.938
[MAIKO] Hello.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.149
[KYOUICHI]
How's Tatsuma doing?

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.443
The Doctor's examining
him as we speak.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:39.946
But it looks good. She says he's
not in any immediate danger.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.050
[ANKO] Here.

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:02.260
How are you doing?

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.762
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:06.681
Shouldn't you be getting
home soon? It's kinda late.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.476
I'm worried too,
so I'd like to stay.

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:18.485
Huh?

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:26.117
Heh. So what's
the story, old bag?

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.080
Call me that again and it's
the last thing you'll ever say.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.707
Is he gonna be all right?

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.126
[IWAYAMA] I'm pretty
impressed, actually.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.170
Any one of these injuries
would have been fatal

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:40.841
if he hadn't just barely
dodged each of them.

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.467
You know, you've
always been lacking

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.970
in the brains department,
but you sure do have a knack

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.722
for finding guys like this
to have as your friend...

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:48.723
Hmph.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.767
Could it be some
primal instinct at work?

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.561
Shut it.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.062
[YUKINO]
What a relief!

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.647
[HINANO] Yes.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.859
So what's going on?
What were the two of you

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.861
doing there in
the first place?

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.363
I'm not sure how we
can answer that...

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:05.657
Uh... How can I put this...?

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.452
[RYUZAN] Perhaps you
could allow me to explain.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.621
Master? What is this?

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:14.374
[KISARAGI] Old Man
White Moth... Master Ryuzan!

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:15.375
Huh?

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:18.503
Young Kisaragi. It has
been a very long time.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.131
And Iwayama, you seem
as well as ever.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.425
I don't need your flattery.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.594
[RYUZAN chuckles]

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.638
Kisaragi... and Dr. Iwayama?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.016
You mean you guys knew
each other all along?

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.476
Aw, just cut to the chase!

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.731
[KYOUICHI]
I really hate mysteries.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:41.568
So, you gonna spit it out
or what... gramps?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.502
[barks]

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:08.094
[RYUZAN] There is an individual
known as the "Bodhisattva Eye."

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.055
[ANKO]
Bodhisattva Eye?

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:13.016
[RYUZAN] This person has the
power to read the Dragon Stream

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:16.061
and thereby select the
chosen from all humanity

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.104
and lead them to salvation.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:21.399
However, this person is
also a source of conflict

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:25.737
precisely because they may use
the power of the Dragon Stream.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.448
If one could manipulate
the Dragon Stream at will,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.533
then bringing the world
under your control

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.285
would be no great effort.

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:35.246
Since the beginning of time,
those in positions of power

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.415
have waged countless
battles over the use

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.084
of the Bodhisattva Eye.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.879
If the past is any indicator,
it would be most irresponsible

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:47.092
and unwise not to prepare
ourselves for any eventuality.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.761
[KOMAKI] So what
are you trying to say?

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:52.973
[RYUZA] It is said that the one
who holds the Bodhisattva Eye

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:56.101
also holds a certain
amount of power.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.852
[YUUYA]
What kind of power?

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:02.065
[RYUZA] To rejuvenate the
power of life, so to speak.

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:05.318
The ultimate
power of healing.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:07.696
[KOMAKI gasps]

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:09.614
It can't be!

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:14.035
Aoi... Aoi's the
Bodhisattva Eye?

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.496
[IWAYAMA] The healing powers
of the Bodhisattva Eye

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:19.833
are on an entirely
different level from my own.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.043
Not only can
they heal injuries,

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.046
but they can even
restore the dead to life.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.882
On the other hand, they can
instantly advance the age

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:31.594
of a person, older and older,
until that person dies.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.847
[RYUZAN] The Eight-Hands-Breadth
Sword that they stole

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.224
is an instrument that
greatly intensifies

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:40.353
the Bodhisattva Eye's powers.
It is one of a collection

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:43.982
that together are called
the ten sacred treasures.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:46.484
"The ten sacred treasures"?

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.738
[YUUYA] If it's only one
of ten, then that means...

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.116
[RYUYA] Our enemy has already
obtained the other nine.

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:58.329
On one occasion, we were able
to track him down. However...

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.832
[KYOUICHI] Huh. You were no
match for him, huh, gramps?

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:01.833
[YUUYA] Kyouichi!

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:05.545
[RYUZA] Heh. It's quite all
right. He speaks the truth.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.797
The Bodhisattva Eye
only appears

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.258
when the Dragon Stream
has been disrupted.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.093
[KOMAKI] So, wait a sec.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.846
If Tendo Kozunu was causing
all those demon attacks

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.057
to disrupt the
Dragon Stream...

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:18.558
[gasps] Then...

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.604
[KYOUICHI] Right. He only
did it so he could wake up

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.106
the Bodhisattva Eye in Aoi.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.486
[KOMAKI] Does Aoi know
what's happening to her?

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.446
[KYOUICHI] Good question.
Why don't you answer

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:34.532
that one for her,
Doom 'n Gloom? Asshole...

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.123
[KOMAKI]
What is this?

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:49.506
You told her...
You told Aoi, didn't you?

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.470
You idiot! If you told her
about something like that,

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:59.933
you know she would... Why?!
Why would you tell her?!

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:06.731
And that wasn't all
you did either, was it?

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.358
[KOMAKI] Tell the truth.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:11.611
Tell me what the hell
you did to Aoi!

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.530
I tried to kill her.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.073
[KOMAKI gasps]

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.078
[KISARAGI]
The Bodhisattva Eye...

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.955
The one with the power
of the Bodhisattva Eye

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:24.624
will bring doom
upon this world.

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.417
With that being the case,

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.545
I sought to kill her
before she...

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:37.428
[KOMAKI shudders]

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.805
[KOMAKI]
You son of a--!

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.473
[slap]
[KOMAKI grunts]

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:45.145
[KOMAKI grunts repeatedly]

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:46.771
[KOMAKI shudders]

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:47.814
[approaching footsteps]

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.357
[YUUYA]
Sakurai, no!

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.151
Stop it! Please stop fighting!

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.653
My God! How could you
even consider that?!

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.113
Why would anybody
have to kill Aoi?

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.948
It just doesn't make sense!

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.283
[KOMAKI]
It's not her fault she was

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.826
born with that stupid power.

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:02.036
It's not her fault that
those demons appeared!

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.789
Aoi always said that we should
try to protect people...

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.958
She said we should
do everything we could.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.961
At first I wondered why she was
saying all that stuff to us...

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:13.506
Why she thought we could prevent
people from getting hurt...

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:16.217
All along, she still...

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:22.432
[KOMAKI] I'm wasting
my breath. Someone like you

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:25.059
could never be half as
courageous as Aoi is!

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.899
[KOMAKI cries]

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.442
[KYOUICHI] Komaki...

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.029
I think that's enough.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.745
[RYUZAN] Kisaragi...

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:47.290
Those were your grandfather's
instructions, weren't they?

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.083
[KISARAGI] Yes.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.921
Just like you, Kisaragi,
I and the Oribe sisters here

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.590
are the last in a long
line of ancestors

00:11:55.632 --> 00:12:00.261
who have defended this land
of Edo, this city of Tokyo,

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:03.848
[RYUZAN] from evil forces
down through the ages.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.935
We each have our own missions,
and it is the mission

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:10.438
of the Kisaragi to kill
the Bodhisattva Eye.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.524
[KOMAKI]
But... what about Aoi?

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:18.279
[indistinct murmuring]

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.245
[TENDO]
That's a good girl.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:26.537
[TENDO laughs]

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.374
You know, I love your eyes.

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.292
[CLAIRE] Hm. So you
can talk to girls

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:33.044
as long as it's
one of your toys.

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.588
For a puppet on someone
else's strings,

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.882
you've sure got a point
of view. Have you finished

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.717
running errands
for your master?

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.845
You're not fit to
breathe the same air!

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:45.098
[TENDO] You think so, hm?

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:51.938
Hmph. Well, no matter.
It's time to go, my dear Aoi.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.066
Kisaragi, I will tell
you all the account

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.568
of how this strife began.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.239
I'll tell you all.
Everything I know...

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:15.378
[child's voice]
Mother! M-Mother! M-Mother!

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.258
[RYUZAN] The house of
Kozunu launched a coup

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.012
against the ruling parties.
The reason was that

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:27.473
the shogunate attempted to
kidnap one of their daughters,

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:31.394
who had been born with the
power of the Bodhisattva Eye.

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:34.314
In order to protect the girl,
the Kozunu made use

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:36.316
of the Dark Arts
and used force

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:39.861
to rebel against the might
of the Shogunate.

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:41.279
[ANKO]
So that means...

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.114
[YUUYA] It means the
Shogunate are the ones

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.366
who started the whole thing.

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:46.951
[YUKINO]
And we're continuing...

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:50.246
[HINANO] Why did we never
know this before, Master Arai?

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:51.914
[KYOUICHI]
That's how war is.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.584
There's no "good" fighting
or "bad" fighting.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.627
Even that fight was
just a struggle for power

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.755
when you come down to it.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:01.841
So, Kisaragi...

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:05.345
What's up? You still
gonna kill Aoi over this?

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.059
[RYUZAN] That fight
ended in a bloody defeat

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.187
for the Kozunu family.
Decades later,

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:16.606
their descendants
again raised an army

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:18.775
during the Bakumatsu reign,

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:21.486
but once again
they were defeated.

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:25.448
Since that time, the Kozunu
have hidden their lineage,

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.786
and lived in the shadows of
history, unbeknownst to anyone.

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:32.163
I don't know how
they managed to do it,

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.748
but they escaped
their pursuers,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.958
and continued to
evade people like us

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.961
after the Meiji
Restoration as well.

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:40.630
All I know for certain

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:44.050
is that the man who calls
himself Tendo Kozunu

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:47.345
must have lived
quite a life indeed.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.734
[MAN A] I don't believe
you're a Kozunu!

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.236
[WOMAN A]
You concealed your identity

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:05.405
so you could sneak
into our family!

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.073
[WOMAN B] And then you
gave birth to a child!

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.117
How utterly disgusting!

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:11.411
[door locks]

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:14.580
[CHILD] Mother!

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:17.959
This is for you, Mother.

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:25.842
[TATSUMA] I think I...
can kind of understand...

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.554
[KYOUICHI] Tatsuma!

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:30.555
[YUUYA] Hiyu!

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.141
[KOMAKI]
Hey, Tatsuma!

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.685
[ANKO]
Oh! Tatsuma!

00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:38.813
You idiot. Goin' overboard,
don'tcha think?

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.064
Sorry.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:43.067
[ANKO] How are you feeling?
Are you... still in pain?

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.278
[TATSUMA]
Nah. Thanks for asking.

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:50.366
He was trying...
to look inside my mind

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:52.326
and see all
of my memories.

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:57.039
"He"? You mean Kozunu?

00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:01.002
[TATSUMA] But instead
I felt what he felt...

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:06.340
A deep, intense
sadness inside him.

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:08.634
I want to save him, too.

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:12.346
I want to save the soul
of Tendo Kozunu.

00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:15.391
[RAITO]
Don't give me that shit!

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:20.188
Save him? What a joke.

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:25.234
That son of a bitch! He's the
only one I wanna see suffer!

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:29.405
Like I told you before,

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:32.283
we fight to protect,
not to punish.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.702
[ANKO] But look at what
he did to Sayo Hirasaka.

00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:36.037
[KOMAKI] She's right.
I couldn't save

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.039
somebody like him.
Not ever.

00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:43.544
[TATSUMA] Aoi also
wanted to protect...

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.254
This is what she wants, too.

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:48.341
I've never been
more sure of that.

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:51.511
Hiyu?

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.846
Man, you are such a dumbass.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.474
I'm sorry you
think so, but I still...

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:58.184
Okay, I give!

00:16:58.226 --> 00:16:59.185
Huh?

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.437
Like the old bag said,
I'm not the brightest bulb

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:05.316
in the toolbox. So I guess
we make a pretty good team.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.402
Kyouichi!

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:14.283
Aww. Primal instinct,
like I said...

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.078
[IWAYAMA and MAIKO laugh]

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.623
[KYOUICHI] So what's that
freak trying to do now?

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:23.417
[RYUZAN]
Well, most likely...

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:25.920
[CLAIRE]
Hey, what are ya doin'?

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:30.132
[TENDO] This very ground is
where my ancestors are buried.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.884
[CLAIRE]
Huh?

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:34.637
[TENDO] My forebears who were
defeated by the Shogunate

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:38.182
committed suicide here.
Members of the Kozunu line

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:41.102
have continued to
sleep here ever since,

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:45.064
never having been granted a
proper burial anywhere else...

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:47.650
[CLAIRE]
What are you talking about?

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:50.820
And now I will
resurrect that bloodline--

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:53.864
the bloodline of my
poor, ruined family!

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.992
I'll make everything right...

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.288
What's that?

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:01.664
What the hell
was that?

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.082
Did you hear something, too?

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:04.625
H-Heard what?

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.087
[TENDO] Come now to those
who serve and venerate you

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:12.967
at this shrine; we implore you,
hasten, heal our ills.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.052
Mirror of the Deep,
Mirror of the Shore,

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.805
Eight-Hands-Breadth Sword,
Jewel of Life,

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.683
Jewel of Perfection,
Jewel of Resurrection,

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.352
Jewel of Warding,
Serpent-Repelling Scarf,

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:28.149
Wasp-Repelling Scarf, Scarf of
Multifarious Protection...

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.825
Is he bringing back
the Kozunu clan?!

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.368
Poor Aoi!

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:01.265
[indistinct murmurs]

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:31.253
[AOI whimpers]

00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:36.300
[AOI screaming]

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:56.320
[screams]

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.491
Looks like it's already started.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:01.992
You don't have
a moment to lose;

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.494
you've got to
go bring Aoi back.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.955
Easy for you to say.
Where the hell is she, huh?

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.456
Well, master?

00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:09.583
[RYUZAN] Hmm...

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.502
[MAIKO]
Doctor Iwayama!

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:18.134
I can hear her... I can hear
Aoi crying out for help.

00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:21.137
Sagaya. You're so
full of it...

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:24.056
I think I can trace
the path of Aoi's mind

00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:26.308
to find out where she is.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.729
I'll go too. He mustn't
travel alone.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.898
[IWAYAMA] Don't push
yourself too hard.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.153
[SAGAYA]
Aoi saved my life.

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:41.240
It's time for me
to return the favor.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:44.076
[MAIKO]
Sure. Now let's go get her.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:55.004
I wasn't able to protect
you in the end. But I...

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:06.390
[KYOUICHI] Whaddaya gonna do?
Still planning on killing her?

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.642
Those were my instructions.

00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:11.020
Huh. Your instructions, huh?

00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:12.438
Well, if that's what
you're gonna do,

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.149
I'm not gonna
waste my breath.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:17.943
But I'm the one you'll
be facing off against.

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.822
[KYOUICHI] I'll protect her,
you'll see.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:28.871
I'm still going to destroy him.
I promise you that.

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:32.041
I'm not going to let you.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.845
Master, what is this?

00:21:44.887 --> 00:21:47.056
The demons.

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:51.227
It seems the demons are out
taking a little stroll tonight.

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:04.698
[KOMAKI]
Anko, this isn't the time!

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.201
[ANKO] You'll tell me
everything that happened?

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:08.744
[KOMAKI] Hm?

00:22:08.786 --> 00:22:11.831
Promise me, okay, you guys?
That you'll all come back here

00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:14.542
and you'll tell me
the whole story!

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.335
Sure, Anko.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.005
[AZUMABASHI]
Heya, Boss!

00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:21.841
H-Hey! What're you--?

00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:25.803
Sorry we're late! I brought
the whole gang with me.

00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:29.181
All that's left for us
is to just sit and wait.

00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:32.309
Seems to me the kids have
everything under control.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:36.063
I suppose that, too,
is our star of fate.

00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:39.942
[KYOUICHI] Heh. This is
gonna be one hell of a party.

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:44.113
So make sure you're ready
to fight. Now let's roll!
