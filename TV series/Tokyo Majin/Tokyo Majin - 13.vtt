[TENDO] That man said to me,

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:33.111
"To exact your revenge,
you will need a mighty power.

I could obtain that power,

if I was prepared to sacrifice.

I don't need any "heart."

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.112
Listen to me. We all need you.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.698
I don't care what kind
of power you have.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.326
I'm going to do whatever
I can to protect you.

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:48.244
We're all going to try.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:52.165
We're going to do our
best to keep you safe.

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:54.375
I promise.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:59.213
[TATSUMA]
Please, come back to us...

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:00.923
Aoi...

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.304
[gasps]

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:10.558
[growling]

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.893
Could it be?!

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:17.565
[yells]

00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:30.411
[sobs softly]

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:32.538
He couldn't have
broken my spell!

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.750
Aoi is--Aoi is mine,
do you hear me?!

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.419
[TENDO] Aoi!

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:40.880
You won't hurt them.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:41.923
[gasps]

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:45.468
[AOI] I won't let you.
I'll protect them.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.428
I'll protect the whole world!

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.224
[YUUYA yells]

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:53.976
[BOTH breathing heavily]

00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:02.026
[MONSTER groans]

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.158
Movin' kinda slow...
huh, dungeon master?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.660
Shut up and fight, simpleton.

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.869
Ha! Well, well.

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:14.997
Kisaragi, looks like still
got a little fight left in ya.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.250
[KYOUICHI] So have you made up
your mind on your duty yet?

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:19.001
Stop talking.

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:24.298
[RAITO] To protect...

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.768
Fight to protect...

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:39.981
K-Kill her! I have no
further use for that girl!

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:43.401
Kill the Bodhisattva Eye and
every last one of her friends!

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:44.861
[KYOUICHI] Let's finish this!

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:48.781
[grunts]

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:49.907
Daigo!

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.742
Haven't I already said,

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.287
I'm never gonna let
anything happen to you.

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:56.247
[MONSTER yells]

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.835
[MONSTER yells]
[KISARAGI screams]

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.462
Hisui, no!

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:03.921
Huh?

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:08.426
Even if it... costs my life.

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:12.680
You're so predictable,
ya furry hairball.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:15.308
Get... outta my face!

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:19.937
[grunting]

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.067
This looks like a
good time to leave.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:26.819
[CLAIRE] Everything's got
this out of control

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.363
because you refused
to listen to his orders.

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:31.782
Betcha you sure
feel dumb now, huh?

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.619
[quavers]

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.374
[yells]

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.131
[MONSTER yells]

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:49.509
[screams]

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.052
[gasps]

00:16:57.892 --> 00:17:00.978
[RAITO yells]

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:26.045
[yells]

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.431
Oh, Mother...

00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:43.229
Recognize your toy?
I wanted to make sure

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:45.731
you got it back,
you fuckin' asshole!

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:49.902
[screams]

00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:07.336
Ah!

00:18:07.378 --> 00:18:08.879
Do you think that means...?

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.258
It seems...
like they did it.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.676
[ANKO giggles]

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:26.564
Is it over?

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.733
Hey you haven't seen
the other two, have you?

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:30.860
[AZUMABASHI]
What?! We lost 'em?!

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:33.195
We screwed up
pretty good this time.

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:34.989
Now we're not gonna
be able to get anywhere!

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.199
How'm I gonna face the boss?

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:49.420
[TENDO whimpers]

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.797
[KYOUICHI] Hey.

00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:54.383
Pretty sweet jamboree. Hmm?

00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:55.468
[laughs]

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:57.345
"Jam session."

00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:59.180
Hello!

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:02.016
[TATSUMA] Ah!
Miss Takamizawa.

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:04.393
[MAIKO chuckles]
We had to join you.

00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:06.187
[AOI] Reiji! You must
be feeling better.

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:08.189
[SAGAYA] Yeah. I could
say the same to you.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.149
[KOMAKI] What are the
two of you doing here?

00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:12.652
We know that you think
we'll just get in your way.

00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:15.279
And we might not
be able to help much...

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.989
but still...

00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:19.283
[BOTH chuckle softly]

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.744
[TENDO groans]

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.496
You filthy insects...

00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:26.707
Please stop! I felt
your painful sorrow.

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:29.293
I felt it when you put me
in contact with your heart.

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:31.337
I know that's why
you're doing all of this;

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:33.798
to end your sadness... But--

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.257
Shut up!

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:41.472
[TENDO] Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up, shut up!

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:45.393
You scum... You bastards!

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.814
[AOI] Tatsuma.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.201
[TATSUMA] Tendo. Kozunu.

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:06.455
I want... to save you, too.

00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.625
Don't give me that shit!

00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:11.794
[gasps]

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.921
[TENDO grunting]

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:16.173
Hiyu! Huh?

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:18.134
Kyouichi?

00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:20.845
[grunting]

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.597
[TENDO] Why do you despise
the Kozunu line so much?!

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:26.392
You're the one who gave
birth to me! This world...

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.602
[exhales heavily]
The whole world!

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:32.356
You stupid people!
You all--you all made me!

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:36.277
This world can--
it can--it can just--

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:38.028
[gasps]

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:43.826
[TATSUMA] Even so...

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:47.872
I still want to... save you.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.458
[yells]

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:53.961

[breathing heavily]

00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:12.563
[TENDO groaning]

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:16.525
It's not--it's not over.

00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:17.985
No.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:21.864
Not so soon...

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:26.619
[TENDO] Mother,
make sure you watch, okay?

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:32.166
I can still do it. I can.

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:34.084
I can...!

00:21:37.379 --> 00:21:38.798
[ALL gasp]

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:39.924
[KYUICHI] What now?

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.091
[grunts]

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.551
[gasps]

00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:52.311
[TENDO] How...?

00:21:54.188 --> 00:21:55.689
What's going on?

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.149
[DEMONS moaning]

00:21:57.191 --> 00:22:01.654
No. Let go!
Let go of me!

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:02.947
--Kozunu!
--What are you doin'?

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:04.156
Get back!

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:05.074
But he--

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:07.117
[CLAIRE screams]

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:12.498
What did I do? Lord Yagyu!
Lord Yagyu, please don't!

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.503
This does not
look good, you guys.

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:18.671
Let's get out of here.

00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:19.880
Tatsuma!

00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:22.049
Give it up already!
He's toast!

00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:23.259
[KYOUICHI] We gotta go!

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.679
[running footsteps]

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.437
[YAGYU] And so
one star has fallen.

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:41.235
The foolish...
young Tendo Kozunu.
