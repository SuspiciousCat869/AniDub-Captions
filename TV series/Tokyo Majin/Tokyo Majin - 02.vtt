a couple of murders.

if they can buy a solution
to this problem, princess.

At the end of the day,
it's all the same.

There's no noticeable

occurred yesterday morning on
the Tokyo-Nagoya Expressway.

that are known as the
"ten sacred treasures".

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.502
[KYOICHI] Damn!
Transfer Student

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:35.004
turns out to be a ladies' man.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.590
Hey, you mind if I
take a look at your mail?

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:38.883
[KYOICHI]
Hmm?

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:43.096
[KYOICHI] Wha-What's up
with that? Crazy...

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.556
Anyway, you up for
some ramen? My treat.

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.979
[KISARAGI] The item the
master requested has arrived.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.857
What would you like me
to do with it?

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.109
Miss Misato?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.152
[AOI]
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.780
I honestly don't know
what I'm gonna do with Daddy.

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.323
Always ordering
new things although

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.783
he hardly ever comes home...

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.119
What did he send us this time?

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.674
[keyboard clicking]

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.187
[YANG]
Hey there, boss!

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:35.023
Huh?

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.650
[KYOICHI] Well,
if it isn't Old Man Yang!

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:40.069
[YANG] I appreciated
your help the other day.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.405
[KYOICHI] You're not makin'
trouble again, are you?

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:45.450
Aw, c'mon, can't ya
have a little faith in me?

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.826
[KYOICHI]
Well, see ya later.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.036
[YANG]
Yeah, later.

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.537
Now, you take care, boss!

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.247
[FAN] I think we got it
cleaned up, master.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.290
[YANG]
Right. Just keep at it.

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:53.958
[WANG] What do you think
the boss would do to us

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.253
if he saw what the inside of
this place looks like right now?

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:59.589
[YANG] He'd beat the
living daylights out of us.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.549
And then our miserable
souls would wander around

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.217
in Limbo for eternity,

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.095
'cause there ain't no way they'd
let guys like us into heaven.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:07.472
[WANG]
Man, that'd suck...

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.141
[FAN] All I want is
to just die in my sleep.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.101
[Yang cackles]

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.104
[KYOICHI]
What's up?

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:17.690
Why, if it isn't Kyoach.

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:19.484
Don't call me that!

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:22.028
[COOK] Sit down
and order, would ya?

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.740
Tatsuma Hiyu.

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:28.034
What the hell are
you doin' here, meathead?

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:31.996
[AOI]
A showdown?

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.498
[KOMAKI VIA PHONE]
A guy from the Wrestling Club

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:34.540
was telling me that Daigo said

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.084
he was going to fight the
transfer student.

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:37.543
[AOI]
But, do you know where?

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.128
[KOMAKI VIA PHONE]
At the old school building.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.505
Guys are so stupid, aren't they?

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:44.884
I mean, what's this gonna prove?
Hey, are you still there? Aoi?

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.512
[YUUYA] This old
building's been around

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.640
since before the War. But
nobody's used it for years.

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.725
[KYOICHI] In other words:
no one's gonna bother us.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:55.061
[YUUYA] Hey.
Who invited you along, anyway?

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:58.272
[KYOICHI] C'mon, you wrestling
guys like it when people watch.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.857
I'll be the ref.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.484
How come it's so
bright in here, anyway?

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.152
I told the Drama Club
I'd get them lunch

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.321
if I could use
their lights tonight.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.948
[KYOICHI]
That's not what I was asking...

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:08.908
What the hell does it matter?!

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.118
[Kyoichi chuckling]

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.245
[KYOICHI] You've plastered
talismans all over the walls

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:14.747
like they're a bunch of
centerfolds, Daigo.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.999
What, are you scared that
we're gonna see a ghost?

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:20.920
[YUUYA] We won't!
I say there'll be no ghosts!

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:24.424
No ghosts.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:25.925
[YUUYA]
Now, let's go.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.051
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.137
[panting]

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:32.223
[YUUYA]
C'mon! C'mon!

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:35.351
What's wrong?
'Fraid to fight me? Come on.

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:36.519
Let's go!

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:39.397
[growls]

[strained groaning]

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.660
This is gonna be interesting.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:53.661
[KYOICHI]
Huh?

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.705
[AOI]
Stop it, you guys!

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:57.915
[KOMAKI]
Aoi?

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:00.042
[YUUYA]
Sakurai, what are you--

00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:01.043
[TATSUMA]
Misato?

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:03.880
[KYOICHI] Jeesh, she's the
nosiest girl on the planet.

00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:05.798
[AOI] I'm sorry,
but you can't do this.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.426
You need a teacher's permission
to even be on this property.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:11.179
[KYOICHI] What? That's what
you're worried about?

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:14.974
[AOI] At any rate,
we need to get out of here.

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.517
I'll help you
guys clean up, okay?

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.352
No! Don't come in!

[cracking]

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:29.363
It's here.

[lightbulbs shatter]

[KOMAKI]
Aoi?

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:39.707
The talismans!

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.127
Hey. Don't worry, Sakurai,
I'll keep you safe.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.463
You can always depend on me!

[YUUYA]
Wha?

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.614

What is this?

I dunno
what's going on here

but things are
about to get interesting.

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:50.791
I got her!

00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:51.917
Yeah, but she's--

00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:12.855
What on earth is
the meaning of this?

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.482
Hisui, how did you...?

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:20.738
[KISARAGI] So it undid
the seals on its own? No.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.865
That sensation I had earlier...

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:25.034
It couldn't be.

00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:27.912
Could they have
summoned this thing?

[otherworldly roaring]

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.587
Four heretic
demons block our path

towards achieving
the way of Buddha.

[Ghost screeching]

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.930
So we must
equally unite them

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.557
the Buddhist and
the realm of demons...

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.184

So, is it...is it over?

00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:23.509
[TATSUMA] Can you tell me
what just happened here?

00:22:26.804 --> 00:22:30.933
[gentle breeze]
