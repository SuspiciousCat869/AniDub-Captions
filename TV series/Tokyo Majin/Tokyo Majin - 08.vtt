WEBVTT

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:11.220
[YUKINO] The five Buddhist
shrines that sealed the demons

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.763
have been destroyed.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:14.848
[HINANO] Along with the seals
under Kisaragi's protection

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.017
were also broken...

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:19.102
[YUKINO] The Eight-Hands-Breadth
Sword was found and

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.772
stolen by the
Demoniacal Horde.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.899
And the vessel
of the Golden Dragon?

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:27.110
[HINANO] He was there
and was in contact.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.612
[RYUZAN]
I see.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.663
It appears the stars
of fate are on the move.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:41.208
[gentle breezze]

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.315
This isn't it...
this won't do.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.077
[SAKUYA]
This arm...

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:46.291
[screaming]

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:52.589
[maniacal laughter]

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.762
[choking]

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.431
[screaming]

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.246
You stay back.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.056
Hiiyah!

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.780
[KYOICHI]
Not too bad...

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:01.992
But!

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.459
You're gonna need more than
technique if you wanna win.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.294
Come on!
One more time!

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.087
[KYOICHI] Why don't
you just give it up?!

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.673
Please, once more!

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.509
You're not gonna get any better
if you let your emotions

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.553
get control of you.

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:31.271
[ANKO] There were
more attacks last night.

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:34.107
[YUUYA] There're been
a lot of incidents lately.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.569
[KOMAKI] I have a strange
feeling it's not all demons.

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:39.112
You're exactly right.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.114
[ANKO] There've been more
and more copycat incidents

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.699
to look like demons.

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.785
At this point, it's hard
to tell which ones are real

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.119
and which ones are fake.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:51.208
People are dying around here.
There's nothing fake about that.

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.669
I'm sorry.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.172
But why so many?

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.216
Guess all this means is that
there's no difference between

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.343
people and demons.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:06.181
So, what is it
that you do know?

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.769
This one that's been going after
members of athletic clubs...

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.730
It kinda feels like the work of
demons to me. What do you think?

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:16.525
The news reports that "part of
the body" has been dismembered,

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.236
but it's the arms they're going
for, the right arm to be exact.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.904
Why would anyone...?

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:22.823
[KYOICHI]
What does Kisaragi say?

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.534
Nothing, really.

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.956
It's impressive to see how hard
you guys have been working, even

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.582
doing this special
training and all...

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.668
And Aoi even dusted
off her old na-gi-na-ta!

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:35.794
I had no idea!

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:37.754
Without strength in my
moves with the naginata,

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:40.131
I don't know if
I can help to fight.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.301
Aoi will be okay.
We all decided to do this.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.887
That's right,
we'll all do it together!

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.693
This will have to do.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.577
[MIKURIYA's PARTNER] Get the sea
lice to the lab for analysis.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.787
[DETECTIVE] It's possible
the same culprit's behind both

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:13.832
the I-ha-ra parasite incident
and the No-za-wa incident.

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.167
Ko-zu-ka's barnacle incident
seems to resemble the I-wa-ta

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.502
murder from the other day.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.714
The man killed in Miya Park
appears to be a copycat murder

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.383
after the unusual
string of incidents.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.303
We've got the suspect in
custody back at the station.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.013
[phone ringing]

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.724
[RYUTA]
Hey, it's me.

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.767
About that high school student
from the other day...

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.269
[MIKURIYA]
The one with the holes?

00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.939
Yeah. They're not holes.
They're honeycomb cells...

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:41.443
like that of a beehive. And
just like the other incidents,

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:44.738
the right arm
was completely severed.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.410
[ambulance siren]

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:58.710
Hey, I said I'm sorry! I didn't
think I'd actually hit you!

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.255
[KYOICHI]
Oh, man.

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:04.674
Hey, Tatsuma, what's that?

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.593
Long underwear!

00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:11.431
Underwear? You mean that
time from the other day?

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.559
[KYOICHI] You weren't making
that shit up to fool her?

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.854
[TATSUMA] Yeah. You do realize
it will be getting cold soon.

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.230
[KYOICHI]
And how old are you?

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.523
[ANKO]
This shatters the image of the

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.776
mysterious transfer student!

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.736
[TATSUMA] They're not for me.
I was planning to send them

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.196
to my dad.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.782
[KYIOCHI]
Okay, I certainly hope so.

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:32.535
[YUUYA] "Send" it to him? So,
he lives away from your family?

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.703
No, I do.

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.997
I live in Tokyo on my own.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.208
Really?
A new detail uncovered!

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:42.170
The mysterious transfer student
is living "on his own"?!

00:07:42.212 --> 00:07:46.174
Lucky him, it seems like it
must be fun living all alone.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.927
[YUUYA] Your parents couldn't
come to Tokyo with you?

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.471
Well, at their age it
would be too difficult.

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:53.306
Really, how old are they?

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:56.685
And so... you live apart from
your parents? Not simply apart,

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.270
but as a high school student
living alone in Tokyo!

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:03.274
[ANKO] Wow! Why is that? What's
the reason for your situation?

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:07.654
Alright already. Let's go get
some ramen. I'm starvin'.

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:09.364
[KOMAKI]
Well, I have archery practice,

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.865
so I'll see you guys later.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:14.119
Oh, right. You've got that
tournament coming up, right?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.246
Yeah, this will be my last
archery tournament at the

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:18.665
high school level.
I got to do my best.

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.667
You will come to watch,
right, Aoi?

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.253
Uh, yeah, sure!

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:27.048
Um... Hey, I'll come to
cheer you on, too, Sakurai.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.299
Thanks, guys!

00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:32.971
[CLAIRE] Why don't
you stop fussing over this

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:36.307
Kisaragi guy or whoever, and
go for something bigger?

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.602
[TENDO] You do know it's your
fault my plan went awry.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.229
[CLAIRE]
Oh, shut up...

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.024
[TENDO] The seeds have
been sown, haven't they?

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.651
[CLAIRE] We haven't done very
much and I know that "he"

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.028
won't be happy about it.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:48.862
[cat meows]

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.488
[Tendo laughs]

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.115
What's so funny?!

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:56.327
Oh, nothing. I couldn't
care less about your "him".

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.414
I will do whatever I please.
Understand?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.670
[TENDO] Where the hell are they?
The Dragon Stream should have

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:11.134
activated their powers. They
should have appeared by now.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:16.139
And that one's
getting on my nerves.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.269
[NEWS ANCHOR] This is supposedly
an effect of gelidium jelly.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.021
[NEWS ANCHOR]
Our other top story...

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.607
Police have identified the body
that was found on the roadside

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.401
of Na-ka-mu-ra in the Ne-ri-ma
ward in the early morning

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:32.989
of the 20th. The victim is
20-year-old E-i-ta I-ke-da.

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.958
[YUUYA] So where do
you guys want to go?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.835
[KYOICHI]
The usual spot, of course.

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:48.004
[TATSUMA] Say, Kyoichi, do
they have strawberry ramen?

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:50.256
--What?
--You...You there!

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:55.637
I sense a very powerful light
emanating from you...

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:58.765
This light is mighty and
illuminates all.

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:00.725
Master Arai!

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.186
It has been some time, Daigo.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.980
It's so good to see you.
When did you get back?

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.066
I returned just the other day.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:11.736
What can this old geezer
possibly be a "master" of?

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.114
Watch your mouth, Kyoichi!

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:18.284
It's quite all right.
My name is Ryuzan Arai and

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.412
you two are Daigo's friends
from school, I take it?

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.873
--What?
--Did he say "friend"?

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:26.334
[YUUYA] We all go to the same
school, his name's Houraiji.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.378
And that's Hiyu.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:36.469
[RYUZAN]
You have a nice face, young man.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.304
[light laugh]

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:45.228
Daigo, has it begun? Has
time begun to flow inside you?

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.703
[MIKURIYA]
A nasty affair...

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:04.622
They say the bodies were
completely dried up. If you

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.666
think about it, it's pretty
disturbing 'cause it seems like

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:09.544
this is happening
more often around here.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:14.215
I wonder what the police are
doing about this? But even if

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:17.385
they do catch whoever's
behind these incidences,

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:20.221
that's not going to bring
back the dead, you know?

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.808
Christ. You have to
feel really bad for all

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.394
the victims' families.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.190
I'm sorry, Excuse me.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:46.581
[SAKUYA] Not it... This isn't
it! This isn't the arm either.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:14.484
[SAKUYA] Komaki... Sakurai?
Komaki Sakurai!

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:17.237
[maniacal laugh]

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:27.830
[KISARAGI] The Kozunu clan...
they summon demons, disturb the

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:30.792
Dragon Stream...
And beyond that,

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.378
the Eight-Hands-Breadth Sword...

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:37.840
With that and the disturbances
in the Dragon Stream...

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:41.469
It couldn't be...
the Bo-dhi-satt-va Eye?!

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:48.601
Um, so...
You made all this yourself?

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:52.313
Yeah, I got up early and
spent nine hours preparing it.

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:53.398
Sweet!

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:56.109
Hey! Get your
damn hands off the food!

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.196
Hey, you too Tatsuma.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.991
[KYOICHI]
Hey, spread the love!

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:06.077
[YUUYA] The most important thing
is that Sakurai will like it.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:11.749
Mmm...
It's better than I expected!

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:15.586
Hey hubby, lunches made by the
wives are always best.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.505
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?!

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:20.425
[ANKO]
Well, now that looks good!

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:23.386
Hey, Komaki,
nice to see you again!

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.221
How've you been, Komaki?

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:28.474
Oh, hi guys. It's really
nice to see you! I was hoping

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:30.435
to get to see you guys here!

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.895
Good luck in the tournament,
Komaki.

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:35.732
Hey, who are they, Anko?

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:38.526
They're on the Yukimigahara
High School archery team.

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:41.154
Hinano Oribe and her
older sister, Yukino, who

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:43.531
specializes in the naginata.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:46.159
[ANKO] Hinano and Komaki
are long-time rivals,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.869
and their duels are always
the main attraction

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.580
to these tournaments. Plus,
the Oribe sisters are as smart

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:52.415
as they are pretty,
and they're quite popular

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:53.249
even at our school!

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:56.502
It'd be a total waste not
to do an article on them!

00:13:58.588 --> 00:13:59.839
Who cares?

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:01.507
Hey, do you guys
want some of this?

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.760
No thanks, I've got other
stories that I need to cover

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:07.180
today, so I've gotta run but
you guys have a good time.

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:08.681
[KYOICHI]
Your loss.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:11.684
Hey, you two want some of this!
This shit's good!

00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:15.980
What did I do?

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.066
Don't scare my little sister!

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:19.442
Let's go.

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.488
Komaki, Number 2.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.837
[SAKUYA]
Komaki...

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:45.301
No... No... No... No...

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:48.429
No, no, no, no!

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:51.599
No... No...

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.894
Komaki... Sakurai!

00:14:57.522 --> 00:15:00.108
[clapping]

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.368
[MIKURIYA] Christ, you have
to feel really bad for all

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.037
the victims' families.

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.045
[OFFICIAL]
Who's that?

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:24.424
Huh? Looks like trouble...

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:26.134
[OFFICIAL] Hey,
there's a sign over there.

00:15:26.175 --> 00:15:27.927
No one can be admitted
unless they're involved

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:29.595
with the tournament.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.406
[sharp inhale]

00:15:49.323 --> 00:15:51.325
[shrill screaming]

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.747
[all screaming]

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:57.707
It's the demons!

00:15:57.748 --> 00:16:00.501
They just come
out whenever they want!

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.464
I will protect them!

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:06.424
[screaming]

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:12.180
[evil laughter]

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:15.933
You'll give it to
me, right, Sakurai?

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:20.062
You're a nice person...
You'll give it to me, won't you?

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.691
Gimme your arm!

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:32.158
[buzzing]

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:35.369
[AOI]
Komaki!

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:36.370
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.165
Komaki!

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.714
--My arm's broken...
--Let go!

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.385
--Give me this one!
--Damn it, let go!

00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:55.348
[AOI] Komaki! Stop it!
Let go of her!

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.183
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:12.156
[KOMAKI] Aoi! Aoi!
You're bleeding...

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.367
Don't worry about me. Help her!

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:16.994
I told you don't let
emotions dictate your actions!

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:18.913
But...!

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.998
Just keep your
ass there for now!

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.041
--Aoi!
--Kyoichi!

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.001
Take it easy! Aoi!

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.127
I got this!

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:27.630
[screams]

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:43.271
Hmm.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.107
Tatsuma!

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:51.237
Go ahead! I'm okay.

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.075
[TENDO]
Who are you?!

00:17:56.993 --> 00:18:00.371
It doesn't matter.
You'll still die!

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:01.706
Please let go,
Komaki!

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.374
--What's wrong?!
--I want to...

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:07.628
I want to... protect them!
I don't want anyone else to...

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.853
[KYOICHI] C'mon, let go!
You are one pushy bitch!

00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:31.652
[KOMAKI]
Daigo!

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.240
I got it...

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:41.912
[bellows]

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:44.582
W-Whoa, not good!

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.482
[KYOICHI]
Aww, can't fly away?

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.985
Get ready to die, Bug Girl.

00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:14.320
Don't do it!

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:19.825
[TENDO] Who are you?
Who the hell are you?

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.805
Thank goodness...

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:44.266
Again... I've been made a
fool of by Komaki Sakurai.

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:48.979
She's so innocent with The
Power. She crushes me again.

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.482
Nothing has changed since then.

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:53.442
[KOMAKI] What in the hell are
you talking about? You act as if

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:55.611
you know me or something.

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:59.657
[SAKUYA]
What? You don't remember?

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:04.036
[Sakuya chuckles]

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:05.329
[KOMAKI]
What?!

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:07.373
[SAKUYA] She says
she doesn't remember!

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:10.376
[laughing]

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:12.586
[KOMAKI]
Watch out, Aoi.

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.505
[AOI]
It's all right.

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:16.632
I don't know what horrible
things you've been through,

00:20:16.674 --> 00:20:19.635
but what
you're doing won't help.

00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:22.430
All this, won't help
make things right.

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:26.726
Please stop all this killing.
You don't have to do this!

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:29.228
Why can't you just become
friends with Komaki? I'll do

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.773
whatever I can to help you get
through this! So please stop,

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:37.945
all this killing.
Please! Please.

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:43.367
Give it back.

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:51.459
[SAKUYA] Give me my arm back.
Give it back... Give it back...

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.931
If I ever lost
the ability to draw my bow...

00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:18.235
No!

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:26.869
[car alarm goes off]

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.634
Sakuya...

00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:45.012
[YUUYA]
Sakurai!

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:50.935
I can't protect them...
I couldn't protect her...

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:54.438
I couldn't...
I couldn't...

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:15.876
We've practiced
really hard for this.

00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:18.712
So let's go out
and try our best!

00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:20.673
Sure.

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:23.384
So that we
don't have any regrets.

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:28.472
If I ever lost the
ability to draw my bow...

00:22:28.514 --> 00:22:31.016
...then I might as well die!

00:22:31.058 --> 00:22:34.103
You know how I feel!

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:36.772
I'm gonna do my
best and not lose!
