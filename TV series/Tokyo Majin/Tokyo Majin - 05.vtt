[Woman screams]

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:52.094
[MOTHER]
Takeo! It's dinner time!

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.972
[desperate gasping]

[animalistic growl]

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:28.589
[scrapes]

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.842
[RAITO] If it's our fate,
I'll see you again.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.477
[KYOICHI]
When it was all over,

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.855
we still didn't have a
real good idea what happened,

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.899
and Lightening Head
just disappeared.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.694
[YUUYA] Can someone
explain to me how a human

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:57.946
can turn into
one of those demons?

00:03:57.988 --> 00:03:59.322
Is it possible
that the other demons

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.991
we've fought have
all been the same?

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.827
It's not. This one
wasn't like them at all.

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.412
It was a human with
a Power, who had been

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:08.248
intentionally transformed
into something else.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.958
Who or whatever did
this to him knew exactly

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.251
what they were doing.

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:12.794
My guess is that they
cast a spell on him

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.172
that intensified his
malice and hatred.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.924
[KYOICHI] A spell...
Is that what the Dark Arts

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:18.925
are supposed to be?

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.636
But who on earth
would do such a thing?

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.013
[gasps]

00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:26.600
It's that guy.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.685
[KISARAGI] At any rate,
this is not to say that anyone

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.813
with the Power is going
transform into a demon.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.733
It's more than likely that
the spell only works on people

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:37.235
who have darkness
in their hearts.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.821
[YUUYA]
Darkness in their hearts, huh?

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.573
Is there anybody on
the planet who doesn't

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.784
fit that description?

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:52.876
But still... This is our
fight! So we have to win it.

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:54.461
We can't give up now.

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:57.714
And more importantly, we can't
forget our obligation to

00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:00.133
protect the innocent
people that this creature

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:03.220
is preying upon
every single day.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.183
[Girl in fire screaming]

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:15.273
[GIRL IN FIRE] Help me, Aoi!
Please! Help me! Aoi!

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.322
I want to save them all,
I want to save every person

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:23.448
I can.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.991
Even the souls of
those who have become

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.203
those horrible demons.
I have to try.

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:30.831
I won't give up.
I'm going to fight.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.416
[KYOICHI]
Madam President got my vote.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.714
[KOMAKI]
Count me out.

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:46.179
Are all of you people out of
your freakin' minds or what?

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.265
You saw what that
thing was capable of!

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:51.101
This isn't a game. You guys are
gonna be fighting for real!

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:52.561
Don't you understand that?

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:56.356
C'mon, Aoi. If a demon has a
chance, it's going to kill you.

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:59.109
[KOMAKI] Let's stop playing
superhero and be normal again.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.822
Can't we please just go back to
being high school students?

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.950
W'e've been waiting for the
summer break for a long time.

00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:08.827
Remember how we talked
about hanging out by the pool

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.954
or the beach all summer long?

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.709
[AOI] Komaki... I understand
what you're saying, but this

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.253
"thing" has already started
whether we like it or not.

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:20.755
We're the only ones who
can do anything about it.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.760
[KOMAKI] Of course, you're
always such a good Samaritan!

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.972
Is saving a bunch of strangers
really that important to you?

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:32.100
You don't even have the power to
do it all by yourself!

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:41.276
[KOMAKI] Tono's not the only one
having a rough time with this.

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:48.033
I... I can't handle all this.
It's too much! I hate you, Aoi!

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.034
[YUUYA]
Wait!

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:53.121
[light rainfall]

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:56.917
She'll be alright.
Komaki will understand.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.546
[TATSUMA] So Anko's still locked
herself up in her house?

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.651
[DETECTIVE] The witnesses all
confirmed she said something.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:25.528
Before she collapsed, they heard
her repeating the word 'dog.'

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.031
Think that she
could have dreamt it?

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:31.743
[MIKURIYA] She said 'dog' huh?
Sure have been a lot of strange

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.245
incidents occuring lately...

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:38.041
[STUDENT LEANING]
Hey, did you hear what happened?

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:41.586
[STUDENT WITH TIE]
Yeah... It got Takeo, too.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.880
[STUDENT LEANING] Yeah. Guess
the curse is real after all.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.799
Man, I'm in deep shit.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.426
[NEWSCASTER]
And now in the news...

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.512
There have been a
series of bizarre incidents

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:53.390
throughout the
metropolitan area, in which

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.934
high school students have
collapsed into comatose states.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.853
As of now, the police are not
ruling out any possibilities

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.605
while they continue
their investigation,

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.066
but there are still
many unanswered questions.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:09.155
[KOMAKI]
Damn it...

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.366
[TALL ARCHER] Hey. Looks
like Sakurai's totally lost

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.201
her touch today!

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:14.703
[SHORT HAIRED ARCHER] Maybe
something happened to her

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:15.996
over vacation?

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.498
[BRUNETTE ARCHER] Do you think
she had a fight with Misato?

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.542
[TALL ARCHER]
Yeah, a lovers' quarrel.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:31.845

[KYOICHI] For cryin' out loud,
it's summer vacation!

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.310
What's do you need to practice
your club stuff for?

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:42.772
I swear, I'll never understand
how you muscle-heads think.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:47.777
Okay, what are you doing here?
Did you want something?

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.654
[KYOICHI] Have you been thinking
about what Kisaragi said

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.531
the other day?

00:08:51.573 --> 00:08:55.618
You know, "darkness in their
hearts" stuff...

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.830
I'm sure you don't have
anything to worry about.

[ANKO'S MOM] I apologize,
but Kyoko says she doesn't

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.819
want to see you today.

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.404

I understand.

[cat meows]

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.589
[MAIKO] You like that,
little fella?

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:52.509
So it looks like somebody's
finally adopted you, huh?

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.135
What a lucky kitty.

[SAGAYA]
Aoi...

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:24.893
Now this is much more
interesting.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.813
[ANKO'S MOM] Kyoko! She
keeps coming by every day

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:32.192
to say hi, the least
you can do is see her!

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:35.445
I'm sorry for the
way she's been acting.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:49.584
[AOI] It's me, Anko. It's Aoi.
Look, I'm really sorry about

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.628
everything that
happened the other day.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.713
I can understand what
you saw must've been really

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:56.716
frightening for you.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:02.263
But, uh, don't worry
about all that stuff, okay?

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.558
Y'know, like Tatsuma
and Kyoichi flying around.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.435
That's really no big
deal, see, there's a perfectly

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:10.730
reasonable explanation...
And you know Yuuya and Komaki

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:14.901
are normal people just like
you, they're like...

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:18.404
they're... so not normal...

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:23.952
Look. We won't put you through
anything like that again.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.703
We'll do our best to
protect you no matter what,

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.205
so don't worry.

Don't worry, okay?

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:31.501
[AOI] The pool opens
tomorrow, and everyone's

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.670
looking forward to it since
we haven't seen each other

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:38.967
in a while, so... So
make sure you come, too, okay?

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:45.890
By the way, do you remember...
How you were on

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.351
Minami Middle Shool's
newspaper, and I went to

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.270
Kagura Middle School
and you interviewed me

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:54.148
for an article?
I was so excited about it!

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.443
Up until then, people
just saw me as an honor student.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.153
That was all anyone
seemed to know about me,

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:01.447
and I felt so much pressure.

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.492
It was suffocating. But your
article really changed things

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:06.452
for me, and I've wanted
to be friends with you

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:09.539
ever since.
I mean that.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:33.688
[crickets chirping]

Hello, Misato residence.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:56.627

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.921
[KISARAGI] I've got some
business I need to take care of.

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:02.300
It may be a while before
I'm able to contact you again.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:05.178
Have there been
any new developments?

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:07.597
Uh, not, not really.
You don't sound like you're

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:09.599
in your shop now, Hisui.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.392
[KISARAGI] There's a certain
rare vase I'm looking for,

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:14.687
so I'm making the rounds
at the area's antiques shops.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:17.315
Another one of those requests
from Dad, huh?

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:20.318
Well, good luck finding it.
And you take care.

[KYOICHI] Hey. You're lookin'
kinda bummed today.

[TATSUMA]
Morning.

[KOMAKI] Listen, you two.
I'm sorry about before.

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:28.594
[TATSUMA] It's no big deal.
But I think...

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.019
[GIRL] Hey,
long time no see!

00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:40.022
[GIRL'S FRIEND] Yeah! You go
anywhere over summer break?

Is something wrong?

[KYOICHI] I can't believe we've
gotta take this summer school

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:04.380
on a nice day like this!

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:08.468
This sucks. What are you doing
in here, anyway, Tatsuma?

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.847
I am the teacher.
You are the student.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.850
Do they even know how
lucky they are? It's not fair!

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:17.977
How come only the girls are
allowed to go swimmin' today?

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.062
I wanna go swimmin' too!

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.401
[MARIA]
I don't get it, Mr. Hiyu.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.028
When we tested
you for placement here,

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:29.405
it looked like you should
be in the top of your class,

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.199
so what happened?

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:32.867
[light laugh]

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:37.705
[binder smack]

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.081
[TATSUMA]
Ow, that hurt.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.668
Hey, guys,
check it out! Over there.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.253
[HANNABATA]
Look, Captain, it's Sakurai.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.772
[GIRL] Stop starin'
at us, ya pervert!

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.357
[GIRL'S FRIEND]
Dirty old man!

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:09.028
[girls chattering]

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:27.838
[AOI]
Hey, Anko!

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:33.636
[AOI]
Good to see you!

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:45.773
You'd rather be with her.
Is that it?

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.944
[KOMAKI] Answer me!
Who's more important to you,

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:52.029
me or Tono, huh?

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:58.035
[AOI]
Komaki...

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:03.291
[KOMAKI]
Aoi?

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:47.543
[SAGAYA] Hello, Aoi.
It's good to see you again.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:57.803
[SAGAYA] Come.
Come with me.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.392
Wha--?
Huh?

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.566
[MARIA]
Hey, get bac...

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.945
You are so gonna
fail this class!

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:23.204
[KOMAKI] Aoi... Aoi! What is it?
What's going on?! Aoi! Aoi!

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:24.080
What's wrong with her?

00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:25.289
[KOMAKI]
Snap out of it!

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.458
--Somebody call an ambulance!
--What's wrong with you, Aoi?!

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:33.589
I might have guessed...
Hey. Horaiji.

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.801
Take her to Sakura-ga-o-ka
Central Hospital.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.761
I'll take full responsibility.

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:43.182
What?! But that place...
Hey, how did you know

00:19:43.224 --> 00:19:44.767
we needed your
help here, anyway?

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.144
This is no time to
stand around arguing, Horaiji!

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.438
We have to do something
to help her right now!

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.607
Quick, show us
where to take her.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:52.858
Right...

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:55.403
Is she okay?!

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:26.183
[TATSUMA] You know I don't get a
good feeling from this place...

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:29.103
So figured it out, huh? See,
that's why I like you, Tatsuma.

00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:31.897
What? Is there something
wrong with this place?

00:20:31.939 --> 00:20:34.024
It just looks like
an ordinary hospital...

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.276
[KYOICHI] Personally,
I'd rather be anywhere

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.861
in the world but here.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:37.903
That's cause
there's someone here

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:39.905
that I'm no
match for, period.

00:20:40.281 --> 00:20:42.074
Hello!

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.209
There aren't even any patients
here, let alone doctors...

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.879
This place isn't
gonna stay open long!

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.674
[reverberating stomps]

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:04.472
What's that...
that sound?

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:06.932
[KYOICHI]
Here she comes.

00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:09.935
[stomps increase in frequency]

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.824
Long time no see, Kyoichi?

00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:26.160
I guess.

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:28.662
I heard from Inugami
a little while ago.

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:31.415
He let me know
you'd be stopping by.

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:33.709
[uneasy laugh]

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.297
Welcome everyone!

00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:43.135
[MAIKO]
It's that girl!

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.341
Hey, Tendo. You look
like you're having fun?

00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:25.719
[TENDO] Well, there's someone
I gave a new toy to, you see.

00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:30.307
Now I'm curious to find out how
he's going to dance for us.

00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:34.770
And this one, as well.
