WEBVTT

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.555
[AOI] Don't die! Live!

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:15.098
Please...

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.143
Live! Live!

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:04.666
[SAYO] Tatsuma.

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.379
Sorry I'm late.

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.723
[KOMAKI sighs]

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.475
Just look at all
those underclassmen,

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.435
just full of energy.

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.437
Must be nice...

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:29.524
[KOMAKI] God, I wanna
draw my bow again!

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.360
[KYOUICHI] Look,
it's never gonna happen!

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:32.486
I mean, we're all out of here

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:33.904
at the end of
September, remember?

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.906
[KOMAKI] How can a guy
who's never joined a club

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.616
in his life know how it feels?

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:41.161
You don't understand how hard it
is for me to watch and not do!

00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:43.497
[KYOUICHI] Hey,
leggo of me, She-male!

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.458
Dude, your little lady-husband's
freaking out on me!

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.126
[YUUYA] Sakurai,
have you tried this?!

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.420
It's a brand new flavor,
mint-pineapple!

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:53.131
[KOMAKI] What?
Ooh, it does look good.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.549
--[YUUYA] Doesn't it?
--[KOMAKI] But what is it?

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:55.676
[YUUYA]
It's a new kind of gum.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.219
[KOMAKI] Gum?
I think I'll pass.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.595
[YUUYA] Oh, come on,
try a little piece.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.639
[KOMAKI] Ugh, no way!
It's pineapple gum--

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.099
[YUUYA] But I went
out and bought it

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.517
--[KOMAKI] Oh. Hi, Aoi.
--[YUUYA] for you to try.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:04.935
[KYOUICHI]
Are you finally done?

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:08.522
[AOI] Yeah. I'm sorry
I kept you all waiting.

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.691
[YUUYA] All right...
Let's get going.

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.693
[KOMAKI] Hey, Aoi. Don't you
think we stepped down

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:14.778
too early this year?

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.155
Huh? You mean
from club activities?

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.782
[KOMAKI]
Yeah. I mean, sheesh,

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:20.909
I'm so out of shape right now.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.710
[KISARAGI] With all the recent
appearances of the demons,

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.503
I've made a chart of
where all the incidents

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.213
have been occuring.

00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:34.881
[KOMAKI] Wow, so many.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.175
[YUUYA] Looks like the attacks
increased all at once,

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:40.971
spreading out from the area
near Sakuragaoka Hospital.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.557
Since nightmare-boy Sagaya.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:48.103
[KISARAGI] Yes, that, and
last month's incident

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.647
with the blonde high school
girl, Sera Rikudo...

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.649
But the curious thing
is that since then,

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:55.318
the demons haven't
shown themselves once.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.405
[KOMAKI] You don't think
they've given up on

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:01.116
attacking Tokyo, do you?

00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:02.617
I mean, that'd
be pretty awesome,

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.828
don't you think, Aoi?

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.373
Yeah. That would... be nice.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:11.126
Tch. I wouldn't
hold my breath.

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:15.630
Kozunu... Tendo Kozunu.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.091
[KISARAGI] Yes. It does
seem fairly unlikely

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.011
that he would drop his
vendetta just like that.

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.637
I'm sure it will be
only a matter of time

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.265
before he comes up
with a new plan.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:29.978
Perhaps he's... in the
process of carrying one out.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:45.577
[YUUYA] So all we do now
is sit around patiently

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.287
for the enemy to
show up again, huh?

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:48.330
[KYOUICHI chuckles]

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.915
Well, when it finally comes,

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.417
I'm gonna be ready to go
on one hell of a rampage.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.003
[KOMAKI] Hey, Aoi.

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.797
Earth to Aoi!

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:59.466
[AOI] Huh? Oh. Sorry.

00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:00.967
[KOMAKI] What's the matter?

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.346
[AOI] Well, I've just been kind
of busy lately, that's all.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.140
[KOMAKI] You mean with the
student council transition?

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:08.391
[AOI] Yeah.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.852
[KOMAKI] Oh, man,
you're such an overachiever.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.646
You know, you've
really got me worried!

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:13.730
[AOI laughs]

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:16.650
I appreciate
your concern, Komaki.

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.235
[KYOUICHI] Okay... so,

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.529
how's about we grab some ramen
while we're in the area?

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.155
Ooh! I'm in for that!

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:25.033
Sure. I was just
startin' to get hungry.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.576
Whaddaya say, Aoi,
you comin' with us?

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.537
There's nothing like a hot,
steaming bowl of ramen

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.789
when you're feeling
down in the dumps. Right?

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.290
Heh. I guess
you're right.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.834
[TATSUMA] Well, I think
I'll be heading home.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.126
[ALL] Huh?

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.337
See you guys tomorrow, okay?

00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:45.512
Hey, what's up with him?

00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:47.013
[ANKO giggles]

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.765
Would you like the scoop?

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.642
[KYOUICHI] Oh crap... Anko.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.478
What's that supposed to mean?!

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.523
[metal clangs]

00:05:56.565 --> 00:06:00.318
Ha! The reason Tatsuma's
in such a hurry is this.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.862
[ANKO] Ta-dah!

00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:04.614
[KYOUICHI]
Hey, could that be...

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:06.825
[YUUYA]
Is he on a... date?!

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:07.826
[KOMAKI] Awww...

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:11.288
Look at Tatsuma and his date.
They look so sweet.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.708
[KYOUICHI] That girl...

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:15.876
[ANKO laughs]

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.836
I'll bet you're surprised.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:20.547
I'll bet you never suspected
that Tatsuma would have

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.466
a secret like this, did you?

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:24.843
[ANKO]
Her name is Sayo Hirasaka.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:27.721
She's in Class 2-5 at Sakurazuka
High School in Shinagawa.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.640
She's 5'6" and weighs 93 pounds.
And her measurements...

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:32.017
...are a secret.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.226
Who gives a damn.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:34.102
[ANKO] No offense.

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.896
Mmm.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:38.523
[ANKO] Also, she enjoys
watching TV drama series.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:43.069
And her favorite word
is... "reincarnation."

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.948
[KYOUICHI] Reincarnation?

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.117
That's, like, got something
to do with religion, right?

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.453
[YUUYA] Master Arai
told me about that.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.497
It's the idea that souls
are reborn again and again,

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.209
and continue to wander this
world of confusion and pain.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.295
[KOMAKI] What else?

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:03.423
[ANKO] Well,
this is interesting.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:07.052
Both her parents died during
that whole crow-attack thing.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.346
She somehow managed
to survive it,

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.348
but from what I hear,
she's been in the hospital

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.642
until just recently.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.560
[KOMAKI] I see...

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:19.981
What's the matter with you?

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.859
You've got the
grumpiest face right now.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.903
Uh, it's nothin'.

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.238
[ANKO] Anyway, she's got
relatives nearby in Izu

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.658
who are planning
on taking her in.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.953
[gasps]

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.287
[ANKO] Oh, no!

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.289
I just can't sit around
eating ramen all day!

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.917
I was in the middle of
investigating a big scoop!

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.210
I'll let you
take care of the tab!

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.169
[KYOUICHI] Huh?

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.713
[ANKO] Consider it
payment for the info.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.383
Man. I tell you what,
that girl's gonna be

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:47.634
[KYOUICHI]
one hell of a teleporter.

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:48.843
[YUUYA and KOMAKI] Reporter!

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.929
[KYOUICHI] Shut up!
I know what I'm sayin'!

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:53.431
[whimpers softly]

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:55.934
Are you all right there, miss?

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.519
[AOI sobbing]
--Hey...

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.104
Aoi?

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.189
[chuckles]

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:10.615
[GRANDFATHER] Hisui,
listen to me carefully.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.909
It is about time
that you also learned

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:18.665
of our family's "other"
mission, which we must uphold!

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.792
It is said that
at times, one appears

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.336
who has the power to
read the Dragon Stream.

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:26.256
This person can discern
who are the chosen among us

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:28.466
and lead them
to eternal salvation.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.011
That individual often
holds great power

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.637
in whatever era they exist,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.765
and this is a source
of much conflict.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:39.978
They're known as
the Bodhisattva Eye!

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.857
Hisui, listen to me
carefully and don't forget

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.901
that if the one who
possesses that star of fate

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:50.905
ever appears to you,
you must immediately...

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.741
[KISARAGI] Lady Aoi...

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:02.834
[KYOUICHI] Man...
when you look at it up close,

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.502
it's pretty damn amazing.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.756
Thanks I should be
all right from here on.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.466
[KYOUICHI] Right.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:13.303
Well, then you have
a good night, okay?

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:16.181
[AOI] Thanks so much for
walking me back, Kyouichi.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.682
[KYOUICHI] Sure.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:27.734
[KYOUICHI] Aoi!

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.194
[gasps]

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:33.490
Don't let everything
weigh you down.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:38.495
[KYOUICHI] If anything happens,
then say so. Got it?

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:59.140
[chanting]

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:02.268
[gasps]

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.360
Why, good evening.

00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:11.319
[gasps]

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.321
Tendo Kozunu,
what are you doing here?!

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:15.156
[TENDO] You don't
look happy to see me.

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:19.744
That bitter expression
is ruining your pretty face.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.955
What are you doing here?

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:25.792
That's one good question.

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:28.461
[TENDO] As a matter of fact,
I'm here this time

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.463
to give my regards.

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:31.965
Regards?

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:33.842
Yes.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.969
Mm.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.598
This power.
You're terrified of it.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.350
[TENDO] You've felt
something powerful

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.978
squirming inside you,
haven't you?

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:48.815
But you're pretending
you're not aware of it.

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:50.316
Stop it...

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.443
[TENDO] Your power
is bringing misfortune

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.988
to everyone around you.

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:56.322
It seems like wherever you go,

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.616
people are getting hurt,
and some of them

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.244
are even losing their lives.

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:05.415
[AOI] That's not...

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.876
That has nothing
to do with me!

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:11.296
[TENDO] I'm the only one
who can help you control it.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.715
This little power of yours
needs harnessing.

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:15.758
So what do you say?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.678
I just wanna protect--
I wanna protect them.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.555
I don't want
anyone else hurt.

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.099
That's all the more reason,
don't you think?

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.810
Just come along with me
and you'll be able to...

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:28.688
protect everyone in the world.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.482
All of your friends
and everyone in this city...

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.359
can be safe.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.905
[TENDO] Well, I guess
hearing all that is enough

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:39.240
to make your
head spin, huh?

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:42.577
But it's the truth,
my little Aoi.

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:47.540
If you really do want to save
Tokyo, just say the word.

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:50.418
I can come
to you any time.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.672
Sooner or later your fate's
going to catch up with you.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.926
Just try to remember
that much at least,

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.386
Aoi Misato.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:15.610
[AOI] Yes. Okay. I'll see
you tomorrow night, then.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:42.303
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.638
[sighs]

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.098
Huh?

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:50.103
[INUGAMI] Take her to
Sakuragaoka Central Hospital.

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:53.314
I'll take full responsibility.

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.733
[KYOUICHI] Who is
that geezer anyway?

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.575
[KYOUICHI] Yo.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.703
Hey, Kyouichi.

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:08.913
[KYOUICHI] It looks like you're
in quite a hurry there, man.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.999
[TATSUMA] Yeah. Gotta take
care of some stuff.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.084
[KYOUICHI] I see...

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.669
"Stuff," huh?

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.045
[TATSUMA] Yeah.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:22.218
You, uh... you know, right?

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.014
I can't talk.
I have to get going.

00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:28.933
Uh!

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:30.727
Tatsuma!

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.319
Sheesh!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.404
[KYOUICHI]
It's not like they'll never

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.072
see each other again.

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:48.119
[ANKO humming]

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.747
[ANKO] I've been running
nothing but scary stories

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:53.583
on the front page lately.
I guess I can't forget about

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:57.170
my female readers,
though, can I?

00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:58.921
Hmm...

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.969
[AOI] This is...

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.180
[TATSUMA] It's my destiny.

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:09.015
[TENDO] Sooner or later
your fate's going to

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.683
catch up with you.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.394
Just try to remember
that much at least,

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.730
Aoi Misato.

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:18.232
[AOI] My fate?

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.527
Is it the same for Tatsuma?

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.237
[groans]

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.414
[SAYO sighs]

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:36.667
I guess I've gotta say goodbye
to this city, too, huh?

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.379
[TATSUMA] We can see each
other again any time.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.928
[TATSUMA] Here,
just what you requested.

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:50.890
Ah! I can't believe
you remembered!

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:52.934
And this one tells time.

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:53.893
[gasps]

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.895
[SAYO] Oh, Tatsuma...!

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.652
Huh... So how does this
thing take a picture?

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:04.946
Oh. You should
stand back.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.197
What?

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:07.657
--[SAYO] Uh...
--[camera shutter]

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:12.078

Tatsuma, you're so funny.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.579
[TATSUMA] I am?

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:16.499
[TATSUMA] Um...

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.417
[SAYO] Huh?

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:18.709
[TATSUMA] You know
those flowers you took

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.420
to the graveyard
yesterday...?

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:21.879
[SAYO] The sweet peas?

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.340
[TATSUMA] Yeah. You know
people don't usually

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:26.342
put those on graves, right?

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:29.220
[SAYO] They were my
mom's favorite flower.

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:32.723
[SAYO] My uncle's family
that I'll be living with,

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:36.769
well, he told me that they
grow sweet peas on their farm.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.146
I've been there once,

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:40.982
but I was so young
I don't remember.

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:43.109
[SAYO] He told me the
flowers would be in bloom

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.027
all December long.

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:47.738
I can't wait to see them.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.868
[TATSUMA] Sure.
That sounds beautiful.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:56.914
[AOI gasps]

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.374
That's Tatsuma.

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:18.019
[KISARAGI chants]

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.821
Houraiji. Why are you here?

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:29.655
[KYOUICHI] Heh.

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:32.408
I got a bad feeling when I saw
you close up shop early.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.910
So I follow you a little ways

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:37.163
and I catch you pulling out
that lethal weapon there.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.207
You know, I really
hate it when people try an'

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.584
keep secrets from me.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:42.877
[KYOUICHI] You're the
one who told me to

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.962
nose around
for stuff like this.

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:46.464
So how 'bout
you just 'fess up

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.591
and give it to me straight?

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.095
[KYOUICHI]
Say something, dammit.

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:54.722
[KISARAGI grunts]

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:59.101
[KYOUICHI huffs]
It's about Aoi, isn't it?

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.230
[KYOUICHI] Kisaragi.

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.357
What's going on
with Aoi right now?

00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:06.567
What are you tryin' to do?

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.948
[KIARAGI] The power which
Lady Aoi possesses...

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:15.409
What about it?
Tell me about Aoi's power?

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:20.581
[KISARAGI]
The Bodhisattva Eye.

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:21.999
[KYOUICHI]
The Bodhisattva Eye?

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.085
What's that supposed to be?

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:25.503
[KISARAGI] It's an
accursed power that will

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.421
lead to the
world's destruction.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.048
At least that's what
it's supposed to do.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.883
[KYOUICHI]
What? Destruction?

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:32.677
But...

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.763
doesn't that make Aoi
part of the problem, then?

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.974
Has she been protecting
Tokyo with the rest of us

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.393
or hasn't she?!

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:43.980
The incidents with the demons
have been part of a plan.

00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:46.315
[KISARAGI] I believe that
plan is to awaken Aoi's...

00:17:46.357 --> 00:17:50.027
or rather, the Bodhisattva
Eye's long-dormant power.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.408
In the hope of finally
awakening that power,

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:57.660
Kozunu sent the demons here.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:18:00.621
[KISARAGI] He's been slowly
leading Tokyo into chaos!

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.415
[gasps]

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:06.544
Hisui, listen to me
carefully and don't forget

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:09.422
that if the one who
possesses that star of fate

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:13.509
ever appears to you,
you must immediately...

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:16.137
[KYOUICHI] So what are
you gonna do about it?

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:19.181
[KISARAGI] That kind of power
must never exist in this world.

00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:20.516
...kill that person,

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:23.060
regardless of what their
circumstances may be!

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.146
[GRANDFATHER] This person must
be vanquished by the hand

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:29.233
of a Kisaragi before the
Dragon Stream is disrupted!

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.693
[KISARAGI] Naturally,
we can't allow them

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.653
to get their hands on her.

00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:35.781
Then what you're sayin'...

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:38.117
is that you're
gonna kill Aoi?!

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.081
Heh. It was naÃ¯ve of me
ever to have trusted you

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:45.958
in the first place.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.670
Hey, Pasty. Get ready
to meet your maker.

00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:51.297
You simpleton.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.758
What would you
know about duty?

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.259
[BOTH grunt]

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.771
[KYOUICHI] You promised--

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.108
[KYOUICHI] Aah!

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.534
[gasps]

00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:25.831
[KYOUICHI] You promised
you'd protect her!

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.796
[KYOUICHI] So I guess
that was all just a lie?

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:36.467
And instead of doing
what you said you would...

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:40.304
you came out here to slice
your gut open like a coward.

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:43.140
And you tell me about duty?!

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:46.227
This is it.
I'm done with your crap.

I wanna save them?

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:46.662
More than my own life?

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:49.290
I had no idea
what I was saying!

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.958
I said that I wanted
to protect people,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.918
but all along...

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.129
All along the one
behind it was...

00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:56.297
[sobs]

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:57.757
[AOI] Uh...!

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:18.903
[SOLDIERS] It's all your
fault. It's because of you.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.780
[whimpers]

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:25.284
[YOUNG TENDO]
Mother? Mother?

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.411
Mother!

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:38.339
[TENDO] Stop it.
Don't come any closer!

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.427
[sighs]

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.143
[KYOUICHI] Aoi!

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:53.479
Aoi!

00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:05.658
[chiming]

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:07.910
What the hell--?

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:08.911
[gasps]

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:11.455
What on earth is... that?

00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:17.044
[SAYO] Thanks for
keeping me company.

00:22:17.086 --> 00:22:20.214
[TATSUMA] Well, I didn't
really do anything...

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:23.676
[SAYO] Tatsuma. Thank you.

00:22:23.717 --> 00:22:24.635
[TATSUMA] Hm?

00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:26.136
[SAYO] Well...

00:22:27.555 --> 00:22:28.806
[beeping]

00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:30.099
[SAYO gasps]

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.559
Goodbye.

00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:37.940
[distant horn]

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:41.110
It's all right.
I'll make the trip with you.
