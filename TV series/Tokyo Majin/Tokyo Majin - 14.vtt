No!

What do you say about
casting a little magic?

to your meal today, Hiyu?

Oh! Oh, it's so good!

What's the matter, Misato?

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.424
Your current grades have not
been the usual high marks

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:31.592
as they should be.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:35.137
With the big exams coming up,
this is no time to slouch.

[AOI]
I'm sorry...

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:39.308
Considering your past grades,
I'm sure you'll be fine, but...

If you are having any problems,
come talk to me, okay?

I'll do what I can to help.

Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much.

Oh, by the way...
does Hiyu seem okay to you?

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.069
Huh?

[MARIA] He was out all
of last week, you know?

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:56.992
I wouldn't expect him to be
out sick. I must admit he

00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:59.828

Yeah, for now at least.

Heh... haven't decided yet.

Not yet? But you had career
counseling, didn't you?

Sure I have, but still... Aww,
what do I want to be anyway?

to make sure the

[IWAYAMA laughs]
Considering the luck is fine,

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.050
but what's most important
is that the name reflects your

"lucky" it might be.

maybe I could help out

help out Misato.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.910
[MAN B]
They call it "amnesia"

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.453
when you can't
remember nothin', right?

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:39.788
[MAN C] Depressing to see
a young thing...

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:44.417
ALAN Hey, girl! C'mon over here!
This stuff is deelish.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.170
You come have some sushi
with us now, y'hear?

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:48.505
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.548
That's right, girlie,
you join in, too!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.926
[MAN D]
You wanna be friends with us?!

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:55.929
Here we go.

00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.182
[AZUMABASHI]
Odds!

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.684
But it's even. Take a look.

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:02.936
Eh! Again?!

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.105
Jeez. Where'd you
learn the game?

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:08.274
Amazing! Please let me
be your student!

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:11.486
[TSUTSUMIDORI]
Hey, you got visitors, Boss.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:13.279
So this is where you've been.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.491
She your girlfriend,
Boss? [groans]

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:17.951
Meow.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:18.827
Hi.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.037
Komaki #2.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:23.289
[KOMAKI'S DAD] Komaki,
take care of that delivery

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.415
once you've gotten changed.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.917
[KOMAKI]
All right, Dad.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:26.835
[HINANO]
Lady Komaki?

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.546
[KOMAKI]
Huh? Hinano?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.675
[YUUYA] So you've
called everyone, right?

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.343
[KYOUICHI]
And going by the mood,

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.929
you probably didn't call us
here for a friendly dinner.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.639
[RYUZAN]
Have a look at this.

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.308
[GROUP gasps]

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.853
[RYUZAN] It appears
he had been thoroughly infused

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:47.313
with the power of the Dark Arts.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:50.525
There is not a trace
of decomposition.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.947
[YUUYA] There's one thing
I don't quite understand.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.407
[RYUZAN]
What might that be?

00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:58.825
[YUUYA]
Kozunu was attempting to

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.243
bring back his ancestors,

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:03.246
who had been wiped out by
the Tokugawa Shogunate...

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:04.164
Is that right?

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.373
[RYUZAN]
Indeed.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:08.877
[YUUYA] Then why would his
ancestors turn on him like that?

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:15.008
[RYUZAN] Their sleep must never
be disturbed, not by anyone.

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:17.927
Not even by their
own descendant.

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:23.391
[AOI] Then why would he
have even tried?

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:28.354
There is something that is
known as the "stars of fate."

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.481
Stars of fate?

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.193
[RYUZAN] All people of
this world are born under

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:35.486
a predetermined star,

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.739
and the path of
their life is guided

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.326
by this particular star.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.952
[KOMAKI]
Like fate?

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.538
I suppose you
could call it that.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.040
All of you coming together,

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:50.668
as well as your battle
against Tendo Kozunu,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.962
was all guided by
the stars of fate.

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:54.505
[AOI]
Stars of fate...

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.049
Gimme a break.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.259
You're tellin' me our lives are
decided from the moment

00:11:58.301 --> 00:11:59.719
we're born?

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.596
That's fuckin' bullshit.

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:04.933
Lemme tell you something. That
ain't the reason I'm fighting.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:07.018
I'm with this bunch
of my own free will.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.229
And I fight of my
own free will, too.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.272
That's all there is to it.

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.233
[RYUZAN]
And that is fine.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:17.320
The stars of fate have not
predetermined all things.

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:21.991
Making use of the stars of fate,
or being victimized by them,

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:25.662
is also a matter of
one's own volition.

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:30.250
Your Bodhisattva Eye is
subject to the same principle.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.835
Have you have spoken
to Doctor Iwayama?

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.087
[AOI]
Yes.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.091
[IWAYAMA] The healing powers
of Aoi Misato's

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:40.885
Bodhisattva Eye
are fundamentally different

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.137
from my own.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.890
I treat patients by sending
my own chi

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:48.935
into them to extract
their negative energy.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:49.769
[MAIKO]
Yes.

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.105
However, she is different.

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:57.902
She does no more than activate
and draw out their vital energy.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:01.072
It's not that she's actually
giving them strength.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:03.950
[MAIKO] But if she's able to
save people that way, then...

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:07.996
There is a limit to the amount
of energy a single life holds.

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:11.207
If too much energy is
drawn out too suddenly...

00:13:11.249 --> 00:13:15.211
You mean it could shorten
the subject's life?

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:20.300
Then resurrecting those who have
already lost their lives would--

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:22.677
[IWAYAMA] Would entail paying
a much harsher price

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:26.514
than losing some
of one's life force.

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.599
It's a dreadful power.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:33.062
But if that is the star
of fate she bears...

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.108
[AOI]
If that is my star of fate,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.319
I will take on this challenge.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.946
Because I have my friends
in this fight.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:45.783
If meeting all of you were
guided by my star of fate,

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.785
then I'm sure.

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:53.916
If you, Aoi Misato, are able
to better control your power,

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.086
then you'll be able
to use it to save lives.

00:13:57.128 --> 00:14:00.882
If you persevere, I will do
all that is within my power

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:02.300
to assist you.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:04.635
[AOI]
Thank you very much.

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.513
[KYOUICHI]
So why are we here?

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:11.059
Did you call us here just
to share that story with us?

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.810
That's not all, is it?

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:20.318
Uh? Lady Aoi!

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.778
Hisui?

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:28.493
[KISARAGI] Master... what is
the meaning of this?

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.834
I'm really glad. We were very
worried about you, Hisui.

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.252
[RYUZAN]
You went on a journey,

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:41.130
in order to have the ten sacred
treasures we recovered

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.591
sealed away once more.

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.635
That is yet another
responsibility

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:48.346
of the Kisaragi clan. Well done.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:49.430
[KISARAGI]
It was nothing.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.599
The treasures have been
successfully sealed.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.142
I'll be taking my leave then...

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:56.145
Hold on!

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.980
Where are you going?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.318
[KISARAGI]
If you'll excuse me...

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.362
[AOI]
No! Hisui!

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.572
Lady Aoi, you need to let me go.

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.200
Hisui, please don't go.
Listen to me.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:14.330
Lad Aoi, forgive me, I need...
I need to...

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:15.373
[KYOUICHI]
You couldn't kill Aoi,

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:18.251
so you're ready to die, right?

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.544
Kisaragi.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:24.006
Jeez... cut this shit out,
will ya, Doom 'n Gloom?

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.883
Hisui... here.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:30.972
It fell apart into pieces,

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:33.391
so I picked them all up
and put it together.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:37.395
I hope it's all right, Hisui.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:43.192
I couldn't find all the beads,
there's still a few missing...

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:49.740
But it's a precious memory, so
I'd like you to have it again.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:54.036
Please, Hisui... stay
with us the way you've--

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:56.664
The way you've been
with us this whole time.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.460
[KISARAGI]
Lady Aoi...

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.426
--What's that?
--Huh? The barrier!

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.095
Kyouichi. Look.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.430
Right.

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:15.183
Lady Aoi, please stand back.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:21.772
[gasps] It's him.

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.608
That's impossible.

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.611
[AOI]
Kozunu...

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.029
[KISARAGI]
Tendo?!

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:37.497
[groaning]

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:39.999
Lady Aoi!

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.459
Let me go!

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:44.378
[KYOUICHI] Stop it, Aoi! There's
something wrong with him!

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:50.343
He's transforming into a demon!

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:52.762
[YUUYA]
Master, this is...

00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:55.181
What the hell is that?

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.726
[RYUZAN] The power of the Dark
Arts is manifesting itself

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:02.313
through a spell that
someone has cast upon him.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.066
The human we knew
as Tendo Kozunu

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:08.110
perished in the Todoroki Valley.

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:11.280
What stands before
us now is a demon,

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:15.076
fully changed in
both body and mind.

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:20.248
[DEMON growling]

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:25.002
Stay here, Lady Aoi!

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.755
[AOI]
Let go! I need to save him!

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:28.631
Let go!

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:29.924
[KISARAGI]
Absolutely not!

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.428
We gotta stop him.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:43.771
It didn't do a thing!

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.940
The curse is very
strong with him!

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:52.530
What the hell?

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:53.656
He's not here to kill us.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:54.574
[KOMAKI]
Houraiji!

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.701
[HINANO]
Make a square formation!

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.457
[gasps]

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:05.835
[BOTH grunting]

[barking]

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.320
The Horde.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:35.656
Well, I ain't afraid of
any loyal demons, either!

00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:38.367
Hey, fucker! It looks
like your five buddies

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:40.661
did us a favor and died quietly!

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:43.748
Time for you to get the hell
back to where you came from.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:46.375
[roars]

00:18:49.712 --> 00:18:50.671
[GRANDFATHER]
Kill that person!

00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:53.924
Regardless of what their
circumstances may be!

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:58.846
[AOI]
I will fight.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:02.099
[RYUZAN] There is more
than one path open to you.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:06.604
There is more than
one path open to me.

00:19:09.023 --> 00:19:13.944
[KYOUICHI] You promised
that you'd protect her.

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.822
So I guess that all of
that was just a lie?

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:19.867
Kill the person!

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:23.287
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Aoi Misato.

00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.959
[AOI]
Komaki! Hinano!

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.800
Please! Stop all this!

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:42.348
[inaudible]

00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:56.195
[AOI]
Hisui!

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:59.824
Lady Aoi!

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:03.494
Bastard. You will never...

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:06.664
[KISARAGI grunting]

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:28.644
[AOI]
Hisui... Hisui!

00:20:28.686 --> 00:20:32.231
Hisui, hang on! Hisui!

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:34.150
Hisui!

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:38.028
[KISARAGI]
Lady Aoi...

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.115
[AOI]
Hisui...

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.826
[grunting]

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:47.329
Even if it costs me my life...

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:48.706
[AOI]
No!

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:52.168
That won't happen.

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:57.339
[AOI sobs]
I won't let it.

00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:59.800
I won't let it!

00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:04.346
I've had enough of this.

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:07.725
I don't want anyone else to die.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:12.229
I won't let anyone die...
no matter what!

00:21:19.153 --> 00:21:20.946
[KISARAGI]
Lady Aoi...

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:32.124
[KYOUICHI] Jeez, you sure
like to keep to yourself.

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:35.169
Hey. I'm with you all the way.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.963
I'm here for you.

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:39.757
Kyouichi...

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:52.311
[roars]

00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:54.063
[BOTH yelling]

00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:13.874
[AOI] Why? He hadn't
taken anyone's life!

00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:16.210
[TATSUMA]
He didn't mean to kill us.

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:19.088
[KYOUICHI] He probably wanted us
to finish him off.

00:22:29.932 --> 00:22:37.273
[AOI] You suffered so much.
But it's over now.

00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:40.484
Now you won't have
to suffer anymore.

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:46.073
[TENDO]
Mother! Mother!

00:22:50.953 --> 00:22:52.413
[TENDO]
Mother...

00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:55.833
[TENDO]
Mother...

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:00.671
[TENDO]
Oh, Mother...

00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:20.524
[YUUYA] Master, you said earlier
that someone else had...

00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:22.610
[RYUZAN]
Hmm... Indeed.

00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:26.447
One does not so easily
come across such power--

00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:29.825
not even a descendant of
the powerful Kozunu clan.

00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:33.245
Perhaps someone else
granted him powers...

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:37.124
[YUUYA] Maybe all this is
someone's calling card.

00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:40.252
To let us know that
this isn't over yet.

00:23:41.003 --> 00:23:46.508
[KOMAKI]
That's right. That must be it!

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.929
Aoi's gonna keep on
fighting till the end.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.848
She'll fight until she
loses her own life.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:57.186
If you're gonna die...

00:23:57.227 --> 00:24:00.898
...make sure it's
only after Aoi.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.275
Won't be too late then, will it?
