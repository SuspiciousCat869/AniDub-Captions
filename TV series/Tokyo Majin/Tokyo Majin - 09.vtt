What your favorite foods are, or
what you really like to eat.

[giggles]

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:54.787
What's this?

00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:57.790
Sakurai... What happened
to you the other day

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:00.084
must have been difficult.

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:05.965
[YUUYA] Something like that
could effect anyone, even me...

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:12.555
But I know that you can overcome
this. So I want you to cheer up.

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:18.144
So Sakurai,
I will protect you!

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:21.189
Please you have nothing to fear,
and protect whatever it is

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.940
you want to protect!

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:25.943
[KOMAKI]
Daigo...

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:46.172
[GIRL IN FIRE] Aoi... Help!
Aoi! Help me... Aoi!

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:53.054
It's unsightly, isn't it? But I
would have endured a hundred

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:57.975
times worse if I could have
saved my friend back then.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:02.063
[AOI] This is my stigma for
not being able to help her.

00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:08.069
I'm afraid, terribly afraid of
people suffering or dying.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:12.198
I think about how terrifying
and painful it must have been

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.493
for all those people who
were killed by demons

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:18.037
or who even became demons.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.207
Those thoughts consume me so
much that I feel like I'm

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:24.168
being crushed sometimes.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:34.637
I feel like I'm being pushed
around by some sort of massive

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.848
force that I
can't do anything about.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.851
I guess that's
what we call fate, huh?

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.440
Maybe, you're right about that.

00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:51.654
That's...

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.142
[TATSUMA]
Here.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.747
I've had this birthmark all my
life. It made me feel different

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:46.042
from all the other kids.
I hated it.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.544
But my father told me that
it was a special symbol that

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:51.339
I'll need someday, and
I need to take care of it.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.675
I think I finally understand
what he meant when I came to

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:57.762
Magami High. Fighting all the
demons, it feels like I'm

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:01.307
finally realizing
life's purpose. Even if this is

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.392
my fate,... I'm glad
that I'm able to become

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:04.894
friends with all of you.

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:08.356
So let's face our fate
together without any fear.

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:11.525
Even if we don't know
where it might lead us.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.324

[YUUYA]
What the hell's that?

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.137
That girl, she has no aura.

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:41.555
[AOI]
Huh?

00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:54.985
Hey, do you think, she's going
to be more trouble than

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.362
the last one?

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.322
She's being
engulfed by the energy.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:11.961
[AOI]
Please stop this!

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:14.880
[KYOICHI] Give it a rest! You
won't get through to her now!

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:17.216
That energy will
swallow your will!

00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:25.099
[shrill screaming]

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.143
[KYOICHI]
Here it comes!

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.898
[screaming]

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.276
[AOI] It's no use!
I can't hold it!

[AOI]
Komaki!

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.628
[YUUYA]
Sakurai!

00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:57.840
Thanks for the lunch box.
It was really good.

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:02.386
[KYOICHI] Keep your focus!
She's on her feet.

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:08.184
[maniacal giggling]

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.978

[screaming]

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:22.615
[YUUYA]
What a disaster.

00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:25.117
[KOMAKI] Did she
use up all her power?

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:33.793
[YUUYA] Is this... Is this how
everyone with the Power ends up?

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:35.127
If you can stay
in control of yourself,

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:38.047
I'm sure you'll be okay.

00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:40.132
Stop it.
You can't save her now.

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:48.224
[AOI] Don't die! Live!
Please... live! Live!

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:54.146
[choking]

00:21:55.189 --> 00:21:56.565

[evil laughter]

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:14.792
There she is! I found you,

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:16.669
bo-dhi-satt-va eye!

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.673
[evil laughter continues]

00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:32.601
[KOMAKI]
It's totally awesome!

00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:35.396
I had no idea you had
power like that!
