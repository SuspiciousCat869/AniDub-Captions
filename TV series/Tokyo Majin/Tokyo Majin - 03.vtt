[RYOICHI]
Who the hell are you two?!

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:58.058
[TENDO] How about if
I give you some power?

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.061
Doing this isn't gonna
accomplish anything, man.

00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:03.480
You hate them, right?
You want to get back at them,

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:07.609
don't you? Those guys
who made an ass of you...

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.361
Then why don't you do just that?

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:12.114
There's nothing that can stop
you! 'Cause you, lucky boy,

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.991
have been chosen!
You don't have to worry about

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.409
those idiots anymore!

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.618
Just kill them!

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.287
Do them in!

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:20.747
You hear what I'm saying?
End all of their lives!

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.332
It's so easy!

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:24.042
Just become a demon.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:36.346
[TENDO] I'll show you what's
known as...the Dark Arts.

[MARIA]
Good morning!

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.417
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

00:04:19.885 --> 00:04:22.888
[KYOICHI] Gotta love
those summer uniforms, huh?

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.765
I think girls should
have to wear short skirts

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.683
whether it's hot
or cold out, don't you?

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.936
Or better yet, make
'em all wear swimsuits!

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.439
You know what that
would be? Sexual harassment.

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.108
Oh, come on,
lighten up, would ya?

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:36.735
[KYOICHI]
Hey.

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:39.404
Whaddaya say we, uh, head
down to the beach and pick up

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.199
some honeys this summer, huh?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.116
Hmm.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.743
What?

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:47.913
[TATSUMA] You're not
being serious are you?

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:49.372
[KYOUCHI]
Man, Tatsuma.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.917
Why can't you just
let a guy dream, huh?

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.252
[GIRL] Do you
know what this is?!

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.545
[GIRL'S FRIEND]
Is that a Crow CD?!

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:56.379
[EXCITED GIRL]
Whoa!

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.633
Is that the unfinished one that
they've been talking about?

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:05.013
[KOMAKI] So, what are you
gonna do over the summer, Aoi?

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:05.931
Huh?

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.766
There's a tournament
that's gonna keep me pretty busy

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:10.060
the first couple of
weeks of the break.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.020
But I wanna make
sure that we can still--

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.689
I know!
Maybe we can go on vacation!

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.234
I mean, this is gonna be
our last summer together

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:20.612
as high-schoolers, so we
should make it fun, right?

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.823
I'm sorry, but I
can't go anywhere.

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.367
Why not? 'Cause
student council? Oh!

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.327
The college entrance exams...

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.037
No, that isn't it.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:39.422
Aoi! Listen: you've
got to let it go!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.185
Aoi, we'll
talk about this later.

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.186
Right.

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:00.694
[STUDENT]
Return to your seats.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.865
[TEACHER] So, this will be my
third time lecturing at this

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:08.493
school, and as you know today's
lecture will cover questions

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.954
that came up during
my previous visits...

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:14.332
[KISARAGI] It was a demon
that attacked you the other day.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.626
[YUUYA]
A...what, now?

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.087
[KOMAKI]
A demon? You mean, like...

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.090
[KISARAGI] Demons do exist.
They've made themselves known

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:25.135
numerous times
throughout history.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:26.845
But in recent years
they've tended to remain

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:28.722
hidden in the shadows.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:32.058
Are you telling us that demons
are behind all those murders?

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:37.606
[AOI] But how...how can
you be so sure, Hisui?

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.609
[KISARAGI] For generations it
has been my family's "duty"

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.070
to fight these creatures of
darkness, no matter the cost.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.573
Lady Misato, I
never would've imagined

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:48.074
that you'd become involved.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.911
I can't believe this.
This is just total crap!

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.162
Oh, come on! You were there--

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:54.331
you saw it with
your own two eyes.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.624
I still don't know...

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:56.791
All right!

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.251
[KYOICHI]
So, like, this uh...

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:00.629
power thing... that we used.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.297
What is that exactly?

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.548
[KISARAI]
I'm not sure.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.424
[KYOICHI]
Huh?

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.928
[KISARAGI] But still, even if I
could explain it in full,

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.471
I doubt you could comprehend it.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.848
[KYOICHI]
Huh, what did you just say?!

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.892
Hisui, please.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.772
There is something known
as the "Dragon Stream."

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.065
Dragon Stream?

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.984
[KISARAGI] It's a current of chi
that flows throughout the earth.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.736
Oh! I know about chi!

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.489
It's that, y'know Feng
Shui hocus-pocus, isn't it?

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.366
It tells you if you put
your couch by the front door

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.076
or across the room determines
whether you're gonna be

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.203
happy or rich, right?

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.664
So, you gonna be an
interior decorator now?

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.165
Knock it off.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.750
Knock what off?

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.001
[KISARAGI] There's been a
disturbance in the current

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:41.586
of the Dragon Stream.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.838
I think that could be the reason
the demons seem to be making

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.341
a resurgence of late.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:50.512
Add to that your
powers, as well as...

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:53.640
In any event,
I'll take care of this.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.309
Until then, I'm asking
you to please try to stay

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.144
out of harms way.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.480
I trust that that's
understood, Lady Misato?

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:14.786
Aoi... where could you
have disappeared to?

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:18.498
Uh hey, Sakurai? You know I
brought some meat and potato

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.210
stew today, but I made a little
bit too much just for me, so

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:25.046
if you wanna, uh.. y'know,
maybe have lunch with me, then--

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.339
[KOMAKI]
Aoi!

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.800
[YUUYA]
Wait! Hold on!

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.220
It took me three days
to learn how to make it...

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:35.265
[COOK]
Here you go, nice and hot.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.517
I'll bring the bowl
back after school.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.602
I sure would
appreciate it, Kyoach.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.354
I told you, don't call me that!

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.773
[COOK]
Aloha, Kyoach.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.151
What?

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:50.530
I just wanted to thank
you for the other day.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:51.406
What?

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.116
When the Mor-yo
demon attacked us.

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:53.992
Oh...

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.244
If the two of you hadn't
been on lookout someplace else,

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:58.371
that thing might have
claimed even more victims.

00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:00.206
So I wanted to
thank you in person,

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.583
for all the quick thinking.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.085
So, thank you, from
the bottom of my heart.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:06.796
I imagine that was your plan,
to split away from the rest of

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.590
the group to save more lives?

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.175
[KYOICHI]
Huh?

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.635
[AOI] If we'd all stayed
together in one spot...

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.554
well, the demon
may have gotten away.

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:16.347
But you anticipated that and--

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:20.060
[KYOICHI] Let's not read too
much into this, all right?

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.729
It makes me sick how you guys
pretend to be best buddies

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.564
with each other all the time.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:25.523
[AOI]
But, Kyoichi...

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.192
And you can quit
hovering around me,

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.110
'cause I ain't
buying into your crap!

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:32.405
I'm not lookin' to join forces
with you losers or anyone else.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:34.407
To be honest with you,
I don't give a rat's ass

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:35.784
if anyone dies over this!

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.452
I just want the
chance to test my strength

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:40.080
against somebody
who's worth my time!

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.873
Got that?

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:46.002
[AOI] But... Even so... none of
us really understand anything

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.214
about our powers in the first
place, so... don't you think it

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:53.009
would be better if... well,
Hisui thinks it would be better

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.302
if we all joined forces and--

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:57.222
And have you get in
my way? Forget it!

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.474
[KYOUICHI] You'd just
be dead weight in a fight

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:00.934
and you know it.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.269
If I had nine lives to
spare then maybe, maybe

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:05.146
I'd consider
teaming up with you.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:06.898
[KYOUICHI] If you don't like
hearing that maybe you should go

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.359
do something useful on your own.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:14.572
I'm sorry.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:19.410
Aw, shit.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.162
Now my food's all cold.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:25.208
[TATSUMA] You might've gone
a little overboard.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.210
But I understand how you feel.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.420
[KYOICHI]
How I feel?

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:34.717
[MARIA] Mr Inugami!
I figured I'd find you here.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:35.635
What?

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:38.680
Don't you "what" me!
You and I've got a problem

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.098
if you don't attend
that meeting.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.224
What meeting?

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.893
About guidance counseling
over summer vacation!

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.687
Oh.

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:46.771
That's right.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.982
A lot of disturbing stuff has
been going on lately,

00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:50.483
and we never know
what's gonna happen

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:53.027
once those kids are
away from us on break.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.362
And they're having
enough trouble as it is

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:57.240
with entrance exams
coming up, you know.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:59.159
I'm telling you all
this assuming that you care

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.035
about your students'
emotional states and how they--

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.245
Oh!

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:03.788
[MARIA]
What is it?

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.708
You've been hurt very
badly in the past, haven't you?

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.543
Tell me, what happened?

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:09.627
Ugh!

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:13.548
Why did I even bother?!
I've had about enough of you.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:18.928
[INUGAMI] Worried about
my students, are you?

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.014
Well, aren't you
the model teacher...

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.436
[INUGAMI] These are
from central Japan...

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:47.457
[KOMAKI] You're really
serious about this, huh?

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:48.875
You know, that
Kisaragi guy said

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.210
that we should
stay out of trouble.

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.879
I think maybe we
should listen to him.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.797
Who the heck is this guy?

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.383
He's the son of an antiques
dealer who worked with my father

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:59.385
and grandfather
for number of years.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:01.888
He recently inherited
the family business.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.765
So he'll come by
the house with old pots

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.725
or other weird artifacts
that my father's asked him

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.852
to find for us, but he...

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:11.940
[terrified scream]

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.776
[panting]

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.920
[low growl]

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:37.423
[roar]

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.677
[snarls]

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:46.057
Tha...that's Kyouichi?

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.102
[low growl]

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.065
[YUUYA]
What are you two doing here?!

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:55.608
[AOI]
Yuuya?

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.277
[KYOUICHI] Meathead?
What the hell are you...

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.779
What do you people
think you're doing?!

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.367
[KISARAGI] This creature
is not the sort of thing that

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.786
you can defeat on your own.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.001
[REPORTER]
It's utter chaos here!

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.837
I-I've never witnessed
anything like the panic that's

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:17.338
going on behind me right now!

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.840
It's because of the crows!

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:22.260
A huge flock of
crows is attacking--

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:25.847
[REPORTER]
Watch out!

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.476
[ANCHORMAN]
Ms. Amano, are you still there?!

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.855
[pandemonium]

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.191
[MAN IN CAR]
Oh my God!

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:38.943
[crash]

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:42.989
[television static]

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.333
[KISARAGI]
A call about Lady Misato?!

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:54.417
[KOMAKI]
That's right!

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.836
I got a call from one
of her housekeepers.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.963
[YUUYA] She wasn't
at school either.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.883
I thought maybe
she'd be over here, but...

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.510
[KOMAKI]
What's going on?

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.932
Why did you let her
go out there alone?

00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:11.893
I told the five of you that
you'd have to stick together

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:15.730
to fight these demons. From the
start I told you that I'd only

00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:19.108
assist if you all stuck
together, but now look at you!

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.610
It's really easy for you
to stand there and make

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:22.362
accusations, but we
don't know what she does

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:23.905
after she goes home!

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.116
[KISARAGI] Quickly!
You've got to go find her

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:28.826
before it's too late.

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:29.911
[KOMAKI]
Daigo, let's go!

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:31.204
[YUUYA]
Right!

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.417
[door slams shut]

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.713
[KISARAGI]
Lady Misato...

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.260
[pandemonium]

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:47.595
[AOI]
I'm so sorry...

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.599
[AOI] Someone else is
killed almost every night now...

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.935
It seems like the
demons must be behind it.

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:56.479
It makes me feel so restless;
I don't want to just sit back

00:14:56.521 --> 00:14:58.106
and let it happen again.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:59.941
But that doesn't
mean that you have to--

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:01.567
[YUUYA]
I feel the same way.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.820
[KYOICHI] Yeah, and I
just want to know how far

00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:06.406
my powers can take me
once it comes down to a fight!

00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:07.907
Right, Tatsuma?

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.033
[TATSUMA]
Huh?

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.743
I think we
should take action.

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:13.371
Please, Hisui,
let me do something!

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:14.747
[KISARAGI]
But, Lady Misato...

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.708
[AOI] I can't just do nothing!
If there's any way at all that

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.128
I'd be able to
protect somebody...

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:23.214
Or not just one person--
if I could protect the people!

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:26.426
of this city...! Please, Hisui!

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.010
I'm begging you!

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:34.225
It seems that the crowd
disturbance is over for now.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:38.563
However, no one can predict when
the next attack might occur.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.273
The experts are
divided on this matter,

00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:43.734
but it seems safe to say that it
will likely be some time before

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.404
people here feel at ease again.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.950
[siren]

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.089
[AOI]
I'm so sorry...

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.633
[siren]

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:10.887
Picking through the trash is
one thing,

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:13.681
but I've never actually
seen a crow attack anyone.

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.934
[ANKO] That's because crows
hardly ever attack humans.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.644
It's not in
their nature, you know?

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.230
[KYOICHI]
Anko?!

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:25.067
[ANKO] Crows only usually attack
during their breeding season.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:27.987
Y'know, when someone comes too
close to a nest full of chicks.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:30.781
But even in those cases
it's just individual birds

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:33.701
that attack,
not an entire flock.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:34.619
[KYOUICHI]
So...

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.871
you wanna tell us what
the hell you're doing here?

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.916
You know I could ask
you the same exact thing.

00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:42.210
What could possibly motivate
two juvenile delinquents

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.253
to investigate this incident?

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.547
Oh. Is that what we're doing?

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.591
We're not "investigating",
we're just out doing

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:49.592
a little shopping.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:50.593
For what?

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.596
Uh, well it's...

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.848
It's for underwear.

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:57.391
Ugh.

00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:00.061
Man, this guy
can't lie for shit!

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.815
Damn!
Stubborn idiot...

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:10.154
[AOI] Let go of me!
Kyouichi, please!

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.074
I told you to
stay out of the way!

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:16.661
I'm gonna do anything I can to
help. I know that I might seem

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.579
helpless compared to the
rest of you guys and maybe

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.748
a little bit weaker, but I--

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.458
Glad to hear you understand.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.210
Now get your ass home,
princess.

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:25.294
I won't!

00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:26.337
Wha'd you say?

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:27.880
I won't go home.

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.549
I'm staying here!

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.675
[KYOICHI]
You little...

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.220
[KOMAKI]
Horaiji!

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.139
Aoi, are you okay?

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:39.308
[KYOUICHI]
Shit, they're all here.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.769
Horaiji! I certainly hope
that you weren't being

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.272
a total jerk to Aoi again.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:47.149
Ha! I was giving your
girlfriend a reality check.

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:49.860
She needs to get her
useless little ass home.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:50.987
Say that again!

00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:51.904
Stop!

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:52.822
It's okay.

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:55.324
You know, why don't you
go home with her, too? I mean,

00:17:55.366 --> 00:17:57.159
it looks to me like you just
wanna have some fun with

00:17:57.201 --> 00:17:59.704
Miss Student Council, right?
So why don't you two

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:02.081
run along to her
little mansion and play house?

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:03.374
Asshole!

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:04.584
Sakurai, don't.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.335
Hey, Daigo, don't you
ever get tired of that

00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:09.171
"daddy will protect you"
song and dance? I do.

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.007
Horaiji! You sonnuva...

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:12.842
Just stop it, everyone!

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:14.135
[ANKO]
What's going on?

00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:15.386
Got me...

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:25.688
A demon.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.363
[battle cry]

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:44.957
[AOI]
But he's...

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:45.958
It's a guy.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.501
Not a demon.

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:49.879
[YUUYA] You're telling
me that he has the Power?

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.256
You mean...That guy?

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:57.511
Things got very interesting.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:19:00.222
So, do you think
that we should tell him...

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.224
That his enemies are here?

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:04.226
[KYOUICHI]
Son of a bitch!

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:05.978
[RAITO] Guess I was
right that you weren't just an

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.147
ordinary buncha onlookers.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:18.824
Horaiji!

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:20.951
Not you.

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:21.911
Komaki!

00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:23.120
Don't argue with me.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:26.582
You're not strong enough to
fight this guy and you know it.

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.626
Please, just
stay out of the way.

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:33.297
Where is Ryoichi?

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:35.675
Ryoichi?
What are you talking about?

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:38.761
Tell me! You've all got
the Power, so there's no way

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:40.554
you don't know!

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.475
[RAITO] Are you and Ryoichi in
this together? Did he have

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.186
something to do with those
crows attacking everyone?

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:49.605
[KYOICHI] I have no idea
what you're talking about

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.190
You're talkin' crazy.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:53.651
[RAITO] Yeah, like
hell you don't know.

00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:56.821
I'll beat it outta you!

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.367
Daigo, get outta the way!

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.285
You can't do this on your own.

00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:19.468
Sakurai...what the hell?

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.803
Sakurai.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:22.179
[KYOUICHI]
Didn't I tell you to go home?!

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.432
[KOMAKI] Shut up!
Don't tell me what to do!

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.976
[YUUYA] Stop it, you
guys! Horaiji's right,

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:28.519
you should get outta here.

00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:35.192
[RAITO] The three of
you together and this is all

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:38.654
you've got? This is
one hell of a jam session.

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:41.449
Let's rock!

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:44.535
[ANKO]
He's glowing! No.

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:45.661
He's flying! No.

00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:49.206
He's glowing again!
Wha-What's going on...?

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:01.969
[explosion]

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.611
Man, that was close.

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:23.115
[pained screaming]

00:21:27.578 --> 00:21:28.746
[light chuckle]

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:35.878
[TATSUMA]
Aoi, no!

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:43.052
Aoi.

00:21:43.093 --> 00:21:44.303
Get out of here.

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:45.471
You idiot.

00:21:45.513 --> 00:21:48.182
Get the hell out of here
before you get yourself killed.

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:49.266
Go on!

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:50.976
Go home!

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:52.895
I'm protecting you!

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:56.857
It's what I do.

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:57.900
[chuckles]

00:21:57.942 --> 00:21:59.985
[RAITO] You sure about that?
'Cause you don't seem to have

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:02.029
very much power...

00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:04.198
[AOI] I think that you're
making a huge mistake here.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.325
We're not your enemies.
I have a feeling

00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:07.660
we're after the same thing.

00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:09.912
I think you're looking
for whoever's behind these

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:12.331
crow attacks, and that's exactly
what we're doing here, too.

00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:14.166
We should be working
together instead of trying to

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:15.960
destroy each other.

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.170
And what if I said I don't
believe you.

00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:20.214
If I have to, I'll fight
you with every ounce of

00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:21.799
strength I have!

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:24.552
I'm going to protect my friends
and the people of this city,

00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:26.720
no matter what it takes!

00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:28.305
[KOMAKI]
Aoi...

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:29.473
Sounds like fun.

00:22:29.974 --> 00:22:31.642
Let's see if you can
protect your weak little

00:22:31.684 --> 00:22:33.435
friends from this.

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:43.654
[battle cry]
