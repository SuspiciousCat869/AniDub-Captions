[crowd chattering]

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.769
[AOI]
Tatsuma...?

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.734
Why you little...

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:01.997
Where on earth did they go?

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.333
Could that be...

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.129
[electric guitar shredding]

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.382
[RAITO]
That guitar...

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.677
[KYOICHI] Hey, man where
do you think you're goin'?

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.473
[KYOICHI]
Dammit!

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:20.599
Kyouichi.

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:21.767
[KYOICHI]
Let's get after him.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:22.809
Right.

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.019
Tatsuma...

00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:26.355
[TATSUMA] Make sure you guys
get in touch with Kisaragi.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.981
[KYOICHI] They got
their asses kicked pretty bad

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.066
by Lightning Head.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.151
Do what you can to fix them.

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:32.402
[AOI]
Right.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.947
[electric guitar shredding]

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.333
Ryoichi...

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.590
If it isn't my enemy...

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.518
[RAITO] Ryoichi! It's me!
Don't you recognize me?

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:05.811
[KYOICHI]
Hold it right there!

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.062
You two again.

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:10.315
What's up, Lightening Boy?
Who's your little guitar friend?

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:13.985
[RAITO] This doesn't
concern you. So get lost.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:19.282
[RYOICHI] It doesn't matter
how many of you stupid pigs

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.618
come at me. I'll
slaughter you all.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.787
[KYOICHI] Little punk,
what did you just call us?!

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.915
I believe that I compared
the three of you to pigs.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.338
[electric guitar shredding]

00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:42.597
[RYOICHI] Sound is so incredibly
powerful that it can interfere

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.393
with just about anything
by using vibration alone.

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:47.894
And at my slightest command...

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.606
[KYOICHI]
Hey, Tatsuma, you stupid pig!

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.984
Don't just stand there with
your thumb up your--

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.485
don't look at me like
that, punk!

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:58.238
What the hell you
gawking at, moron?

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.116
[TATSUMA]
Kyoichi's a stupid idiot!

00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:02.659
Kyoichi's a stupid idiot!

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.579
Kyouichi's a piece of
trash! He's trash!

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:08.623
[battle cry]

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.209
Kyoichi!

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.714
Oh, man...
What the hell was that?

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:18.717
It seems you
too have the Power.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.469
[RYOICHI]
It's magnificent, isn't it?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.306
All things obey me and whatever
I ask for I can have.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.393
Because I have become as
powerful as a god.

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:32.981
Ryouichi, did... did you...

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.694
[Ryoichi chuckles]

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:40.781
[RYOICHI]
The pigs wish to defy a god?

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.286
What the hell
are you doing?

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:47.871
[Kyoichi chocking]

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:50.499
It's not me,
he's controlling my body!

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.420
Stop it, man. Leave them alone.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.715
[electric guitar shredding]

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.095
This isn't your sound.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.681
This isn't how you're
supposed to play!

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.561
Your sound? No...
it was our sound.

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.105
It should never have
been like this.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:21.655
[RYOICHI]
Raito.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:31.832
[plays chord]

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:32.916
Ryoichi, no!

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.626
[TATSUMA]
What the hell just happened?!

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.253
You two need to get lost.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.838
[KYOICHI]
What was all that?

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.298
Hey! Where do you
think you're goin'?

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.552
Damnit... Stupid
lightning bastard...

00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:52.519
[ANKO] Ohran Academy, Class
3-4, Hisui Kisaragi:

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.437
President of the school's
Tea Ceremony Club,

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.399
proprietor of an antiques shop,
and well known hunk.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.192
So how do you two
know each other, huh?

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.444
Lady Misato, I have
told you time and time again

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:03.488
that you must never go
act on your own.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.242
I'm so sorry, Hisui but I
was just wanted to help out.

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:09.077
Hey, don't you ignore me!

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.079
[YUUYA] So the flock of crows
that attacked those people is

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.248
being controlled by the guy
with the guitar.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.333
Isn't that right, Horaiji?

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.002
[KYOICHI] Yeah...
And he could control

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.212
our voices and our
bodies at will, too.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:22.257
He had the power to control
atmospheric vibrations?

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:24.509
Kyoichi said some
very nasty things to me.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.428
I'm tellin' you,
that wasn't me talkin'!

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.929
And then he
tried to strangle me.

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:30.181
Stop tryin' to make
me look bad! Oh, come on,

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:34.895
you did the same
thing to me. Oh, screw it...

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.105
So that guy with the crazy
hair is supposed to know

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.733
the guitar player,
is that right?

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.985
[ANKO] That's right! They're
from that band, Crow! You know.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:42.903
I don't wanna be rude,

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.821
but nobody invited you
to this party.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.656
Whatta you want, parasite?

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.117
[TATSUMA] Not as much
of a parasite as you are.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.995
[KYOICHI] I told you,
it wasn't me!

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.791
[YUUYA]
So, what is this "Crow" thing?

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.919
[ANKO] They were this
crazy popular indie band.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.421
They only released, like, 11
songs over two years, but every

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:05.383
one of them was a hit. They were
this huge internet sensation.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.011
Oh, and all of the members
are Tokyo high schoolers,

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:11.056
just like us. So
that's pretty cool, huh?

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.558
[KOMAKI] Really? So who's
the guy with the mohawk?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.394
That's Raito, the lead
singer. Ryoichi was the one who

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.272
was the driving force behind
the band. He played guitar and

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:20.857
composed all of their songs.

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.567
He was a huge
deal on the music scene,

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:23.902
but then...

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:24.986
[KOMAKI]
What?

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:28.031
[ANKO] Three months ago,
the band mysteriously broke up.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:31.576
Word on the street was that
Ryoichi just disappeared.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:32.827
[KOMAKI]
But why?

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.538
[ANKO] I dunno. From what I hear
the rumor has it he was a

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.583
real difficult person to get
along with, so the band was

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.504
always arguing and getting
into fights with each other.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.131
They broke
up three months ago...

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.217
It was just about then, huh?

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.260
[AOI]
Yes...

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.849
[YUUYA] So there are other
people out there like us.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.267
[KOMAKI] Which means
we're gonna have to fight

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.228
other people
with the Power.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.814
[crying]

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:04.651
[TENDO] What's the matter?
Why are you crying?

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:08.905
[RYOICHI] I don't think I can
do this... I can't do this!

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.324
You can. You'll
find the strength because

00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:12.909
this is what he wants.

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:13.868
[RYOICHI]
But...

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.787
[TENDO] You know that you're
the only person who can

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.414
grant that wish.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:20.792
That's why he's
chasing you so mercilessly.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.128
Surely you haven't forgotten?

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:28.717
[RYOICHI] Raito? He wants this?
Of course he does...

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:32.137
[KYOICHI] Well, that settles
it then. I'd sure love to teach

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.889
Lightning Head a lesson, but
I guess we're gonna have to go

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.017
after the little Crow Boy first.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.728
[ANKO] For crying out loud!
What the heck is going on with

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:42.313
you guys, anyway?!
Somebody better start explaining

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.399
things to me right now
or I'm gonna get really angry!

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.900
Hey, Dungeonmaster.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:46.901
[KISARAGI]
What?

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.154
You got any baskets?

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.196
Huh?

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.365
I've got a pot, will that do?

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.742
[ANKO]
Huh?

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:01.374
[AOI] I wonder if it was wrong
of us to do that to Tono...

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:04.169
[KYOICHI] It'll be fine.
With everything we're up against

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.131
we couldn't protect
her even if we wanted to.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:16.097
[KYOICHI]
Don't you agree... Misato?

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:18.767
Well, I guess you must be right.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:26.024
[electric guitar shredding]

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:30.695
Ryoichi!
It's me Raito.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:34.365
Tell me what the
hell's gotten into you?!

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:49.255
[RAITO] You were always alone...
even when you were a little kid.

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:53.093
You didn't even try to make
any friends, except for me.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.303
I guess both of us coming
from broken homes,

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:58.473
it was easy to become
like brothers.

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:02.227
I always think about how proud
I was of your guitar-playing.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.979
Remember how much you loved
playing and that's why we

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.774
started the band. And I thought
the band would help you to

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:09.901
make friends.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.612
[RYOICHI]
You wanna change it? Why?

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.280
[RAITO] Because if
we don't rearrange it,

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.491
then the other guys won't be
able to keep up with us.

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.368
[RYOICHI] Raito.
You promised me that we'd

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:21.830
never change this song.
You remember that?

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.834
[RAITO] They can't play it live.
And we've got a gig, so...

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.044
Ryoichi?

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:30.004
[RAITO] You just
disappeared which meant

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.590
that was the end of Crow.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:37.303
I formed the band for
you... to help you.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.390
[RAITO]
Where in the hell have you been?

00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:42.225
[RYOICHI] Let go of me!
Get your hands off of me!

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:43.601
[RAITO] You're comin' back
with me, you got that?

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:44.435
[RYOICHI]
Like hell!

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.397
Everyone's waiting on you,
damnit! You're comin' with me!

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:48.982
Understand--

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:58.741
[RAITO] Ever since that day,
I've been able to use the Power.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:01.536
And since you disappeared,
I've been searching for you,

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:06.374
wondering if... maybe
you'd got this power, too.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:11.171
[RYOICHI] You know I've
been waiting for you to come.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.132
I've been waiting for you all
this time. I wanted them to hear

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:17.177
the music we made.
That you and I created.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:19.470
I'll use this divine power
to make those ignorant

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.681
pigs understand!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.517
Do you know this Power
doesn't make you into a god?

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:28.980
In fact you're acting
more like the Grim Reaper.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:32.901
[Ryoichi laughs]

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.696
[RYOICHI] You can't fight
the music made by a god!

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:40.158
But you know that.
Don't you, Raito?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.243
Ryouichi, you...
You've already killed--

00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.787
[KYOCHI] Well, well,
lookie what we found here:

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:49.083
Lightning Head. And his "little
sidekick", The Crow Boy.

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.628
[RAITO] This isn't
any of your business.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.421
So get the hell out of here!

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.340
[KYOICHI]
Put a sock in it, Bedhead!

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:58.176
This isn't just
your problem or ours.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.471
It's the whole city's.
Don't be so full of yourself

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:03.848
to think you can fix
all this on your own.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.391
[RAITO]
You don't understand...

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:08.937
[RYOICHI] Then it's settled.
I'll let everybody hear it.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:13.733
The true voice of God...
that we created...

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:25.411
[ANKO]
I want my scoop!

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.288
[explosion]

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.670
[electric guitar shredding]

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:36.047
[TATSUMA]
Kyoichi! Behind you!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.006
Horaiji!

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.466
[KYOICHI]
Hey, Dumb Muscle-head!

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:40.218
What did you say?!

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.016
[FIREFIGHTER]
Oh my God...

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:50.895
[RAITO] What are you doing?
You need to fight me!

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:54.691
I'm the one who attacked
you remember? Ryoichi!

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:57.735
Hey, I got a question: how can
we be sure that mohawk guy

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.821
isn't still our enemy?

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:01.614
[AOI]
I'm not sure.

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:04.909
He's not after us.
He wasn't fighting us at his

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.494
full strength earlier.

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:07.912
Sure 'bout that?

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:11.124
All of his strikes deliberately
missed all of our vital spots.

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:12.875
So that means...

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.753
You did it so you could
determine whether we were your

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:20.008
enemies or on your side.
Your eyes tell me...

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.510
that you're not a killer.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.729
[YUUYA] Are we really
gonna fight another human being?

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.188
[KYOICHI]
Looks like it...

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.780
Nope. It's no good.
There's just not enough

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.157
evidence to go on.

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:46.576
Have you looked at
anyone the crows attacked?

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:48.995
Yeah, I didn't find anything.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:54.000
That's too bad. Well,
I guess that's what we expected.

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:56.753
[RAITO] You just
don't know when to quit.

00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:59.630
I already told you:
I'll take care of Ryoichi.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.215
[KYOICHI] Hey, you're the
one who got us involved

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.176
in this in the first place.

00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:04.927
Weren't you lookin'
for a jamboree?

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.637
You mean, Jam session.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.056
[KYOICHI]
Stop correcting me!

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:10.975
Who the hell
are you guys, anyway?

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:14.687
[TATSUMA] We're here to protect
the city and everyone in it.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:17.148
And to protect them, we fight.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.237
[KYOICHI]
Let's do this!

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.255
[RAITO] Ryoichi...
I wish we can go back

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.341
to the way things used to be.

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:45.885
But we can't turn back.

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.187
And someone has to stop you.

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:57.772
So I will!

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.946
[battle cry]

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:14.872
[screams]

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.374
[TENDO]
Hmmm...

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.423
[KYOICHI] Were you
really trying to kill him?

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:30.596
You can't go
through with it, can you?

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.267
[RAITO] I couldn't do it.
I just couldn't.

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:36.477
[AOI] There is no need to take
another person's life.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.729
We don't know what happened
between the two of you.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:42.483
But no matter how terrible the
crimes he's committed, we...

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:44.694
we have to try to
save his soul, and to do that,

00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:46.904
we have to give
him another chance.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.907
Please we must let him live!

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.288
Save his soul.
Didn't think of that...

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.500
[RYOICHI]
What happened...

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:02.211
You're the one
who took them from me.

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:03.754
It was you!

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.805
It was you!

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.516
Ryoichi?

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:21.606
[RYOICHI] You know Raito.
You did it to us.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:25.151
You ruined us!!!!

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.736
[RAITO]
Ryoichi!

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:46.255
Ryoichi!

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:49.217
[shrieks]

[KISARAGI]
Three million yen...

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:25.586
[ANKO] Huh? So you're telling me
that you're one of

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:27.296
the members of Kyoichi's gang?

00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:29.257
Yeah, that's right.
The Boss is the one that has

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:31.968
shown us the right
path to follow.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.511
[ANKO] Well, you
sure are a lifesaver!

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.137
[AZUMABASHI] Hey, I'd do
anything for one of the boss's

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:38.224
school friends!
Know what I'm sayin'?

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:48.818
Tatsuma! Damn it!

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:50.528

[AZUMABASHI]
What the hell's goin' on?!

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:21.309
[ANKO] Thanks for the ride. I'll
be okay on my own from here.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.019
[AZUMABASHI]
You can't be serious! You know,

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.895
I uh think we oughta go back...

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:27.356
Lemme tell you a little
somethin' about journalists:

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:29.317
whoever gets the story wins!

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.611
[RAITO]
Ryoichi!

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.779
[KYOICHI]
Demonic Crow!

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:41.287
[RAITO] You were saying that I
ruined us? Well, what the hell

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.748
would you call what you're
doing now, huh? What's with this

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:47.251
"sound of a god" shit?!
Where's the sound we made?!

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:50.921
[RAITO] Were we just writing
songs to become mass murderers?

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.841
What the hell did you write 'em
for, anyway? Who did you write

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:58.512
'em for, Ryoichi?! Hey, are
you gonna answer me or not?!

[KYOICHI] Tatsuma,
what the hell are you doing?

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.753
I feel sorry for her.
But we both know that for her

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:32.546
it's too late.

00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:34.590
All we can do now
is try to stop him.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.426
[TATSUMA] I can't
just leave her here.

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:39.845
I can't just leave her here!

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:44.225
[KYOICHI] Okay, then.
We'll go take care of Crow Boy.

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:46.435
[TATSUMA]
Thanks.

00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:06.914
Ryoichi, I'm here.

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.666
What's goin' on?

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:12.128
[shrieks]

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:13.629
What was that?

[growls]

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:30.020
[RAITO]
Ryoichi? Ryoichi?

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:36.402
[RYOICHI]
Raito...

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:39.780
[RAITO]
Stay with me.

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:42.324
What's going on?

00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:44.326
Ya got me, man.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.788
[YUUYA]
Is he... back to normal?

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:54.962
[RAITO]
Ryoichi...

00:20:56.297 --> 00:21:01.510
[RYOICHI] Why did you change it?
We made that song together...

00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:05.973
It was ours and
no one else's... Raito...

00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:09.018
I thought at least
you would understand!

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:15.232
That was it? You were still
upset with me about that song?

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:18.944
I just wanted to protect it,
no matter what.

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:23.032
[AOI] Can you
tell me something?

00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:25.451
Why did you do it?
How were you able to turn

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.661
yourself into a demon?

00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:38.672
[RYOICHI] It was...
the Dark Arts...

00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.554
[RAITO]
Oh!

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:51.393
[KOMAKI]
Oh my god.

00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:53.479
[CLAIRE]
Oh, phooey.

00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:59.693
[TENDO] We grant a favor and
give him the Power, but it looks

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:02.613
as if there was a trace of
humanity left in him and

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:05.783
the demon's power devoured
what was left of his soul.

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:07.993
[CLAIRE]
That's totally gross.

00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:10.913
Who the hell are you?!

00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:12.748
Well, we must be off.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.459
We'll see
each other again soon.

00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:17.461
Aw, that was boring.

00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:21.549
[RAITO]
Ryoichi! Ryoichi!
