[REPORTER] At the moment, no
detailed information has been

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.126
released, beyond the fact
that the victim was a student

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.711
from a high school in Tokyo...

[helicopter blades whirring]

00:03:17.948 --> 00:03:20.659
[MIKURIYA] Just like you
asked for, here's one exactly

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.953
as it was found, no
autopsy done on it yet.

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:25.205
Too smokey in here...

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.499
[MIKURIYA] What are you talking
about, you're smoking, too.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:30.627
Anyway... Why don't
you help me move her?

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.795
[RYUTA]
Not gonna happen.

00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:32.671
[MIKURIYA]
Oh, that's nice.

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.089
What kind of an
attitude is that from

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:35.215
a guy who wants a favor?

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.259
[RYUTA] Just shut
up and do your job.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.719
[MIKURIYA]
Yeah, yeah...

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.765
This one brings
the total to five, huh?

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.435
[RYUTA] That we were
able to find, at least.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.104
Anyhow, every last
drop of water's been

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.814
sucked from her body.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.774
[RYUTA]
Desiccated.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:54.609
[MIKURIYA]
That's right.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:55.902
Kind of a shame, still...

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:59.614
I mean, she was just
a high schooler, you know?

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.783
Seems like a waste...

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.618

I'll leave

Don't you wanna

Putting that aside
for now, in this instance...

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:04.012

I got a stomach ache.

See ya later!

[laughter]

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.486
That boring class
was putting me to sleep.

But I'm awake now.

Just as I thought...

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.558
It's too weak a link.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.354
I can only assume I'm
overlooking some element.

How?

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.607

figure it out either...

[FAN]
I don't know, man,

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:27.405
it couldn't possibly be
normal people doin' this stuff.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.575
[YANG] It's not entirely
certain that they're people...

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.327
We oughta check with the
boss on this one before

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.745
we make any moves.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.330
Huh?

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:38.458
[YANG] Have you two ever
heard of the "living dead"?

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.129
What do
you mean all of them?

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:45.006
[MIKURIYA ON PHONE]
I'm not kidding here!

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.092
I didn't even finish
my autopsy on that new girl,

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.301
before she runs off on me!

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:50.845
I mean, that's gotta
be against the rules!

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:54.057
Hey, you didn't know this
was going to happen, did you?

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.309
[RYUTA]
Shut up and do your job.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.772
But all
the bodies are gone...

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:05.443
I'm gonna use this thing to
shove it right up your ass!

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.655
[FOUR GREAT] All right,
dickhead, let's play ball!

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.157

I've got no choice...

[light chuckle]

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.416

Horaji...

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.088
You always make me look stupid
when we fight but this time,

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.634
I swear to God, it's not
gonna work! I'll kill y--

[crying in pain]

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.149
What the
heck are you doing?!

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.900
Is this a geology experiment?

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.194
If you must know, I was
on the trail of a scoop.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.112
Whatever you're doing.

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.739
You have enthusiasm.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:54.409
The mysterious transfer
student, Tatsuma Hiyu, hooks up

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:57.829
with resident delinquent Kyoichi
Horaiji and the two proceed to

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.624
cut class, get into brawls both
on and off campus, buy junk food

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.710
to eat on the way home,
and all of this adds up to a

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:06.254
record 26 offenses
in the past two months.

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.715
So you you think I'm
"mysterious", huh?

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.091
[KYOICHI]
Anko!

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:13.428
Holy shit, you're one persistent
little pest! I dunno if you call

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.847
it journalism or what, but in my
book I'd call what you're doing

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:18.892
just plain old-fashioned
spying, ya friggin' stalker!

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.101
You're like the pa- pa-

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:21.019
Paparazzi?

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.312
Yeah, that's right,
that's the word.

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:23.271
[KYOICHI]
Parapazzi!

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.272
It's "paparazzi."

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.273
I don't consider that an insult.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:27.400
But why don't I cut to the
chase and ask what I've been

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:30.236
curious about: what have you
guys been up to at night lately?

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:33.239
I saw you with student
council president Aoi Misato,

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.534
the captain of the archery team,
Komaki Sakurai, and the captain

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.871
of the wrestling team,
Yuuya Daigo. That's kind of an

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.791
odd social circle,
don't you think? I mean,

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.335
I've never even seen you guys
talk to each other at school...

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.586
I smell a rat!

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.963
Listen here, little snitch!
I'd rather die than team up

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.924
with a bunch of candy-asses!

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:54.427
[TONO] Oh, would you now?
Man, do I ever smell a scoop!

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.721
[KYOICHI] I can't listen to
any more of this crap.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.473
Tatsuma, let's get out of here!

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.020

[TATSUMA]
The living dead?

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.665
[KYOICHI] I'm telling you,
old man Yang used to know a

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:26.042
thing or two about Taoism.

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.377
You're kidding, right?

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.212
He happens to be the
leader of the notorious

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.673
"Three Wise Men"
of east Shinjuku.

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.007
It's always the quiet ones...

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:35.343
Well, it's a
complicated story...

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:38.680
...but now he's supposedly a
fine, upstanding citizen.

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.849
[KYOICHI] At least,
that's the story I heard.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.226
And I've got a hunch he may
have a couple of ideas about why

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:45.270
we haven't been
getting any sleep lately.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.107

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.910
[YANG]
Fan! Wang!

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.120
[ground breaking]

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.330
[shocked gasp]

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:52.962
It can't be! Is that you, Boss?

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:58.301
[zombies roaring]

00:11:58.635 --> 00:11:59.469
It was that girl...

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:03.348
Yang! Wang! Fan!

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.664
[TATSUMA]
That was the girl.

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:31.000
[KYOICHI] You mean the
girl who washed up here?

00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:32.543
Yeah.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.004
[KYOICHI] Old man Yang said
he'd give us the rest of

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.090
the story when we
caught up with him.

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.511
[KISARAGI]
The living dead...

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:43.596
There is a certain kind
of evil spirit known as

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:47.642
a Fuishimon, which kills
its former friends and family.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.686
If the giant creature you
saw is controlling them,

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:53.147
it may be a kind of Moryo devil.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.816
[TATSUMA]
Mor-yo, huh?

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:57.026
[KISARAGI] They're spirits that
live in nature, it's said that

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.821
Moryo are devils
that prey upon corpses.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:02.156
[YUUYA] So they just
ended up as zombie chow.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:06.160
Those guys Kyoichi knew and
that girl from Houmei High.

00:13:07.662 --> 00:13:09.914
What the hell are you saying?
Is that why we've been at this

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.959
hunt for two weeks and we're
still ending up nowhere? Huh?

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.085
[AOI]
Komaki.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.671
[KISARAGI] That's because
we've been unable to determine

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.256
a common link among the victims.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:19.299
[KYOICHI]
Jeez.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.551
Old man Yang was way
more helpful than you are...

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:24.637
[KISARAGI] Don't compare me
to that renegade Taoist hermit!

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.724
What was that?!

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.017
[KISARAGI] Were you
not the one who said

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.102
it doesn't matter
who this thing kills?

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.812
[KYOICHI]
You lookin' for a fight?

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:34.397
[KISARAGI] You are
such a simpleton...

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.733
[YUUYA] Cut it out you two,
give it a rest.

00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:38.234
The point is: anyone
that devil has taken is

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:40.737
coming back to life
and killing more people.

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:42.405
So that's what we're up against.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.906
[YUUYA]
Right, Kisaragi?

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.950
That's the jist of it.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.494
Maybe we should
concentrate on our similarities.

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:51.039
[AOI] We all want to protect the
city, no matter what it takes.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.082
Thanks, Miss Student Council.

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:54.709
Was that a campaign speech?

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:55.543
Shut your trap!

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:56.878
[KYOICHI]
See, the thing is...

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.838
anybody can
make a pretty speech.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.173
What are you gonna
be doing while we're

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:02.216
out there, busting
our asses fighting?

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.177
What other skills
do you have? Face it,

00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:06.679
this just isn't where
you belong, princess.

00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:08.514
You've only got the right to
talk all important-like after

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.808
you've actually
done some real work.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.685
[KISARAGI]
Shut your insolent mouth!

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:14.354
How dare you speak
to her that way!

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:15.813
Don't worry about it, Hisui.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.023
But he --

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:20.109
[AOI] It's all right.
Please. Continue.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.069
[KISARAGI]
Right.

00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:24.030
Here take a look at this.

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:26.074
I compiled a list of
everyone reported missing

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:29.827
and anyone who'd been on
intimate terms with the victims.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:30.787
[KOMAKI]
Oh my God...

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:32.997
[AOI]
There are so many of them...

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.708
[KISARAGI] The next victim will
probably be from Homei High.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.585
[KOMAKI] Yeah,
that'd be a pretty safe bet,

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.712
but we don't have any idea
who that person might be.

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:40.797
Right?

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:44.425
Yeah! You've hit the nail right
on the head again, Sa-ku-rah-ee!

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:46.552
Wait a sec.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.013
[KYOICHI] You think maybe she'd
know? She knows a lot more

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.681
than she needs to.

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.642
[YUUYA]
By "she" do you mean...?

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:57.188
[TONO] Huh? From Homei High?
Oh, you're asking about

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.482
Kugayama! She was
one of the best violinists

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:00.983
in Tokyo, you know.

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:02.735
She was originally
from Hokkaido.

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.404
I heard she lived on campus.

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:07.240
And, I believe she has a
boyfriend named Kamiyogi.

00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.826
As a matter of fact, I've
got her address memorized!

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:11.744
[TONO]
Say...

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:14.372
How come you wanna
know all that stuff, anyway?

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:15.790
Uh, you see...

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:17.250
Academic curiosity.

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:18.459
[TONO]
What?

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.546
[TATSUMA] What I mean is
someone asked me to find out.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.089
[TONO]
Oh? And who was that?

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.757
[TATSUMA]
Um, well... Gotta go!

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.467
[TONO]
Uh, wait!

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:29.178
There's the mysterious
transfer student for you.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.514
He's obviously
got something to hide.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.641
Could this be a
scoop that I'm smelling?

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.981
[YUUYA] Split up? What are
you talking about, Kyoichi?

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:41.774
[KOMAKI] Remember the
terms of our agreement?

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:42.984
All five of us go.

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.485
[KYOICHI]
God, you pansies...

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:47.238
I don't need somebody to hold
my hand. And I never agreed

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.532
to those stupid "terms"
in the first place!

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:50.491
[AOI]
But...

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.034
[KYOICHI] Thanks to
our pasty-freak friend

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:53.828
I haven't had much
sleep the past two weeks.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.788
Tatsuma and I are
gonna do our own thing.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.249
[YUUYA] Well, I can't say I
don't understand how you feel...

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.293
What gives you the
right to be so selfish?

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.503
[KYOICHI] Oh,
shut yer face, she-male.

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:03.671
What did you call me?!

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:06.090
[KYOICHI] Anyhow if we
don't get our acts together and

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:08.217
settle this thing,
no one's ever gonna

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.136
be able to rest in peace again.

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:16.893
[INUGAMI] Horaiji! I haven't
received your report yet.

[INUGAMI] What you do at night
is your business but

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:23.983
I don't particularly wanna have
you in my class again next year.

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.362
[INUGAMI]
And I almost forgot...

00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:31.449
Hiyu: it hasn't been too
safe around here lately.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:34.494
I wouldn't go looking
for trouble if I were you.

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:35.912
[TATSUMA]
Yes, sir.

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:37.997

[YUKO]
Come on.

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:01.145
Come to me, Kamiyogi.

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.942
Is that you?

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:11.822
[KAMIYOGI] What are you
doing here? You know...

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.199
everybody's looking for you.

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.951
I mean, they told...

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:16.327
they told...

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.870
they told me that you're dead.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:41.782
Kin-ka-tsu, Kin-shin!

00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:53.419
[MONK]
You soulless little monster!

00:20:54.128 --> 00:20:54.962
[giggles]

00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:56.130
[OLD MAN IN GLASSES]
Don't be foolish!

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.466
[groans]

00:20:58.758 --> 00:20:59.884
[TENDO]
And now for you...

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:01.761
Now that I've got your
attention and since all

00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:03.512
of your friends are
gone, there's something

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:06.974
I wanted to ask
you, Mister Eyebrows.

00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:07.975
[screams]

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:09.727
[KYOICHI]
There are so many of them!

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.562
[TATSUMA]
Kyoichi, look out!

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:17.902
[KYOICHI] Tatsuma!
Now, quick, go for it's arms!

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:32.917
[pained groan]

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:37.546
[KYOICHI]
Goddamn renegade!

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:42.092
[flames roar]

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.975
[gurgling]

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:03.614
The Ku-ja-ku-shi...

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:05.157
what a pain...

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:06.325
[OLD MEN]
No-ro-I-to-ku...

00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:07.618
They asked for it.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.411
Do your thing, Claire.

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:10.746
[straining]

00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.248
[explosion]

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:18.003
[YUUYA]
Kyoichi! Hiyu!

00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:20.756
[cars honking]

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.551
Didn't mean to blow it up.

00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:25.219
What a friggin' mess this is.

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:28.264
[KYOICHI] Hey, where you
think you're going, asshole?

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.873
[bursting]

00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:55.624
[explodes]

00:23:05.301 --> 00:23:06.343
[TATSUMA]
You alright?

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.558
[YUUYA]
Hey! Kyoichi! Hiyu!

00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:17.521
[AOI]
There were so many of them.

00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:20.232
[Kyoichi]
It's like I said before.

00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:23.569
This isn't where
you belong, princess.

00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:33.954
[AOI] I wasn't able to protect
them...I couldn't protect them.

00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:37.666
[Newscaster] I repeat:
according to police,

00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:40.419
the corpses discovered in the
cave-in account for almost all

00:23:40.461 --> 00:23:41.670
of the missing persons.

00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:42.880
[Newscaster] ...the number of
recovered bodies alone are

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:45.007
thought to number more than a
hundred. Seeking to at least

00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:47.426
confirm identities, the
relatives of those missing are

00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:50.512
asked to be patient as the
bodies are being identified...

00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:51.847
Huh.

00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:53.933
Wh-What in the...

00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:57.436
What in the world is going on?!
