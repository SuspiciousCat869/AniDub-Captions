1
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,066
(battle cry)

2
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,466
Cecilia:
I have this flank covered!

3
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:21,766
Charl:
Not yet! A little more!

4
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,733
Houki:
No!

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,533
Ichika!

6
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,100
Ichika:
Chifuyu...

7
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:20,366
(struggling)

8
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,466
White Knight:
I'll kill you...

9
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,233
I'll kill you...

10
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,566
White Knight:
Ichika Orimura.

11
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Huh?!

12
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,533
Huh?!

13
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,566
Ichika:
(stammers)

14
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,966
Laura:
(sighs)
Is it morning now?

15
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,400
Laura, you again...!

16
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,766
But today...

17
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,533
I am not naked!

18
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,566
Ichika:
What the heck are you wearing?!

19
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,100
A brilliant assistant
instructor's recommendation.

20
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,233
If I were you, I think
I'd fire that instructor...

21
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:55,966
There is a special reason
why I was waiting here
for you to wake up...

22
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:56,966
Read this.

23
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,500
What is this?
Let's see here...

24
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,766
Ichika:
Come to end of the
summer festival for your
dating... pleasure?!

25
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:07,700
Ichika:
Hey! Is this event
at that big, swanky waterpark
that just opened up?!

26
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,033
I've really been wanting to
check this place out!

27
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,100
Is that right?
You want to go?

28
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,266
Look... It says here that
you can even rent a yukata
at the festival square.

29
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:21,000
I would like to wear a yukata...
together with you, Ichika...

30
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,733
Then why don't we
take everyone there and...

31
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,500
(yelps)

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,066
Hmph.

33
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,433
What was that?
Why is she so mad?

34
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,833
(content sigh)

35
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:50,900
Chelsea:
Milady, may I express
my gratitude for your
service in England

36
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,233
Chelsea:
during your summer break.

37
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,633
Chelsea:
Your country thanks you.

38
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:57,566
Cecilia:
As a member of the Alcott
family, it's my duty to serve.

39
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,166
But more importantly...

40
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,100
I am here for
my triumphant return!

41
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,600
Triumphant because,
at the end of the day

42
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,300
I intend to be under the same
sky with my special someone.

43
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,333
Ichika:
Huh?
My beloved.

44
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,533
Ichika:
Oh hey, Cecilia!

45
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,066
I‐Ichika.

46
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:15,833
(giggles)

47
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:20,466
Is it possible that he
came out here just so
he could greet me?

48
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:21,666
(gentlemanly laugh)

49
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:22,900
Oh, my darling!

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,933
I couldn't sit still knowing
that you were coming back to me!

51
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,733
Oh, Ichika...
you naughty boy!

52
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:32,233
We shouldn't do that out here
where everyone can see!

53
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,966
Cecilia? Cecilia?

54
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:35,533
(gasps)

55
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:40,133
I‐I'm alright.
I was just feeling a little
bit dizzy, that's all

56
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,666
I see, you're okay then.

57
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,100
By the way, would you
like to go here tomorrow?

58
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,033
Oh! You're asking me
to go out with you, Ichika?

59
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,833
Yes! I, Cecilia Alcott,

60
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,900
shall make all of
the necessary preparations!

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,500
Laura:
Verdammt! He must become more
aware of his duties as my bride.

62
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,366
It seems like something
is bothering you.

63
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:07,366
Huh...? Oh, no.
It's nothing.

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I know!

65
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,233
Why don't we go do a
little clothes shopping today
if you have time?

66
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,333
What for? The military
supplies all my clothing...

67
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,366
Charl:
That is a military uniform.

68
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:20,766
The summer break
is almost over. Let's go!

69
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,533
(sighs)
Well, I guess you
have a point.

70
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:27,566
So, can you be ready
to leave around 10?

71
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,600
Uh! Ja, that
is fine.

72
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,933
Laura:
I changed!

73
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:36,066
Here is my going‐out attire.

74
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,800
Charl:
But you're still
wearing a uniform!

75
00:06:39,397 --> 00:06:40,482
Girl A:
Hey guys!

76
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,645
Have you heard the rumor
about the special crêpes
at the seaside park?

77
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,245
Oh, yeah, I have!

78
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:48,512
Supposedly, if you eat
mixed berry crêpes with
the person you like,

79
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:50,058
Girl B:
you'll find true love!

80
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:52,858
Girl A:
That's right! But I heard that
they're always sold out of them.

81
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,858
Charl:
Find true love with
the mixed berry crêpes?

82
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:05,058
Brain freeze!

83
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,558
Rinin:
Aw, tomorrow will be the last
day of the summer break...

84
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:10,991
It would be nice to make some
memories with Ichika...

85
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:14,158
Because of him, I chose to stay
here instead of going back home.

86
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:17,558
So you'd think that he could've
asked me out at least once.

87
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:19,191
Ichika:
Hey, Rin...

88
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,691
Ah! I‐Ichika?!

89
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,558
Ichika:
I'm coming in.

90
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,558
Ah, uh, just a...
just a second!

91
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:28,825
Uhhh...

92
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:30,225
(nervous laugh)

93
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,125
(screams)

94
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:36,158
(pained scream, groan)

95
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:39,791
Ichika:
(whimpers)

96
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:42,158
Huh?

97
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:44,858
Store Manager:
Welcome, ladies.

98
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:45,591
(gasps)

99
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:47,891
(customers fawning)

100
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:52,125
Store Manager:
Ooh! A platinum and a blonde...

101
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,725
Ah! I meant to say...

102
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:56,125
How would you ladies
like to try on some items

103
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,958
from our
latest collection?

104
00:07:58,058 --> 00:07:58,991
Hmmmmm?

105
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:03,425
It's so sheer, that what's
underneat will be...

106
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,558
Uh... what do
you think, Laura?

107
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:08,558
Um... it is
very white...

108
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:14,691
Laura:
That is not bad,
but as you can see...
I'm already wearing white.

109
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:18,091
Why don't you
try it on?

110
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:19,758
No, it's too‐

111
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,958
Oh it's not
too much... bother!

112
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:31,858
Perhaps I am
mistaken about this...

113
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:33,925
(sighs)

114
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:38,858
but maybe I am simply not
attractive to the opposite sex.

115
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,158
(sighs)

116
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,325
This is absurd.

117
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:49,158
But... maybe I should have been
wearing garments that are
much cuter than this.

118
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:53,525
Ja, I am sure that Ichika would
commend me for that.

119
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:57,058
(German accent)
Laura, your clothes
are super cute.

120
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:59,791
Only my clothing?

121
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:03,058
The person who's wearing it,
is the cutest of all.

122
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:05,825
You foolish boy!

123
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:09,925
Charl:
So, did you
try it on, Laura?

124
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,491
What is this?

125
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:14,325
You're still
in your uniform!

126
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:15,925
Ah, actually...

127
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:21,358
I see, I guess you did not
find that one to your taste.

128
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,225
No, it is not that
I did not like it...

129
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:29,458
Actually...
I want something cuter.

130
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:31,158
Oh?

131
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:35,091
Oui! C'est si bon!
You want something cute, right?

132
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,425
Tell me what
kind you'd like.

133
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:40,625
Well... one that's a little
more revealing would be nice.

134
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:43,858
(chuckles)
Leave it to me!

135
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:49,891
(customers fawning)

136
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:52,091
Charl:
And the icing
on the cake...

137
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,558
You brought some shoes too.
You thought of everything.

138
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:57,691
Ha... but of course!

139
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:05,691
(struggling to keep balance)

140
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:07,425
You okay?

141
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:08,625
Ja, I am sorry.

142
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,225
Store Manager:
Quick, take a picture?

143
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:13,025
(customers fawning)

144
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,358
No problem!

145
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,925
(giggles and cheers)

146
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,758
(nervous laughter)

147
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,791
(sighs)

148
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:30,358
Oh... I don't believe it...

149
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,691
I think my boobs
got bigger AGAIN!

150
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,191
Ichika:
Houki? Are you in there?

151
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,225
I‐Ichika!

152
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:40,291
Houki:
Wh‐what do you want?

153
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,491
I've been looking
for you, Houki.

154
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:43,725
Can we talk?

155
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:48,158
Houki:
(stammers)
Okay! Just give me a second!

156
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,558
Uh, what do you want?

157
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:56,858
Uh! I'm sorry. I guess
you were in the shower.

158
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,725
Yeah, I was! So what did
you want to talk about?

159
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:03,058
Ichika:
Would you like to go
to this with me?

160
00:11:03,158 --> 00:11:04,591
Houki:
What's this? Oh!

161
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,858
I know it's kind of last minute.
So you don't have to go.

162
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,325
Sure, I'm easy!

163
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:11,591
(uneasy laugh)

164
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:13,158
Cafe Worker:
Thank you for waiting.

165
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:14,825
(sighs)
I am so tired.

166
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,891
I really think that you should
have kept the dress on, Laura!

167
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:22,791
Mmm... I didn't want to because
I did not want to get it dirty.

168
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:27,725
Mmm‐hmm... or do you
just want Ichika to be
the first person to see it?

169
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:30,291
Oh! Nein! That
is totally untrue!

170
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,125
Excuse me, ladies.

171
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,158
Want a job?

172
00:11:35,258 --> 00:11:36,758
Huh?

173
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:49,010
Charl:
Uhh... Madame, I was wondering,
why did you want me

174
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,177
to be dressed up as a butler?

175
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,343
Umm... because you're
better‐looking and more stylish

176
00:11:54,443 --> 00:11:55,943
than most of
the guys around here.

177
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:58,143
Is that so...?

178
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:01,710
Charl:
But I wanted to wear
that kind of outfit...

179
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,177
Huh?

180
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:06,877
(sighs)
I guess this is just
inevitable for me?

181
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,743
Don't worry, toots.
It really suits you.

182
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:11,543
Yeah, so I've been told.

183
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,710
(laughs)

184
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,877
(door opens)

185
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:18,310
Hello! Welcome
to Café at Cruise!

186
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,643
Charl:
Thank you for
waiting, ladies!

187
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:23,177
Which one of you
ordered tea?

188
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,010
Customer:
O‐oh, I had the tea...

189
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,443
(flustered shudders)

190
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:39,077
Charl:
Very well then,
just let me know if you
require anything else, ladies.

191
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:40,810
Please enjoy!

192
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,010
Robbers:
(panting)

193
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,877
Manager:
Hello! Welcome to‐
(screams)

194
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:47,843
Alright, nobody move!

195
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:49,643
Shut up, yous!

196
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:53,710
Attention, you've been
completely surrounded!

197
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,377
Give up and turn yourselves in
peacefully, I repeat...

198
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:00,743
If you want the hostages
to be released unharmed,
bring us a car!

199
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:03,777
And don't even think
about putting some kind
of tracking device in it,

200
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:05,043
or trying to follow us!

201
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:07,977
(hysterical screaming)

202
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:10,077
(chuckles)
They look pretty scared!

203
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:11,010
Robber C:
Hey, blondie!

204
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,910
Robber C:
Yeah! You over there!

205
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,277
I'm thirsty.
Bring me the menu.

206
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,510
What the hell
is this?

207
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,577
Laura:
It's water.

208
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,477
Huh? Water?

209
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:25,243
Go ahead and drink it...

210
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:26,777
...if you can that is.

211
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:28,377
(battle cry)

212
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:45,143
Don't mess with us,
you little brat!

213
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:48,243
I'll murderize ya!

214
00:13:48,343 --> 00:13:51,777
Unfortunately for you,
there's more than one of us!

215
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:53,577
Too bad for you!

216
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,977
Target number two, neutralized.
And you, mon ami?

217
00:13:58,077 --> 00:13:59,210
No problem.

218
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,277
Target number three,
also neutralized.

219
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:05,277
Robber B:
(struggling)

220
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:09,410
This is a bunch of crap!
How'd we let these kids
do this to us?!

221
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,277
You're so slow... now die!

222
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,743
All targets neutralized.

223
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,710
They saved us!

224
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,343
Thank you for saving
our lives, Maid and Butler!

225
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:30,943
Um, Laura, it'd be a
problem if they find out

226
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:32,977
that we're the
representative contenders!

227
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:34,877
We should get
out of here, now!

228
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:39,077
A good point.
We should probably leave.

229
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:43,610
Robber A:
I didn't come this far to get
caught and spend the rest
of my life in jail.

230
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,710
I'd rather blow everything
here all to Hell!

231
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:02,610
That's Checkmate!

232
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,243
C'est fini?

233
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:06,410
Unless you want me to blow off
your amrs or something.

234
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,610
Excuse moi!

235
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,843
Can I have two crêpes
with mixed berries?

236
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:15,277
Aw, bummer, ladies!

237
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:18,177
I'm afraid there's no more
mixed berries today.

238
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:21,010
What? You're
sold out?

239
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:24,810
So, do you
still want one?

240
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,577
Ja!

241
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:28,577
I want one with strawberries
and blueberries, now!

242
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,010
Huh?

243
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,443
Straw' and blue? No problemo!

244
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,077
This is really good!

245
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:46,143
Ja. This is my very first time
to eat a real crêpe.

246
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:49,543
and I am finding it
to be quite tasty.

247
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:52,343
I'm going to come here
with Ichika next time.

248
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:57,177
It'd be so nice if they have
the mixed berries crêpes...

249
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:00,077
Mm... Charlotte.

250
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:01,677
Uhh... oui?

251
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:07,243
Uh! L‐Laura...

252
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:10,010
What was that about?!

253
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,277
There was sauce on your cheek.

254
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:14,177
I understand,
but still...

255
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:15,743
Both of my hands were engaged.

256
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:20,710
However, if you are going to be
upset, I will offer you a bite
of my crêpe as a peace offering.

257
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,077
Merci beaucoup,
Laura...

258
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:31,243
Laura:
By the way,
about the crêpe shop...

259
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:33,710
They do not have
the mixed berries crêpes.

260
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,243
Ah?

261
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:35,777
Laura:
It wasn't even
on the menu.

262
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:40,643
Furthermore, I did not see any
sauce on the shelf that was
labeled for that purpose.

263
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:41,810
Oh is that right?

264
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,510
You are so observant!

265
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,610
But you still got to eat
the mixed berries crêpe, ja?

266
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:50,943
Oh yeah! Strawberries
and blueberries!

267
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,177
Mmm! Together!

268
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:54,277
Sacré bleu!

269
00:16:54,377 --> 00:17:00,143
Now I understand the real reason
they are always sold out of the
mixed berry crêpes!

270
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:03,710
Laura:
What is this
bizarre contraption?

271
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,177
Are you sure
these are pajamas?

272
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:12,510
Mmm! Ah! Sacré bleu!

273
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,377
And you look so good
in them mon petit cher!

274
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:20,510
Laura:
Do not hold me that way!
I cannot move!

275
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,743
Charl:
Now, behave!

276
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:25,577
Charl:
You're a little pussycat so you
need to sit still on my lap!

277
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:29,477
Charl:
Can you just say "meow"?
That's a good pussy!

278
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:30,543
I will not comply!

279
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:33,577
Why would I ever want to do
something so embarrassing!

280
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,677
Why would you?

281
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:36,243
Because it's so cute!

282
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:39,010
Come on, now!
Say it with me!

283
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,510
"Meow".

284
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:44,543
Ah... Ah...

285
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:46,010
Meow...

286
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,443
Très adorable

287
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,777
(door knocks)

288
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:52,077
Oui, who is there?

289
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:53,710
How's it goin'?

290
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,777
Well, those are
unusual outfits.

291
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,877
Black cat and a white cat, huh?

292
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,877
Oh yeah... about tomorrow...

293
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:02,910
Ichika:
Are you interested?

294
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:03,910
Huh?

295
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,143
(gasps)
(angry meow)

296
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:14,910
(sires wailing)

297
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,443
Announcer:
Intruder detected in Area 6‐D!
All units move to intercept!

298
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:22,910
Repeat, intruder detected
in Area 6‐D!

299
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,110
Intercept at once!

300
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,143
Squall:
Um, do you read me?

301
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:28,543
Let me make this clear,

302
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:31,277
your body has been
implanted with nano‐devices

303
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,843
that monitor
your every action.

304
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:37,243
Therefore, you will carry out
your mission as ordered.

305
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,843
There she is!

306
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:40,977
Vile pests!

307
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:55,610
Can't kill me yet?
How pathetic!

308
00:18:57,043 --> 00:19:00,677
Good girl, M.
Let's see more.

309
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,077
This is a restricted area!

310
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,010
Is she gonna fight
us barehanded?!

311
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,343
There's a special IS
sealed up on this base...

312
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:20,777
A special Infinite Stratos.

313
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:22,543
It's mine.

314
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:23,610
It's what?!

315
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,343
Deploy!

316
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:36,277
That's Silent Zephyrus!

317
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,143
It can't be... Phantom Task?!

318
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:57,077
Houki:
(giggles)

319
00:19:57,177 --> 00:19:58,510
I can't believe this...

320
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,443
Ichika was so direct about
asking... but I'd never imagine

321
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:04,077
he'd be so nervous when he
finally got up the nerve

322
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:05,943
to ask me out on a date!

323
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:08,610
But here we are and... huh?

324
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,243
Huh?!

325
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:15,043
Ichika:
Hi there! Good morning!

326
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:18,043
Sorry I kept
you waiting, everyone!

327
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:18,677
You idiot!

328
00:20:18,777 --> 00:20:21,010
I feel so stupid for coming here
with such high hopes!

329
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,210
I should have known...
I should have known...

330
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,343
You fail
as a bride!

331
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:31,410
Jeez... what are
they so mad about?

332
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,843
Cecilia:
Oh yes! Let's hurry and get over
to the pool now, shall we?

333
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,843
Houki:
Haaaa Ichika!

334
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:41,143
Ichika! Come on!
Hurry up!

335
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:42,810
Ugh! He set us up!

336
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,010
Cecilia's the raunchiest!

337
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,443
I am not the raunchiest!

338
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:49,543
Charl:
Look over there!
It's a water slide for couples!

339
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:52,043
Houki:
I suppose I don't
have a choice...

340
00:20:52,143 --> 00:20:54,743
I wouldn't object
to doing it with you.

341
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:56,943
Aikawa:
Yo‐ho‐ho!

342
00:20:57,043 --> 00:21:00,210
Rinin:
I don't get it, where could
those two have gone?!

343
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,210
Ichika:
What the hell was
that all about?!

344
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,543
Houki:
Wh‐what?!

345
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:06,810
Charl:
You're such a pervert!

346
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,110
Ichika:
Huh?! It's not my fault!

347
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,443
Tanimoto:
Yeah, it's so nice!

348
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:11,643
Charl:
Mon Dieu! What are these?!

349
00:21:11,743 --> 00:21:14,177
Houki:
Huh? You've never
seen them before?

350
00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:16,310
Cecilia:
Are we going to eat octopus?

351
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,043
Charl:
Oh, no, no, no!
Nothing with tentacles for me!

352
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:21,143
Ichika:
And when that happens,
it's game over!

353
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:23,077
Houki:
Uh... wh‐what?

354
00:21:23,177 --> 00:21:25,377
Laura:
Ja! This is pretty good.

355
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:26,943
Charl:
Don't worry, we're behind you!

356
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:31,643
Rinin:
Yeah well, I've had sniper
training in the military too,
ya know!

357
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:57,643
Ichika:
And another summer, gone.

358
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:14,077
Tatenashi:
It looks like
it's game time for me,

359
00:22:14,177 --> 00:22:17,977
Team Leader:
Tatenashi Sarashiki...
