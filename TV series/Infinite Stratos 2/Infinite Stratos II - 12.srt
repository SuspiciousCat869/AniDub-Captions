1
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:47,100
[Madoka]
Hmph! Finally, I can fight her.

2
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,466
Chifuyu Orimura...

3
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
[Chifuyu] Sarashiki...
[Kanzashi] Mm?

4
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,066
I want you to hack
into the mainframe...

5
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,966
Let's see if you
can stop this train.

6
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,766
Right. Hold on!

7
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:07,366
I'm shut out...! The whole
system has been over‐ridden!

8
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,300
[Chifuyu] (angry)
These guys are thorough.

9
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,366
(Tatenashi struggling)
(Squall exerting)

10
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:19,700
I won't let you do
as you please...

11
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,366
Phantom Task will fail!

12
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:25,333
By the way, remember the
monorail your classmates are on?

13
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:28,300
It seems there's a little
bomb planted on it.

14
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,333
What!

15
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,600
Do you think you can
stop that as well?

16
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,866
(laughing menacingly)

17
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:36,700
Of course. I think
I'll do just that.

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,100
(laughing) Let's
see you try.

19
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,733
(Tatenashi gasping in pain)

20
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,900
Hmmph. Sayonara, sweetie.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,900
(Tatenashi inhaling sharply)

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
[Squall]
Uh?

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,466
(panicked breaths)

24
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,333
[Squall]
Huh? What?

25
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:59,133
[Tatenashi]
Well, Miss Phantom Task...

26
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,333
I guess I'll see
you next time. Hup!

27
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:04,033
No need to be so frosty. Unh!

28
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:09,800
Oh? Uhhh...!

29
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,433
(Squall chuckles)

30
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,566
(Tatenashi dodging)

31
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
[Kanzashi, thinking]
I should be able to find
a trace somewhere.

32
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,033
And if I can find it...

33
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,233
Kanzashi!

34
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,666
[Kanzashi]
Uh‐huh? Yes, sis?

35
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,200
There's a bomb
planted onboard...

36
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,900
The monorail that
everyone's on...

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,633
Take care!

38
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,600
Ma'am...! This is bad..!

39
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,700
There's a bomb on this train!

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,400
(irritated)

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,600
(pained breaths)

42
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,900
(through clenched teeth)
My sister, Chifuyu...

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,733
(struggling up)

44
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,633
I'll never let you...

45
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,800
Will you just die!

46
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,300
[Houki & Cecilia]
(gasp) Uh‐argh!

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,166
Akatsubaki!

48
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,533
[Houki & Cecilia]
Uh! Ha!

49
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:01,733
(dodging cries)

50
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,733
[Autumn]
Take that! And that!
And that! And that!

51
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,233
[Madoka]
There you are...
Chifuyu Orimura.

52
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,066
[Madoka]
Hmph, you're nothing but flies.

53
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:32,300
[Pilot]
(screams of agony)

54
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,066
[Yamada]
Miss Orimura!

55
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,366
There's a massive energy
signal approaching!

56
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,333
Go on...

57
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,166
It's overwhelming
all military units

58
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,533
and headed straight towards us.

59
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:46,733
I am requesting
permission to move out!

60
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,166
And me!

61
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:49,966
Just wait.

62
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,933
But, mentor, at this
rate, we will...!

63
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,533
Enough...! Just standby...

64
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:57,400
there are other
duties I need you for.

65
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,666
(pissed)

66
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,633
Cecilia...! Let's head back
over to the monorail!

67
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,733
[Cecilia]
Understood!

68
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,100
[Autumn]
Mmph!

69
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,500
[Autumn]
You've really got
a lot of nerve!

70
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,700
[Autumn] Take that!
(powering up)

71
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,733
Nnngh!!

72
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,766
[Houki]
Cecilia!

73
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,566
[Cecilia]
AAAAAHHH!! Hmph!

74
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,833
[Cecilia]
Ah... Houki!

75
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,500
[Houki]
Got it! (pushing off)

76
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,333
[Autumn]
Uargh! Come back here, damn you!

77
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,566
[Tatenashi]
Egh! Got ya now!

78
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,433
(dodging)

79
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,233
[Tatenashi]
Hyyaa!

80
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,166
[Squall]
Mmph!

81
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,900
(Tatenashi gasping and growling)

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,633
[Squall]
You're so naive.

83
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,866
(struggling in)

84
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,133
(Tatenashi screaming)

85
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,600
That's it...

86
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:27,333
[Charl]
What is that? Huh?

87
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,766
The enemy unit has approached
airspace above this train!

88
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:31,400
[Chifuyu]
(breath) Uh?!

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,100
[Chifuyu]
That IS, the Black Knight...

90
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,666
[Madoka] Heh...

91
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,033
(Kanzashi gasps)

92
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,266
(Charl gasps)

93
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:44,666
Heh!

94
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:54,033
Mmph... You all okay?!

95
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,000
(together)
Ichika!

96
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,233
So, you're still alive.

97
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,466
[Ichika]
Did you think something like
that would kill me?

98
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:04,700
I'm not going to let
you go any farther!

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,866
Ho...! We'll see about that!

100
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,433
[Ichika]
Hyyyyyahhhhhhh!

101
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,200
Chifuyu...! I'll
stop her somehow!

102
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,700
That's great, but do it fast!

103
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,566
This train has a bomb on it!

104
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,933
What?!

105
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,600
[Chifuyu]
And we only have
ten minutes left.

106
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,600
Understood.. I'll take care
of it and see you soon.

107
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,033
Ichika...

108
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:27,866
[Ichika]
Just hang in there,
this isn't over yet.

109
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:29,400
[Autumn]
Hynnnnnaagghhhh!

110
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,833
[Houki & Cecilia]
(determined)

111
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:34,300
Ichika...! We'll
meet you guys there!

112
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,866
Houki!

113
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:38,166
(dodging)

114
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,866
(dodging)

115
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,400
Heh! (crazy laughter)

116
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,100
[Ichika]
Hyah!

117
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,400
(Rinin whimpering)

118
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:00,333
That's it!

119
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
Ma'am, all the locks
have been released..

120
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,633
The pilots can move out!

121
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:06,866
All right, everyone!

122
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:08,100
Deploy your units...

123
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,266
Let's stop this train!

124
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,133
[Laura & Charl]
Right!

125
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:19,000
[Autumn]
You won't get away!

126
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,566
[Houki]
Nngh! Hup!

127
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,233
[Houki]
Arugh! Hyaaaahhh!

128
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,533
[Houki]
(grunting) Hmph!

129
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,133
What the?

130
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,833
Cecilia..! Engage!

131
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,666
This one's all mine!

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,666
Hu‐Aaarrrggh!

133
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:44,000
(breath of relief)

134
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,333
We need to move!

135
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:46,666
Mm‐hm!

136
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:50,033
[Ichika]
Ungh! Take that!

137
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:52,900
(taunting laughter)

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,200
[Ichika]
Gwah! (straining)

139
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,900
[Ichika, thinking]
A brother... who lacks the
ability to protect... his
only sister...

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,633
Is not a real man! Arraughhhh!

141
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,500
[Laura]
Rin and I will try
to stop the train...

142
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,700
In the meantime, Charlotte, you
will have to disarm the bomb.

143
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,766
Got it.

144
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:18,233
Okay... Let's
do this thing!

145
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,400
I will... find it!

146
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,600
Less than one hundred twenty
seconds until detonation!

147
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:33,466
[Ichika]
(gritting teeth)
We're... out of time!

148
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,333
(pushing themselves,
straining and struggling)

149
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,333
We got this... Shenlong...!

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,700
[Ichika]
Huaaaaahhhh! Kyah!

151
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,166
[Ichika]
(exertion) Hyah!

152
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,666
Ichika...

153
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,433
(worrying) There!

154
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:07,200
Found it! I've
located the device!

155
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,800
[Kanzashi]
Foreign object, detected!
Transmitting data!

156
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,466
Roger! Uh!

157
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:15,066
Oh, no!

158
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,833
Ungh!

159
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,366
Laura!

160
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,200
[Ichika]
(gasp) Uh...

161
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,033
[Ichika]
No way...

162
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:28,266
(in shock)

163
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:30,400
Buh‐bye!

164
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,066
[Ichika]
Gwah! Agh! (pained gasp)

165
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:41,400
(heavy breaths) ICHIKA!

166
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,000
[Houki]
(gasp) Ichika!

167
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,666
ICHIKA!

168
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:03,100
[Madoka] Hmph.

169
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,500
This is where it ends!

170
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,000
(straining, breathing out)

171
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,766
(Charl letting out
a breath of relief)

172
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:18,633
That was a
little too close.

173
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,566
It sure was!

174
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,066
Mm!

175
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:25,733
We've got trouble!
It's Orimura' IS!

176
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,266
Uh!

177
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,566
[Madoka]
Move aside.

178
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,033
[Cecilia]
If you have plans to
go any farther today,

179
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:37,800
you'll have to defeat me,

180
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,700
champion pilot Cecilia Alcott...

181
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,900
[Madoka] Heh... (exertion)

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,400
[Cecilia] Gasp!

183
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,500
(dodging)

184
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,800
[Madoka]
Ngh!

185
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,800
(Cecilia gasps)

186
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,166
[Cecilia] (muffled scream)

187
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,066
(tossed) Ahhh! Ungh!

188
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,600
Now you'll die, too.

189
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,366
[Charl]
Ungh!

190
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,400
Ah... So, had you
forgotten about us?

191
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,600
Huh?!

192
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,533
(Laura screaming)

193
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,866
[Laura]
Uh! Mmph.

194
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:17,566
[Madoka]
Hup!

195
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,100
(groggily waking up)

196
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,566
[Houki]
(weeping) Ichika,
just hold on...

197
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,933
Ichika...! (inhale) Ichika.

198
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:58,833
(sobbing) Please.. Open
your eyes... Ichika...

199
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:03,033
[Houki]
I‐Ichika... (sobbing)

200
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:09,700
(fighting continues)

201
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:16,000
(determined) (gasp)
Rin, target approaching
at ten o'clock!

202
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,733
[Rinin]
I got it! Yagh!

203
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:25,800
Now I gotcha!

204
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,166
[Kanzashi]
Yama arashi, GOOOOO!

205
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,166
[Rinin]
You're MINE!

206
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:38,266
(sharp inhale)

207
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,533
Ungh!

208
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:45,466
(determined)

209
00:13:55,333 --> 00:14:01,266
(struggling to get up)

210
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,100
Uh...?

211
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,933
[Ichika]
Chifu‐

212
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,466
(Ichika gasps)

213
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,566
(panicked breaths)

214
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:29,366
[Ichika]
Gwah! Geh! (struggling)

215
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,066
I will kill you...

216
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,366
(Ichika still struggling)

217
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,900
I will kill you...

218
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,866
[Madoka]
Ichika Orimura.

219
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,366
(Ichika straining)

220
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,800
(strained) N‐not yet.

221
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,500
[Ichika]
(labored breaths) Right now...

222
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,000
all my friends are still
out there fighting.

223
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,833
So, there's no way...
I can die...

224
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:06,433
Not in a place like this...

225
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:12,766
[Ichika]
Byakushiki... please give me...
a little more strength...

226
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:15,666
(straining through
labored breaths)

227
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:20,600
(agreeing laugh)

228
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:28,700
(Charl straining)

229
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,700
[Rinin]
Arrrrggggghhhhh!

230
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:39,866
[Madoka] (pissed off)

231
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:41,533
Do it now!

232
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,733
Uh? It worked!

233
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,633
(exhale) Jeez,
she's stubborn!

234
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,233
(pissed off) FIRE!!

235
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,333
Mmph...

236
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,433
[Laura]
(reaction) (pissed off)

237
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,433
AAAAHHHH!!

238
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:39,333
AAHH!

239
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,766
AAHH!

240
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:46,200
(Rinin straining)

241
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,766
(Laura in pain)

242
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,366
[Rinin] Uh... Huh...?

243
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:57,266
[Squall]
It's not possible for you to
get past us.

244
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:00,866
How is it that you're not
able to understand that fact?

245
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:04,466
You're the one, who
doesn't understand! Hwh!

246
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Here we GO!

247
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:20,100
[Squall ]
Hm? Aauughh...

248
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:22,866
Right, Ichika. Do it now!

249
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:27,333
[Ichika]
Reiraku Byakuya, GOOOO!

250
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:28,500
Huah!

251
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,400
[Madoka]
Damn it!

252
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,033
[Ichika] HYAAAAH!

253
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:35,800
(Madoka yelling)

254
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,033
(Ichika gasping, straining)

255
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,766
HYAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!

256
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:54,400
(straining)

257
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,200
Hyahhhhhh‐kyaaaa!

258
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:07,166
(Madoka gasping, reaching)

259
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,233
[Squall]
M, heads up!

260
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,933
We'll have to
withdraw now...

261
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:25,333
We just can't continue
in this condition.

262
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:26,133
Mmph.

263
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:27,566
But at least, I've collected

264
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,833
sufficient real combat data.

265
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:31,533
Understood, ma'am.

266
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:37,033
(Ichika struggling up)

267
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,233
(pushing exertion) Uh...?

268
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,733
[Houki]
What happened to Phantom Task?

269
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,333
I think they're gone.

270
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:47,733
[Ichika] Uh...

271
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:50,300
Huh... boy...

272
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,600
(happy laugh)

273
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,233
[Tabane]
Well now we know Chi‐chan
received my gift...

274
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,133
But do you think she enjoyed
it as much as I did?

275
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:16,600
Most certainly... More
than the unmanned unit.

276
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,333
[Tabane]
(giggle) Oh, yeah! But there's
still so much more fun stuff
that's yet to come!

277
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:24,100
(giggling)

278
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,166
[Tabane]
Chi‐chan's younger sister, huh?

279
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,933
My goodness! Strange things
do happen, don't they?

280
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:32,266
[Chloe]
Yes, they do.

281
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,366
[Ichika]
Ahh...! (chuckling)

282
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:41,900
These outdoor baths
really are the best!

283
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,100
The stuff that happened today...
seems so unreal...

284
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,133
Did it even really happen?

285
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,100
And why did she
have Chifuyu's...

286
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:59,933
[Chifuyu]
(sigh) Man, I can't
believe it's so late.

287
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:03,866
Today was an incredible day...

288
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:07,266
That said... I'm just glad
that everyone is okay now.

289
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:10,466
Hm... It'll take a while to
finish those reports.

290
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:15,633
Let's hurry up and knock these
back and then go to bed.

291
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:19,566
The incident investigation
report said there were no
casualties...

292
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,233
In the end, it really could've
been a whole lot worse.

293
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:31,600
[Yamada]
(sigh) Do you think this Phantom
Task will ever show up again.

294
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,766
[Chifuyu]
Hmph? Who knows...

295
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:39,200
[Yamada]
Well, at least everyone's
probably feeling a little more
sure of themselves now.

296
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,833
[Chifuyu]
Yeah.

297
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,533
[Bath Attendant]
Oh, no! These're
backwards again!

298
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,033
That's better!

299
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:52,133
[Ichika]
Well, I guess I'll go ahead
and get out now.

300
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:55,433
[Rinin] Whoa, this
outdoor bath is huge!
[Ichika] Huh?

301
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:58,333
[Cecilia]
Taking a bath under the
night sky... How lovely!

302
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:01,066
[Ichika]
Holy cow! What the heck's
going on around here?!

303
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,766
[Rinin]
I'm naked and
getting in the bath!

304
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:07,000
[Rinin] This is really awesome!
[Cecilia] Oh, Rin! Please,
wait for me!

305
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,600
[Cecilia]
Ahhh... (laughing)

306
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,566
(water sloshing)

307
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,566
[Cecilia]
Oh my... (happy moans)

308
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,566
Hey guys! We're over here!

309
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,900
The water feels utterly perfect.

310
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,600
[Ichika]
Okay, just pretend you're a
rock...

311
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,166
An invisible rock that no one
can see...

312
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:31,200
Mind over matter, that's
the way out of this...

313
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,300
Huh? What is that
I am smelling?

314
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,966
Ah.. what you're smelling
is the scent of cedar.

315
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,500
It is so nice and warm
on my bare skin.

316
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,566
(agreeing sigh)

317
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,400
But! It's frigid out here!

318
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:50,666
[Tatenashi]
(cringing) Ahhh! (happy)

319
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:53,433
It's heaven...! Uh?

320
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:56,566
Houki.. Have your boobs
grown bigger again?

321
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:00,333
Uh...! Um, oh you think so, huh?
