1
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:03,233
Who's there?!

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:07,533
And my name is...
Madoka Orimura.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,466
I must take your life!

4
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:12,033
Grr! Gahh!

5
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:17,000
Hmph. I wonder how
long this'll last.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,166
(gasps)

7
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,633
(gasps)

8
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:24,733
Laura! ,/
Damn you...!

9
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,400
You have a lot of nerve,
going after my bride like that!

10
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:30,633
Hyah!

11
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,900
(gasps)

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,700
Laura:
Silent Zephyrus?!

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,633
(gasps)

14
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,400
What a pain. Huh?

15
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:53,966
She got away?

16
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,466
(sighs)

17
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,300
Are you okay, Laura?

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,366
That is what I should
be asking you.

19
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:02,900
Since it was you who she was
after... but for what reason?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,533
I don't know...

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,133
Huh?

22
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,633
What's wrong?

23
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:11,566
Hmm... Laura, your eye
is really pretty.

24
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:12,533
Huh?!

25
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:15,100
Ichika:
It's kinda like
a gemstone.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,933
Ach du lieber! This is
no time for that!

27
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:19,133
You just
got attacked!

28
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:21,900
Well, I don't usually
get to see it.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,066
Pretty...

30
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,633
Ichika said that
I look... pretty!

31
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:30,100
And of course, your timing
couldn't have been better!

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,733
Well, that is because...

33
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,666
I was looking for a
chance where I could
be alone with you.

34
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:37,966
(gasps) I cannot believe
you made me say that!

35
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,400
WAAUUGH!

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,133
(panting)

37
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:43,700
Ichika:
What was that for?

38
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,718
(siren sounds)

39
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:25,713
Ichika:
So we're supposed to be
escorting IS equipment?

40
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:26,180
Oui.

41
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,680
Recently, several countries
have asked us to test their
prototype equipment.

42
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,613
But then...

43
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,547
Sorry, but I've got
urgent family business.

44
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:38,480
You see, there's a
VERY important meeting
that I must attend.

45
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,347
Actually I already have a
different duty assignment.

46
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:43,413
Ja, Clarissa,
you were saying...

47
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:45,313
Everyone
seems busy...

48
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:47,547
I guess I will
do it alone.

49
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:48,913
Hm?

50
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:51,013
Huh?

51
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:53,247
You did not have
to come with me, Ichika...

52
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:55,247
You were just
ambushed the other day.

53
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:57,080
But that doesn't mean
I should stand by

54
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,280
and let you take all of
this on by yourself.

55
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,513
Ichika:
Don't worry,
it'll be fine.

56
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:02,880
(sighs)

57
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,047
Ichika:
Huh?

58
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:06,447
Or... it
won't be fine.

59
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:09,680
I'll check it out!

60
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,147
Ichika, wait!

61
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:44,113
Who're those guys?

62
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:46,913
There's no nationality
or ID code!

63
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:48,047
Let's go, Charl!

64
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:49,547
Right, Ichika!

65
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:52,413
Hm? Huh?!

66
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,313
Damn it! They're way
too fast to hit!

67
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:02,080
If you surrender now,
no one will get hurt...

68
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,880
is it a deal, ladies?

69
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:05,913
They're IS pilots!

70
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,213
Who the hell cares?
Waste 'em!

71
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:12,447
(yelps)

72
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:14,447
HAAAAH!

73
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:22,880
HYAAAH!

74
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,147
Dammit!

75
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:29,347
(high‐pitched battle cry)

76
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:38,547
Not too bad!

77
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:45,013
Oh, no! You can't
escape!

78
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:46,713
HAAAAA!

79
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,680
HIYAAAAA!

80
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,880
Your poor handling
is making my Revive weep!

81
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,480
SHUT UP!

82
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,613
HYAAAAAHHH!

83
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:00,880
(pained scream)

84
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:03,480
Ichika!

85
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,347
HYAH!

86
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,047
Just give up!

87
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:11,347
You have no chance
against us.

88
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,447
(sighs)

89
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:24,247
(struggling)

90
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:31,847
CHARL!

91
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,847
Oh, Ichika, dearest!
Are you feeling alright today?

92
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:50,013
Yeah, sure, why?

93
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:51,780
Could you be
any slower?

94
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,747
You should never let your
guard down, Ichika.

95
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,380
Sorry. I just didn't
want you to worry.

96
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,280
Rinin:
(sighs) Honestly.
You're hopeless.

97
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,180
Cecilia:
Oh! He certainly is!

98
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Ichika:
I said I'm
sorry, Jeez!

99
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:10,813
Hm...

100
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:14,447
Orimura appears to
have no physiological
impairments at all...

101
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:14,913
And yet...

102
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:18,647
Yamada:
I detect an anomaly with the
Byakushiki's quantum conversion.

103
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:19,313
Orimura?

104
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:20,880
Ichika:
Yes, Ma'am.

105
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,913
Yukihira, engage.

106
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:24,280
Huh?

107
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,147
He's not able to deploy
his weaponry, Ma'am.

108
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,380
And why's that?

109
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,780
I can't say without
conducting further tests.

110
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,247
Hm...

111
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:36,080
Alright.
Hand over your IS.

112
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,747
Huh...?
Hold on...

113
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:42,347
What if Phantom Task returns
and I don't have anything
to help defend us with?

114
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:43,247
But that's just it.

115
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:47,480
You'd be in worse trouble
if your Byakushiki
failed unexpectedly.

116
00:07:47,913 --> 00:07:48,647
Yeah, but...

117
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:51,680
It's better to be
powerless than defective.

118
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:53,413
Of could it be...?

119
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:56,113
That you're just scared
to be without your IS?

120
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:58,580
U‐uh... Hm...

121
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,347
No, I'm not
scared, Chifuyu.

122
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:10,113
Mm... Good boy.

123
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:11,047
Next question...

124
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:14,413
How're we going to handle it
if the girls find out
about this situation?

125
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:16,347
It'll probably
cause an uproar...

126
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,547
However, viewing this
from a security perspective,

127
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:21,180
I believe it's essential
for us to notify

128
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,480
all the representative
contenders.

129
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,147
Oh swell, this is going
to be a double headache.

130
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:29,147
No... please do not
let them know.

131
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:32,180
It is my duty to protect him!

132
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,847
I must... I must
protect Ichika...

133
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:39,580
Ichika, tell me
which one you like?

134
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,213
Ichika:
Gah!

135
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:42,013
What is this?!

136
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:42,813
Hey, Laura!

137
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:44,680
What are you doing, showing
him that kind of stuff?!

138
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,013
Ichika! Close
your virgin eyes!

139
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:48,380
I am merely trying
to determine

140
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,013
what my bride's
tastes are.

141
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,980
"Your bride's tastes"?

142
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,280
Ja... Clarissa
told me...

143
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,213
When a young girl
is in love,

144
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:59,580
A certain type of
incident may happen...

145
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,180
This is called,
the "panty flash event."

146
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,613
In this... the boy finds
a glimpse of her panties.

147
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:09,580
So you MUST wear panties you
want Ichika to see at all times!

148
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,813
Ohh!

149
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:11,380
Und these..

150
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,147
horizontal‐striped panties...

151
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:16,747
Laura:
are supposedly the very best
kind to boost your likability!

152
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,647
The striped panties...
are the best?

153
00:09:20,747 --> 00:09:23,580
Well, uh, this design
isn't bad at all.

154
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,313
Yeah, I agree...
I have some myself.

155
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,613
Chelsea, I want to order
some new knickers.

156
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:31,947
And it's imperative that
they have horizontal stripes...

157
00:09:32,047 --> 00:09:33,080
No, no, no!

158
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,380
You've got
this all wrong!

159
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,213
Perhaps Ichika is flustered
because it was the truth...?

160
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:39,413
Obviously, I have
a very modest bride.

161
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,880
(laughs)
THAT'S NOT RIGHT EITEHR!

162
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,580
Und which kind of
underwear do you like?

163
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,413
Laura, you are not supposed
to talk about things like that

164
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:49,847
in front of
a boy. Huh?

165
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:51,880
(gasps)

166
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,913
Uh, excuse moi!
Oh...!

167
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:58,913
Hm?

168
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,713
Oh... Sacre bleu!

169
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,647
Ahh! What has happened
to my underwear?!

170
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:12,813
(gasps)

171
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,213
I detect an anomaly
with the Byakushiki's
quantum conversion.

172
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:18,847
Yamada:
He's seems unable
to deploy his weaponry.

173
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,080
Oh...

174
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,447
Could it be... that
the same thing is happening
now with my underwear?!

175
00:10:24,913 --> 00:10:26,413
(whimpers)

176
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,747
Fortunately,
I have a spare!

177
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,913
Mon dieu! Not again!

178
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,113
What should I do?

179
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:42,080
(door knocks)

180
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,580
Ah!

181
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,680
Hey Charl,
are you in there?

182
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,347
Gasp! Ichika!

183
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,080
What is the
matter?

184
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,213
Well, class has
started already!

185
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:52,880
Huh?! Oh, right! Sorry!

186
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:56,713
I'm sorry,
Ichika.

187
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:57,980
Is something wrong?

188
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Well, sort of, but um...

189
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,913
It's okay now.

190
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,313
All right...
let's go then.

191
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,547
Wait, Ichika! Give me a second.
Slow down! Slow down!

192
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,313
Come ON! The bell already rang!
And you know how my sister is!

193
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:12,813
Oui... I know
this, but...

194
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:16,047
Ichika:
(growls) FASTER!
We gotta hurry!

195
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:18,713
Whoa...! Do not
pull me like that!

196
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:24,247
Wha! You okay?!

197
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:28,313
Uh... I.. am
all right! Ah!

198
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:29,147
Hm?

199
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:33,580
(progressively higher
pitched screams)

200
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,613
NOOOOOOOO!!!

201
00:11:34,713 --> 00:11:37,513
(pained yell, groan)

202
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:42,913
Sacrebleu! How long
can this keep going on?

203
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,547
Ah, Houki.

204
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:52,113
Uh‐huh?

205
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,513
May I sit here?

206
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,413
Sure. Go ahead.

207
00:11:57,247 --> 00:11:57,713
Oh!

208
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:59,313
Is something
wrong?

209
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:01,513
Oh! It is nothing...

210
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:04,947
Ooh... this seat
is very cold!

211
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:06,780
Over here!

212
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,713
Okay, Charlotte!

213
00:12:09,347 --> 00:12:12,747
Got it! Attack mode!

214
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,313
Charl:
Huh?

215
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:20,980
Uh, my timing was off.
(nervously laughs)

216
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,747
Why on Earth did they have
to ask me to help out

217
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:26,147
with this sort of thing,
today of all days?

218
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,547
Hey Charl!
You need a hand?

219
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,447
Hm? Eek! AAH!

220
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:31,713
WAAHH!

221
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:33,480
(gasps)

222
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:39,747
Come on, Charl, there
must be something going
on with you today.

223
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:40,847
I'm so sorry...

224
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:43,747
Ichika:
(sighs)I know.
The issues
with Byakushiki

225
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:47,247
must have gotten you worried.
It's my fault, right?

226
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:49,313
Oh, it is not
like that at all.

227
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:52,713
Actually I am very glad
to be of help to you, Ichika.

228
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,680
Well, that's fine, but I don't
want you to have a breakdown.

229
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,980
Just be careful.

230
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,047
Mm‐hm.

231
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:00,547
You are so sweet, Ichika.

232
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,713
Huh? What? Did you
say something?

233
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:05,447
Nothing!
(giggles)

234
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,780
Hm?

235
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,280
Laura:
Oh... ah...!

236
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,747
(horrified gasps)

237
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:19,680
Hallo, Clarissa. Laura...
This is an emergency!

238
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,480
What?! Charlotte Dunois
has no underwear?!

239
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:22,813
Oh!

240
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:24,613
It seems as though I
may have accidentally

241
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:27,047
opened up
Pandora's box here...

242
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:27,780
Bodewig.

243
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,747
Do you remember the "panty flash
event" we discussed?

244
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:31,880
Laura:
Of course I do.

245
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,213
Sometimes... in some situations
you cannot see the panties

246
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:36,313
which are supposed
to be there.

247
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:37,180
Laura:
What did you say?!

248
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,647
You see, this case,
codename: "The Full
Commando Sneak Attack",

249
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:43,113
Can be a trick of light!

250
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,680
Or perhaps, a cheat
of the viewing angle!

251
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,547
Oh, I see...!

252
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:48,080
That means..
Charlotte was...

253
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,980
Clarissa:
In all probability, you simply
were not able to see them.

254
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,513
Laura:
I see...

255
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:59,080
So Charlotte actually
was wearing the panties.

256
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,747
That is good.
Ja, that is very good. ,/
I expect nothing less
from our Squad's XO!

257
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:02,313
I agree!

258
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:04,647
She doesn't love Japanese anime
and manga for nothing!

259
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:10,713
I admire her and
want to be like her!

260
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,013
Laura:
Then it seems I will not have
to lose a comrade over this. ,/
She is your "comrade"...?

261
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:16,147
Hmph! Hearing you refer
to someone else that way
makes your commander jealous.

262
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:17,713
Laura:
Huh? What was that?

263
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,147
Oh, it was nothing.

264
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:21,180
Leader, we of the
Black Hare Squadron,

265
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,013
will always be on your side...
Please do not ever forget that.

266
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:27,313
Laura:
I appreciate that, Clarissa.

267
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:29,847
Thank you for helping me out
with this, Ichika...

268
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:32,113
I will go tell the teacher,
so you can go ahead

269
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:34,247
and return to the
classroom.

270
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:37,547
Okay... Don't push
yourself too heard.

271
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,647
(sighs)

272
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:44,013
Thank God he
did not find out.

273
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:45,947
Whatever went wrong
with Byakushiki

274
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:48,213
has now happened to
my underwear...!

275
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:51,880
(sighs) I must do
something about it soon.

276
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,213
But that means I will
need to have Revive
inspected, as well...

277
00:14:55,313 --> 00:15:00,080
And as long as that is
the case, I will not
be able to protect Ichika.

278
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,980
Aside from that,

279
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,113
what will happen if Ichika
should discover that I do not

280
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:06,580
have any
underwear on...?

281
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,447
I'm shocked to find out
you're into things like that...

282
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:12,113
Even more than when I found
out you were a girl.

283
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:13,780
But it's not...
like that!

284
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,413
Truthfully, I'm stunned...
You going commando...

285
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:20,247
Please, Ichika...!
I can explain!

286
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:22,947
I'm disappointed in
you, Charl. Good‐bye...

287
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,813
No, Ichika!
Please WAIT!

288
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:30,913
That could happen...
Mon dieu, it really could!

289
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,747
Anyway, I will have to keep
my problem a secret

290
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:36,980
until Ichika's Byakushiki
has returned to normal.

291
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,613
What?!

292
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:41,447
Huh...? Ah, bonjour. What a
coincidence seeing you here.

293
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:46,213
I was just moving
some materials to the
reference room for a teacher.

294
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,880
Well, bye‐bye!

295
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,313
Uh!

296
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:50,047
Not so fast,
Charlotte.

297
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:51,413
Exactly what you were
talking about...?

298
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:54,180
Why don't you tell us
about it in greater detail.

299
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,547
(nervous laugh)

300
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,113
Houki:
Why didn't you tell
us about that sooner?!

301
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:00,313
Cecilia:
You shouldn't have hesitated!

302
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:02,513
Don't you realize that
you're being targeted?

303
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:06,847
Uh... I guess you guys figured
out about Byakushiki, huh?

304
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:07,147
Mmm‐hm!

305
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:10,680
Then I have no choice
but to give you my
full‐time protection.

306
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,713
Oh, no. This situation
definitely calls

307
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:14,913
for me and Blue Tears
to step in.

308
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:15,747
Are you kidding?!

309
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:19,180
There's no way a
long‐distance sniper
could ever be his bodyguard!

310
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,780
Just leave it up to me
and my Shenlong.

311
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,580
Cecilia:
What did you say?
Rinin:
What's your deal?!

312
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,280
Actually...
Houki:
Hey, calm down!

313
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,180
Here. This way!

314
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:31,013
Sorry, Ichika.

315
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:33,680
But it wasn't your fault
that it happened!

316
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,380
I know, but...

317
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:37,580
Get down!

318
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,613
ARE YOU INSANE?!

319
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:43,913
Oh, there's no need to worry,
as I decreased the output.

320
00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:47,147
And now you shall be taken under
Cecilia's protective wing.

321
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:50,513
Don't shoot at the guy
you're protecting!

322
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:51,513
Look out!

323
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:52,713
GAAH...!

324
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:54,547
AH! Now Rin's
gone psycho!

325
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,480
Don't worry...
I just tapped it.

326
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:00,480
YOU TAPPED IT
EIGHT‐INCHES DEEP!

327
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,213
I've got you covered!
Aaaaahhhh!!

328
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,313
No, I'll do it!

329
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:08,113
I'm the one who's going
to protect Ichika!

330
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:10,047
Oh no, not on
my watch, you wont!

331
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:10,280
(growls)

332
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,280
I'll make it clear to
everyone to see who Ichika's
true childhood friend is!

333
00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:19,447
Uh, all right...
calm down.

334
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,647
Tatenashi:
That's quite enough!

335
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:24,213
There will be no more
using your IS

336
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:26,280
for private purposes
on school grounds.

337
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,180
(giggles)

338
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,080
No one invited the
student council

339
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,613
This is a personal issue
we're dealing with!

340
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,847
You're not part of it,
so butt out!

341
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:34,413
I see. I see.

342
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:37,380
Well, maybe I ought to just go
ahead and join in the fun...

343
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,080
And then after I
defeat all of you,

344
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,413
I'll get to have
Ichika, okay?

345
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:46,680
I like how obedient
you girls are...

346
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,880
Now I want the three of
you to rake all the sand
on the school grounds.

347
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,013
Huh?!

348
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,980
Now, what kind of example would
I set if I didn't penalize you

349
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,413
after making such a commotion?

350
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:57,747
Well, I'll leave you to it!

351
00:17:57,847 --> 00:17:59,847
(sighs)

352
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:05,680
(sighs) I feel kinda
guilty, now. ,/
Mm‐hm...

353
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:09,647
Oh, well. I guess
I gotta go.

354
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:14,013
Huh? Go where?

355
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:18,080
To go get yelled
at by Chifuyu. ,/
It's not your fault. This
wouldn't have happened if it
weren't for Byakushiki.

356
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,880
Then I... should
go with you, no?

357
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,980
But you've already done
the best you could, Charl. ,/
Let me do some of
the hard work for a change.

358
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,680
But I...

359
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,147
And thanks for
everything today...

360
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:31,847
you've been great.

361
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:33,813
Ohh...

362
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,047
Ichika is leaving now,
and it is because of me...

363
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:43,013
Ichika did not do
anything wrong...

364
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:47,147
Does this mean that I should
have told him the truth earlier?

365
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:50,413
That is impossible!

366
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:53,180
I will not be able to protect
Ichika if I tell him that,

367
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,513
and he is going
to hate me!

368
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:57,547
But then...

369
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,413
what am I
supposed to do?

370
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:13,088
Charl's Mother:
Why did you not
tell me about it?

371
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:19,067
Because I thought
you would get mad.
Oh...

372
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:23,742
Are you
hurt, ma chÃ¨re?

373
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:25,409
You are not mad?

374
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:27,042
What for?

375
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:29,675
Because I broke your
favorite mirror, mama.

376
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:33,609
There is nothing that is more
important to me than you...

377
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:35,509
Charlotte.

378
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,975
Mama... I am sorry!

379
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:41,442
I am proud of you because you
said you were sorry.

380
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:45,275
But can you promise me
that you are going to
be honest from now on?

381
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,609
I promise will not
tell a lie again, Mama!

382
00:19:51,142 --> 00:19:52,409
That is right...

383
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:55,575
Ichika is not going to hate
me because of this...

384
00:19:55,675 --> 00:20:00,409
As long as I am
honest with him...
Everything will be alright!

385
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,275
Charl:
Ichika, wait!

386
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,209
Huh?

387
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:07,342
There is something important
that I need to tell you.

388
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:10,642
Uh... tell me?
About... what?

389
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,209
I just... wanted to...

390
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:16,375
What do you
think you're doing?!

391
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:17,042
I'm getting to it!

392
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:19,142
To what?!

393
00:20:19,242 --> 00:20:23,009
I want... to show you my...

394
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:24,542
secret!

395
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:26,509
Charlotte.

396
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:28,109
HUH?!

397
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:28,975
AHH!

398
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:32,575
What... What on Earth
was I doing just now?

399
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:35,175
Bonjour! So, what is up?

400
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,342
(gasps)

401
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:40,842
Hm... Oh! So you
DO wear underwear.

402
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:43,042
Of course I do...!

403
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:46,175
I do...? Huh...?

404
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,709
Yes, I do!

405
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:50,575
Look, Ichika! Look at this!

406
00:20:56,109 --> 00:20:57,075
You big pervert.

407
00:20:57,175 --> 00:20:59,375
Ichika:
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

408
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:05,188
Chifuyu:
Have you determined
the cause yet?

409
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:08,288
It seems one of the
prototype units that was
scheduled to be brought in

410
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:12,388
had an option that would
execute quantum conversion
more effectively.

411
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:15,155
It must be the one that was
destroyed in the attack.

412
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:17,755
Right, and when it went out
of control it apparently had

413
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:19,888
some kind of impact
on Byakushiki.

414
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,788
Luckily, the effect
was temporary,

415
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:24,222
and it now appears
to be back to normal.

416
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:24,855
Hmm...

417
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:27,988
Either way, the whole thing
was suspiciously inconvenient.

418
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:30,788
I'm just glad that
Orimura's okay now.

419
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:32,955
Well, given that his
carelessness caused this,

420
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:35,555
I'd say he got...
what he deserved.

421
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:37,455
Uh? What now?

422
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:39,655
Nothing. Really.

423
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:42,622
Yeah right, so what else
have you learned?

424
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:45,155
Yamada:
They had no ties
to Phantom Task.

425
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:47,388
They were just
industrial spies.

426
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:48,688
Hmph.

427
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:50,088
(sighs)

428
00:21:50,188 --> 00:21:53,888
So, the quantum conversion
only affected your underwear?

429
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:56,222
Oui! It was worse
than commando training!

430
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:58,288
What I believe you should have
done is to put on something

431
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:03,055
that would not be
recognized as panties,
such as these... bloomers!

432
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,388
Ah...!

433
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:06,855
Bloomers?

434
00:22:06,955 --> 00:22:08,022
Why did I not
think of that?

435
00:22:08,122 --> 00:22:10,622
You know, a French
queen once said...

436
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:15,422
"If they have no panties,
then let them wear
bloomers instead." Ja.

437
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:17,455
She did not say that!

438
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:19,288
(groan)

439
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:52,188
Laura:
It is a time of great unrest.

440
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:55,588
We are engaged in the
great civil war over Ichika.

441
00:23:55,688 --> 00:24:00,522
We of the Black Hare
Squadron may occupy very
little territory, and yet...

442
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:05,922
our spirits continue to
soar higher than even
the great Mount Fuji!

443
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:09,555
Und now, we depart for war!

444
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:12,288
Ach du lieber! Frau Orimura?!

445
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:13,922
Chifuyu:
Stand aside, Bodwig.

446
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:18,822
Next time on Infinite Stratos 2,
"Sisters".
