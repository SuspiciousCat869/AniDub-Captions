1
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:04,133
Yeah... I thought I should
use this opportunity

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:06,333
to take your
Byakushiki from you.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,533
Huh?

4
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:11,733
I'm saying...
just give it to me already!

5
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,566
(strained)
So, who are you,
really?

6
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,300
Who am I... you ask?

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,266
A mysterious beauty,
disguised as...

8
00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:30,133
a corporate businesswoman!

9
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:34,000
Gosh...? Aren't you lucky?

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,000
Byakushiki!

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,700
I've been waiting so long...
for you to summon that!

12
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,000
Eat... this!

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,500
Oh... not too shabby.

14
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Obviously you're not
Miss Makigami from Mitsurugi.

15
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,366
So what gives?

16
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,966
(chuckles) I called
myself "Makigami"

17
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,200
as an alias
because I had to...

18
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,200
Don't be too scared,
you little brat!

19
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,533
(gasps)
An IS?!

20
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:45,800
That's right.
"Arachne."

21
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,200
You'll find its venom
is rather potent!

22
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:52,500
Here's a little sample!

23
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,100
(cackles)

24
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,966
Damn! Who are you?!

25
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:02,733
What?! Don't you know?

26
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,766
HAAAAA!

27
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,466
You could say I'm from
an "evil organization."

28
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:15,066
(chuckles)

29
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,700
No kidding!

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,066
Hah! That's right!

31
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,400
There's nothing funny
about this for you...

32
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,666
you little brat!

33
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:24,566
What if I told you that
I'm really Lady Autumn

34
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,600
from the secret organization
Phantom Task...?

35
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,000
Does that ring
any bells?!

36
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,233
Phantom Task?

37
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,366
Oh, you're still in the dark?

38
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:37,466
Then let me explain it to you
before I send you to HELL!

39
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,800
Take this!

40
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,500
You fool!

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
YAAAAAHHH!!

42
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,166
(laughs)

43
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:59,766
She's got too many arms!
And that armor is rock solid!

44
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:00,866
That means...

45
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:03,600
HYAAAH!

46
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,100
What the‐?!

47
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:13,466
Yeah! There's no
stopping now! HYAAH!

48
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:15,166
AAAUUGGHH!

49
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,233
Hmph! You really thought
you could take me on, huh?

50
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:31,300
GAHHH!
This can't go on!

51
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,233
Oh, no!

52
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:38,666
HYAAAH!

53
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:40,500
Not bad, you little brat!

54
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,066
Shut up!

55
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:48,300
Heh! That was cutting it
just a little too close!

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,033
Ma'am! There's an unidentified
IS detected in the locker room!

57
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:58,933
I knew they were going
to attack on the day
of the school festival...

58
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,566
but who'd have thought
there'd be just one?

59
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,966
All right, then...

60
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,233
Scan for enemy back up.

61
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,000
Order all general
students to evacuate.

62
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,766
Understood, ma'am!

63
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,733
Hm...

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,966
Rinin:
C'mon! Where the heck
could Ichika have gone?

65
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,000
Houki:
Well, it's hard to say...

66
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,533
given that he runs like a
gazelle and we're hyenas.

67
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,833
This is all because YOU
tried to come between

68
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:24,633
ME and my bride.

69
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:27,266
Laura's right, Charlotte!
None of this would have happened

70
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:29,100
if YOU hadn't interfered!

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,966
Oh sure, blame the French!

72
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,866
(siren wails)

73
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,833
Yamada:
Attention! An unknown IS
detected in the locker room

74
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,566
is currently engaged
in battle with Byakushiki.

75
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:42,166
All students with a personal IS
are ordered to deploy.

76
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,000
Yamada:
Stand by for orders!

77
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,666
Understood!

78
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:52,300
Alcott and Fan,
you're on patrol!

79
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,566
Cecilia and Rinin:
Yes, Ma'am!

80
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,566
Shinonono. Dunois. Bodewig.

81
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,400
Support Orimura. Get down to
the locker room on the double!

82
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,900
Laura, Charl, Houki:
Understood!

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
Right. Let's go!

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,033
Huh?

85
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,866
What?! The enemy's
movement... it's...

86
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:19,180
Tatenashi:
Your velocity is declining!
You need to maintain focus!

87
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,819
This is...

88
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:23,559
Tatenashi:
You have to shift from the
shooter flow's circular orbit
to a straight‐line.

89
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,659
Now I know the timing!

90
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:32,659
You little brat!
Quit zig‐zagging!

91
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,259
Huh?!

92
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,859
Now! Ignition boost!

93
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,092
HYAAAAAAAH!

94
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:47,992
Heh.

95
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:49,492
(gasps)

96
00:06:55,159 --> 00:07:00,559
Aww, you're just a boy after
and you came at me head‐on.

97
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,292
Damn!

98
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:06,725
(cackling) This is
a piece of cake!

99
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:11,225
But that's what you get
for underestimating
the spider's web!

100
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:15,425
Autumn:
Finally... it's time for
a little entertainment.

101
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:20,925
And now...

102
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,925
I'm going to take
your Byakushiki.

103
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:29,625
ARGHHH... AHHHHH!

104
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:34,859
(sinister laugh)
I'll tell you something else
while we're here.

105
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,792
We're the ones who kidnapped you
during the Second Mondo Grosso!

106
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,025
Phantom Task!

107
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,625
(evil laugh)

108
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:47,159
This is such
an emotional reunion!

109
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,392
Damn you...!

110
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:52,892
AAAHHH!!

111
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:56,459
(cackles) Okay,
you're no longer useful,

112
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,859
so I'll finish you off!

113
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,525
Tatenashi:
Oh, my. Now that would
be a problem...

114
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,692
Because Ichika...
happens to be my favorite.

115
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,692
Where the hell did you come
from?!

116
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,459
I thought all the systems
had been locked down.

117
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:11,292
Uh, Tatenashi...

118
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:14,659
I'm the IS Academy's student
council president...

119
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,992
and I conduct myself
accordingly.

120
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:20,992
Huh? What the hell
are you talking about?!

121
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:22,925
Take this!

122
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:30,559
(gasps)

123
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,459
Rinin:
Right flank, all clear.

124
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,725
Nothing to
report here, either.

125
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:44,325
Rinin:
There's an IS approaching
at high‐speed.

126
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:45,759
Intercept and
capture it!

127
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,859
Chifuyu:
Be careful, don't let
your guard down.

128
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:48,459
Right.

129
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,025
Understood!

130
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:52,859
Let's do this!

131
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:05,592
The IS is now in range...
we are prepared to engage!

132
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,892
(gasps) But that's...
impossible...!

133
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:15,825
Cecilia:
BT Two, Silent Zephyrus?!

134
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:18,892
Rinin:
What's the matter,
Cecilia? Fire!

135
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:23,592
Uh! Right!

136
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:31,059
What is... that thing?!

137
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,092
Alright. Try this!

138
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:45,092
(gasps)

139
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:49,825
Cecilia:
No way...!

140
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:54,625
That was the same Flexible
Weapon system... as Blue Tears!

141
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:56,625
But I'm supposed to be
the one with the highest

142
00:09:56,725 --> 00:10:00,192
BT compatible rate
amongst the current pilots.

143
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,425
How can she possibly...?

144
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:07,859
Rinin:
Cecilia, be careful!
GET OUT OF THERE!

145
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:25,259
Ah... Tatenashi...!

146
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,792
TATENASHI!

147
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,959
What the hell?

148
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:35,525
Autumn:
You didn't even flinch...

149
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,625
(laughs)

150
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,992
Huh?!

151
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:42,492
Huh?!

152
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:43,925
What the hell?

153
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,592
Water...?

154
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:48,959
Tatenashi:
Oh, you've figured it out!

155
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:52,059
Yes, that was a replica
made from water.

156
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,059
(giggles)

157
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,559
Oh!

158
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:02,259
I underestimated you...

159
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:06,459
Your IS... has better
mobility than I expected.

160
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,159
Who the hell do you
think you are?!

161
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:10,892
Tatenashi Sarashiki...

162
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:14,325
This is my IS...
the "Mysterious Lady."

163
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,359
Remember the name, biotch!

164
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,625
I'm going to kill you right now!

165
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:29,892
(giggles)

166
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:33,092
That's some big talk,
for someone dressed like a bug.

167
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:38,259
Damn it, you little brat...!

168
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,092
Don't push your luck!

169
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:49,559
You'll never break through
this water with that kind
of an attack.

170
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,592
That's not just regular water!

171
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,059
What the hell's going on?!

172
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,892
Oh‐ho‐ho! You noticed.

173
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:57,659
My water is rather special,
because it's being controlled

174
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,425
by nanobots that
transmit IS energy.

175
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:02,025
Pretty cool, huh?

176
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,059
You probably aren't aware,
but at this school,

177
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,959
student council president
is the most powerful title

178
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,225
anyone could have.

179
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:13,559
Who the hell cares?!

180
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,125
"The most powerful"?

181
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:22,992
You have to be kidding!

182
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,592
Tatenashi!

183
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,925
Heh!

184
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,759
Ichika...

185
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:43,592
allow me to handle
this intruder.

186
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:47,359
Hah! Don't be
so damn cocky!

187
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:04,625
Oops... I really
can't move this time.

188
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,792
The next blow
will end this!

189
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,159
Say... does it
seem hot in here?

190
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:17,925
Autumn:
What?

191
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:20,292
Tatenashi:
I don't mean just the
temperature,

192
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:23,159
I mean how it feels
‐the heat index.

193
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:24,925
What are you
talking about?

194
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:25,125
You know...

195
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:29,092
how when the humidity level
makes the temperature
feel much hotter?

196
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:31,959
Steamy... isn't it?

197
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:36,125
Mist is easily able to
penetrate through the
chinks in your armor.

198
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:37,092
(gasps)

199
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:40,259
(gasps)

200
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:44,859
Tatenashi:
Ah, yes. That's the face
I was looking for!

201
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,992
That's a face
which has just realized

202
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:50,825
that your plan is a failure. ,/
(giggles)

203
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:02,859
Tatenashi:
(giggles)

204
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,359
"Mysterious Lady"...
that's the name of my IS,

205
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,292
and it's a double
entendrÃ©...

206
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:10,325
which also means
"mist bearing lady."

207
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:16,125
It controls water
in all forms using
energy‐transmitting nanobots.

208
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:17,692
I'm not done yet!

209
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:20,759
Oh, no... you're already
done, sweetheart.

210
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,125
Right, Ichika?

211
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,159
Yukihira Nigata, Maximum yield!

212
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:29,859
HAAAAAAAAAA!

213
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,992
TAKE THIS!

214
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,259
Ichika. After her!

215
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,559
Right!

216
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,459
Damn him!

217
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:57,992
Huh?!

218
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,725
Heh.

219
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,592
Madoka:
I came to get you, Autumn.

220
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:07,192
Autumn:
Dammit, you will address me
with the respect I deserve!

221
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:08,925
Another one?

222
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:13,759
Ichika, come back!

223
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:19,159
Who are you people?

224
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,492
Heh.

225
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:31,459
GAAAAAHHH!

226
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:35,925
Miss Orimura,
that unit is...

227
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:39,025
So, they're using
that already, are they?

228
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:44,925
Tch!

229
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,259
Gasp!

230
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,631
There will be
no escape for you!

231
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:58,997
You do not know when
to give up, do you?

232
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:00,764
Yeah!

233
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:02,597
This ends here.

234
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:12,531
This one...
is really strong!

235
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,997
Oh, no!
My energy levels!

236
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:23,364
WAAAH!

237
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:27,131
Gaah!

238
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:28,697
Ichika!

239
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:57,397
Is that all you've got...
German ber soldier?

240
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:58,497
Damn you...!

241
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:00,497
How do you know
about that?

242
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:02,531
That's irrelevant.

243
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:04,864
Hm?

244
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:06,531
Madoka:
Yes, Squall?

245
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:11,297
Ichika:
(struggling)

246
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,331
Roger. Hmph.

247
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:17,131
They have too many
combat ready units.

248
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:19,397
It's time to fall back, Autumn.

249
00:17:26,264 --> 00:17:31,597
(beeping)

250
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:34,097
Everyone! Get out!

251
00:17:34,197 --> 00:17:36,964
(gradually rapid beeping)

252
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:57,097
Tatenashi:
Are you okay, Ichika?

253
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:02,331
I think so...

254
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,997
Ichika:
Hey, where'd she go?

255
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:06,397
She got away...

256
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:10,064
Somehow, she managed to make
only the armaments explode.

257
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:16,864
Ichika:
Oh, I see...

258
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:18,164
Uh, by the way,
Tatenashi... ,/
Huh?

259
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:23,597
If you could let me get up
now... that would be great.

260
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:27,064
Gee... You really ARE a pervert.

261
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:28,797
Huh?! No, I'm not! Honestly!

262
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:31,431
It was just an
emergency situation!

263
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:34,864
Ah‐ah! Making excuses
isn't very manly!

264
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:38,464
So. Since you're looking,
what do you think of my boobs?

265
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:40,731
Huh? Well, uh...

266
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:43,164
they're, um...

267
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:46,664
they're really...
um, soft...

268
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:49,597
Ichika.

269
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:51,564
Uh, yeah?

270
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,331
Pervert.

271
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,497
Ichika:
(frustrated sigh)

272
00:18:55,597 --> 00:18:57,897
Yamada:
They extracted the core
from the Arachne IS

273
00:18:57,997 --> 00:18:58,797
and detonated it.

274
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:00,897
The other one appeared
to be Silent Zephyrus,

275
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:04,864
or Blue Tears Two, which was
stolen from Great Britain.

276
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:07,164
This was the work of
"Phantom Task", correct?

277
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:10,997
Yes... Their next target would
appear to be the Byakushiki.

278
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:13,731
Yamada:
Especially since there's still
so much that we don't understand

279
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:15,331
about the Byakushiki
ourselves yet.

280
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:21,331
Right. That's exactly why
I had Sarashiki train and
safeguard Orimura, but...

281
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:22,564
I know.

282
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:24,131
You were worried
the whole time.

283
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:27,697
And maybe wishing you could
take her place, right, Ma'am?

284
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:32,431
Don't be ridiculous...
And anyway, it's
Sarashiki's job.

285
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:35,431
Yes, ma'am, of course.
(chuckles)

286
00:19:39,597 --> 00:19:41,131
Autumn:
I didn't want your help!

287
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:42,697
You need to
stay out of my way!

288
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:46,464
STOP INTERFERING
WITH MY LIFE!

289
00:19:46,564 --> 00:19:49,164
Say something,
you stinking, little brat!

290
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:50,831
Hmph.

291
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:57,331
Damn you!

292
00:19:57,431 --> 00:20:00,097
Squall:
Put it down, Autumn. ,/
You're making
too much noise.

293
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:02,064
Ah, Squall...!

294
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:07,397
You need to calm yourself.
It ruins your beautiful face.

295
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,531
Hmph!

296
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,997
This is ridiculous.
It's just stupid...

297
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:22,864
M... I want you to return
Silent Zephyrus to maintenance

298
00:20:22,964 --> 00:20:24,364
when you get back.

299
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:28,031
It's obviously still
needs some adjustments.

300
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:29,497
Yes, ma'am.

301
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:38,331
Soon... very soon...

302
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:42,064
I will begin
to get my revenge.

303
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:46,597
Yes... then we
shall finally meet.

304
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,464
Heh...

305
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,697
So now you know...

306
00:20:58,797 --> 00:21:00,931
the real reason why I was
always hanging around you,

307
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:02,931
is because I was supposed
to be protecting you.

308
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:05,797
(sighs)
I did not
know that.

309
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:08,764
The Sarashiki Family

310
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:12,097
has always been well‐known
for working in secret operations

311
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:13,331
like this one.

312
00:21:13,431 --> 00:21:15,331
Oh...

313
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:19,997
However...

314
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:22,631
It looks like the immediate
danger is gone...

315
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,364
so I'll get to relax
for just a bit.

316
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:29,197
So I'm sorry for
being so clingy.

317
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:31,631
You don't have
to apologize.

318
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:34,797
But... would you be lonely
if I stopped hanging around you?

319
00:21:34,897 --> 00:21:35,864
Huh...?

320
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:38,731
Well actually...

321
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,897
By the way...

322
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:42,197
recognize this?

323
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:44,497
Ichika:
Oh! That... crown!

324
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:46,297
Yep! That's right.

325
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:48,431
And this crown is
a wonderful little item,

326
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:49,831
because whoever
captures this crown

327
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:51,597
gets to live in the
same room with you!

328
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:54,964
WHAT?! No one told
me anything about that!

329
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:55,464
Mm‐hmm!

330
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,464
Because I've only
told that to the girls.

331
00:21:57,564 --> 00:22:00,931
You... what in the hell
were you thinking?!

332
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:02,664
In any case...

333
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:05,197
It's all mine now.

334
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:07,697
All. Mine. Now.

335
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:13,331
Oh, come on... ,/
Ichika:
Have mercy...

336
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:14,731
Nighty‐night then, Ichika...

337
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:18,597
It's so nice of you...
to have me here.

338
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:53,797
Rinin:
Teke‐ten‐ten‐ten‐ten!

339
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:54,897
Rin Fan, here!

340
00:23:54,997 --> 00:23:57,397
There's a boy who's
my childhood friend.

341
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:59,797
His name is Ichika Orimura,

342
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,897
and he just never seems
to get ahead.

343
00:24:01,997 --> 00:24:05,497
To make matters worse,
he's totally crazy about me.

344
00:24:05,597 --> 00:24:07,464
I don't know where
he's wandered off to,

345
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:10,464
but I'm sure he's
goofing off somehow!

346
00:24:10,564 --> 00:24:12,964
Oh! Miss... Chifuyu...!

347
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:17,831
Next time on Infinite Stratos 2,
"Lovely Style."
