1
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:10,233
(battle cries)

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,900
No matter how many
times I try to shake him off,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,133
he comes charging
right back!

4
00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:21,366
She's not laying down that
much fire, so here goes!

5
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:29,733
I'm not done yet!

6
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,633
Hyaaa!

7
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:32,033
Yah!

8
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,766
AAAAHHHH!!!

9
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:36,300
Heh. Not bad.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,033
You're going down
this time, Rinin!

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,266
The first training battle
of the second term...

12
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:51,500
These two seem very
enthusiastic.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,433
Uh‐huh.

14
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:55,433
And once again, Orimura is the
dominant one in the battle.

15
00:00:55,533 --> 00:01:00,200
No... that reckless idiot
has no strategy at all.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,566
Rin... the next round
ends this.

17
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:15,033
(battle cry)

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,133
What?!

19
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:29,066
Gotcha! YAAAH!!

20
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:29,966
(pained scream)

21
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:32,466
Rinin:
Your shield
energy's all gone!

22
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:33,833
(chuckles)

23
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,500
Gasp!

24
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,266
(buzzer sounds)

25
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,333
(sighs)

26
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:26,333
I was so close to
winning that match.

27
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:29,599
I'm gonna have to do something
about my fuel consumption‐ Uh!

28
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,566
Tatenashi:
Guess who!

29
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,699
Uh, uh, huh?!
Who the heck is that?!

30
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,699
Tatenashi:
Too late! Guessing
time's over.

31
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:43,066
(giggles)
I got ya, huh?

32
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,633
Yeah... who are you?

33
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,333
Well, see ya later!

34
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:52,433
By the way, you're going to be
in trouble with Miss Orimura

35
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,066
if you don't hurry
it up now (tisks).

36
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,799
Huh?

37
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:00,299
WAAAAHH!

38
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:05,533
Chifuyu:
So...

39
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,799
That's your excuse for
being so late?

40
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:10,133
Well, basically, there was
this mysterious blue‐haired girl

41
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:13,499
who I'd never met before
and she was, uh...

42
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,966
So you were late
for my class,

43
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:17,599
because you prioritized
a conversation with a girl

44
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:18,599
you didn't even know?

45
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,566
That's... not
what I said!

46
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,499
Dunois...! Please
demonstrate the rapid switch!

47
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:24,866
The what?!

48
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,999
Now... observe the rapid switch.

49
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,666
(cowers)

50
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:41,466
Um, hold on... can we talk,
Charlotte, buddy, ol' pal?

51
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,899
Is something wrong, Orimura?

52
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,433
Let us begin... revive go!

53
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:51,399
Ichika:
AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!

54
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,133
Sigh...

55
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,633
PA Announcer:
Ladies and GentleMAN
of the IS Academy.

56
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:58,866
Standby for an address
from the president
of your student council.

57
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,233
Hm...?

58
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,033
Hmm... things have been
hectic this year,

59
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,933
so hectic, that many of you
haven't properly met me yet!

60
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:13,466
Tatenashi:
My name's
Tatenashi Sarashiki.

61
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:17,299
And if you're in this student
body, that makes me your head.

62
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,599
(giggles)

63
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,999
(giggles)

64
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,499
Our annual school festival
is coming up.

65
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:30,766
That means each class must
decide what they want to do
as a fundraising project.

66
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,599
(giggles)
Good luck!

67
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,366
Ichika:
Okay... the suggestions
handed in for our class'
program fundraiser are...

68
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:41,299
Ichika:
(horrifed groans)

69
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:43,666
...all rejected!

70
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:44,766
Whaaaat?!

71
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:47,866
Are you nuts...! Who would wanna
do ANY of that kinda stuff?!

72
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:50,566
I'm absolutely sure
I would! No doubt!

73
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,466
Ichika:
WHAT?!

74
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:52,299
Tanimoto's right!

75
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,066
You should follow through with
your duty to please us!

76
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:55,833
Ichika:
B‐but!

77
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:59,133
Yeah, Ichika Orimura
is public property!

78
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,333
(angry agreement)

79
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:04,633
Miss Yamada, you wouldn't
actually approve any of these

80
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:07,166
ludicrous ideas, would you?

81
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,666
Actually...

82
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:11,033
From... the suggestions
I've seen so far,

83
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,799
I think I'd prefer
the one with the Pocky.

84
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:19,666
What I mean is, we need to do
something more normal!

85
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:22,233
Perhaps the maid cafe?

86
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,599
Student:
Oh yeah. Right on!

87
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,733
Maid cafe, Laura?

88
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,999
I'm sure it would be well
received...

89
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:33,133
Und besides, an eatery will
let you earn back the money
you spend on it.

90
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,799
Hm...

91
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:35,733
That's a good one...

92
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:39,499
Not only that, we can have
Ichika either helping out
in the kitchen,

93
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,033
or he could
be a butler.

94
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:41,366
Huh?

95
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:45,633
Student:
Orimura as a butler?
That sounds totally awesome!

96
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:46,699
We need costumes.

97
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:47,899
I know how to sew.

98
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,966
Okay, so we've settled
on the café idea?

99
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,333
I agree!

100
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:56,266
Students:
(buzzing in agreement)

101
00:06:56,366 --> 00:07:01,599
Well, I guess I can
just pretend it's a café
with some unusual outfits.

102
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:10,466
Oh, no! It's already time
for my special training!

103
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:13,199
Ah‐ah‐ah!
Hi there!

104
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,833
Right... student council
president, of course.

105
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:24,199
Oh, don't be so formal.
Just call me Tatenashi.

106
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:25,899
Uh‐huh. And what
do you want?

107
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:29,133
Oh, what I want, is to be
your very personal IS coach.

108
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:29,699
Huh?!

109
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,866
Hold on, this is
totally out of the blue!

110
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:34,366
I already have so many coaches,
I don't need a new one!

111
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:38,199
If you have so many, then why
is your performance so weak?

112
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:41,033
Well that's rather personal, and
I don't think I'm all that weak!

113
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:45,933
Oh, yes, you are...
Totally limp in the saddle.

114
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,999
Therefore, in order to make you
just a teensy‐peensy bit better,

115
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,733
I'm going to be your
personal trainer for now.

116
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,433
I'll tell you what
Miss Rude‐and‐Bossy,

117
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:54,799
let's settle this IS style!

118
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:57,033
We fight, and the winner
tells the loser what to do!

119
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,566
Sure! Sounds fun!

120
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:16,733
The rules are if you're able to
get me down on the ground even
once, you're the winner.

121
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,199
Huh?

122
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:18,033
Tatenashi:
However...

123
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,033
for me to win,

124
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,266
I must render you
unable to continue.

125
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:23,766
Are you okay with that?

126
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:26,833
You sure do like to
underestimate me, don't you?

127
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:27,633
(chuckles)

128
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,199
Oh, I'm not
underestimating anything.

129
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,333
All right...

130
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:34,766
I won't hold back.

131
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:37,033
Less talking,
more attacking.

132
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,966
(battle cry)

133
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:46,766
Tatenashi:
You see, at the IS Academy,

134
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:49,466
the title of student
council (grunt) president...

135
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:52,633
stands as proof of one
very important fact.

136
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,399
You see, the council
president by default...

137
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:00,099
is the head of
the whole student body.

138
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,366
Tatenashi:
And must, therefore,
be the strongest fighter!

139
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,166
Got it?

140
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:09,533
That's three in a row...
are you done yet?

141
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:12,533
I'm not done yet!

142
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:13,699
Hm...!

143
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,199
I do like a boy
with stamina...

144
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:18,199
That's nice to know.

145
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:24,799
(battle stance)

146
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:31,799
Uh!

147
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:32,566
AHHH!

148
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,199
Ah! You're a pervert!

149
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:38,433
(stammers)
Uh... sorry!

150
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:41,466
The thing is...

151
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:44,399
there's a price to seeing
a girl's lingerie...

152
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:45,666
and you're gonna pay!

153
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:46,733
Tatenashi:
WITH INTEREST!

154
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,966
Ichika:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!

155
00:09:57,775 --> 00:10:00,018
Where in the devil could he
have gotten to this time...?

156
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:02,885
He is the worst bride ever!

157
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:09,785
Is it possible that Ichika
is trying to avoid me...?

158
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:11,385
Ach, nein.

159
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,618
(giggling)

160
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:19,185
Oh, hey... I just
noticed that you have a
major cowlick going on

161
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,218
No! Where
is it? Gosh!

162
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:23,851
I overslept this morning,
so I didn't have much time

163
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:25,451
to fix my hair!

164
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:26,751
That's not cool.

165
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:30,651
You have to keep your
appearance up or Orimura
isn't going to notice you.

166
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,885
Appearance?

167
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:51,651
There!

168
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,851
Chifuyu:
Oh...

169
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:55,585
So you worry about stuff
like that now, do you?

170
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:57,085
Huh?!

171
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:59,485
Heh. I guess you're that age.

172
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:02,985
Uh... It's not what
it looks like, Mentor!

173
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:04,918
You may think I'm being
frivolous, but I'm‐

174
00:11:05,018 --> 00:11:06,085
Oooh!

175
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:08,185
That's "Miss Orimura"
to you.

176
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:09,951
Jawohl.

177
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,885
I just saw Orimura...

178
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:14,818
he was in front of
the club building's infirmary.

179
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:17,985
Huh? "The Infirmary"?

180
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,951
Oh...

181
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:12,418
(whispers)
Are you awake?

182
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:14,751
Huh?!

183
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:16,718
WHOAAAAAA!

184
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:18,885
Uh, what the hell
is going on here?!

185
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:19,951
You're lying down.

186
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:22,185
That's not what I
was talking abo‐OW!

187
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:25,118
There, there. Take it easy.

188
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,218
Hmm?!

189
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:31,718
Uh...

190
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,518
(giggles)

191
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:36,951
This target shall
now be destroyed.

192
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:41,685
You're dead!

193
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:42,985
Whoa!

194
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,718
Now that's a good girl.

195
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,818
Tatenashi:
All right, Ichika!
Are you ready to get started?

196
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:03,351
Ichika:
Uh, okay.

197
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,551
Hold on, that's Ichika!

198
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:08,685
I don't
understand...

199
00:13:08,785 --> 00:13:12,885
I could have sworn that he was
getting special training from
Laura in Arena Four.

200
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:17,585
Hello, girls! I'll be
taking over as Ichika's
exclusive coach from now on.

201
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:18,951
Nice to meet you!

202
00:13:19,051 --> 00:13:20,918
The council president
is his coach?

203
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:23,685
Just hold on!
What's going on, Ichika?

204
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:24,551
Mm‐hm!

205
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:29,218
Well, I kinda... lost a
contest we just had and...

206
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:32,651
Don't worry! This is all in
Ichika's best interest.

207
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:36,818
But, there is something that
I'll need to get you ladies
to help me with.

208
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:38,318
You need us?

209
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,418
To help?

210
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,985
Uh...

211
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:45,551
We're running short on time,
so let's get this started.

212
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:49,018
Charlotte, Cecilia, demonstrate
the proper shooter flow

213
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:50,451
for a circle
rondo formation.

214
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:53,185
Cecilia:
Hmm... do you suppose a
fire‐based battle stance

215
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:55,585
would be helpful
to Ichika at all?

216
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,085
(sighs)

217
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:10,418
Right! Here we go!

218
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:13,251
Cecilia:
Ichika be sure you're
paying close attention

219
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:16,051
to all my magnificent moves,
alright?

220
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:29,251
En garde, Cecilia!

221
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:31,618
Do your worst,
you villain!

222
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,518
That's incredible!

223
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:47,751
They're firing while
also executing advanced
manual frame control.

224
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:49,018
Tatenashi:
And, in addition...

225
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:52,485
they're also maintaining focus
on evasion and targeting.

226
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:54,951
Is that... understood?

227
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:56,951
AAH! Why're you there?!

228
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,518
Gasp! Ichika!

229
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:00,151
What are they doing down there?!

230
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:03,418
That is totally inapproriate!

231
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,551
Are you guys... okay?

232
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:13,451
Alright, Ichika,
now it's your turn.

233
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:17,418
Ready yourself, Ichika!

234
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,851
Ready or not, here I come!

235
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:21,451
Oh yeah... sure.

236
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:34,251
Jeez... This is
really different...

237
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:38,251
Hmm! Not bad!
Now let's see your guns!

238
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:58,118
Charl:
Ichika!

239
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:01,051
Ichika, dearest,
are you all right?

240
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:03,985
Uh, yeah, just peachy.

241
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:05,985
Let's keep going, Cecilia.

242
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:11,418
Well, I'm not in the mood,
but if you really want to get
back in the saddle, then...

243
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:13,551
One more time!

244
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:21,351
Is this because of the
Byakushiki recent augmentation

245
00:16:21,451 --> 00:16:23,685
for long‐range
assault capabilities?

246
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,185
Yes...
that's correct...

247
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,951
But actually that's
not the only thing.

248
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:30,285
Tatenashi:
In order for firepower
to be effective,

249
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:32,451
it needs wide
distribution, right?

250
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:35,418
But even at maximum output,
a charged‐particle gun

251
00:16:35,518 --> 00:16:39,585
isn't capable of rapid fire, so
it's more like a sniper rifle.

252
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:42,518
So... it's about
one lethal shot.

253
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:45,018
Given how poor Ichika's
shooting skills obviously are...

254
00:16:45,118 --> 00:16:47,985
he really has to improve...
therefore...

255
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:50,551
You made him fight
at close range.

256
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:52,685
Right... you're sharp!

257
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:58,051
Whooooaaaaa...!

258
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,718
(sighs)

259
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,585
I'm beat...

260
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,551
Tatenashi:
Welcome home, dear!

261
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:11,618
Hm...? Huh?!

262
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:14,818
Would you like dinner...?

263
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:16,218
Or to take a bath...?

264
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,551
Or perhaps... to‐have‐me?

265
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:27,318
Silly boy!

266
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:30,285
I was just asking...
would you like,

267
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:32,585
to‐have‐me.

268
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:41,351
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?!

269
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:42,218
Huh?!

270
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:49,951
Well... since I'm
your special coach...

271
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:52,185
I wanted us to
become synchronized...

272
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:54,285
by eating and
sleeping together.

273
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:58,985
Well... actually,
I... don't...

274
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:03,085
Surprise! It's
just a swimsuit!

275
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:08,451
Oh, Ichika, your
reaction is so cute!

276
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:11,258
(giggle‐laughs)

277
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:20,785
Tatenashi:
(giggling)

278
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:22,051
Ichika:
Yes, who is it?

279
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:24,285
It's just me...

280
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:25,985
I've brought some food
for you, Ichika.

281
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:27,418
Is it alright
if I come in?

282
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:30,685
Ichika:
Houki! Uh, sorry,
not right now!

283
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:34,585
Tatenashi:
Ichika! What are you doing?
Oh, I get it!

284
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:38,251
You're dying not to let her know
that you're messing around
in here, right?

285
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,585
Why you!

286
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,518
Houki:
Ichika! How dare you!

287
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:53,418
As if it's not bad enough to
sneak a girl into your room,

288
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:56,985
but you're also doing something
in here that's totally indecent!

289
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:58,785
Know your shame!

290
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:01,251
Wait, wait! You've got
it all wrong!

291
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:04,818
Huh?!

292
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:06,451
Uh‐uh, Houki... I'm sorry,

293
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:08,651
but I can't let you
kill Ichika right now...

294
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:12,051
because that would be a
little inconvenient for me.

295
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,385
What the‐?!

296
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:17,318
Game over! Bye!

297
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:32,585
Your inertial coordinates
are off‐center. Correct now.

298
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,385
Yeah, right!

299
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:38,851
So Ichika, do you always yield
to your elders so easily?

300
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:40,418
Not that easily!

301
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:43,818
Tatenashi:
Your velocity is declining!
You need to maintain focus!

302
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,385
Right, understood!

303
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,818
Okay... I see you've
increased your speed...

304
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:57,085
And now I want you to attempt
to engage the ignition boost.

305
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:58,418
Ichika:
You want me to what?

306
00:19:58,518 --> 00:19:58,985
The ignition boost.

307
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:03,151
Tatenashi:
You have to shift from the
shooter flow's circular orbit
to a straight‐line.

308
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:05,551
Then penetrate your
opponent's line of fire

309
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:08,451
and use the charged‐particle gun
at point‐blank range!

310
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:12,285
Ichika:
Hold on! I can't just
do something like that
all of a sudden!

311
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:13,118
Engage!

312
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:15,251
Gasp! Oh what the hell!

313
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:32,251
That... hurt...

314
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:36,985
Here's a tip. You must
always remember not to interrupt

315
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:39,285
the shooter flow
while you're charging.

316
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,218
Yeah, sure... simple.

317
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:43,718
Tatenashi:
Come on. You need
to learn how to do this.

318
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:46,118
So, get back up
and try it again.

319
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:47,185
Right.

320
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:52,818
Um... Ichika, are you okay?

321
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,518
Uh... define "okay"...

322
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:56,751
Have some tea...

323
00:20:56,851 --> 00:20:58,085
If you can't
eat anything,

324
00:20:58,185 --> 00:21:00,618
you should at
least drink some tea.

325
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,418
Oh... thank you, Charl...

326
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:05,518
And what happened to that
blue‐haired floosey?

327
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:09,118
She said she had some student
council business to attend to...

328
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:10,351
I guess it was your fault

329
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:13,085
for rising to her stupid
provocation to begin with.

330
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:16,985
But still, she didn't have
to beat you up this badly.

331
00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:19,851
Yeah, well, I probably just
got what I deserved.

332
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:21,551
It's like
Miss Tatenashi said ‐

333
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:23,651
Ichika:
I am still really weak
in certain areas,

334
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:27,185
and I need to master those
skills as soon as possible.

335
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:28,685
You know...

336
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:30,985
when I see a boy
who is doing his best,

337
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:32,318
That is
a wonderful thing.

338
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:35,651
I have to agree...
You're doing a lot better now.

339
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:39,985
Ahem... Ichika... if you
happen to find the conditions of

340
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:42,251
your present room to
be less than desirable,

341
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:44,718
I'm certain I could find
it in my heart to permit you

342
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:46,851
to be a guest in my
quarters.

343
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:49,285
Hey, wait just a
second there, missy!

344
00:21:49,385 --> 00:21:51,885
Ichika, I think you ought
to come stay in my room!

345
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:52,551
I have playing cards!

346
00:21:52,651 --> 00:21:55,818
Hold on! I have the
playing cards in my room.

347
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:58,285
How about hanafuda
cards, Ichika?

348
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:01,551
I forgot to mention it, but I
have tarot cards in my room!

349
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:03,285
Shh!

350
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:04,518
(Ichika snoring)

351
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:06,051
Huh?

352
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:52,885
Houki:
No one is around, right? Good.

353
00:23:52,985 --> 00:23:55,085
Ichika, I like you.

354
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,851
I‐I like you, Ichika!

355
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:01,051
Ichika, will you please
make me some miso soup?

356
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:07,551
Ichika, meow, I like
you a lot, meow.

357
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:11,318
Ah! Um, Miss Chifuyu?!

358
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:13,451
Chifuyu:
Next time on Infinite Stratos 2,

359
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:16,418
Translucent Chord of
Cinderella's Heel.

360
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:17,585
Houki:
Meow...
