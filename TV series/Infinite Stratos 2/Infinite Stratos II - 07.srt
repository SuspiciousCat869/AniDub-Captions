(Computer beeps and motors whir)

00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,380
[KANZASHI]
None of the drive sections
are responding properly.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,649
But why?

4
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:18,885
And the core's aptitude level...

5
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,253
Why isn't rising?

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,523
Am I using the wrong type?

7
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,159
Uh...

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,797
Sigh...

9
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,868
Forget this.

10
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,370
I'm gonna watch some anime.

11
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,704
Yoohoo, Orimura and Shinonono.

12
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,773
Hey Mayuzumi.
How's the newspaper going?

13
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,308
Well, I've got a favor
to ask of you.

14
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,911
A favor...
to ask me and Ichika?

15
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,481
That's right.
My older sister is working
at a publishing company now,

16
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,083
and I was wondering if...

17
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,552
maybe she could
interview the two of you

18
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,854
since you each have
your own IS units.

19
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,856
Oh, this is the magazine.

20
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:40,894
Um, this doesn't have anything
to do with IS units, does it?

21
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,531
Hold on. Have neither
of you done any of this
kind of work before?

22
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,766
No...

23
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,801
[MAYUZUMI]
Well, some pilots with
their own IS units

24
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,235
are kind of like celebrities.

25
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,704
There's some tech stuff,

26
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,472
but more about fashion shoots
and modeling and stuff.

27
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,608
Wha‐? Is that right, Houki?

28
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,777
Uh, why are you
asking me that?!

29
00:02:56,877 --> 00:03:00,380
[RININ]
Are you talking about modeling?
Let me show you my portfolio.

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,114
Rin!

31
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,283
Uh, no... that's okay.

32
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,218
And why not?!

33
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,755
Well, isn't it you
just doing some kind of
weird poses and stuff?

34
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,156
What do you mean by weird?

35
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,425
Just take a look at them
and find out for yourself!

36
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,960
Look at them RIGHT NOW!

37
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,261
Huh...?

38
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,231
Oh, not bad.

39
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,634
Haha! I told you so, didn't I?

40
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:24,037
Oh, and have a look at this
one from that summer event
we attended last year.

41
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,407
(School bell)
Hey, tell you what,
I'll catch ya after class.

42
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,577
And then check
this one out, it's‐

43
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,678
Ow, that hurt!

44
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,847
Someone needs to go
back to Class Two.

45
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,849
Yes, Ma'am...

46
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,153
[CHIFUYU]
Now then...
For today's lecture,

47
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,123
I'd like to begin by discussing
the philosophy of close combat,

48
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,393
including implementing
effective evasive maneuvers
and how to keep your distance.

49
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,598
[GIRL]
Hey, have you heard
about the upcoming event

50
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,267
that's just for people
with personal IS units?

51
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,869
[OTHER GIRL]
What? Seriously?

52
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,338
Yeah, and I've heard
that Kanzashi from
our class is going.

53
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:03,176
Is she really?
But I thought that her
personal IS hadn't
been completed yet.

54
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,813
Yeah, I hope she
gets it done in time.

55
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,083
(Exertions)

56
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,052
Um, Houki?

57
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,687
What?

58
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,390
The interview with Mayuzumi's
sister... Are you going?

59
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,425
No way...

60
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,995
It's against my principles
to be on display like an object.

61
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,097
[ICHIKA]
Yeah, that's what I
thought you'd say that.

62
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,599
Yo. Thanks for waiting!

63
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,834
Now down to business,
about the interview...

64
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,303
Well, about that, Houki
actually feels we‐

65
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,673
Oh, yeah. Did I mention
that the deal also includes

66
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,841
these dinner tickets to
a three‐star restaurant?

67
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,109
For two, of course.

68
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,079
I, uh...
I hate to say this bu‐

‐ We'll both do it!
‐ Huh?!

00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,616
Well then, it's decided.

71
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,351
The interview's going
to be this Sunday.

72
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,888
‐ Uh, but we were...
‐ Thanks again! Bye bye!

73
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,393
Houki, what about
your principles?

74
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,829
Well, upon reflection,
it turns out that I happen to be

75
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,699
a person who's thinking
can be very flexible.

76
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,734
You mean twisted.

77
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,368
Do you have a
problem with that?

78
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,970
Well, no problem.

79
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,140
I guess I'm okay with doing it
as long as you're okay with it.

80
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,809
That's right...

Ahem... In regards..
to this free dinner tickets...

We are going
together, aren't we?

83
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,154
Sure. Why not?
They're going to interview
both of us after all.

00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,556
Really?

I mean right...
You're totally right!

No, I won't!

[HERO]
‐ That's far enough!
‐ Ah! What?!

91
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,510
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Just leave it to me.

92
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,113
[KANZASHI]
Someday...
Someone will come for me.

93
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,783
Who'll be a hero...

Thanks to you.

[HERO]
I'm glad.

00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:04,464
[KANZASHI]
A hero of my own. Who will
protect me and watch over me.

I'm Nagisako Mayuzumi,

I'm Houki Shinonono.

Right.

106
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,347
If you don't mind, I'd like to
start with the interview first.

107
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,584
So, here's the first question.

108
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:27,053
Orimura, what's it like
attending an all‐girl school?

109
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,389
Well, uh...

110
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,325
it's difficult to find a
bathroom that I can use.

(Chuckle)

112
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,463
I guess what my sister's
been telling me is true!

113
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,099
Oh, yeah...

114
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,801
And now, Miss Shinonono,

115
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,970
there are some questions
about your sister that
I would like to ask.

116
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,506
(Grunt)

117
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,074
You received your personal IS
directly from her?

118
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,177
Is this a plan to make you
a representative contender?

119
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,347
[HOUKI]
About the Akatsubaki...

120
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,817
I'm grateful that she
gave it to me.

121
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,553
However...
I'm not interested in being

122
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,688
a representative
contender right now.

123
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,190
There have been offers,
but I have said no.

124
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,926
Okay, okay...

125
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,261
Now be honest,
between the two of you,

126
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,330
which one of you is
the strongest pilot?

127
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,497
That'd be me!

128
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,433
[NAGISAKO]
Oh, really?

129
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,101
Well, uh... yeah...

130
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,505
Oh, my. That's a bad thing
for you, as a hero, isn't it?

131
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,508
But I'm not trying to be
any kind of hero, Ma'am...

132
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,744
In the end, I'm just a
rank‐and‐file soldier.

133
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,179
Hey! I really like that line.

134
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,614
Okay, so if you were in command,

135
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,550
what's your
battlefield philosophy?

136
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,251
Well.. it's, uh...

137
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,519
Hmm...

to protect... my comrades!

Okay, let's move on
to the photo shoot.

143
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,169
Oh...

144
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,237
I must protect Houki!

145
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,338
Yes!

146
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,474
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

148
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,582
Uh!

149

On the other hand,
you know what?

152
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,192
Opportunity could be
knocking here.

I mean... it's not...
not too bad.

161
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,322
Oh, thank you...

162
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:47,393
And you look...
awesome yourself, Houki.

163
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,062

164
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:53,967
[HOUKI]
Ichika complimented me!
Ichika complimented me!

165
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:58,505
Right! Let's get this
photo shoot started!

166
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,507
[NAGISAKO]
Oh... hmm....

167
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:04,210
I need you to get closer, now.
Much closer.

168
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,747
Oh. Okay...
So, like this?

169
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:09,916
No. That's not good.
Get closer!

170
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,685
Okay.

171
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,656
Oh...

172
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,525
Great! I want this to have
a more mature feel.

173
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,427
Okay, next shot.
Orimura, hold Shinonono's waist.

174
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:22,896
Hm...
What?!

175
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:26,299
I‐said‐to‐hold‐her‐waist!
So, do it!

176
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,601
Ah! Yes, Ma'am!

177
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,370
Mmm, well, you heard her...

178
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,972
Uh...

00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,279

Uh...

00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,920
[NAGISAKO]
Oh, nice! Nice. Very nice.

183
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,824
Okay, next shot.
Now, Shinonono, put your arm
around Orimura's neck.

184
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,260
Come on, get to it.
Chop, chop. Go, go.

(Nervous breathing)

00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:08,875
Mm...! These are some hot shots!

188
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:09,776
Oh! Um!

189
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,277
Uh, well, that was...

190
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,679
Yeah, that was...

191
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,014
[NAGISAKO]
Good job, guys.

192
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,749
You can keep the outfits.

193
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,851
Thank you so much
for everything today.

194

[FEMALE STAFF]
Great work, everyone!

195
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,122
(Deep exhale)

196
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,824
So, should we go?

197
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,159
I guess we should.

198
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,900
(Dog barking)

199
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,740
We were so close.

200
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,575
Staring at each other...

201
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,244
What if we had actually
been alone then...?

202
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,249
Hm...

203
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:50,884
Ah!

00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,319
Whoa! Hey, are you okay?

205
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,690
Uh... Yeah, I'm all right.

206
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,058
Did you sprain yourself?

207
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,695
No, it's really not that bad.

208
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,396
Looks like the heel came off.

209
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,868
All right. I guess
I'll just take the
other one off, too.

210
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,740
There. That's much better.

211
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:16,677
Oww!

212
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,512
Hey, take it easy.

213
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:22,015
It isn't your fault
you had to wear shoes
you weren't used to.

214

Here.

215

Umm... Thank you.

00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,893
Hey, it's no big deal.

218
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,295
After all, protection
is part of my job.

Completely hopeless.

[Squall]
M, I'm coming in.

227
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:20,273
You initiated an
unauthorized contact.

228
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:24,344
Would you care to explain,
Madoka Orimura?

229
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:31,051
Your assigned task is
the seizing of other
nation's IS units...

230
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:34,721
However, if you recklessly
choose to indulge in
other endeavors...

(Evil laugh)

You always had good reflexes.

Hm...

234
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,144
Whether you're Madoka Orimura
or not, is irrelevant to
this mission...

235
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,982
For right now, you're simply
"M" of Phantom Task.

236
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:05,786
Until I settle the score,
that's my intention

237
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:09,389
Ah yes, the score...
with Ichika Orimura?

238
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,691
Hmph...!

00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,225
He's no threat at all...

240
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,561
I can kill him
anytime I like.

241
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,830
Oh yes, right.

242
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,333
You're talking about the
score with Chifuyu Orimura?

243
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,502
Heh!

244
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:23,303
I wouldn't worry about her.

245
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,839
Since she no longer
has her own IS,

246
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:29,309
she could possibly pose
much of a challenge to you‐

247
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,479
Shut your mouth!

248
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,316
You don't even hold a candle
to someone of her talent!

Sigh...

Some of us need our sleep,
so I guess it's time
to take my leave.

your next assignment.

Uh...!

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,381
Hey, Chifuyu...

258
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:11,918
I keep telling you,
it's "Miss Orimura" here.

259
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:16,557
I know, but this is
about our family...

260
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:23,296
Do you think there might be
more than just you and me?

261
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,737
Like... another sister?

262
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:35,008
You're my only family...
It's just us.

263
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,220
[YAMADA]
The entire academy is
going to be participating

264
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,890
in a tag‐team tournament
designed to improve the skills

265
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,358
of pilots with
personal IS units.

266
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,827
A tag‐team, huh?

267
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:57,831
A number of IS units
from several countries'
have been hijacked.

268
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:01,467
And as you know, one of ours
was targeted during the
recent cultural festival.

269
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,869
(Sigh...)

270
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,238
Therefore, those of you
with personal units

271
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,841
are obliged to improve
your skill level.

food for my lunch today.

So would you like
to have some?

276

Wow, are you sure, Charl?

Oui! But of course!

Ya know, I think you've gotten
to be really good at making
Japanese food.

Really?
Merci beaucoup, Ichika.

tastes good, too.

284
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,876
The batter's
nice and crispy.

285

[RININ]
Ah‐ha, there you are, Ichika.

286
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,414
Here! Please try some of my
Chinese stir‐fried pepper steak.

287
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,284
[ICHIKA]
Whoa, it looks super yummy!

288
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,087
[RININ]
Hehe... Doesn't it?

00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,658

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,996
Hmph!

292
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,131
You two will be
great wives someday.

293
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,767
You're both such good cooks!

00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,003
Oh!

Here, Ichika, please have
a taste of my omelet now.

00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:14,641
Here, have some
tea, too!

Wait a minute, why is it you're
both being so nice to me today?

00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,080
Well, that is because...

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,816
Hey, we're always
nice to you, right?

301
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,518
[ICHIKA]
Uh... You are?

302
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,186
Um, Ichika, tell me...

303
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:29,556
When you're fighting,
which kind of partner...

304
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,025
Would you normally prefer
to fight alongside?

305
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,294
Hmm... Lemme see...

306
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,763
I still need to brush up
on my sniping skills...

307
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,399
so it'd be nice if my partner
could cover me there.

308
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,767
Mm‐hm!

309
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,737
But in the end I guess it's
all about working in harmony..

310
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,806
and just being
really compatible.

311
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:47,874
Compatible?

312
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,676
Well, what do you want?

313
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,178
Ah, well... I think...

314
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,550
that my ideal partner would be
someone who'd help me out
when I get cornered.

315
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,920
Someone, who'd be willing
to put everything
on the line for me.

316
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,522
Oh...

317
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:04,157
Oui, I agree with her.

318
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,927
I like those same qualities.

319
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:10,597
Oh, and also, I want that person
to be responsive to my needs.

320
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,735
Ah... Well everyone has
their type, I guess.

321
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,469
(Slurp)

322
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:21,808
Oh, man. Today's training
sure kicked my... ahh...

323
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,744
(Sigh)

324
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,413
Huh?!

325
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,651
Um... Ichika...

326
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,986
I want you to take care
of my sister for me!

327
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,321
Your what?

328
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,095
So. Anyway, here she is.

329
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,898
Her name is Kanzashi Sarashiki.

330
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:46,600
Huh...

331
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,904
[TATENASHI]
The thing is, she's kind of,
ya'know, the quiet type.

332
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,238
Oh...

333
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,474
However, she's really
quite skilled.

334
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,511
A representative contender
of Japan actually.

335
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:58,645
And yet...

336
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,913
And yet?

337
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,482
She doesn't have
her personal IS...

338
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,519
and it's kind of
because of you.

339
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,419
What?

340
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,421
Kanzashi's IS was created by

341
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,791
the same team of developers
who built yours.

342
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:14,094
The whole staff was directed
to work on the Byakushiki

343
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,129
while her unit got
put on the back burner.

344
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,566
Aw, man... I'm sorry.

345
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,435
That's why I want you
to pair up with her

346
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,839
and be Kanzashi's partner
in the upcoming
tag‐team tournament.

347
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,741
Pretty please!

348
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,911
Aw geez, Tatenashi, you
don't have to do the sad
puppy dog thing, ya'know.

349
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,714
Really? So does that
mean you'll do it?

350
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:36,382
Well yeah, I guess it does...

351
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,220
So, I suppose you
want me to go and talk
to Kanzashi in person now?

352
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,557
Mm‐hm. But please don't
mention my name to her.

353
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,727
Huh? But why not?

354
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:49,495
It's a little bit... um...

355
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:54,200
Let me guess...
You're not that close
to your sister, right?

356
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,902
Mm...

357
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:00,674
Understood. I'll approach her
as covertly as possible.

358
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:03,309
Oh, excellent.

359
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,980
I have been waiting for you.

360
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,784
I assume you will pair up with
me for the tag‐team tournament.

361
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,186
Well, actually, I...

362
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,121
This is a tournament entry form.

363
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,757
You will put your
signature on it now.

364
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:18,625
Ah, sorry, Laura,

365
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,494
but I've already decided
who I'm teaming up with.

366
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,863
Ach, nein!

367
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:25,532
You are my bride,
yet you will team up
with someone else?!

368
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,535
This response is
totally unacceptable!

369
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,337
Ah!

370
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:41,481
The only time I want to
smell burning flesh is
at a Korean Barbecue!

371
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:43,817
This matter is just between
me and my bride.

372
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,052
I've had it to here
with this "married" crap.

373
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:49,856
And besides, why would anyone
want an idiot with no manners
as thier sister‐in‐law.

374
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,258
Ah...

375
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:56,296
My mentor hates me.
My mentor hates me.

376
00:19:56,396 --> 00:20:00,534
Right, Orimura, would you
take Bodewig back to
her desk, please.

377
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,636
Class has been
delayed long enough.

378
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,337
Right.

379
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,310
[HOUKI]
You're too slow, Ichika!
I'm over here!

380
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,482
HYAAAAAAAAAH!

381
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,884
AHH!

382
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,686
You're finished!

383
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,423
I'm not finished yet!

384
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,394
(Houki humming)

385
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,463
I beat Ichika again today.

386
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:33,600
I said he was going to pick me
as his tag‐team partner.

387
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,169
And today clearly made me
the best choice.

388
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:40,006
So, if he asks nice,
I guess I'd consider it...

389
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,142
(Cecilia humming)

390
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:46,880
Ichika said he'd already
decided who he was
going to pair up with.

391
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,582
So he must've meant me, right?

392
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:51,652
Finally! Finally, I will
get to be with Ichika!

393
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,187
(Giddy sounds)

394
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:58,659
[HOUKI]
Hmm... looks like our
British contender is in
a good mood today.

395
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,127
Oh, hi, Houki.

396
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,696
So, how's it going?

397
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:06,266
Not too bad. And how are
you doing, Ms. Shinonono?

398
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,034
Oh, I'm awesome.

399
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,103
[HOUKI THOUGHT]
Hmph! That Cecilia...

400
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:11,672
I can't wait to see
the look on her face

401
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,574
when she hears that Ichika
is teaming up with me.

402
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:16,242
Well, I'm very pleased
to hear that.

403
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,312
[CECILIA THOUGHT]
Poor dear sweet Houki...

404
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,382
She has no idea that Ichika
is going to pick ME!

405
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:25,051
[HOUKI]
Well, see ya later, Cecilia.

406
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,453
[CECILIA]
Have a splendid day!

407
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,725
[BOTH THOUGHT]
And she takes the prize!

408

[GIRL]
Hey, that's Orimura
from Class One.

409
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:37,063
[OTHER GIRL]
Are you coming to see
someone in Class Four?

410
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,199
Is, uh...
Sarashiki here?

411
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,634
[Students]
Huh?

412
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,068

Aww...

[ICHIKA]
Um, hi...
Nice to meet you.

414

My name's Ichika Orimura.

415
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,714
I know that.

416
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:54,781
You do?

417
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,149
What did you want?

418
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:57,818
Oh yeah, about that.

419
00:21:57,918 --> 00:22:00,854
I want you to be my
partner for the upcoming
tag‐team tournament.

420
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:02,122
I don't think so.

421
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:04,925
Aw, don't say that.
Please. Uh‐

422
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,161
In all honesty...

423
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:10,731
I'm in my rights
to punch you now,

424
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:15,335
but then, it's just not
worth the effort.

425
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,801
[TATENASHI]
Hi there! Good morning,
all you sleepyheads!

426
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:58,304
Today it's going to be sunny,
then cloudy, with periods
of rain.

427
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,007
So, don't forget to have your
umbrella and rubbers handy!

428
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:06,713
Be safe, be prepard,
and everybody have a
really super day now! Mwah!

429
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:09,349
Oh, my, if it isn't
Miss Orimura...
