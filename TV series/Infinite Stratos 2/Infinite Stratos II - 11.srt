1
00:00:06,157 --> 00:00:10,221
(giggle) The goddess
of victory has truly
smiled upon me this day.

2
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:14,355
Nien! The last laugh
will be belonging to me.

3
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:17,588
Grah! D'oh!

4
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:21,021
[Houki, thinking]
I'm gonna be in the same
group as Ichika today,

5
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,788
I can't afford to
waste this chance.

6
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:30,955
[Houki]
Buddha, help me!

7
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:31,955
(laughing boastfully)

8
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:36,821
D'aaaahhhh!
(defeated)

9
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,688
[Charl]
Oh, is that your camera?

10
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:40,921
Yeah...

11
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:42,988
I brought it from home so
I could take some pictures

12
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:44,788
during the trip.
For class mementoes.

13
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:46,455
"Class mementoes"?

14
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:48,455
Yeah, since I'm the class
representative,

15
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:50,321
I'll be separated
from the group.

16
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:53,188
I'll be wandering around taking
photos of the scenery.

17
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:54,755
Separated from the group?

18
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,221
You mean you will not be
joining the rest of us?

19
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:01,321
How could you neglect to
tell us such an important
thing? How could you?!

20
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:02,988
What is this?
Why are you so mad?

21
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:05,488
(Houki, Laura, Charl &
Cecilia arguing with Ichika)

22
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:08,188
(chuckle) I hope this is going
to be a great trip.

23
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:09,955
Hmmm...

24
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:11,688
Yeah, sure...

25
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:50,788
Wow!

26
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:58,255
[Charl]
Ohh... what a lovely garden!

27
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,655
[Houki]
Yeah, the hotel
has great scenery.

28
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:03,621
[Aikawa]
Everyone, come on!
Hurry up! This way!

29
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:06,055
[Charl & Houki] Oh?
[Ichika] Huh? Guh?!
(Students screaming excitedly)

30
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,655
[Aikawa]
This is great! (laughing)

31
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:09,455
[Takatsuki]
I wonder what the
rooms look like.

32
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,121
[Nohohon]
Yay, yay, yay!

33
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,388
[Ichika]
Unnghh... so beautiful...

34
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:17,088
[Yamada]
Everyone, listen up!

35
00:03:17,188 --> 00:03:21,121
All of you are going to be on
free‐time in your groups after
this meeting is concluded.

36
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:24,488
We're all scheduled to pay
a visit to Kiyomizu‐dera
Temple this evening.

37
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:29,455
Make sure that you arrive...
no later than the scheduled
time... Understood...?

38
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:30,988
You're dismissed!

39
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:32,288
[Students]
Yes, ma'am!

40
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,588
(Ichika worn out)

41
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:38,288
[Yamada] Um...
[Ichika] Hm?

42
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:40,688
A piece of luggage was
just delivered for you.

43
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,288
Huh?

44
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:46,255
Mm‐hm...?

45
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:49,988
Is something wrong?

46
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:54,155
This piece of luggage was
delivered for me, but I
don't know what it is.

47
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:55,921
Hm...?

48
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,821
[Ichika] Uwahh... What the‐
Kanzashi] Whoa!

49
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:02,521
Ta‐da...!

50
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,088
It's me, Miss Tatenashi!

51
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:06,388
T‐Tatenashi?!

52
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:08,321
Sister?! You!

53
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:11,921
[Kanzashi] (growling angrily)
[Tatenashi] Ahh! Kanzashi,

54
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:14,321
[Tatenashi] please stop that!
Hey, hey! Cut it out!
[Ichika] Uhh...

55
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,588
[Kanzashi] (struggling)
[Tatenashi] Little sister! I
haven't done anything yet! Wah!

56
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:20,088
[Kanzashi]
Give me a hand, Ichika!

57
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:22,188
[Ichika]
Uh, right!

58
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:23,755
[Kanzashi] Uwaugh!

59
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:27,388
[BOTH] Ungha! (exhale)

60
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,488
[Kanzashi]
Whew...!

61
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:32,121
[Ichika]
Man, what was that?

62
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:34,355
(chuckling)

63
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,321
[Cecilia]
Fleeting feelings...

64
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:42,321
dancing in the autumn breeze...

65
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:47,621
[Cecilia]
Oh, yes...

66
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,988
The season of love
has definitely arrived.

67
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:53,855
[Ichika]
Hey, Cecilia! Do you mind?

68
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:55,621
Huh?

69
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,488
(exhaling)
Absolutely beautiful.

70
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,488
[Cecilia]
(happy) Huh?!

71
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,255
[Cecilia, thinking]
My, he's such an impatient boy.

72
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:07,655
If he wants to take photographs
of me, he should simply reveal
his intentions.

73
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:12,555
[Cecilia]
Did it come out beautifully?

74
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:15,755
I'd like to have a look at
it, if you wouldn't mind.

75
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:16,888
Of course.

76
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:18,355
Uwah!

77
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:20,355
[Ichika]
Aren't the autumn maple
leaves beautiful?

78
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:21,888
Look at the foliage!

79
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,755
Ichika..! What on earth
is this supposed to be?!

80
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:28,155
Huh...? It didn't come out
blurry or something, did it?

81
00:05:28,255 --> 00:05:32,121
[Cecilia]
That is not the point here!
In the first place, you are
so totally‐

82
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:34,755
[Nohohon] Orimu! Orimu!
[Cecilia] Uh?

83
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:36,421
[Nohohon]
Will you take our picture?

84
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:38,655
Oh! Yeah!
(grinning)

85
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,955
Huh?

86
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:41,421
Over here, Orimura!

87
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:44,188
Hey, no fair..!
Over here, too!

88
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:46,888
Uh...! Okay...!

89
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:48,955
Please wait for your turn.

90
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:50,521
(seething)

91
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:55,455
[Tanimoto]
Okay... make sure you get
everything in the shot!

92
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,555
[Aikawa]
Hold on! Let me get
in the photo, too!

93
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,321
[Kishihara]
It really is gold!

94
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:02,221
[Nohohon]
Whoa... look at all the koi!

95
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,988
[Kagami]
Check it out, you guys!
See the bride?

96
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:09,455
[Takatsuki]
Ohhhh... The all‐white
kimono is divine!

97
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:30,088
Ah... Ichika!
(Ichika struggling)

98
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:32,255
Huh...? Yeah?

99
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:34,488
Uh... What are
you doing?

100
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:37,355
[Ichika]
Ah... My lens cap fell
underneath this.

101
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:39,388
(pondering)

102
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:43,188
I see... I think my hand
will fit... Shall I try?

103
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:44,688
Oh, thanks.

104
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,821
[Charl]
Now then...

105
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:50,621
Hm... It is too
dark to see very well...

106
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:54,555
[Ichika]
Oh... I guess you
can't reach it, huh?

107
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:58,188
(giggle) No problem
at all, Ichika.

108
00:06:58,288 --> 00:07:00,221
[Ichika] Is it there?
[Charl] Ungh! I'm trying.

109
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,755
[Ichika] Are you close?
[Charl] It's too big!

110
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,221
[Ichika] Huh? Uh, Charl... Um...
[Charl] It doesn't fit!

111
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:08,488
[Ichika] I see something...
[Charl] Huh...? But I still
cannot see it.

112
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:11,455
That... isn't what I'm seeing!

113
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:15,021
[Charl, straining] I got it!
[Ichika whimpering]

114
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:16,355
[Charl] Here you go.

115
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:19,855
Uh, thank you...
But I, uh...

116
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:21,755
Is something wrong?

117
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,721
It... kinda...

118
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:25,021
[Ichika]
...went up.

119
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:28,655
Huh? (gasp) OHH!

120
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:30,988
And I'm sorry.

121
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:33,488
Well... I will forgive you,

122
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:36,688
[Charl]
if you will spend a little
time with me after this. Okay?

123
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:38,888
[Ichika]
Uh, okay.

124
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:47,355
(Crowd chattering)

125
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,688
[Rinin]
It's not like me to ask
a favor of the gods,

126
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:53,455
but since this shrine is so
famous for making successful
relationships,

127
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:56,155
my prayers might
be answered, right?

128
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:59,521
(giggle)

129
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:05,155
[Rinin, thinking]
Please... will you make that
idiot notice how I feel about
him? Even just a little.

130
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:06,521
[Rinin] Right!

131
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,521
[Rinin & Cecilia ] Uwuh?!

132
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:12,255
(awkward laughing)

133
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:13,588
[Rinin]
What a coincidence..!

134
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:16,155
So, uh, is this shrine
famous for something?

135
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:17,788
Uh, I just happened
to be in this area,

136
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:20,388
so I decided I'd stop
by and check it out.

137
00:08:20,488 --> 00:08:22,921
[Cecilia]
Oh! I just happened to be in
this area as well,

138
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:26,455
so I decided to pay a visit,
too... So here we both are...

139
00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:28,988
What a delightful coincidence,
huh?

140
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:30,355
[Rinin] Yeah, isn't it?

141
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:35,188
(nervous laughter)

142
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:37,621
[Rinin & Cecilia] Hmph. Hm?
(splashing)

143
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:39,955
I wish to be blessed
with many children.

144
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:41,555
Laura...! When did‐

145
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,988
Hold a second!
What did you just say?

146
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:45,521
[Laura]
Excuse me?

147
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:48,488
Is this not the place where
these wishes are granted?

148
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:50,221
[Rinin & Cecilia] (sigh)

149
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,688
[Charl]
Uh, bonjour!

150
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:52,988
[All]
Hm?

151
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:53,955
Yo!

152
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,255
[Rinin & Cecilia] Ichika?!

153
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:57,021
(angry reaction)

154
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,055
[Charl]
(embarrassed)

155
00:08:58,155 --> 00:08:59,288
[Cecilia]
Uhh..! Look..!

156
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:00,821
We demand to know
what is going on!

157
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:03,321
That's right! Have you two
been on a secret date?!

158
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,755
Oh, no. It is
not like that.

159
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:08,221
Yeah, really. No way
that would happen!

160
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:10,655
[Charl] (aghast)
[Ichika] Anyway, the
magazines in the lobby say

161
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:13,855
getting angry and frowning gives
you girls wrinkles and stuff.
[Rinin & Cecilia] (seething)

162
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:16,621
So since we're all here on
vacation... let's have fun!

163
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:19,221
[Ichika] Huh?
[Girls] (fuming))

164
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:21,855
[Ichika]
Uh‐uh! (sweating)

165
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:25,755
[Ichika]
Jeez! What the hell did
I say or do this time?!

166
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:28,321
[Girls]
Ichika!

167
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:40,288
[Yamada]
Um, excuse me, Miss Orimura...
But is there something that's
bothering you?

168
00:09:40,388 --> 00:09:42,221
[Chifuyu]
Of course there is.

169
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:46,121
Our school and our students
have already been the targets
of several attacks.

170
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:51,721
We need to keep a close eye
on everything, and ensure
that our students actually
enjoy their trip.

171
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:54,888
[Yamada]
(happy) Yes, ma'am!

172
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,488
[Ichika]
Whew! I finally
managed to lose them.

173
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:02,821
[Nohohon, singing]
Hey there! Orimu!

174
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:05,821
[Ichika] Huh?
[Nohohon] (happy giggles)

175
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:07,388
[Ichika]
Uh? Nohohon?

176
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:09,988
[Nohohon, singing]
I'm being chased by Kan‐chan!

177
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:14,688
[Kanzashi]
Honne, please wait! Oh, where
are you going?! (panting)

178
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:18,055
[Ichika]
Uh? Kanzashi... what's
up with the outfit?

179
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:19,988
[Kanzashi]
Ah! Ichika!

180
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:21,321
[Ichika] Hm?

181
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,488
Um... It wasn't my idea...

182
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:28,721
I only got it... because
everybody else said I should
try wearing something fancy.

183
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:33,588
I really didn't want to do it,
but well, you know...

184
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:36,088
[Ichika]
Well, I think it looks
really great on you!

185
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:38,288
Um! You... think so?

186
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,355
[Ichika] Sure!

187
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:41,521
[Ichika]
Uh? (frightened sound)

188
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:44,988
[Laura] Target locked!
[Ichika & Kanzashi] Huh?!

189
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:48,121
[Charl]
What looks "great" on her...
Ichika Orimura?

190
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,355
Yeah, what she said!

191
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:50,788
Unforgivable!

192
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:52,088
Gah! Not again!

193
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:53,521
ICHIKA!

194
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:55,288
[Cecilia] You won't get away!
[Charl] You will pay!

195
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,221
[Rinin] Big time!

196
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,621
[Ichika] Whooooaa!

197
00:10:57,721 --> 00:11:00,721
[Ichika]
Hold on Kanzashi!
We're outta here! Ahh!

198
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:02,521
[Kanzashi] (unsure)

199
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,221
(Ichika breathing heavily)

200
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:06,188
[Kanzashi]
Ichika...

201
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,988
[Kanzashi] Oh, no! Look out!
[Ichika] WAAAAAHH!!

202
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:16,121
Uh.. What happened..?
Hey! What's going on!?

203
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:19,755
[Ichika] Un‐uh... Oh crap!
[Houki] (seethe) Why
you little...!

204
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:22,355
What in the hell do
you think you're doing?!

205
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:24,421
[Ichika] Huuh?!

206
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,061
[Cecilia]
Oh? Mmmmm!

207
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:53,761
This is delicious...! Thank you
so much for treating me, Ichika!

208
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:55,761
[Ichika]
Yeah, how did that happen again?

209
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:58,295
[Rinin]
What was that? Got a problem?

210
00:11:58,395 --> 00:12:00,095
[Ichika]
Uh...

211
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,928
[Rinin]
You're lucky that we're letting
you off the hook this easily.

212
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:04,761
[Ichika]
(sigh) Ah‐huh...

213
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:08,128
It's a good thing that Houki
knew about such a great place
for a picnic.

214
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:13,795
[Houki]
Uh! Yeah... I guess it was...
(sigh)

215
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:20,261
[Houki, thinking]
Except that, I found this place
so that Ichika and I could come
here by ourselves...

216
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:23,395
[Kanzashi]
Chomp! (chewing)

217
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:25,628
Hey! This is good!

218
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,128
(giggle)

219
00:12:27,228 --> 00:12:29,628
(sigh)

220
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:31,428
(Laura intrigued)
[Ichika] Hm? What is it??

221
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:35,195
Uhh... What are these things?

222
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:37,995
Oh, those are
Japanese sweets, Laura.

223
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:40,595
Mmhm, would you like to try one?

224
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:43,328
[Laura]
Uh! (hesitant)

225
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:48,261
[Bunny A]
Have mercy on us!

226
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:51,228
[Bunny B]
We exist so that
we may be eaten.

227
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:55,128
And that is why there is
delicious sweet bean paste
inside our tummies!

228
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:58,695
[Bunny A]
(sobbing) But I don't...

229
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:04,428
[Bunny B]
All right, then. You may go
ahead and eat me first. Bon
appetite!

230
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:07,028
(hesitant)

231
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:10,595
Just try one.
They're great!

232
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:12,995
[Laura] Uhhh...

233
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:14,428
(determined)

234
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,428
(chomp)

235
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:25,528
[Laura]
(gasp) So tasty...

236
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:27,761
[Ichika]
Mm‐hm, Told ya!

237
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:55,395
[Ichika, thinking]
What did she say, I should
never forget those who were
in my past.

238
00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:57,361
(thoughtful)

239
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:06,795
[Houki]
Hey, um... Ichika!

240
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:09,795
[Ichika]
Oh... Houki!

241
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:11,995
Why aren't you
with the others?

242
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:16,395
Oh well... it looks like
we've gotten separated.

243
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:18,895
You know...

244
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:21,861
there's supposed to be
a wonderful bamboo forest
close by.

245
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,661
Have you been there already?

246
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:28,628
No, not yet... But it sounds
great... You wanna go?

247
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:31,695
Aah... Yeah, let's go!

248
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:51,561
[Houki]
(sigh) This is such
a lovely place...

249
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:53,361
[Ichika]
Mm‐hm.

250
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,861
[Ichika]
Hmph, it really is.

251
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:03,828
[Houki]
I was really hoping that I
would get to come here...

252
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:08,528
...together, with you.

253
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:13,128
[Ichika]
Hey... Do you remember how you
and I used to take walks
together like this?

254
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:16,728
[Houki]
Uh...? Yeah, I remember that...

255
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:21,095
You'd ask me to go for
walks with you after we
finished training...

256
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,695
Sweet memories.

257
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,528
[Houki]
Hey, uh... Is there something
wrong?

258
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:34,095
You don't sound like yourself.

259
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:35,861
[Ichika]
What? You think so, huh?

260
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:39,161
[Ichika]
Oh by the way, can I get a shot?

261
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:42,861
[Squall] Or would you prefer...
that I take it for you?
[Houki & Ichika] Huh?

262
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:46,128
You'd rather be in the photo
together, wouldn't you?

263
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:50,128
[Ichika]
Oh, sure. We appreciate it.

264
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:57,261
(happy) Thank you
so much, ma'am!

265
00:15:57,361 --> 00:16:00,728
I did have great‐looking
subjects... Both of you.

266
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:02,428
Oh, thanks.

267
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:07,428
Enjoy the rest of your
trip... Ichika Orimura, kay?

268
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:14,995
Did I... tell her my name?

269
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:17,261
Un‐uh...

270
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:22,628
[Yamada]
The veranda outside the
Kiyomizu‐dera Temple's main hall

271
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:24,861
sits thirteen meters
atop the hillside.

272
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:30,361
It is supported by a "hell
stop" structure comprised
of 139 wooden pillars.

273
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:32,695
(Students intrigued)

274
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:34,595
C'est magnifique!

275
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,861
It's quite beautiful!

276
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:42,728
Hey, everyone, make sure
that you return back to the
monorail platform at the
appointed time, okay?

277
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:44,028
[Students]
Yes, ma'am!

278
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,295
I'm going to check
out souvenirs.

279
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:49,461
Hey, do you want to go
see what's over there? (giggle)

280
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:51,061
Oh?

281
00:16:56,795 --> 00:17:02,528
Hm...? Etiquette requires that
you ask for permission before
you take a lady's picture.

282
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:04,928
[Ichika]
Oh... well I...

283
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:09,295
(small chuckle) Be sure to
give me a copy later, okay?

284
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:11,961
Eh?

285
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:12,995
(sigh)

286
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:14,861
(giggle)
Hello, Ichika.

287
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:16,328
Hey, what's shakin', Charl?

288
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:18,761
I was hoping you could show
me the pictures you took.

289
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:21,295
[Ichika]
My pictures...? Okay.

290
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:23,061
Whoa...

291
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:25,328
You have been to so
many places today.

292
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:27,728
[Ichika]
Uh! Um, places?

293
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:29,961
I'd very much like to
have a look at them, too.

294
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:33,095
Huh? D'uoh
(whimpering)

295
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:34,128
Too close...

296
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:35,561
[Cecilia]
Have a look at this one.

297
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:37,161
It's really wonderful,
don't you think?

298
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:39,295
[Charl] But I am not done
looking at them yet.

299
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:40,661
[Cecilia] Well, neither am I.

300
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:41,861
[Charl] But I got here first!

301
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,061
[Ichika] Just take turns!

302
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:45,628
Orimura, I want
to see them, too.

303
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:47,361
It's not fair!

304
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:49,228
Me, too, Orimu! Me, too!

305
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:50,995
(Girls arguing)
[Ichika, smushed]
Come on, girls!

306
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:53,095
[Ichika]
You can't all look at
them at the same time!

307
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:54,328
I'm not done yet!

308
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:55,795
Give it to me!
[Ichika] Ack!

309
00:17:55,895 --> 00:17:57,328
(Girls still arguing)
(Ichika getting pushed around)

310
00:17:57,428 --> 00:17:58,795
[Ichika] AH!

311
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:05,028
[Ichika] Ohhh...! (Sigh)
[Students] Oh! Ah! No! Aw...

312
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:08,695
I guess, I'll go get it.

313
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:16,095
[Ichika]
(sigh) Let's see...
It should be around here.

314
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,061
Huh?

315
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:26,461
You again!

316
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:33,395
[Madoka]
Ichika Orimura... I am
here to take.. your life.

317
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:35,761
Geh!

318
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:39,461
[Madoka]
Come... Black Knight!

319
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:43,095
(wincing)

320
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:48,428
[Houki]
Hm? Uh... Hey, Cecilia!
(Cecilia gasps)

321
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,661
[Houki]
It's almost time for us to
meet up at the station, so
where are you going?

322
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:57,795
Oh, Ichika still hasn't come
back yet... so I thought I had
better go find out what's
keeping him.

323
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:59,395
Where could he be?

324
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,477
[Yamada]
Okay everyone, make sure
your travel buddy is
sitting next to you!

325
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:11,864
Uh, ma'am.. Orimura
isn't here yet!

326
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:15,697
And Shinonono and Alcott
haven't come back yet either.

327
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:18,031
Hm? Look at that.

328
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:19,697
[Girls] Huh?

329
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:21,397
(concerned)

330
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:24,864
Miss Yamada... Go ahead and
take these students back to the
hotel,

331
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,831
and I'll see you there
once I find the others.

332
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:28,664
[Yamada]
Hm? Yes, ma'am.

333
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:31,031
(gasp)

334
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:33,297
What the...!

335
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:34,031
(gasp)

336
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,131
Huh?

337
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:50,731
Hmmm...

338
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,631
[Tatenashi]
So here you are, gazing down

339
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:55,431
from the highest perspective.

340
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:59,097
I guess celebrities don't think
like the rest of us, huh?

341
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:00,697
Hmph.

342
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:04,464
[Squall]
"Moscow's Thick Fog",
I believe...

343
00:20:04,564 --> 00:20:06,597
Wasn't that the name of your IS?

344
00:20:06,697 --> 00:20:11,797
[Tatenashi]
That's what it used to be
called... But it's the
"Mysterious Lady" now.

345
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:15,031
[Squall]
(chuckling) I see.

346
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:20,197
[Tatenashi]
So, what's Phantom Task up
to...? Nothing good, I'll bet.

347
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:28,964
[Squall] My... Such attitude.
And just what do you know about
our plans in the first place,
Miss Sarashiki?

348
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:32,197
[Tatenashi]
I won't let you do
whatever you please.

349
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:39,264
(chuckle) The situation was
practically perfect... but I
guess you arrived just a little
too late!

350
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,397
HYAAAH!!

351
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:42,997
(screaming, struggling)

352
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:46,931
You see, we've already begun!

353
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:49,364
(struggling)

354
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:54,331
[Students] AAAAHH!!

355
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:57,064
What's happening?

356
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:58,197
I'm not sure...

357
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:01,331
I'll try to hack
into the control system.

358
00:21:01,431 --> 00:21:03,464
Miss Orimura, what's going on?

359
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,831
We need to contact the
academy immediately

360
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,131
and tell them we need
military backup stat!

361
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:09,831
Understood, ma'am!

362
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:14,497
[Chifuyu, thinking]
So they're willing to
use any means, are they?

363
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:16,531
(panting)

364
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:18,064
Ichika!

365
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:19,931
Ichika!

366
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:27,464
(crying out)

367
00:21:27,564 --> 00:21:31,231
(recovering)
[Houki] Huh!
[Cecilia] Oh?

368
00:21:32,897 --> 00:21:34,631
(maniacal laughter)

369
00:21:34,731 --> 00:21:38,331
[Autumn]
Sorry... I'm not going to allow
that, you little brats!

370
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,064
Who are you, you psycho?!

371
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:44,731
I'm Autumn, dammit. How
could you forget about me?!

372
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:54,864
Okay, "Madoka"...
why're you after me?

373
00:21:54,964 --> 00:21:58,564
Heh... You're not
the one I'm after.

374
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:00,764
[Ichika]
Eh? What?

375
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:03,297
[Madoka]
My true objective is...

376
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:07,231
Chifuyu Orimura...
to kill her.

377
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:09,831
(gasp) Kill her?! My sister?

378
00:22:16,897 --> 00:22:18,764
[Ichika] AAAAAAAHHHH!

379
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:55,197
[Ichika, voiceover]
So... this model kit is really
popular right now, huh?

380
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:57,597
All right then, I'm going
to try to make it.

381
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:04,031
Let's see... This is the
arm joint, right...?
Hm... Yeah, yeah...

382
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:07,264
Hey, this moves!
That's pretty cool!

383
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:11,631
No wonder Big Sister Chifuyu
is crazy about it...
(gasp) Chifuyu...!?

384
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:16,931
[Chifuyu, voiceover]
Next time on Infinite Stratos 2,
"Girls Over".
