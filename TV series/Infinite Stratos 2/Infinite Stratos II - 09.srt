1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,506
[Kanzashi]
Could it be? That I
actually like Ichika?

2
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:08,474
[Ichika]
So would you like to be
my partner?

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:13,413
[Tatenashi] (Laughs)
I bet my unit's data
came in handy, right?

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,550
[Kanzashi]
This was... all her?!

5
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,323
Mm...

6
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,602
(Whimpering)

7
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,172
(Light sobbing)

8
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,442
(Courtyard chatter)

9
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,848
Okay... she's not here?

10
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,456
Hello, everyone...!

11
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:41,161
Today's the day of the IS
tag‐team tournament spectacular!

12
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,031
I want to see all of the
participants out there

13
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,768
She's not here, either...
put every bit of their
hard training to work

14
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,070
Where are you, Kanzashi?
and give this competition
everything they've got!

15
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,406
[Tatenashi]
And even if you don't have your
own personal IS unit right now,

16
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,377
I think this tournament is
going to be something you
can still learn a lot from.

17
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,846
So please pay close
attention, everyone!

18
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:04,585
(Laughs)
I bet my unit's data
came in handy, right?

19
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,819
(Gasp)

20
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,656
Uh... AH!

21
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,393
You don't have to do anything
at all, Kanzashi...

22
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,062
Because I'll handle
everything for you...

23
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,230
Wha‐?

24
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,768
But... but I... can do this!

25
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:27,140
(Giggle)
No, you should just
remain incompetent.

26
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,309
I won't...

27
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,346
(Tatenashi laughs)
NOOO!

28
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,953
There's no way...
I can't beat her.

29
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,223
There's no way...

30
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:50,296
But I have to go...
I have to.

31
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:55,035
Therefore, with the
hope that this experience
will be a worthwhile one,

32
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,872
I would like to declare this
tournament officially open!

33
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:06,046
And now that we've
dispensed with all the
required formalities...

34
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:09,883
It's time to announce the tag
team tournament match‐ups!

35
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,386
Oh!

36
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,793
Kanzashi! Where are you?!

37
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,699
Uh! Could she have
already gone down to
the pit by herself?

38
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,801
(Explosion)
AH!

39
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,104
Now what?!

40
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,508
UH! Miss Orimura!
We're under attack!

41
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,545
Hmph. What are those?

42
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,814
They look like the same
unmanned type as before.

43
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,584
No, wait... Those are
an advanced version!

44
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:44,317
How many?

45
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,485
Five, ma'am!

46
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,120
They appeared at
each arena's pit...

47
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,923
And now they're attacking the
students with personal IS units

48
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,424
who were standing by!

49
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,894
Damnit... This is
way too fast!

50
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,095
Huh?

51
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,863
Instructors, evacuate
the students...

52
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,700
All combat‐capable
instructors, prepare
to deploy!

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,901
Understood!

54
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,137
<i>You're pretty bold,</i>
<i>all right...</i>

55
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,541
<i>But don't underestimate us!</i>

56
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,078
Agh!

57
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,989
Huh?! What's up with her?!

58
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,858
[Cecilia]
Rin, get back!

59
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,627
UGH!

60
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,035
AH!

61
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,436
AHH!

62
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,809
Hng! HNNNG!

63
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,047
OHH!

64
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,717
Get down, Laura!

65
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,988
Ugh! Hnnnng... Aahhh!

66
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,890
Ch‐Charlotte!

67
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,893
Huh?!

68
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,068
(Gasp)

69
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,836
(Muffled squeak)

70
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:17,644
<i>No. No!</i>
<i>What's happening?!</i>

71
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,050
[Kanzashi]
No... help me...

72
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,654
Somebody, please...

73
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,092
Orimura!

74
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,561
[Ichika]
AAAGGHH!

75
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:38,431
Guh! Hng!
[Kanzashi](Whimpering)

76
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,234
Kanzashi! You okay?!

77
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,970
Hah... Orimura!

78
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,208
Activate your IS...!
You're in this now!

79
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,844
Okay! Uh...

80
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,884
Uggh! Huh?

81
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,753
Orimura!

82
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,457
Each shot...
has so much power...

83
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,193
Uh... Uh!

84
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:12,098
I wish I... I could...

85
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,067
...find the courage...

86
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,571
to fight beside you!

87
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,609
Hyaaaaaahh!

88
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,478
Let's push it outside
and get some distance!

89
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,485
[Houki]
Hagh! Hah!

90
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,054
Yaaggh!

91
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,889
[Tatenashi]
I gotcha now!

92
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,728
Ugh! This thing's really hard!

93
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,498
Hey, Houki! Activate the rear
armor, then give me a push!

94
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,333
Hm! Got it!

95
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,869
Hrragh!

96
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,370
I got your back!

97
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,772
Let's do it!

98
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,210
(Grunting)

99
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,719
What's the plan?!

100
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,822
We're going to break
through that unmanned
IS unit's armor!

101
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:09,623
But how...?!

102
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:10,724
We're just going to do it!

103
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,861
I wonder how you
like THIS move!

104
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,733
You ain't seen nothin' yet!

105
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,268
I still have a few
tricks up my sleeve!

106
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,406
Ah! The armor!

107
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,674
AAHH!

108
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,976
Houki... Ggghh...!

109
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,346
Ah! Now! Switch all your
settings to defense,

110
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,615
or it will suck you in!

111
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,883
But... you just...

112
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,956
I'm immortal...
Didn't you know that?

113
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:48,629
[Tatenashi]
Take this. Mysterious Lady's
maximum firepower!

114
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,196
No! Don't do it!

115
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,198
Now Mistilteinn spear...

116
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,167
ENGAGE!

117
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,806
Huh?! What's that?!

118
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,909
No! Don't tell me
Houki and the others‐

119
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,845
[Kanzashi]
Watch out!
Whoa!

120
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,080
I'll handle this!

121
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,248
Kanzashi?!

122
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,750
Orimura, go check the condition

123
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,417
of that gate over there!

124
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,153
You got it!

125
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,598
Hah! You're not getting
past me, you bitch!

126
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:29,536
[Yamada]
I'm detecting some type of
unknown energy emerging from
the enemy IS unit's arm!

127
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:33,006
And now we're experiencing
problems with the shield
barrier deployment!

128
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,742
Absolute defense
has been nullified!

129
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,477
Ugh...

130
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,914
That must be an
anti‐Infinite Stratos IS.

131
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,150
(Grunting)

132

Ahh!

(Panicked breaths)

138
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,220
No...

00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:25,826
NOOOO!

140
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,295
How dare you?
How dare you?!

141
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,097
My sister!

142
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:35,201
NOOOOO!

(Charging up)

151
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,727
This ends NOW!

152
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,268
[Kanzashi]
The core!
If I blow that away...

Uh...

I‐Ichika?!

Ichika!

00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,194
[Kanzashi]
<i>Ichika... I'm sorry...</i>

168
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,533
(Mechanical roar)

169
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,267
I couldn't help you...

170
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,037
<i>I'm so useless.</i>

171
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,977
<i>I'm sorry...</i>
<i>that I was ever born...</i>

172
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,888
<i>In the real world...</i>
<i>there are no heroes.</i>

173
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,657
<i>They don't exist.</i>

174
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,391
[Tatenashi]
AAGGHHH!

175
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,326
Ugn!

176
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:44,097
Ngh. Huh?

177
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,336
[Kanzashi]
Big sister?

178
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:55,475
(Gasp)

179
00:12:55,576 --> 00:13:00,480
No... SIS...!

180
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,418
Big sister!

181
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,454
Big sister!

182
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:16,162
(Giggle)
How long has it been
since you've called me that?

183
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:21,467
I thought you were...
How did you...?

184
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,738
This is... impossible!

185
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,106
No, it isn't.

186
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,574
Yes, it is!

187
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,443
Because in this world...

188
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,713
there are no heroes!

189
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,214
[Ichika]
No, there aren't.

190
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,582
Huh?!

191
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,120
There's no perfect
invincible hero...

192
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,222
None.

193
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,924
Ichika...

194
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,593
The heroes from our
fantasies...

195
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,363
they never get to laugh..
and they don't cry either.

196
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,001
But I am human,

197
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,303
so I cry AND I laugh.

198
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,506
I lose sometimes, too.

199
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,143
But I don't give up...

200
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:07,848
And if the choice means losing
my friends, then I'll fight!

201
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,950
But aren't you...

202
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,019
Aren't you afraid of dying?

203
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,856
Of course I am...

204
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:21,394
But if I run away,
how could I ever be
able to live with myself?

205
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:26,499
(Sobbing)

206
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,234
Then I'm just...

207
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,037
I'm just...

208
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,674
I'm just a coward!

209
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:36,777
(Sobbing)

210
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,612
But who cares?

211
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:40,981
Does it matter?

212
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,949
If you're weak?

213
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:44,785
Or dirty?

214
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,187
Or have no courage?

215
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,356
You're still human.

216
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,162
But... But, Sis...
I wanted to be‐

217
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,065
It's all right,
my dearest Kanzashi...

218
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,134
No one's perfect.

219
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,905
The trick is
accepting that.

220
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,509
Accept your weaknesses,
and then you can beat them.

221
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,512
Because...

222
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,648
I'm just human?

223
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,151
That's right.

224
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:20,153
And besides,

225
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,590
you're my sister,
and I'm proud of you!

226
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,227
[Kanzashi]
Really?

227
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:35,235
I'll finish this
for you, sister!

228
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:40,306
This is a good luck
charm. Use it when
you really need it.

229
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,609
An aqua crystal?

230
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,412
Good luck... freshman.

231
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:47,981
Mm‐hm!

232
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,651
(Grunting)

233
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,390
Ichika, status report!
Answer me!

234
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,161
Ugh... Houki?

235
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,997
Can you use your
Reiraku Byakuya?

236
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,833
[Ichika]
No. I don't have
any more energy left.

237
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,835
Then I'll have to use
my Kenran Butou.

238
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,336
Agh!

239
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,473
But I've gotta
buy some time first!

240
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,545
[Kanzashi]
Don't worry!
I've got you covered!

241
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,646
Kanzashi!

242
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,648
There's no time
to debate this!

243
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,719
Hyah!

244
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:31,224
[Houki]
Ichika! Grab my hand!

245
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,229
(Charging up)

246
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,071
Hng!

247
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,443
Uchigane Nishiki...
Manual guidance system,
activate!

248
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:54,280
Ready Yama Arashi
warhead missiles,
one through forty‐eight!

249
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,283
Setting all trajectories
to manual control!

250
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,522
Uchigane Nishiki,
lend me your power!

251
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,536
NGH! It's still coming?!

252
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,571
Gah! Hrg!

253
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,674
Akatsubaki...
I'm counting on you!

254
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,743
Let's show 'em what we can do!

255
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:30,250
Okay! Enough with the
techno‐babble already!

256
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,720
That left arm is mine!

257
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,126
Finish it!

258
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,764
HAAAAAAAAGH!

259
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,432
Kanzashi! Now!

260
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:47,568
Mm!

261
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,682
It didn't work?!

262
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,051
It's time to use that charm!

263
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,687
(Snap)

264
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:15,896
Yay!

265
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:17,831
(Sighs of relief)

266
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:24,470
(Laughter)

267
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,240
(Sigh)
Cecilia!

268
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,342
Ahah!

269
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,247
Uh! Hah...

270
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,716
Hm!

271
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:37,483
Boo‐yah

272
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:44,558
(Crows cawing)

273
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,396
(Waking sounds)

274
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,733
[Kanzashi]
Huh! Big sister!

275
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,868
Ah! Kanzashi! Oww!

276
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,871
Please, try not
to move...

277
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,173
You could reopen
your wounds.

278
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,375
Yeah...

279
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:15,288
[Tatenashi]
<i>I wonder how many years it's</i>
<i>been since the last time we</i>
<i>talked like this.</i>

280
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,361
<i>I guess I owe this</i>
<i>opportunity to Ichika.</i>

281
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,933
<i>Why did I ask him to do this?</i>

282
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:33,774
<i>Did I want to cling to him</i>
<i>and rely on his kindness?</i>

283
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,144
[Kanzashi]
Big sister?

284
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,713
Oh! Uh‐huh?

285
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:41,347
Is something wrong?

286
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,116
Your face is really red.

287
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:47,120
Oh? It must
be because
of the sunset.

288
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,657
Uh‐huh...
Is that what it is?

289
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,697
Um, Sis?

290
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:57,964
Yeah?

291
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:03,269
I‐I'm sorry
about everything...

292
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,773
I mean, I'm such
a bad sister!

293
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,509
(Sobbing)

294
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,443
[Tatenashi]
That's not true.

295
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,778
Huh!

296
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,448
Actually, you are
my dearest little sister...

297
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:20,253
And you're growing up
to be so strong.

298
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,558
Oh, Big sister...

299
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,561
Big sister!
(Sobbing)

300
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,295
(Soft gasp)

301
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:37,671
[Yamada]
They turned out to be
advanced unmanned units
with unregistered cores.

302
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:40,340
We only managed
to get two of them.

303
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,109
Inform the government
that they have all
been destroyed.

304
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:48,248
But ma'am! If we do something
like that, the whole school
could be in jeopardy!

305
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,482
Don't worry...

306
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,618
Have you forgotten
who you're talking to?

307
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,520
I think I can
protect this school.

308
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,522
And as a matter
of fact...

309
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,760
I'd bet my life on it.

310
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,833
Right. This is it.

311
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,035
I have to let him know...

312
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,437
Just how I feel.

313
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,406
(Knock on door)

314
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,542
(Door opens)

315
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:18,344
[Ichika]
Oh, Kanzashi. What's up?

316
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,480
Well, um...

317
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:23,116
Here... This is
for you, Ichika.

318
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,985
What's this...?

319
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:26,587
Anime?

320
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,622
Um, yeah.
I don't know‐

321
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:30,490
Man, I used to watch
this all the time!

322
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:34,460
Hah!
You never know what you love
until you find it.

323
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:35,929
You too, huh?

324
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,898
Uh! Yeah...

325
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:41,602
Mm‐hm... Kinda...

326
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:42,636
I see!

327
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:46,039
[Kanzashi]
And I like... like...

328
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,909
Like... very much!
(Panicked panting)

329
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:52,112
[Ichika]
Huh? Uhh...

330

I said it...

332
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:00,954
I said I like Ichika!

333
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,489
It was okay, right?

334
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,459
I didn't say anything
that was too weird, did I?

You never know what you love
until you find it.

336
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:09,462
You too, huh?

337
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:11,497
Mm‐hm... Kinda...

338
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:15,268
Wait! What'd I say?! Oh no!

339
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:18,872
I think I told him that
I liked anime, not him!

Kanzashi's late‐night
ramen snack!

344
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,145
We have three delicious flavors:

00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:08,615
Salt, bean paste, and soy sauce!
