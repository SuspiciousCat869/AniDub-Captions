1
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's see... Is it this way?

2
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:27,200
(camera scanner)

3
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:33,500
Whoa...

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,733
I didn't even know there
was a place like this here...

5
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:40,033
The IS Academy sure is
a helluva lot bigger
than I thought it was.

6
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:49,633
Okay... is this
the right place?

7
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:50,700
Huh...

8
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,900
Uh... Miss Yamada...!

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,266
I'm here now, and I brought
all the materials you asked for.

10
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,000
Come on...!

11
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,500
This can't be
the right room...

12
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,500
Mmm...

13
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,300
YAH!

14
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:17,766
Who are you?!

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,366
What's going on?!
Who are you people?!

16
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:27,500
Huh...?!

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,733
(struggling)

18
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
Huh?

19
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:24,000
What's going on?

20
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,133
(horn blows)

21
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,400
Yamada:
Welcome, Ichika Orimura.

22
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,900
Welcome to the forbidden
fairyland of paradise.

23
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Hey, who is that?!

24
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,133
Yamada:
(giggles)

25
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:45,566
(drums and gong)

26
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,400
Huh...? Uhh...?

27
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,433
Yamada:
And now... let the
games begin!

28
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,400
This is the "Cater to Ichika
Orimura Service Battle"...

29
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,966
and I'm your moderator,
Maya Yamada!

30
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:02,166
Uh, Miss Yamada?!

31
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,333
Each of you may choose
what you want to do...

32
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:06,900
and then whoever is the
most pleasing to Orimura,

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,100
is the winner!

34
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,233
Okay! Let's get
the ball rolling!

35
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,833
Wait just a second here!

36
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:12,733
What ball?!

37
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,433
And who's...
rolling it?!

38
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:15,266
(coy laugh)

39
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:18,733
Oh it's a very special
top secret competition!

40
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:19,833
Huh?

41
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,966
And the first one up is
contestant number one...!

42
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:26,400
Let's hear it for...
Houki Shinonono!

43
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,466
Huh?

44
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,133
Uh...

45
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:59,066
Uh, Houki?

46
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Uh...

47
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,533
Could you stop
staring like that?

48
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,966
I... wish I could...

49
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:16,300
Right! You come up to the stage
right this minute, Ichika...!

50
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,833
And... let me serve you!

51
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,266
Huh...?

52
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:29,700
Mm...

53
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,666
Houki...

54
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:41,533
what's up with that
foxy outfit you're wearing?

55
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:46,033
Well, I'm supposed to be,
um... a fox priestess.

56
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,500
Why...?

57
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,066
But... the thing is...

58
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,533
I've got the urge
to stroke it.

59
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:57,733
I'm not... sure if
that's... appropriate.

60
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:02,733
Umm... could you not...
stare... so hard?

61
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,333
Ulp! Sorry...
about that.

62
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:09,300
Houki:
So... uhh...
Do you want some tea?

63
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,766
Sure.

64
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
Ah! That's good.

65
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,666
Oh! Really...?
You want some more?

66
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,000
Uh... yeah, thanks.

67
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:33,533
(gasps)

68
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,266
(yelps)

69
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,733
Oh, I'm sorry!
Sorry, I'm sorry!

70
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,233
Are you okay?

71
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,000
Uh... sure.
It's nothing.

72
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,433
I'm so sorry.

73
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,966
I'm really nervous,
you know?

74
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:52,200
I haven't ever dressed up
like this before... so...

75
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm sort of
embarrassed about it.

76
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,200
I hope I didn't
burn anything.

77
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,200
No... I‐I'm good...

78
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,000
(gong)

79
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,033
So sorry! Your time
is up now!

80
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,900
But it can't be!
That was way too fast!

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
Get used to it, kid!

82
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,566
There are other contestants
waiting behind you.

83
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,733
Uh... I'm really sorry
about that.

84
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,866
Uhh... sorry
about what?

85
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:33,266
The tea wasn't
all that hot anyway...

86
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,400
However...

87
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,000
Huh?

88
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,033
Could you let me feel...
them first?

89
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,300
Could... you
feel them?!

90
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,700
So soft...

91
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,833
Houki:
Hey! Come on, just
a little longer!

92
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:50,566
Hey! Let go of me! Ow!

93
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,833
(sobs) Stop it!

94
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay... what now?

95
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,433
Uh... HAA?!

96
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:57,733
Cecilia?!

97
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,500
Ichika:
(shuttered breath)

98
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,933
Ichika... are you ready
to be thoroughly enraptured

99
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,233
by my first‐rate service?

100
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,700
Okay, what's really
going on around here?

101
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,366
(giggles) I'm afraid
I can't tell you that just yet.

102
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,600
However, let's just say
that I would like for you

103
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,933
to play a game
of billiards with me.

104
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,800
Um, is that kinda like pool?

105
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,933
I've never done this before.

106
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:26,400
Then I'll be glad to show you
how to hold your shaft.

107
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,300
(giggles)

108
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:35,033
First of all, you'll need
to take hold of the cue

109
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,600
firmly like this...

110
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,466
Whoa...

111
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,400
The object is to knock each
of the balls into the pockets,

112
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,766
starting off with the
smallest number on the table.

113
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,566
Whoa.

114
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:16,000
Wow... you REALLY know
how to handle a stick!

115
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,033
Cecilia:
(laughs)
Oh, I'm not that good.

116
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,233
Oh! Oh! Oopsie!

117
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,233
Hmm... and it's
your turn now, Ichika.

118
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,733
So... I'm supposed to knock it
into that hole, right?

119
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,300
Mm...

120
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,933
No, Ichika.

121
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,966
You have to loosen up.
And not be so stiff.

122
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,833
You need to relax
your shoulders

123
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:41,533
and hold your
arm like this...

124
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,066
See?

125
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,533
Cecilia, you... know
they're touching me, right?

126
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:50,566
No, no, no. You need
to focus on the shot now.

127
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,066
(giggles)

128
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,666
Uh... I'm having
trouble focusing.

129
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:59,600
Don't worry about it...
Just follow my instructions...

130
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,166
HEY! THAT'S INDECENT!

131
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:04,900
Don't stand up there!
You could fall and hurt someone.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,466
Huh?

133
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:07,733
Here goes!

134
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,966
(cheers)

135
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:14,966
Huh?

136
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:18,033
Time's up! Put your
balls away, now!

137
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,466
That was quite
impressive, Ichika!

138
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:23,300
It's all because you were such a
good teacher, Cecilia!

139
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,800
Can we do this
again soon?

140
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,066
Uh‐huh! Next time it will
be just the two of us.

141
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,000
Cecilia:
Oh? No! No!

142
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,133
Ichika:
WHOA!

143
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,333
Oww... my spleen.

144
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:36,666
Sacre bleu!

145
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,400
No, no, no, no! It is too early
for you to turn on the lights!

146
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,533
I am not ready!
Merde! No!

147
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:43,033
I am not ready!
Merde! No!
It's an elevator...?

148
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,066
Huh?

149
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:52,100
Uh... Ichika...
you are having fun, non?

150
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,566
Uh, you too, Charl?

151
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,200
Mm‐hmm...

152
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,900
So, what are you...
dressed as?

153
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,700
A French poodle.

154
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,866
You like poodles... right?

155
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,766
Uh‐huh...

156
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,533
Et voila! I baked some
cookies for you, Ichika.

157
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:16,233
Oh, I LOVE cookies!

158
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,333
Whoa! They look good!

159
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,400
And I was just
getting hungry, too!

160
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,966
Please allow me
to feed you, Ichika.

161
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:31,533
Close your eyes
and open your mouth.

162
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:32,666
Huh?

163
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,333
Uh, like this?

164
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,900
Uhhh...

165
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,633
Mm...

166
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,366
(screams)

167
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,400
Buh?!

168
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:52,600
Uh... BAHAHAAAA!

169
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:53,800
Ah!

170
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,766
Uhhh...!

171
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:08,333
Ah... uhh... uhh...

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,433
(gasps)

173
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,866
(gasps)

174
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,866
(gasps)

175
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,500
(jazzy saxophone plays)

176
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:25,400
Mm, Ichika, by any chance...

177
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:31,433
do you... like
this way... better?

178
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,733
AHHH!

179
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:36,633
(whistle blows)

180
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,033
Huh?

181
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,400
This is totally immoral...!

182
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,633
Dunois, you're
officially disqualified!

183
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:46,033
AHHHH!

184
00:12:58,157 --> 00:12:59,397
Rinin:
TAKE THAT, YOU FRENCH POODLE!

185
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:02,931
That jerk! He's glued
to her boobs!

186
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:04,364
Laura:
Ahem...

187
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:06,897
What?!

188
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:09,464
I am experiencing technical
difficulties with this,

189
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:11,064
will you zip it up for me?

190
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:12,897
I can't reach.

191
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:14,797
Oh, sure...

192
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:17,864
And the ears
are crooked... Hm!

193
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,931
Gut! The equipment
is all set...

194
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:24,564
Let us move out!

195
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:28,664
(sighs)

196
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:35,564
Jeez! What is
it now?! Huh?

197
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:42,397
Heh... The Black Hare Squadron
will now demonstrate

198
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:43,797
their skills.

199
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:45,064
Um... Laura?

200
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,831
What's the deal
with this setup?

201
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:50,031
Ichika... I challenge
you to darts!

202
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:53,764
Oh! This is something I've
actually done before!

203
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,264
This contest offers
fantastic rewards...

204
00:13:57,364 --> 00:13:58,797
Everybody wins.

205
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:05,764
(bells chime)

206
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:16,797
Tickets for a week of the
cafeteria's daily lunch combos!

207
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,631
Whoa! That's a
really awesome prize!

208
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:23,564
Okay! I'll do my best.

209
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:28,031
Oh, yeah!

210
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:31,697
(bells chime)

211
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:42,831
Uh... well that's unexpected.

212
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:44,897
My swimsuit!

213
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:46,497
That is mine!

214
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,831
But... why...
is that here?!

215
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,097
Due to unfortunate
budgetary constraints,

216
00:14:51,197 --> 00:14:54,064
some of the prizes are actually
items from Miss Bodewig's

217
00:14:54,164 --> 00:14:55,264
personal collection.

218
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:56,131
Uh?!

219
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:57,497
Huh?

220
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:04,731
If you really insist
on keeping it, then...

221
00:15:04,831 --> 00:15:08,864
Laura:
What happened? I know
I still have some time left!

222
00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:10,097
Whoa!

223
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:13,664
Tatenashi:
Oh, Ichika!

224
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:15,397
Tatenashi:
This way, this way.

225
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,464
Hey! Hold on!
AHHH! My arm!

226
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:27,331
Meow! Hi there.

227
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:28,564
(giggles) Mmm...

228
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:32,131
Ah! Tatenashi, you too?!

229
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,597
You've been hogging so many
cute girls all to yourself...

230
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:39,397
That must really stroke
your male ego, huh, Ichika?

231
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:41,764
AHH! IT'S TOO MUCH!

232
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:46,297
So... I've been meaning to tell
you, there's this other girl

233
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:48,497
I'd like to introduce
you to sometime soon.

234
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:49,264
Huh?

235
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:50,731
Mew...!

236
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:53,664
And it's true that she does
tend to be a little bit

237
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:56,031
on the quiet side, buuut...

238
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:58,464
she's a very cute girl.

239
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:07,697
Listen, could we maybe talk
about this after you get off?

240
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:11,831
This is serious...
pretty please?

241
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:17,097
Ichika:
Tatenashi?

242
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:19,697
Huh?

243
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:22,597
Well, this sucks! Things were
going pretty well, too. Nyah!

244
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:25,131
Rinin:
GET AWAY FROM HIM,
YOU CAT BURGLAR

245
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:26,397
YAAAAAAH!

246
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:27,764
The hell?!

247
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:31,764
Listen up, girly! You'd better
give me my costume back!

248
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:32,631
Sorry, Rin...

249
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:34,931
But it looked like you guys
were having so much fun,

250
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:36,731
that just had to join in.

251
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,497
I have to tell you
that your tiny top

252
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:42,064
is awfully tight around
my chest. See?

253
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:43,131
Why you...!

254
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:45,797
Just calm down, Rin! Please!

255
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,031
Shut up...!

256
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,431
This is all because I was
watching you do nothing but

257
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:51,364
stare at boobs, and I
let my guard down!

258
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:53,531
Hmm? What're you saying?

259
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:55,397
Just admit it,
Ichika...

260
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:56,831
You were staring
at them...

261
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:57,964
Mm?

262
00:16:58,331 --> 00:16:59,497
Huh?

263
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:08,931
Sounds like SOMEBODY
wants to be the bull's‐eye!

264
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,031
AHHH! Wait a second...!

265
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,831
Let's talk about this!

266
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:15,097
All right then, Ichika.

267
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:18,997
We can pick this up some other
time right where we left off!

268
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:20,931
Uh...

269
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,697
Uh...

270
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:25,997
(gong)

271
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:26,797
Huh?

272
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:29,731
Yamada:
All contestants,
please return to the stage!

273
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,664
We still have one more
segment left to do.

274
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:34,431
Huh?

275
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:37,031
Haven't we all
had a turn already?

276
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:45,064
Huh?

277
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,397
HUH?!

278
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:10,664
Chi... Chifuyu...?

279
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:14,864
Don't say a word...
If you do, I'll kill you.

280
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:16,264
Okay.

281
00:18:16,364 --> 00:18:18,664
Now, open your mouth.

282
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:25,764
Here.

283
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,531
Oh wait, that's right!
Today is my...

284
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:45,764
Happy birthday, Ichika!

285
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:52,931
Seriously, you didn't really
need to go to all that trouble
just for my birthday.

286
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,764
Yeah, but you know you manage
to forget about your birthday

287
00:18:55,864 --> 00:18:56,631
every single year.

288
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:59,631
So we decided that we'd
throw you a surprise party!

289
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:01,597
And, of course,
we wanted to ensure

290
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:03,797
that your celebration
was a memorable one.

291
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:08,444
So it's not just a birthday.
But something special!

292
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:11,244
Ja, und the outfits
were my idea, Ichika...

293
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:15,244
A fine German lieutenant said
costumes make everything better!

294
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:18,411
I see... well thanks, you guys.

295
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:22,211
Yeah well, I certainly hope
you enjoyed everything
we did for you.

296
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:26,244
It was a bit embarrassing,
but we all did our best.

297
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:28,511
(embarrassed laugh)

298
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:29,944
I agree.

299
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,578
And you were especially
wonderful, Miss Orimura.

300
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:34,144
GRR!

301
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:37,144
Oh, please
forgive me, ma'am.

302
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:41,044
Miss Yamada...
thank you for everything.

303
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:42,911
and you
too, Chifuyu.

304
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:45,111
Mm! Hm...

305
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:46,611
It really meant a lot
that you were willing

306
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:49,411
to get all dressed up
like that for me!

307
00:19:49,844 --> 00:19:51,544
(sigh)

308
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:54,311
You know, now that I think
about it, it's been ages since

309
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:57,078
the last time the two of us
spent my birthday together!

310
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:58,778
Not since I was
a little kid!

311
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:03,244
Well, um, I have to admit
you're right about that, Ichika.

312
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:05,744
Huh...? What was that?

313
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:08,411
Nothing!
It wasn't important!

314
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:09,778
(giggles)

315
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:11,411
Oh, by the way, Orimura...

316
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:14,044
who did you think had
the best outfit today?

317
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:15,644
Say what?

318
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:17,311
Huh?

319
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:24,478
Umm... let's see...

320
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:35,644
I'd say...
my big sister Chifuyu!

321
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:38,478
Huh?

322
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:39,978
Huh? ,/
Huh...?

323
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:45,011
(seething)

324
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,244
Huh? Wrong answer, huh?

325
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:51,411
Oh, Ichika... You are
the worst kind of idiot!

326
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:55,144
ICHIKA!

327
00:20:55,244 --> 00:21:00,144
Ichika:
AHHH! NO! NOOO!
NOT ON MY BIRTHDAY!

328
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,511
Aww, man...

329
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:14,644
I don't understand why
they were so mad at me...

330
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:18,378
But other than that,
today rocked!

331
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:22,378
Huh?

332
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:29,311
Who's there?!

333
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,011
Chi‐Chifuyu?

334
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:41,078
No.

335
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:45,478
Ichika Orimura...
I am you.

336
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:48,044
Gasp! You're what?

337
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:50,344
You cost me dearly
last time.

338
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:55,511
Wait... are you... the pilot...
Silent Zephyrus, right?!

339
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:57,544
That's right.

340
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:02,444
And my name is...

341
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:05,411
Madoka Orimura.

342
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:14,111
And... for my self‐preservation,
I must take your life!

343
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:16,078
(gasps)

344
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:18,211
(gunshot)

345
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:54,011
Charl:
Ooh La‐la‐la‐la‐la‐laaa!

346
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:56,311
Today is another beautiful day!

347
00:23:56,411 --> 00:24:00,878
And this lovely weather
dries the clothes so nicely!

348
00:24:00,978 --> 00:24:02,044
Bonjour!

349
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:04,011
I am Charlotte Dunois,

350
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:06,411
and a typical day
in my life begins

351
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:11,911
by making a delicious
omelet for my beloved Ichika!

352
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:13,144
(laughs, gasps)

353
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,278
Oh! Miss Orimura?!

354
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:19,111
Next time on Infinite Stratos 2,
"The Secret Base."
