1
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,918
[Kanzashi]
Mmph... It's still
not good enough...

2
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,221
This just won't do.

3
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:25,325
Mmph. My sister would
be able to do more.

4
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,093
Uh?

5
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,399
(Sigh)

6
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:36,737
If it weren't for
his damn Byakushiki...

7
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,272
I'd have caught up to her.

8
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,608
Mmph...

9
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,545
(Sigh)

10
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,783
Uh?

11
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,251
Yo!

12
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,320
Hey, about that upcoming
tag‐team tournament...

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,790
I still need a partner.

14
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,192
Come on, Kanzashi!

15
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,528
Stop calling me
by my first name.

16
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,729
Mm... Sarashiki?

17
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,031
And don't call me by
my last name, either.

18
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,033
Well, all righty then...

19
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,035
You, girl over there!

20
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,036
Uh...

21
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,573
What are you doing?

22
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,742
Look, you just told me not
to call you by your name.

23
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,980
I'd rather be called by
my name than have you
address me in that way.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,716
Well then... Kanzashi it is.

25
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:23,717
(Huff)

26
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,185
"Miss Kanzashi"?

27
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,254
What made you want to
pair up with me anyway?

28
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,557
Uh! Well, I was...

29
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:36,096
Mm‐hm. But please don't
mention my name to her.

30
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,865
Um! Because I want to see
your personal IS!

31
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,300
Ah!

32
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,804
Uh...

33
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,710
Oh.

34
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,643
Mm... huh?

35
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,477
Waah! When did you get here?!

36
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,213
Hey, you're not
thinking about asking

37
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,981
the maintenance department
for help, are you?

38
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,551
Well, maybe...
not for me...

39
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:42,488
I thought I might
ask them a favor for
Kanzashi's personal IS.

40
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,090
Hmm?

41
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,860
That might turn out
to be more difficult
than you think.

42
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,632
I'm pretty sure...
Kanazashi is determined to
assemble her unit by herself.

43
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,866
Huh?

44
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,402
She's hung up about it
because I did mine that way...

45
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,272
But I really wish
she wouldn't worry about it.

46
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,474
You assembled
your own IS?

47
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,810
Mm‐hm. With a little
help and advice

48
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,613
from Kaoruko and the
maintenance department.

49
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,316
More importantly, how's it
coming along with Kanzashi?

50
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,519
Um, actually...

51
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,387
your sister
hit me in the face.

52
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,256
What? But that's so unlike her.

53
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,391
Normally Kanzashi wouldn't
want to waste her energy

54
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,794
on something so
totally unproductive.

55
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,596
(Sigh)

56
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,397
Did you touch her butt
or something?

57
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,300
Now why would I do
something like that?

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,836
(giggle)
I'm just yanking your chain!

59
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,739
In any case, I can't believe
Kanzashi would do that.

60
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,475
Now I get it.
You have a crush on her!

61
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,242
What?!

62
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,978
[Hero]
That's far enough!

63
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,212
[Bad guy]
What?

64
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,881
[Hero]
There's nothing to be afraid of!

65
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,115
Just leave it to me!

66
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,550
[Bad guy]
Take this!

67
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,853
[Kanzashi]
I hit him...
Why did I do such a thing?

68
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,155
Oh, Ichika...

69
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,524
You don't know it yet,

70
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,293
but I'll make you regret
not pairing with me.

71
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,429
(Crazed laughter)

72
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,772
Tremble in fear, as I,
the legendary Cecilia Alcott

73
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,776
and my Blue Tears
play your sad requiem!

74
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,144
[Kishihara]
Hey guys, have you heard?

75
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,579
Heard about what?

76
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,347
Supposedly Orimura's
been to see Sarashiki

77
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,782
in Class Four every day.

78
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,584
And he keeps asking her
to be his partner

79
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,952
in the tag‐team tournament!

80
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,622
Are you serious?
What would he do that for?!

81
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,090
I just told you, damnit!

82
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,826
I need you to get me
the package data

83
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:29,062
on that new wide‐spread
impact cannon for the
right shoulder unit,

84
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,697
and I need it yesterday!

85
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,232
You have three days to finish,

86
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,201
and I don't wanna hear
that you can't do it!

87
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,903
And as for you, Ichika.

88
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,541
You can cry and beg for
forgiveness, but you'll
get none from me!

89
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,178
Miss Kanzashi!

90
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,814
Stop following me!

91
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,593
Bonne chance, Revive!

92
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,597
(Battle cry)

93
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,080
Mmph! I will be your
worst nightmare, Ichika!

94
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,652
(Sharping knife)

95
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,457
Heh...

96
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,294
I am going to show you
what true terror really is.

97
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,662
In fact...

98
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,733
I will engrave it into
your very flesh, Ichika!

99
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,835
(Grunt)

100
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,237
Uh!

101
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,706
(Gasp)

102
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:51,712
Uh! If I could just find
some tape to repair it...

103
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,849
Oh!

104
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:59,553
I need a medic!
Get me a medic!

105
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,892
Showing you some mercy
is the least that I can do.

106
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:11,464
I'll make it quick so you
won't suffer... much, Ichika.

107
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,304
[Tatenashi]
Hmph! Gotcha, Houki!

108
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,741
What are you doing, Tatenashi!

109
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,443
So I notice you're been
training with a live blade.

110
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,045
Well, yeah, of course I am.

111
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:28,882
Hey, here's a crazy idea!
Let's hookup!

112
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,116
Huh?

113
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,588
First things first.
I'm going to check
your physical data.

114
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,557
Nothing creepy about that...

115
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,191
Okay, whatever.

116
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,596
Right, everything's all set,
so let's get down to business.

117
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,138
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

118
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,473
Is something wrong?

119
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,242
You've got some
really big boobs.

120
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,179
As a matter of fact,
I think your dirty pillows
might be bigger than mine.

121
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,548
Hey, exactly what are you
looking at in there?!

122
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,183
This is serious business?!

123
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,485
(chuckle)
All right, All right!

124
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,254
(Shower running)

125
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,628
[Kanzashi]
When did I start feeling
so uncomfortable

126
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,064
about being a member of
the same family as her?

127
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:24,037
We're both Sarashikis,
but I can't even look
at her face anymore...

128
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,807
But if tomorrow's
test flight goes well,

129
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,610
I might actually beat her...

130
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,716
What's going on here?

131
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:40,386
Someone advancing from C to S
in such a short period of time?

132
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,988
That's unheard of.

133
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,125
But I'll bet the key is
named Tabane Shinonono...

134
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,528
[Cecilia]
So, I'd like to raise
the booster output

135
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,763
in order to improve
my tuning operability.

136
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,634
[Tech Girl]
That's fine, but it's
going to make controlling
the unit more difficult.

137
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,768
And you'll lose stability.

138
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,236
I don't care
about stability!

139
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,971
I can't afford to lose
this next battle,

140
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,573
no matter
what it takes!

141
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,041
[Ichika]
Hey!
[Both]
Oh!

142
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,510
Have either of you
seen Miss Kanzashi?

143
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,745
[Both]
Hmph!

144
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,346
You need to get
out of here right now!

145
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,616
That's right! We're going
to have to report you!

146
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,285
I wonder what they're
mad about this time.

147
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,222
[Charl]
Uh‐hm? Would you
please move, Orimura?

148
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,224
Huh? Ah!

149
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:28,034
Oh, now I get it. Everyone
is probably feeling nervous
because of the competition.

150
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:32,906
And I'd better get
a move on, too.

151
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,440
Appear...

152
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,309
Uchigane Nishiki.

153
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,782
This is the day...

154
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,651
that I'm finally going to
make this work.

155
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,798
Unit control is good.

156
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:01,267
Hyper sensor connectivity
and interlock... verified.

157
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,474
Posture control thrusters...
functioning.

158
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,777
Adjusting deployment
hard‐points.

159
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,847
Shifting out of PIC
Interference region...

160
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,751
Adjusting the center of gravity
six centimeters forward...

161
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:21,154
And reigniting the
leg booster balancers...

162
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,089
at minus four.

163
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,098
(Sigh)
And she's not
out here, either...

164
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,267
What's that?

165
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,871
[Ichika]
Hey, that's Kanzashi!

166
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,207
Oh, so that's what
her IS looks like?

167
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:43,977
Huh?

168
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,980
Uh‐ah!

169
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,216
(Alarm beeping)
The Recoil control's offline!

170
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,885
But why?

171
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,420
Uh...

172
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,660
Byakushiki!

173
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,670
Big Sister...

174
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:16,877
There's no way
that I'll ever...

175
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,379
be able to
catch up with her.

176
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,147
There's no way!

177
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,618
In the end...

178
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,987
I'm still no good.

179
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,155
Kanzashi!

180
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,331
(Ichika groaning)

181
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:39,566
(Gasp)

182
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,335
Orimura, are you okay?!

183
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,972
You know what,
this really
hurts like hell.

184
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,242
I'm so... so sorry!

185
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,346
Miss Kanzashi,
are you okay?

186
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,917
Uh! Yes. I'm fine.

187
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,086
Well, I'm really
glad to hear that.

188
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,329
So the way I see it,
we're going to have to file

189
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,133
a crap load of damage
reports for all this.

190
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,969
Umm, but it's
really all my fault.

191
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,741
Hey, don't worry about it.
No one will blame you
for a malfunctioning unit.

192
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,109
Um, I... just...

193
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,679
Um, wanted...

194
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:26,747
Huh?

195
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:30,050
...to say thank you.

196
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:31,585
Eh?

197
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,187
You know,
for saving me earlier.

198
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,723
That's all right. You don't
have to thank me for that.

199
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,525
Just doin' my job.

200
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,893
(sigh)

201
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,795
Uh, is something
the matter, Miss Kanzashi?

202
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,897
Oh no, nothing.
Nothing at all.

203
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:47,133
Anyway, I bet you're hungry.
Wanna grab some chow?

204
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,334
Huh?

205
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,939
[Ichika]
Oh boy! Time to eat!

206
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,241
Yeah, uh, time to eat.

207
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:58,679
Mmm...

208
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,013
Ooh!

209
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,348
So you soak your kakiage
in your soup, huh?

210
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,385
Laura likes hers crispy,
so she'd definitely give
you hell over that.

211
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,589
Oh, this is called the
"soak the whole body
in the bath" method.

212
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,625
Well, that's definitely
a new one on me then.

213
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,594
I guess that's my bad.

214
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:16,563
Oh yeah, do you want to try
some of my chicken nanban?

215
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:17,931
Huh?

216
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:21,234
Hmm? It's fresh and hot,
and yummy in your tummy!

217
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,936
Uh...

218
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:27,541
Just give it a try,
come on. Say, "Aaah".

219
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,011
Uh? Aah...

220
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,447
Is that good or what?

221
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:37,183
Mm‐hm...

222
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,020
So, do you mind if I have a
little taste of your kakiage?

223
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,354
Uh...

224
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,089
No way!

225
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,525
Oh, sorry about that...

226
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,562
I had no idea that you
liked it so much.

227
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,565
Yeah, I'm kind of
greedy that way.

228
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:55,001
[Female Teacher]
Therefore, the most
important elements of combat

229
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:59,072
are largely comprised of three
factors: weight, speed and flow.

230
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,141
Furthermore, it's the
accumulation of...

231
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,209
[Kanzashi]
Not only did I
let him feed me,

232
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,179
but it was also
an indirect kiss!

233
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,416
(Gasp)

234
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,054
[Kanzashi]
Why am I having these thoughts?

235
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,858
What's happening to me?

236
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,562
[Ichika's voice]
If you don't know what you want,
you need to try something.

237
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,731
So would you like to
be my partner?

238
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,701
No. I mean...
I... maybe...

239
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,135
I just don't know.

240
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,104
I'm sorry,
but I'm not sure.

241
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,339
But if you don't try,

242
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,642
then you'll never
know, will you?

243
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,111
It's just that
I'm scared.

244
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,648
There's no need to
be afraid...

245
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,584
Just leave it to me.

246
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:44,350
(Gasp)

247
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,752
Come on.

248
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,354
Just give it a shot, teammate.

249
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,996
Ah!

250
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,664
Oh, yeah!

251
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,465
That was a yes, right?

252
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,034
Well, um... I...

253
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,303
All right!
We'd better hurry
to the faculty room.

254
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,039
We have to go register
our partnership!

255
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,813
So how much of your unit
has been completed?

256
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,681
Well, the weapons
aren't online.

257
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,751
But the operational data
isn't available yet either,

258
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,253
so it still can't be
used in actual combat.

259
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,722
Ah, I see.

260
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:23,356
So, what kind
of weapons?

261
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,291
She's got high‐yield
guided missiles

262
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,460
controlled by a
multi lock‐on system.

263
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:30,764
And a charged particle cannon,
but it's not finished.

264
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,699
A charged
particle cannon?!

265
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,536
Then we should be able
to use Byakushiki's
data for that.

266
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:40,473
Let's see now,
since this one is for
Yukihira Nigata...

267
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:42,408
Oh! There it is!

268
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,477
We can pull up all the
operational data later,

269
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,312
but for the time being,
we should go ahead

270
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,616
and get started with
whatever we can do right now.

271
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,987
Uh‐huh...

272
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,622
Uh, thank you
for everything.

273
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,290
Don't worry about it...

274
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,660
Why don't we go hop in
the shower together?

275
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,094
What? No!

276
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,596
Come on, silly.

277
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,198
Don't be like that.
I mean, where's the harm?

278
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:09,069
[Houki] Please stop pulling me!
I can walk by myself!
[Tatenashi] Come on!
Shower time! Woo‐hoo!

279
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,605
Oh...

280
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,711
[Houki]
She... she used to pull
my hand just like this...

281
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,479
before...

282
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,615
But then...

283
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,017
I hurt her.

284
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:32,158
[Tatenashi]
Ahh! This feels so good,
don't you think, Houki?

285
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:35,095
So, whatcha thinkin' about?

286
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,565
Huh? I was thinking...

287
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,266
about my sister....

288
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,503
I guess you've been trying to
keep your distance, huh?

289
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:45,706
From your big sister,
I mean, from Doctor Tabane?

290
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,774
Uh...

291
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,010
No, it's not that I
dislike her...

292
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,246
And I'm grateful she
gave me a personal IS, but...

293
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,316
I see. That's really
good to know...

294
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:00,053
After all, it's best to
get along with your family.

295
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,323
Not that I have room to talk...

296
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:06,292
[Houki]
The thing is...

297
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,796
I never can never figure out
what she's thinking.

298
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:14,400
And your scared
because you don't know?

299
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,802
Mm‐hm...

300
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,871
Yeah, I get it.

301
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,372
I feel the exact same way.

302
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,707
Hm?

303
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,943
I wouldn't worry
about it though.

304
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,945
From what I can tell...

305
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:29,716
your sister must still
care about you a lot.

306
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:33,219
Hey, let's ask the
maintenance department
staff to help us tomorrow.

307
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,989
We don't have very much time
left until the match.

308
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,525
So, safety first, right?

309
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,596
Uh‐huh. I guess we can
do that tomorrow.

310
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,464
Uh...

311
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,299
(Laugh)

312
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,670
So, Miss Kanzashi,
shall we go?

313
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,805
Uh...

314
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,307
Hmm? Are you okay?

315
00:17:57,177 --> 00:18:01,381
You don't have to call me
"Miss"... anymore, okay?

316
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,717
So I...?

317
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,218
You...

318
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,853
can call me "Kanzashi"!

319
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,488
Uh...

320
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,226
Oh...

321
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,530
(Panting)

322
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,564
I...

323
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,099
I really said that...

324
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,736
But I...
I was acting so strange...

325
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,039
Could it be...

326
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,842
that I actully like...

327
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,276
Ichika?

328
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,413
What on Earth
is happening to me?

329
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,419
Good morning!

330
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,822
(Giggle)
Tech Service here.

331
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:45,491
[Ichika]
We appreciate your help.
Thank you, very much!

332
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,761
Now you're gonna

333
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:48,962
[Ichika]
What?!

334
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:50,496
Howdy, Kan‐chan!

335
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,699
Sorry about the last
minute request, Honne.

336
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,234
Aw, don't sweat it.

337
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,269
Just call out our names
and we'll be there for ya.

338
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,338
Cause that how we tech nerds
roll, don't ya know.

339
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,807
Well, thanks anyway!
(chuckle)

340
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:04,711
All right. Since we
don't have a lot of time,
let's get right to it.

341
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,612
[Girls]
Mm‐hm.

342
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,413
Hey, Orimura!

343
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,716
Bring me the extra large wrench
with the high‐frequency cutter.

344
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:10,817
Okay!

345
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,052
Bring me the data scanner

346
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,954
and the ultrasonic wave
tester, please!

347
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:15,522
(Panting)
Coming!

348
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,391
‐ Orimura! Bring some drinks!
‐ Yes!

349
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,794
‐ Orimu, snacks, stat!
‐ Here you go!

350
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,496
Would you go to the school shop
and buy me some shampoo?

351
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:26,900
[Ichika]
Huh? What does that have
to do with anything?!

352
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,537
That does it.

353
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,807
I guess this oughta do.

354
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,609
Yay!

355
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,845
[Kanzashi]
Um, I just want to say
thank you to all of you.

356
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:42,516
I couldn't have done it alone,
so all I can say is...

357
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:43,483
I really...

358
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,351
really owe you all so much!

359
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,320
[Kaoruko]
(Giggle)
Don't mention it.

360
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,625
We're your classmates
after all, aren't we?

361
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,695
[Kaoruko]
Well, everyone. I think
it's time we call it a day.

362
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,096
Let's get outta here!

363
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,300
[Nohohon]
Our work is done.
You've got clean detail, Orimu.

364
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,436
I guess we did it, huh?

365
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:06,673
Yeah, we did.
Thanks to everyone.

366
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:10,110
So we better give
the match our all, okay?

367
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,245
(Giggle)

368
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,581
(Sigh)

369
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,085
Huh?

370
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,353
Chow, big boy!

371
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,922
You snuck in again?

372
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:24,424
Ohh... I want a
massage, Ichika!

373
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:27,393
Rub me all over
and over, pleeease!

374
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,729
[Ichika]
Sigh...

375
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,531
[Tatenashi]
So, the thing is,

376
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,633
I've noticed that you're
close to your sister.

377
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,668
Where did that come
from all of a sudden?

378
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:37,571
Well, I've just noticed
that Miss Orimura

379
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,806
seems to always be
especially strict with you.

380
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,475
And you think that defines
a "close relationship"?

381
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:47,447
Jeez, you really don't
understand what she's
doing at all, do you?

382
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,552
She's so strict because
she cares about you.

383
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:54,120
You're special to her, Ichika.

384
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,857
So she doesn't
want you to die.

385
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,362
[Tatenashi]
You know, like if a war
breaks out or something.

386
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,497
Now, Ichika,
rub my butt!

387
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,366
[Ichika]
Huh?! What did you say?!

388
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,770
(Giggle)
I just wanted to see
the look on your face!

389
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,470
(Ichika sighs)

390
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:13,273
(Kanzashi giggles)

391
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,310
(Giggle)
I wonder if...

392
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,980
Orimura is going to
like these...

393
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:22,282
Ah!

394
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,885
[Ichika]
Jeez, come on.
Gimme a break already!

395
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:27,320
[Tatenashi]
Hey, it's okay,
just relax!

396
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,823
By the way, how'd it go with
Kanzashi's unit today?

397
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:30,757
Is it done?

398
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,458
Uh...

399
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,794
Don't assume the worst.

400
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:35,061
Maybe he's...

401
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,763
[Ichika]
Well, it's coming together.

402
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:40,701
[Tatenashi]
(Giggle) I bet my unit's
data came in handy, right?

403
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,335
(Gasp)

404
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,071
This was... all her?

405
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,378
No!

406
00:21:58,018 --> 00:22:01,354
(Crying)

407
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:18,404
(Sobbing)

408
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:53,033
[Nohohon]
Hee‐hee! Hello, Nohohon here!

409
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:55,736
For today's project,
I'm going to be constructing

410
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:59,740
my own personal IS unit using
some paper and cardboard.

411
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,743
Hmm... Why don't I
give it a name first?

412
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:06,613
Ah! The offical name of
my personal IS unit

413
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:10,751
is going to be
"The Fox's Wedding"!

414
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:13,587
Hey, that's Miss Orimura!
Yoohoo!

415
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:16,489
[Chifuyu]
Next time on Infinite Stratos 2,

416
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,560
"The Requirements for a Hero".
