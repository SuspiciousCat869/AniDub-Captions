1
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:05,333
Hm...

2
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:08,566
Tatenashi:
Ichika!

3
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:12,266
Hm?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,433
Ichika:
Hm?!

5
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:17,366
(giggles)

6
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:20,066
No way! AHHH!

7
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:25,066
Tatenashi:
Hey, Ichika...
is something wrong?

8
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,133
What do you mean
"is something wrong"...?!

9
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:30,400
You're what's wrong! Put some
clothes on for God's sake!

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,400
But... I did.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,533
Uh! Pants! I was
thinking about pants!

12
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,766
It's stuck!

13
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:43,166
(power struggle)

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Fine...!

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,966
Give it up!

16
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:48,133
I want to have one
of your massages...

17
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:51,166
Tatenashi:
Everyone says
you're so good at them!

18
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:54,833
It's so I can be relaxed for
tomorrow's school festival.

19
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,566
Come on... pretty please?

20
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:01,266
Ichika:
As a guy, it's NOT a good idea
for me to massage THAT body.

21
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,066
It's a terrible idea!

22
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,533
If you continue
to resist me,

23
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:07,133
I'm going to have
to do this by force.

24
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:10,666
I won't let you do that!

25
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:11,733
All right then...

26
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,433
If you won't open it,
then I'll just rip the door

27
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,900
off its hinges!

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Aaah!

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,066
GAAAHHH!

30
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,600
Get‐them‐off!

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,500
(giggles)
Now... massage me!
Massage me!

32
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:37,600
Fine... if
you insist.

33
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,461
Bienvenue!

34
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,040
This way,
please... Milady

35
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,265
I don't believe it!

36
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:26,931
Orimura's actually going to
wait on us personally!

37
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:29,065
And he's even dressed
like a butler!

38
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,265
And you get to take
pictures with him, too!

39
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:34,198
Just the two of you!
Can you believe it?!

40
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,731
Hey, you butler over there!

41
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:38,165
Aren't you going to
take me to my table?

42
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:38,731
Huh?

43
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:41,431
Rin? When did
YOU get here?

44
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:42,998
Mmph! Never you mind!

45
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,331
It so happens that Class Two
is doing a Chinese café.

46
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:47,731
Ichika:
Hm?

47
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:52,065
Hang on... is that the way
you usually wear your hair?

48
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,965
Oh... this...?
Yeah. I put it up.

49
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:57,731
That's what
it is!

50
00:03:57,831 --> 00:03:59,865
I knew there was
something different!

51
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:02,731
Ah... but
the thing is...

52
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:04,831
it's not all
that different.

53
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:08,031
I do this way
all the time...

54
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:11,265
Uh! Just take me
to my table already!

55
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:13,965
Of course...
if you'll follow me,

56
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:15,531
(gentlemanly)
this way, Madame.

57
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,898
(gasps)
What'd you call me?

58
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:24,031
(gentlemanly)
I'll take your order
whenever you're ready.

59
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,965
Hm... Let's see...

60
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:29,898
Oh!

61
00:04:29,998 --> 00:04:31,698
Would you please
tell me about this

62
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:33,631
"Treat Your
Butler" Special?

63
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,431
Well Madam,

64
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:36,898
I think it would actually
be much better if you tried

65
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:39,531
our famous cake
special instead.

66
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:42,798
Hey, you were trying to trick me
just now, weren't you?

67
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,431
Hmph. Certainly not.

68
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:48,198
Well, in that case, I'd like
you to bring me one of these

69
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:50,231
"Treat Your Butler" Specials.

70
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,998
Your "Treat Your Butler"
Special... Madame.

71
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,298
Um, so...

72
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:00,998
I don't get it.

73
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:04,998
Why did you come sit down
at the table with me?

74
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:09,065
Uh, well, I suppose I don't
actually mind you being here.

75
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:14,798
But what kind of
"special" is this anyway?

76
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,598
You get to feed me now.

77
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:18,865
What?

78
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,331
Like I said...

79
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:23,765
you get to feed your butler.
That's what the "special" is.

80
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,198
And what kind of
stupid special is that...?

81
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:28,898
You mean the customer is
supposed to feed YOU sweets?

82
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:31,231
That's why I didn't
want you to pick it...

83
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,898
But you don't have to go through
with it if you don't want to.

84
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:36,965
That's really dumb...

85
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:39,665
But since you already
brought it out here...

86
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:41,765
I might as well...

87
00:05:41,865 --> 00:05:43,531
Hmm...

88
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:47,698
Wait! You mean that I get
to feed you something?!

89
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:49,698
Okay then!

90
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:52,331
Now, say "aah...!"

91
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:54,198
Aaah...

92
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:02,331
I fed something sweet to you,
so now... it's your turn t‐

93
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:03,231
Gah!

94
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:03,798
I'm so sorry...

95
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:07,731
But I'm afraid that
service is not part
of our special, Madam.

96
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:09,298
Hmph!

97
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:10,531
Mmm...

98
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:18,298
(sighs)
Rin...

99
00:06:18,398 --> 00:06:18,498
Hm?

100
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:21,231
Nothing... It's just
that you're kind of cute.

101
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:22,265
(choking)

102
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:24,998
Hey, do you need
a Heimlich or something?

103
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,298
What in the heck
is your problem today?!

104
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:34,398
I was... just talking
about the way you eat.

105
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:37,065
You think... that
the way I eat is "cute"?

106
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:41,198
Yeah... Just like
a squirrel.

107
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:44,965
WAAAUGHH!! ,/
Hmph!

108
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:50,631
What's HER deal?

109
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:53,365
Huh?

110
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:56,198
Do you have a minute?

111
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:57,931
Sure...

112
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:04,065
Okay... So you're
Reiko... Makigami?

113
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:07,865
Yes... I'm so excited to be
meeting with you today...

114
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,965
we'd like to interest
you in equipping your IS

115
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:11,531
with our
company's products.

116
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:15,065
Well, I'm not totally sure when
it comes to things like that...

117
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,831
Come on. Don't
be like that.

118
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,865
Just have a look at
our supplemental armor

119
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:22,298
or these secondary
thrusters.

120
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,765
And if you act right now,
we're even going to throw in

121
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:26,765
leg blades as well.

122
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:29,131
Uh... but I really
don't need any...

123
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:32,331
Excuse me, ma'am,
I'm sorry to interrupt...

124
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,498
but the next customer
is waiting for him.

125
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,898
(scoffs)

126
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:41,465
Ichika:
Uh... please excuse me.
I have to go now.

127
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,998
(sighs)

128
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,898
You're a real lifesaver...
Thanks, Takatsuki..

129
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:53,965
A lot of people have
been trying to recommend

130
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:55,131
different equipment
for the Byakushiki lately. ,/
Don't worry
about it...

131
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:57,798
I guess you have a
lot on your plate.

132
00:07:57,898 --> 00:07:59,198
Mm...

133
00:07:59,298 --> 00:08:02,065
you can go ahead and take
a break now, if you like.

134
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,631
Why don't you go look at the
other class projects?

135
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,065
Huh? Now?

136
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:10,265
Sure! I guess you can have
about thirty minutes, alright?

137
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,131
Well, okay then, if you
think it'd be all right.

138
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:17,131
Oh, it's perfectly alright...
I'll gladly accompany you.

139
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,265
Oh! That's not fair, Cecilia!

140
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,365
No kidding! In that case,
I'm going, too!

141
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:23,998
Right! Let's go, Ichika.

142
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:25,198
Wait just a minute!

143
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:28,565
You know you can't all go
and leave the café unattended!

144
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:30,731
Rock‐paper‐scissors
for it.

145
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:31,365
One!

146
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:31,698
Two!

147
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:32,465
Trois!

148
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:33,465
Do it!

149
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:38,665
Oh‐ho‐ho‐ho‐ho!

150
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,031
(French horn blares)

151
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:43,131
Whoa! I totally
blew it!

152
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,198
Oh, no, you're a
natural with those lips.

153
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:48,298
But our club offers
private tutoring.

154
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:50,898
No, I don't think
it's for me...

155
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,198
But maybe Cecilia
would like to.

156
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:54,398
Do you think
I could...?

157
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:57,965
I've never played any sort
of wind instrument before.

158
00:08:58,065 --> 00:08:58,765
Seriously...?

159
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:01,998
I'd have thought you'd
already play the flute
or something like that...

160
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:07,998
because you're a well‐bred
and elegant, ya know?

161
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,298
Well‐bred and elegant? ,/
Oh‐ho‐ho‐ho!

162
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:12,898
Come on. Give it
a blow, it's easy!

163
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:14,198
But...

164
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:17,231
that's the same one
that you just...

165
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:18,331
Huh?

166
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:22,398
It would be an
indirect... kiss

167
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:25,065
Huh? What'd you say?

168
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:29,498
Oh, it's nothing really...
Please don't worry about it.

169
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:36,998
At... long last...
here I go.

170
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:41,865
Music Club Captain:
Wait a second.

171
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:44,165
Let me change the
mouthpiece first.

172
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:45,498
Uh!

173
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:50,231
(sobbing)

174
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:55,931
Look at the time, I'd better
get back to work, now.

175
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,665
Ta‐da!

176
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,965
Aaack! Uh...
Tatenashi?!

177
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:04,698
(giggles)

178
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:05,665
Hello, Ichika...

179
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:08,198
I'm here because we have decided
that you will help us out

180
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:10,631
with the student council's
interactive play.

181
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:11,831
Huh?

182
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:14,498
Just come with me...
it's right this way.

183
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:14,831
Huh?

184
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:15,998
Tatenashi:
Don't struggle!

185
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,398
What a good boy!

186
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:20,498
Hold on, wait!

187
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:24,565
Tatenashi:
Here. Go change into this
and then come to the stage.

188
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,031
Huh?

189
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:29,965
And don't forget this...
it's vital.

190
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:32,465
Consider yourself...
crowned!

191
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,698
Yeah, but...

192
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:35,098
What am I supposed
to do?

193
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:36,598
I've never even
seen the script...

194
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:38,398
Don't you worry about that...

195
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:40,698
Basically, the dialogue
is all ad‐libbed...

196
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:43,331
and we'll give you any
directions that you'll need.

197
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:46,265
You can take it from there,
can't you Ichika? Okay?

198
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:48,298
(giggling)

199
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,031
Uh‐huh...

200
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:58,532
Tatenashi:
Now, let us begin!

201
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,432
Once upon a time...

202
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:09,799
in a faraway land...

203
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,899
there lived a young girl
who was called Cinderella.

204
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:19,032
Now, however... Cinderella
is no longer just a name.

205
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:20,732
Huh?

206
00:11:20,832 --> 00:11:24,299
Tatenashi:
Now the name stands for...
delighting in defeating

207
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,832
countless swarms
of enemy soldiers!

208
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:29,566
In myriad ballrooms
throughout the land.

209
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,266
The world's most
powerful warriors...

210
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:35,099
those with an appetite
for total destruction.

211
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:40,399
And the title that is most
befitting for those brave
lady warriors is...

212
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,832
"Strike Force Cinderella"!

213
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:43,366
Uh, what?!

214
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:47,299
Tatenashi:
Now, watch these young ladies
dance as they all vye

215
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,132
for the military secrets
that are hidden

216
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:51,899
within the prince's crown!

217
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,499
(cheers and applause)

218
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:56,866
Uh... huh?

219
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:00,066
Tatenashi:
And now, once again...

220
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,066
the night of the
blood‐thirsty Cinderellas...

221
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,866
is about to begin.

222
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:06,566
That crown is MINE!

223
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:10,566
(stumbling, groaning)

224
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,666
Just hand over that crown,
and no one will get hurt!

225
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:18,766
Ah!

226
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:19,932
(whimpers) Gah!

227
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,466
What would you do if you
really killed me?!

228
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:23,432
Tatenashi:
Don't worry.

229
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:26,732
They're all made
from safe materials.

230
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,432
I doubt that!

231
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,466
Rinin:
Hyaaah!

232
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:36,766
Ichika:
(cowers)

233
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,866
Hey, I can see
your underwear...!

234
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:42,532
AHH!

235
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,499
Are you out of your
freaking mind?!

236
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,399
You're wearing
glass slippers!

237
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:48,332
Don't worry...

238
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:50,899
they're made of
tempered glass.

239
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:54,666
Hey! This is dangerous!

240
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:58,199
Hey, wait!
Come back here!

241
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:00,432
Hey, that was a sniper rifle...

242
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:03,099
Has Cecilia gone crazy too?!

243
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,666
Stupid question!

244
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:11,732
Man... what the heck
is up with this play?!

245
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:15,366
Dash, got away...

246
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:18,666
I've been thinking about
who should have the right

247
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,166
to be roommates
with Ichika,

248
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,299
and I've decided...

249
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,232
I'm going to award
that to the person

250
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:25,132
who captures
the prince's crown.

251
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:27,399
Huh?

252
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:30,432
But I do not think
you can do that...

253
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:33,032
(chuckles) Don't worry...
with my authority

254
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:36,466
as the student council
president, I'll make it happen.

255
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:40,099
I swear that I will
win this challenge

256
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,032
no matter
what the cost!

257
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:48,699
Cecilia:
Ha! There you are...

258
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:52,699
I have you now!

259
00:13:58,632 --> 00:14:01,332
Ichika, this way,
over here!

260
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:04,732
Oh, it's you... Hup!

261
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,799
Thanks, Charl...!
You really saved me!

262
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:16,166
I'm sure they are
right behind you...

263
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,532
so run like the wind!

264
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:18,632
Right. Thank you!

265
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,299
Oh, one moment please!

266
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,799
Charl:
Don't go yet!

267
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,132
But you said run!

268
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,066
Well, um...

269
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,732
it would really mean a lot
if you could leave the crown

270
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,066
here with me before you go.

271
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,666
Oh, yeah...
sure, no problem.

272
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:34,666
Tatenashi:
For the prince,
his country means everything.

273
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:37,366
So he can never lose
his crown, as it contains

274
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:39,099
confidential information...

275
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,266
For real...?

276
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:42,199
WAAAAAHH!

277
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,999
Tatenashi:
His sense of remorse triggers
a powerful electric shock!

278
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:48,532
Ichika?
Tatenashi:
Oh, bless his heart!

279
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:50,132
It's a tragic situation,

280
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:54,099
and the prince's love for his
country must truly be great.

281
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,266
It's agonizing!

282
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,332
But all we can do now
is watch over him!

283
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:59,832
Oh, my! It's a
tragic situation!

284
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,599
It's not necessary
for you to repeat that!

285
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,466
I'm sorry, Charl. But you
heard the crazy narrator,

286
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:07,132
I can't give
you the crown!

287
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:07,766
Huh?!

288
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,099
That is SO
not good!

289
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,632
Cecilia:
Hold it right there!

290
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:13,399
You've gone far enough!

291
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:14,932
Yeah, surrender now!

292
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:16,399
Watch out!

293
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,099
Oh...

294
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:20,166
Oh...

295
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,732
AAAAAHH!

296
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:29,932
You get away from HIM!

297
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,432
Ichika? Ichika,
where are you?

298
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:50,099
Ichika:
It's dark... I can't breathe...

299
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,432
I don't know where I am.

300
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,099
Did I die just now?

301
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,666
Ahh!

302
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:07,932
What is this? It's so soft.

303
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,666
A‐ahh...!

304
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,766
Ahh!

305
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:15,999
Ichika! What were you doing,
down under there?!

306
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:20,099
Ugh...
well... uh...

307
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,832
Oh, that's right!
I'd better run!

308
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:25,966
Sacre bleu...!

309
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,432
Ichika, come back!

310
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:39,066
I wonder if this
is far enough...

311
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,999
Huh?

312
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:45,066
No!

313
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,999
I've waited for you.

314
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,032
And now your crown
is going to be mine...

315
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,332
Hyaah!

316
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:55,932
Ichika:
Hey! Watch‐
Gahh! Calm down!

317
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:59,099
Hey! Be careful!
Jeez!

318
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:03,466
You are my bride,
so give it up already!

319
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:07,699
But ya know...
love's no fun without obstacles.

320
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,532
Laura!

321
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,799
This looks bad!

322
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:22,566
C'mon, Laura! Let's go!

323
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,666
Ichika:
HOLY CRAP!

324
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:30,532
Ichika...

325
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,366
Bye!

326
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:43,132
Wait...

327
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:51,866
(whispers)
Hey! Ichika!

328
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:53,599
Ichika, this way!

329
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,532
Ah! Houki, am I glad
to see you!

330
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,141
Up here. You'll be
safe at the top.

331
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:06,574
Huh? Oh great...
we're climbing.

332
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,774
Ah! Ichika, you better
not be looking up!

333
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:16,941
Huh?

334
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,141
Look at what?

335
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:20,241
YOU KNOW WHAT!

336
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:21,441
Stop looking!

337
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,974
Hey, cut it out! You're supposed
to be rescuing me! Ack!

338
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,774
Both:
(panting)

339
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:34,474
Ichika:
How could I ever
thank you...?

340
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:38,141
Ahem...

341
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:42,841
Well... why don't you go ahead
and hand that crown over to me.

342
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:44,608
What?

343
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:48,074
Sorry, dear... It's not
going to be that easy.

344
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:51,608
Both:
Huh?

345
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:58,874
Ahhh!

346
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,741
Let's get outta here!

347
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,441
Uh‐huh! Ahhh!

348
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:09,808
Oh, man...! This is just
getting ridiculous!

349
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:10,974
Uh‐huh!

350
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:12,774
In the side pocket!

351
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:19,374
Whew, that was
a close one...

352
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:22,308
Yeah, but would you please
remove your hand now?

353
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:26,708
Huh? Oh! Sorry
about that.

354
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:31,908
(sighs) What I don't get
is why everyone wants
this stupid thing...

355
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:37,674
W‐well, that's because...
because... um...

356
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:41,441
Laura:
There you are!
That crown will be mine!

357
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,274
In your dreams!

358
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:46,474
What do you think
you are doing?

359
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:48,441
Eliminating
interlopers!

360
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,408
That's my line!

361
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:55,608
Hey, come on, you two!
Isn't anyone else tired of this?

362
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,908
Not yet!

363
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:04,341
I have ways of making you back
off, you bride‐stealer!

364
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:06,508
You just go ahead
and try it!

365
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,674
Uh, excuse me...

366
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:11,008
Hyaaaaaahh!

367
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:12,641
Hyaaaaaahh!

368
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:18,008
(surprised and startled moaning)

369
00:20:20,508 --> 00:20:23,608
You... LOOK
AT THEM!

370
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,241
HYAAAAAAA!

371
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:29,908
I will not let you
touch my bride!

372
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:38,708
All:
(whimpering)

373
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:47,974
And now, it's time for
the audience participants
to join the story!

374
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:52,508
Tatenashi:
Come on, girls,
do your best trying to
capture the prince's crown!

375
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:56,608
Get through to me,
sweet, Orimura!

376
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:00,174
Let's make it happily ever after
with me, my prince!

377
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:02,608
Hey! Give me that crown!

378
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:05,041
AHHHH!

379
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:08,574
Wait, Orimu! Come back!

380
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:13,508
Gwha?! GAAAAAAHHH!

381
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:19,908
Reiko:
Shh... they won't
find you in here.

382
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,474
Thank you very much.

383
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,474
Hey, wait. Aren't you that
Miss Makigami I met earlier?

384
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:31,541
Yeah... I thought I should
use this opportunity

385
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:33,941
to take your
Byakushiki from you.

386
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:36,508
Huh?

387
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:40,974
I'm saying...
just give it to me already!

388
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:43,641
GAH! Ugh...

389
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:49,174
(coughing)

390
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,774
(strained)
So, who are
you, really?

391
00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:54,641
Who am I... you ask?

392
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:58,041
A mysterious beauty,
disguised as...

393
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:00,841
a corporate
businesswoman!

394
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:05,008
Gosh... aren't you lucky?

395
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,008
Byakushiki!

396
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:15,574
I've been waiting so long...
for you to summon that!

397
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:52,608
Cecilia:
Good day to all of you!

398
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:56,141
This is the United Kingdom's
representitive, Cecilia Alcott.

399
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:58,808
And I'm announcing an initiative
that will make all of your

400
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:01,541
dreary lives just
a little bit better!

401
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:05,141
And all you have to do is cast
your ballot for Cecilia Alcott

402
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:07,308
as the IS Academy's
top candidate!

403
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:11,274
That's Cecilia Alcott!
Now, don't forget!

404
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:13,008
What?! Miss Orimura?!

405
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:18,041
Chifuyu:
Next time on Infinite Stratos 2,
"The Mysterious Lady"!
