1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:10,677
(Girls fuming)

2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,412
Uh...

3
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:14,748
Well?!

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,116
Ehhh...

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,019
There, there, Rin,
please calm down.

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,487
Look... You are
scaring Kanzashi.

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,957
[Laura] Halt, Charlotte.
Stop this now.
(Kanzashi whimpers)

8
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:28,161
Under normal circumstances I
would torture her or administer
a truth serum...

9
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,264
but I am suppressing
that urge for the moment.

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,466
Do not say such things, Laura.

11
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:37,971
[Charl]
Here. This is for you,
Kanzashi. You are probably
thirsty, no?

12
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,708
Huh...? Oh! Thanks so much!

13
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,313
Now tell us...
what is going on, hm?

14
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:48,248
(gasp)

15
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,250
[Houki]
Yeah! Spill!

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,286
What we want to get to the
bottom of here is whether
you and Ichika are‐

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,022
Whether the two of you
are actually dating?!

18
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,291
(gasp)

19
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,529
Uh, it isn't like that...
with me and Ichika...

20
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,630
(growling)

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,831
You said "Ichika"!

22
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,867
You're on a first‐name
basis, too?!

23
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,169
[Kanzashi]
It's kinda hard to explain...

24
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,005
it's not that I don't hope that
something happens...

25
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:16,076
but so far, in real
life we're not like that...

26
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,115
(Rinin, Houki, Laura,
Charl & Cecilia sigh, laugh)

27
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,722
It looks like we read rather
too much into it, didn't we?

28
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:33,093
[Houki]
Yeah, sorry about the Spanish
Inquisition, Sarashiki.

29
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,396
Uhm, You... can call me
Kanzashi... if you like?

30
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:40,033
Cool! Then you can call us
by our first names, too.

31
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,602
Mm, okay.

32
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,804
And since we all happen to be in
the same grade,

33
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:47,207
why do we not get together
after school for the
practical training?

34
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:51,845
[Kanzashi]
Mm... hm...! Sounds like fun!

35
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,343
(nervous)

36
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,314
[Yamada]
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Orimura.

37
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:39,753
Everyone should be down
here soon... And here's
your special measuring tape.

38
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,423
A measuring tape?

39
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,992
So what exactly am I
supposed to do with it?

40
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,327
Really..?

41
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,596
That's for taking
body measurements.

42
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,065
In the wake of attacks by
unmanned units,

43
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:56,970
we realized we must improve
our IS suits, and precise body
measurements will be vital.

44
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,471
I understand that..!

45
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,206
The issue I'm
asking about is why

46
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,275
I'm the one who has to
take the measurements?!

47
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,111
Well, I had my doubts about
this idea at first, too...

48
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,414
but the student council
had already voted it through,
so here we are...

49
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,750
(stammering) HUH?!

50
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,019
(sinister laughter)

51
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,623
What the heck could
this ridiculous school
be thinking?!

52
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,826
[Chifuyu]
What are you gibbering
on about now, you bonehead?

53
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,694
Huh?

54
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,062
Big Sister Chifuyu!

55
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,263
Waaahhh!!

56
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,465
That's Miss
Orimura, here.
Ow...

57
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,501
I don't know why you can't
just follow through

58
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,402
with your assigned duties
like you're supposed to.

59
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,005
[Ichika]
Come on! This is clearly
not a regular duty!

60
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,740
I was set up!

61
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,844
Do you have to be such a
martyr about everything...

62
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,948
Besides, I may have just
the solution for you.

63
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,252
Whoa...! A blindfold!

64
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,722
My work is done.

65
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,024
[Ichika, thinking]
Thank you, Big Sister Chifuyu!

66
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,427
Thank you, Miss Orimura!

67
00:04:54,528 --> 00:05:00,066
(gasp) It's see‐through...!
Noooo! Grrr...

68
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,905
Hey, look it's Orimura.

69
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,041
Oooo, is he really the one who's
taking our measurements?

70
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,243
[Nohohon] Yoohoo, Orimu!

71
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,513
Now... Everyone
please quiet down...

72
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:16,717
If each of you will strip down
to your unmentionables, we'll
start the measuring, okay?

73
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,218
Uwahhhh!

74
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,687
I'll be in the back area
recording the numbers that
you call out,

75
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,656
so whip out that measuring
tape and get started.

76
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:26,993
Uh... Hey, Miss Yamada,
wait... No, no, no! Come back!

77
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:31,464
Number one, Kiyoka Aikawa.
Ready or not, here I come!

78
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,800
Wh‐whoa! Wait just
a minute, I‐I...!

79
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,436
[Aikawa] Tee‐hee!
It's already too late!
Measure me, measure me!

80
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,439
UUUWWWAAAHH!

81
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,441
[Ichika, thinking]
What to do, what to do?

82
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,610
I'll do it without looking!

83
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,413
I'll use my mind's eye,
my third eye!

84
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,316
Excuse me, Orimura...

85
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,652
[Ichika] All right!
[Aikawa] Oh!

86
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,755
Now...! First... I'll
put the tape around...

87
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,422
so just hold
your arms out.

88
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,592
Ohhh‐kay!
(giggling quietly)

89
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,329
Let's see... around here?

90
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,498
[Aikawa] Oh!
(Ichika gasps)

91
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,167
[Aikawa] Uh! (reactions)

92
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,804
[Ichika, thinking]
That was not what I
thought it was... Uh...

93
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,807
[Aikawa]
Orimura! Hey! What do
you think you're doing?!
(embarrassing moans)

94
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:18,679
[Ichika]
I have no idea! I just want to
loop the measuring tape around
your back! I can't!

95
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,748
[Aikawa]
You're way off target! Aah!

96
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:26,987
[Ichika]
Then what is this? It feels
kind of soft and squishy. And
that's so not good.

97
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:31,357
[Aikawa] Hey, Orimura! Would you
please stop doing that!
[Ichika, thinking] Think about
flowers and summer...

98
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,393
[Ichika] Huh?!
[Aikawa] Ahhh!

99
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,162
Ichikaaaaaa!!! You're DEAD!!

100
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,064
What on earth are
you doing to her?!

101
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,766
Non! I cannot believe it!

102
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,503
So. Do you have any
last words, Ichika?

103
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,270
(advancing cries)

104
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,673
No, I was just doing
what they told me...

105
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,110
[Ichika] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGHHH!!!

106
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,748
[Cecilia]
I'm shocked.

107
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,418
My lovely waist has increased
by five millimeters. (sad)

108
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:03,423
Yeah well, I've put on some
weight, too, but... my chest
size stayed the same...

109
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:09,830
(angry) Distortion of body means
distortion of mind.. I must
increase my training time!

110
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,067
Man, girls sure do worry about
crazy things, huh? Chomp!

111
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,136
(eating) And I can't tell
any of that by looking at you.

112
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:20,273
Oh! How could you be so
insensitive toward us,
Ichika...?

113
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,575
By the way...

114
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,176
What is that you're
having for lunch today?

115
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,811
You seem to
be enjoying it.

116
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,881
Ulp! Ah, the bento Houki
gave me this morning.

117
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,082
(gasp)

118
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,216
(seething)

119
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,852
That was very
sneaky of you.

120
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,521
Sneaky and completely
unexpected.

121
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,290
I.. just happened
to make too much...

122
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,962
And her mistake is my pleasure,
because Houki's chicken breasts
are incredible. Chomp!

123
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:46,299
Oh..! Do you really
think so? (giggle)

124
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,168
(seething)

125
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,738
Of course, when it comes to
pork, Rin is just awesome.

126
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,374
(defeated)

127
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,643
And Charl's Pot‐au‐feu
is oh la la.

128
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,245
Everybody here is
a wonderful cook.

129
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,750
Uh... Ichika... what
about my cooking?

130
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,654
(gasp) Oh! Cecilia,
you're, uh...

131
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:11,558
[Rinin] Hey! I think it's about
time for her to hear the truth,
so you've got to tell her.

132
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,360
Cecilia's cooking is
like chemical warfare!

133
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,597
What? There's no way
I could say that!

134
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,532
But it would be for the
good of all mankind!

135
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:22,268
Hey...! I demand to know
what you two are whispering
about over there...

136
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,338
Ichika, I asked you
what you thought about
my cooking, now answer!

137
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:30,276
Bonjour! I am sorry
to be late...! And
Kanzashi is here, too.

138
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,012
Um, hello everyone.

139
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,582
[Ichika]
Hey, Kanzashi! Haha.
Come sit next to me.

140
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,151
(Cecilia whimpering)

141
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:43,757
Let me thank you in advance..!
I will sincerely appreciate it!

142
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,459
Ce‐cilia?!

143
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,429
I've decided that, in
order to improve my own
culinary abilities,

144
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,534
I want to learn more about
the cuisine from everyone
else's home countries.

145
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:58,639
Furthermore, since your
bento boxes are always fantastic
to look at and to eat..

146
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,874
I'd love for you to
teach me how to cook.

147
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,911
Uh... I see... It certainly
makes me feel good to
hear that...

148
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,648
So I'd be glad to
help if you insist.

149
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,616
Thank you so very much...!

150
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,752
All right, the first think
I'd like you to teach me

151
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,220
is how to prepare fried chicken!
(squawking)

152
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,056
Uh...?

153
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,924
What is.. that for?

154
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,894
[Cecilia]
That is a premier grade
Bresse capon chicken.

155
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,463
I assure you I had the
best one sent to me.

156
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:29,803
Actually, I have chicken in
the fridge... so you can take
that home, okay.

157
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,005
[Cecilia]
Oh, is that so? That's too bad.

158
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:36,242
But, I guess there's always
Christmas pie... isn't there?

159
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,678
(squawk)

160
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,113
Okay, let's get
started then.

161
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:44,384
[Houki]
But first, let's cut the chicken
thigh into bite‐size pieces.

162
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:48,088
Then, add some salt and
let it sit for a while.
[Cecilia] Mm‐hm...

163
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,625
[Houki]
Next, we'll prepare the garlic
and ginger that we'll be drop
in, okay?

164
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,760
[Cecilia] Okay!

165
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,261
[Houki] Not literally.
[Cecilia] Huh?

166
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,297
Nevermind, just
warm up the oil.

167
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,765
Okay...! Ahh...

168
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,834
Not like that!

169
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,005
[Houki]
Now it's time to remove
them from the oil.

170
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,341
After that, we're going to
let them rest for about
three minutes, okay?

171
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,278
(phone ringing)
[Houki] Oh! I'm sorry. But you
can take it from here, right?

172
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,880
Huh?

173
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:22,255
[Houki]
Oh, yes... I understand.
But actually, I'm pretty
busy right now...

174
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,660
Hm...

175
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,131
[Cecilia]
I'd really like it if the
presentation were just a little
bit more colorful...

176
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,935
And then, I'll add a spritz
of perfume for aroma.

177
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:39,806
Ah! Plus some of this and a dash
of that for the glaze...

178
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,108
So, is it done?

179
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,679
Yes! I just completed
the finishing touches.

180
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,915
[Houki]
Whoa! It came out
looking pretty good.

181
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:53,153
(giggle) Please do
have a taste.. Go on.

182
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,121
[Houki] Chomp!

183
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:06,440
Apparently, Shinonono isn't
feeling well, so she won't
be joining us today.

184
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,511
That's weird? Houki's
never called in sick.
Wonder why.

185
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:14,215
She sounded fine when I spoke to
her on the telephone last night.

186
00:11:14,315 --> 00:11:18,052
Thank you in advance!
I do sincerely appreciate it!

187
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:19,987
Mm! No problem at all...

188
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:25,092
I just got some ingredients
earlier for pot‐au‐feu so I
can make some for Houki.

189
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,394
We can make it together.

190
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:29,830
So, what happened
to Laura today?

191
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:36,270
Shhhh! She seems to be
exhausted. She went to bed
as soon as she came home.

192
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,841
So, let us try
not to wake her.

193
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:44,311
Cecilia, would you make
the diagonal slits on the
sausages...?

194
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:46,380
That would be most helpful.

195
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,914
Oh? You mean like this?

196
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:51,452
Oui, c'est tres bon! You seem
to know what you are doing!

197
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:55,689
(giggle) Houki taught me how
to do this just yesterday.

198
00:11:55,789 --> 00:12:01,395
Huh...?! So... Houki has given
you a cooking lesson as well?

199
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:04,031
Yes! It was all going along
quite nicely,

200
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:07,868
then for some reason she seems
to have suddenly fallen ill.

201
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,007
Oh... did she now?
I wonder why...

202
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,209
[Cecilia]
I really can't imagine...

203
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:19,646
But I'm certain that this
pot‐au‐feu we're preparing is
going to make her feel much
better.

204
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:21,115
Don't you think so?

205
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:24,785
Uh‐huh... I.. agree.

206
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:30,091
[Charl, thinking] Do not tell me
Houki got sick because she ate
Cecilia's cooking...

207
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:35,262
Surely, I am reading too much
into this, non? There has been
no problem so far anyway.

208
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:36,930
(humming merrily)

209
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,800
[Charl, thinking]
Besides, we are
cooking together...

210
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,268
[Charl]
Ah! There we go.

211
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:44,138
You just have to let it
simmer this way for a while.

212
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:46,740
[Cecilia] It looks scrumptious.
(Laura screaming in background)

213
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,009
[Charl & Cecilia] Huh?

214
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:50,277
Oh, excuse me one moment...

215
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:51,946
will you keep an eye on the pot?

216
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,147
[Cecilia]
What's going on?

217
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:54,615
Whenever Laura has a bad dream,

218
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:57,318
she tends to thrash around
and throw things.

219
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,967
It needs more...

220
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:15,769
color...

221
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:18,472
Ah... sorry about
that, Cecilia..

222
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:20,707
it looks like Laura went
straight back to sleep.

223
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:22,543
[Cecilia]
That's quite all right.

224
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:25,379
In any case, I believe
it's finally ready to eat.

225
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:29,016
Whoa! C'est magnifique!
Let us have some.

226
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,587
(giggle) Please,
go right ahead.

227
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:42,263
(rousing from sleep)

228
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,465
(waking up)

229
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:49,836
[Laura]
I must have been taking a nap
during the odd hours...

230
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:54,841
That is Charlotte there...
apparently she is sleeping...

231
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,577
(stomach growling)

232
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:59,046
Oh...

233
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:07,654
Oh?

234
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:14,761
What is this...? Charlotte made
this for me! Wunderbar!

235
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,302
[Ichika]
Charl and Laura are both absent
as well?

236
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,504
Do you think there's
something going around?

237
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:28,109
I'm not sure, but I do know that
Laura went to bed terribly early
yesterday evening.

238
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,545
[Ichika]
Now that I think about it, when
I went by to check on Houki
yesterday,

239
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:35,016
she would only tell me she was
okay from behind the door.

240
00:14:35,116 --> 00:14:38,252
[Cecilia]
I wonder if it could be because
of something she ate.

241
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:41,455
Huh...? Cecilia.. did
you hurt you fingers?

242
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:45,292
Huh...?! What..? Oh, this?
It's nothing to worry about!

243
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:47,194
[Ichika] Oh...

244
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:48,762
[Cecilia]
Um, by the way, Ichika!

245
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:52,433
Would you.. like to join
me for lunch tomorrow?

246
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:55,569
I shall prepare a picnic lunch
for us and bring it with me.

247
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:01,475
What...? Well, umm...
I.. don't mind lunch

248
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:04,078
(awkward laugh) Sure, we
can eat lunch together...

249
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:09,550
Ohhh, hah, then I'll see you at
lunch tomorrow on the rooftop!

250
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,286
[Ichika]
Uh, okay then...

251
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:13,520
[Kanzashi]
Hi, Ichika...

252
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,490
Hey, Kanzashi... How are you?

253
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,327
Actually, I was, uh, cooking
and made too much for lunch...

254
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:22,829
So... I was wondering if you'd
like to have some?

255
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:24,498
(Cecilia gasp)

256
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,170
Man, this is so cool!

257
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,439
Her lunch box is a truly
magnificent work of art...!

258
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,941
I will never be able to
compete against that!

259
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:39,446
So. Are you saying that you want
me to teach you how to make
sweet and sour pork?

260
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:42,183
Yes, I do, Rin. Truly!

261
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:43,584
Are you kidding me?!

262
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:45,686
[Rinin, thinking]
Cooking WITH Cecilia?!

263
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:48,689
That has to be the most deadly
combination in the world!

264
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,558
Please! Today's the only
time we can do it.

265
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:53,860
But I really
don't want to die!

266
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:55,829
Oh, please!

267
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:01,735
Please help me, Rin! You're
the only one I can count on!

268
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,772
[Rinin, thinking]
A long time ago, I was a pretty
bad cook myself,

269
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:07,941
so I'd like
to help her out, but then...

270
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:14,015
Oh, no way! She's a deadly
weapon! One tiny slip could
be a fatal mistake!

271
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:15,882
(Gasp) Hold on...

272
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:17,884
[Rinin]
What's wrong with your fingers?

273
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:20,421
(Gasp) Oh, this..
happened..

274
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,556
when I was practicing
cutting with a knife...

275
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:25,859
But... It's really not
a big deal at all.

276
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,928
Mm...

277
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:38,605
All right then, I'll do it!
I'll teach you how to make
sweet and sour pork..!

278
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:42,643
But remember, you have
to taste your own food!

279
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:44,445
[Rinin]
So, now that we've
fried the pork,

280
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,380
the next step will be to
sautÃ© the vegetables.

281
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,182
You mean like this?

282
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:51,485
Hey! It's looking good.

283
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:53,420
This is when I would normally
crank up the heat

284
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,522
until the flames came
leaping out, but...

285
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:57,258
'Til the flames
are leaping out?!

286
00:16:57,358 --> 00:17:00,627
That's right. Chinese food
is all about firepower!

287
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,697
[Rinin] Anyway, we can't have
flames with an electric stove...

288
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:05,699
Let me handle that!

289
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:06,900
Huh?

290
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,738
[Rinin] Uh...! AAAHH!

291
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:28,896
I'm sorry, Ichika... but I
wasn't able to prepare the
bentos for us last night
because,

292
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:32,400
for some reason or other...
the food exploded...

293
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,469
Uh... exploded?

294
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:36,337
I'm especially disappointed,

295
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:40,108
because I was really looking
forward to watching you enjoy my
cooking, too...

296
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:45,380
[Ichika]
Well why don't we go make
something together right
now, okay...?

297
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,847
We don't have to buy our lunch.

298
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:50,118
And I'll teach you how to
make... my favorite dish!

299
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:52,220
Huh?

300
00:17:53,688 --> 00:17:56,091
[Ichika]
Cecilia... are you
ready for this?

301
00:17:56,191 --> 00:18:01,029
[Cecilia]
Uh, yes...! But I
am rather nervous.

302
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:04,932
[Ichika]
Look, Cecilia... we
don't have to do this...

303
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:06,734
if you don't feel comfortable.

304
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:11,639
[Cecilia]
No, I can do this!
We're already here.

305
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:13,108
[Cecilia]
I'll be fine.

306
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,277
[Ichika]
Okay then. Now, take
it in both hands...

307
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:18,012
and hold it gently...

308
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:19,947
[Cecilia]
Gasp! It's so very warm.

309
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:25,820
[Ichika]
Mhmmm... Then you wet it
thoroughly, like this...

310
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,355
[Cecilia]
Mm‐hm. Like this...?

311
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,761
[Ichika]
Yeah, I like that. All right
then, let's do it.

312
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:37,065
[Cecilia]
Uh, okay.

313
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:40,968
[Cecilia]
So... like this?

314
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:44,772
[Ichika]
Uh‐huh. And now you
can pick your filling.

315
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:47,408
[Cecilia]
What are those
red thingies there?

316
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,413
Oh those? Those are
pickled plum... Try one.

317
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:56,384
(Gasp) Chomp.
(reaction to sourness)

318
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:58,653
[Ichika] (laughter)

319
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:03,458
[Ichika]
Next, you press the rice into
a triangle shape, like this.

320
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:04,992
[Cecilia]
Let's see. Is this right?

321
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:08,129
[Ichika]
No, You have to squeeze
it a bit more gently.

322
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:12,967
(Ichika chuckles)

323
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,536
Hey! Were laughing
at me just then?!

324
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:17,605
[Ichika] I'm sorry.

325
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:19,074
[Ichika]
You were just... so cute.

326
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:22,277
Ah? You thought that I was cute?

327
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,812
That's hard to believe.

328
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:27,115
[Ichika]
Hey, let's try something?

329
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:29,717
(Cecilia gasps)

330
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:33,921
So.. The key is to squeeze
it in firmly and tight.

331
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:37,725
[Cecilia] Uh‐huh...

332
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:39,260
[Ichika]
There! Now it's done.

333
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,497
Ah! Could you please.. show
me how that went again?

334
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:44,032
(Ichika chuckles)

335
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:49,870
[Cecilia]
It's so lovely and warm...

336
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,939
[Ichika]
Well sure. It's
freshly made rice.

337
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,344
[Cecilia]
Oh, that's not what I meant...
Mhm. Honestly...

338
00:19:56,444 --> 00:20:00,715
[Tabane]
Yummy! Mmm! These ribs
are delicious!

339
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,450
[Tabane] Chomp! (chewing)

340
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,520
[Tabane]
Ah! Wiiiine! (wacky sounds)

341
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,223
[Squall]
So is everything to your
liking, Doctor Tabane?

342
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:14,962
Mm.. I guess so. Except for that
soup that had the sleeping drug
in it, ya know...? Hee‐hee! Ah.

343
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:19,734
[Squall]
Now, as to the matter about
providing Phantom Task with
IS units...

344
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,902
Have you made any
decisions yet?

345
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:26,541
[Tabane]
(giggle) No way! Sounds like
a major pain..! Hey, bring me
some cake!

346
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:31,246
[Squall]
(laughing) Ah... I wonder what
you think about this then.

347
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:36,151
[Tabane]
Hehe!

348
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:37,885
[Tabane]
Yah!

349
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:44,292
Uh‐oh!

350
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:47,662
[Tabane]
Does my hair look okay?
You see, I'm mentally

351
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:53,401
and physically over‐engineered,
down to the cellular level.
(giggle)

352
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,403
[Tabane]
As it is, I'm afraid that
Chi‐chan's about

353
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:58,906
the only one who's good enough
to challenge me physically.

354
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:01,276
[Tabane]
(laughing) Sorry,
E for effort though.

355
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:04,445
[Madoka] Don't move!

356
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:06,114
[Tabane]
Huh?

357
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:06,814
(evil chuckle)

358
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:08,349
[Tabane]
Ooo My...

359
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,485
Now this is interesting...

360
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:15,990
(Tabane giggles)

361
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:26,667
(Tabane giggles)

362
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,370
[Tabane]
Huh? Huh...?!

363
00:21:30,738 --> 00:21:32,940
[Tabane] (laughter)

364
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,609
Okay so, what's your name?

365
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:36,944
Or... how about
I just guess?

366
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,781
[Tabane]
Let's see, could it be
Madoka... Orimura...

367
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:43,051
(Madoka gasps)

368
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:45,620
[Tabane]
Gahaha, I win! Hehe! Yay for me!

369
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,623
[Tabane]
Oh! I don't mind making a
personal IS for this one.

370
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:49,657
[Madoka] Huh?

371
00:21:49,757 --> 00:21:50,825
[Tabane]
And that means...

372
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:52,493
you get to come with me now.

373
00:21:52,593 --> 00:21:55,663
Okay, lemme keep her!
Lemme keep her! Please!
Lemme keep her!

374
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:58,033
[Squall]
Sorry, but could be problematic.

375
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:01,469
[Tabane]
Aw, what a bummer!
You're so stingy. Oh, well...

376
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:05,040
[Tabane]
So, Madocchi‐wawa, what kind
of personal IS do you want?

377
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:10,311
A long‐distance type?
A close‐combat type? Or how
about a special‐armored type?

378
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:16,684
Well, I guess we can talk about
that later. I can hardly wait
to introduce you to Ku‐chan.
It'll be great! Haha!

379
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:20,255
Riiight! All right! Let's go get
something to eat! YAAY!

380
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:57,785
[Yamada, voiceover]
Right...! Now I'd like to begin
the special after‐school class.
(giggle)

381
00:23:57,885 --> 00:24:01,056
What's the matter?
Are you feeling nervous?

382
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:04,792
You know, you really are
going to have to focus!

383
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:09,930
You. Need. To. Try. To. Fo‐cus!

384
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,799
(gasp) Miss Orimura?

385
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:17,272
[Chifuyu, voiceover]
Next time on Infinite Stratos 2,
"Looking for Memories".
