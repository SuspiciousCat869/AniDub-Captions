the potential that lies
within you.

00:09:01.215 --> 00:09:03.085

so what's driving you
to go back out into

Having freedom is tough,
you know.

00:09:15.945 --> 00:09:18.750
You gotta make all
the decisions yourself,

00:09:18.783 --> 00:09:21.690
like what to eat,
where to sleep,

00:09:21.723 --> 00:09:23.794
and when to take a crap.

00:09:23.828 --> 00:09:27.000
I mean, try thinking about
that all the time.

00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:30.841
It's not easy.
It's enough to drive you crazy.

00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:35.116
Tendo, honestly, I don't want
for you to end up that way,

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:38.055
which is why I'll tell you what
to do.

00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:39.759
KOSUGI: Listen to me
and you won't need

00:09:39.793 --> 00:09:42.063
to think for yourself
ever again.

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:45.538
To be honest, I'm kinda jealous
of the chance you're gettin'.

00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:47.575
So put your hopes
and dreams aside

00:09:47.608 --> 00:09:49.411
and park yourself here.

00:09:49.445 --> 00:09:51.916
All you need to do
is follow my orders

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.755
and I promise you'll have
a bright future ahead of you.

you see all

00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:00.266
of those poor people out there?

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.707
They're there because they lived
how they wanted to.

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:06.679
You're different
from those people because you

00:10:06.713 --> 00:10:08.817
know how
to put your wants aside,

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.623
listen to me,
follow all of my orders,

00:10:11.657 --> 00:10:14.060

to do.

00:10:14.695 --> 00:10:16.499

for your benefit.

That man who is doing everything
in his power to manipulate you,

he's really after?

of your life.

00:13:45.984 --> 00:13:49.224
SHIZUKA: Your free will is yours
and yours alone, Akira.

00:13:49.258 --> 00:13:52.430
Your freedom to choose
your own path in life,

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:55.538
the self respect you need
to live your life,

00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:58.108
your soul,
your pride...

00:13:59.345 --> 00:14:01.983
He wants you to abandon all
of those.

00:14:02.016 --> 00:14:06.125
That man has no self esteem
and he'll never be satisfied.

00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:08.597
He'll keep putting others down
in order

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.201
to make himself seem bigger
to the people he controls

00:14:11.234 --> 00:14:13.807
around him.
Can't you see?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.745
That pathetic man
will do anything

00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:17.982

I lost myself, you know?

Maybe I'm not cut out for it.

Nah, it's starting
to really feel like--

00:22:26.425 --> 00:22:29.063
like I'll never find
the right job.

will be.

It's anyone's
guess, really.

00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:54.915
So do whatever you wanna do now.

00:22:54.948 --> 00:22:58.823
Just make sure you enjoy it
and savor every second of it.

00:22:58.857 --> 00:23:00.660
Eventually, one day,

00:23:00.693 --> 00:23:03.833
one of those things may become
a job that only you can do.
