Oh!

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:08.035
Well, anyway, my name
is Akira Tendo.

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:09.836
Since we keep running
into each other,

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:11.038
I thought maybe we
could exchange--

00:11:11.072 --> 00:11:13.106
- You said your name
was Akira, right?

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.242
- [gasps]
- Not that it's my business,

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:17.878
Akira, but in what way
do you benefit

00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:19.780
from saving random people
like this?

00:11:19.814 --> 00:11:21.548
- Huh?
Then, uh--

00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:24.818
- And what's the deal
with that get-up you're wearing?

00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:27.121
What is it psychologists
call it?

00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:29.423
Oh, right.
Identification.

00:11:29.456 --> 00:11:32.893
An inferiority complex fueled by
a low self esteem.

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:34.561
One of the common
defense mechanisms

00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:37.932
is imitating heroes.
Or in other words,

00:11:37.965 --> 00:11:40.167
it causes men who
are typically unvalued

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.570
by society and lack
self-worth to develop a strong
desire

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:44.972
to become a hero.

00:11:45.005 --> 00:11:46.340
<i>AKIRA: That's
a little harsh.</i>

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.642
- Hey, you better show
some respect!

00:11:48.676 --> 00:11:50.544
He saved you!
If not for him,

00:11:50.577 --> 00:11:52.212
you'd be dead right--
- I understand he managed

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:54.114
to save a couple
of complete strangers

00:11:54.148 --> 00:11:56.717
from getting eaten alive
by zombies.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.119
I don't intend to deny
the fact that he was able

00:11:59.152 --> 00:12:01.622
to save a few people's lives,
but...

00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:03.724
- [gasps]

00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:04.958
the danger
you might have caused

00:12:04.992 --> 00:12:06.827
to those truly important
to you when you leapt

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.328

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:11.032
Was endangering their lives
really worth bolstering

00:12:11.065 --> 00:12:12.599

[AKIRA gasps]

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:16.136
SHIZUKA: Additionally,
hero isn't a title

00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:17.271
that you can claim for yourself.

00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:18.539
What one person
considers justice,

00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:19.940
another might see as evil.
- AKIRA: What?

00:12:19.974 --> 00:12:21.342

<i>If I continue

00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:33.687
<i>it's sure to eventually put
Kencho's life in danger.</i>

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:38.092
What does it mean to be a hero?

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:41.395
<i>And do I have what it takes?</i>
- SHIZUKA: Anyway,

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:44.431
If you're still unable
to properly analyze risk,

00:12:44.464 --> 00:12:47.168

my survivability,
