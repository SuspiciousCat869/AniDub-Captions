You wouldn't believe it.

why not just walk away, Akira?

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.350
You should quit your job

my serious advice

is that you should quit.

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:08.169
There's no reason to stick
with a company like that.

Of course.
That makes sense.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.652
No matter what situation
we were in,

00:18:38.685 --> 00:18:42.323
that fun-loving panache
of yours brought everybody up!

00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:43.390
- Huh?

00:18:44.057 --> 00:18:45.926
[all groaning]

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.931
That's why I wanted a job where
I could make people forget about

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:52.766
their lives and laugh
for a moment!

00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:57.204
I--I wanted...

00:18:58.806 --> 00:19:01.742
I wanted to be
a stand-up comedian!

- [scoff]

00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:10.350
Then do it!

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.754
Leave that garbage job in
the past and do it!

00:19:14.788 --> 00:19:17.123
Take it from me!
You won't regret it!

- Don't make the mistake I did!

00:19:24.064 --> 00:19:25.832
Listen to advice
from your friends

00:19:25.865 --> 00:19:27.534
the first time!

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:30.404
If you're a coming then
show me you can jump that gap

00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:31.705
and make it funny!

Hey, Akira!
Give me a hand!

- Oh, crap, what's wrong?

00:20:52.253 --> 00:20:54.855
Did you get bitten by a zombie?
- It's worse!

00:20:54.889 --> 00:20:59.793
I scraped my balls!

00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:03.863
AKIRA: Oh, man.

00:21:03.897 --> 00:21:06.633
I never thought I'd see you
so magnificently buck naked

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:07.701
crying like a baby.

00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:09.169
KENCHO: Shut up.

00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:11.572
Anyone with taste would know
it was a bit inspired

00:21:11.605 --> 00:21:13.373
by my rebirth as a comic.
- Yeah, right.

00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:15.342
What's new about you
doing naked jokes?

00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:17.777
- [exhales]
Ah, get used to it.

00:21:18.612 --> 00:21:20.280

Ah, I'd give anything
to be on a stage.

You know, if you got
any connections

00:21:25.886 --> 00:21:27.588
from work that could help,
I'm all ears.

00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:28.923
- From work?

00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:29.757
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:30.958
I've never worked.

00:21:30.991 --> 00:21:32.292
- Yeah, then who
was whining about

00:21:32.326 --> 00:21:34.561
the company they worked for?
- [groans]

00:21:34.595 --> 00:21:36.796
- You looked worse than
the zombies back then.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.065
[chuckles]

00:21:38.098 --> 00:21:40.367
- So what?
You're the one who was crying.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.769
What kind of comic cries
during their act?

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:45.339

00:21:52.746 --> 00:21:56.049
You were seriously
amazing today.

00:21:56.083 --> 00:21:58.652
The guys who quit their jobs,
drop everything,

00:21:58.685 --> 00:22:00.387
and move on with their lives,

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.390
those are the ones who turn
out to be successful later on.

00:22:03.423 --> 00:22:06.393
Heh, that's how entrepreneurs
and artists are born, right?

00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:09.396
Hell, for all I know...

00:22:11.231 --> 00:22:14.134
It might even turn out to be
the guy who saves us all

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:15.602
from the zombie
apocalypse.

00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:17.337
- Mm?

00:22:18.906 --> 00:22:21.174
Who, me?
No way!

00:22:21.208 --> 00:22:23.077
Like that'll ever happen.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.512
- Yeah, probably not.

00:22:24.545 --> 00:22:26.613
That definitely ain't happenin'
for sure.

[both laughing]

00:22:31.018 --> 00:22:33.253
Whoa, I just thought up
a brand new killer bit

00:22:33.286 --> 00:22:34.455
