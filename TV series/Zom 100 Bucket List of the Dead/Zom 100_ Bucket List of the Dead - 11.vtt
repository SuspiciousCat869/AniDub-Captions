00:15:35.604 --> 00:15:37.440
the way we really wanted it to?

00:15:37.473 --> 00:15:38.843
all: Huh?

00:15:38.877 --> 00:15:40.914
OLD MAN HIKO:
Large scale projects declined

00:15:40.947 --> 00:15:43.052
following
the post-war land reform.

00:15:43.086 --> 00:15:45.123
The TPP was looming.

00:15:45.156 --> 00:15:47.862
We were unsure
of who our successors would be.

00:15:47.895 --> 00:15:50.935
Even so, we desperately worked
our fields

00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:53.072
and found a way
to make ends meet, didn't we?

00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:54.775
[all groaning]

00:15:54.808 --> 00:15:59.184
Typhoons, sweltering heat,
freezing cold--you name it.

00:15:59.217 --> 00:16:01.723
No matter how many times
nature beat us down,

00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:04.294
we'd grit our teeth and say,
"This is the year!"

00:16:04.327 --> 00:16:07.467
We've survived this long,
haven't we?

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.474
So who cares about a couple
of zombies?

00:16:12.912 --> 00:16:14.548
SHIZUKA: Are you aware
of the recognitive

00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:16.084
hyper focalization theory?

00:16:16.117 --> 00:16:18.524
- Recog-what?

00:16:18.557 --> 00:16:22.464
- It was a study that attempted
to scientifically define luck.

00:16:22.497 --> 00:16:24.702
So do you only care
about yourself,

00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:26.839
your family,
your issues?

00:16:26.872 --> 00:16:28.877
What about your
concern extending

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.014
from lovers to friends
to strangers?

00:16:31.048 --> 00:16:33.620
Do you care if it's just
for today or tomorrow?

00:16:33.653 --> 00:16:35.857
Are you considering
the next generation

00:16:35.891 --> 00:16:37.595
or our society as a whole?

00:16:37.628 --> 00:16:39.598
SHIZUKA: And when you face
a challenge head-on,

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:42.370
who else do you consider before
you leap into action?

00:16:42.403 --> 00:16:45.811
You see, the larger the scope
of your consideration,

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:47.582
the more luck you end up having.

00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:50.219
- Showing off how smart you are
is pointless.

00:16:50.252 --> 00:16:52.390
Who cares about all that crap?

00:16:52.423 --> 00:16:54.896
ATENBO: 'Cause at this moment,
I'm the lucky one!

00:16:54.929 --> 00:16:57.367
See?
Too bad for you,

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.705
'cause you're the one
with bad luck!

00:17:00.439 --> 00:17:01.977

[SHIZUKA gasps]

Old Man Hiko?

- [grunts]

Wow, you are the best hunter.

00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:21.750
- [shudders]
That was a lucky shot!

00:17:21.783 --> 00:17:23.720
What's one old man gonna do?

00:17:23.753 --> 00:17:25.991
[all shouting]

00:17:26.025 --> 00:17:28.697
What?
Who the hell are all of you?

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.634
- [giggles]

00:17:30.668 --> 00:17:34.107
- Anyone who tries
to rough up our Shizuka...

00:17:34.141 --> 00:17:36.078
- Gets no mercy no matter what!

00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:38.683
- Take this, whippersnapper!

00:17:38.716 --> 00:17:40.085

Oh, no!

I was so close, dammit.

00:17:50.406 --> 00:17:53.412
Why do I always have
bad luck all the time?

00:17:53.446 --> 00:17:55.349
SHIZUKA: 'Cause you only think
about yourself

00:17:55.383 --> 00:17:58.055
and the immediate present.

00:17:58.088 --> 00:17:59.558
And someone as self-absorbed

00:17:59.591 --> 00:18:01.963
as yourself will never
be blessed

00:18:01.996 --> 00:18:03.700
with any amount of luck.

00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:05.236
- [groans]
all: Shizuka!

00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:07.107
TOME: Are you all right, dear?

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.712
SHIZUKA: I'm okay,
thanks to all of you.

00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:11.983
[whimpers]

00:18:12.016 --> 00:18:13.686
I'm lucky you all showed up.

[chainsaw revving]

00:18:17.528 --> 00:18:20.399
- Wrong-minded people like you
who get in my way

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:23.071
are only good
for becoming zombies!

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:25.543
I'm who's right!
The only one right!

00:18:25.577 --> 00:18:26.546
- [scoffs]

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:28.750
[BEATRIX grunts]

00:18:28.783 --> 00:18:32.090
In my country it is normal
to toss your cigarette butts on

00:18:32.123 --> 00:18:33.392
the ground as you walk.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.463
- [gasps]

00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:37.500
BEATRIX: Supermarket cashiers
chew gum

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.437
as they serve their customers,

00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:42.745
and using a vacuum cleaner
on Sunday is rude,

00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:45.049
because it's a day of rest.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.922
On your birthdays you organize
your own party

00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:49.592
and treat others to food.

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:52.964
I'm sure everything I'm saying
sounds absurd to you.

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:55.335
However, that was all just part

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:57.474
of normal life back
in my country.

00:18:57.508 --> 00:18:58.710
- I get it.

00:18:58.743 --> 00:19:01.649
You're also trying to say I'm in
the wrong here.

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:06.593
Well, too bad I don't give
a damn about your culture!

00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:08.530
KANBAYASHI: Wrong-minded people
like yourself

00:19:08.563 --> 00:19:12.103
are better off just shutting up
and becoming zombies!

00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:13.840
[BEATRIX grunts]

00:19:14.708 --> 00:19:15.810
- [gasps]

00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:22.323
No way!

00:19:22.356 --> 00:19:24.862
KANBAYASHI: You took advantage
of the zombies gathering...

00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:27.433
[wood creaking]

00:19:29.104 --> 00:19:31.141
And used them to destroy
the water wheel

00:19:31.174 --> 00:19:32.677
and cut off the power?

00:19:34.047 --> 00:19:36.384
[gasps]
But that's crazy.

00:19:36.418 --> 00:19:38.455
It's just not right.

00:19:38.488 --> 00:19:40.527
It's the wrong way
of going about it.

00:19:41.428 --> 00:19:42.732
BEATRIX: That's just it.

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:46.304
There is no perfectly right way
of doing things.

00:19:46.338 --> 00:19:48.409
There are all sorts
of people who do things

00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:51.816
in their own way and it makes
the world a colorful place.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:53.820
BEATRIX: Perhaps instead
of pushing what you thought

00:19:53.853 --> 00:19:55.422
was right onto others,

00:19:55.456 --> 00:19:57.694
you should have stopped
and asked yourself,

00:19:57.728 --> 00:19:59.497
"Am I the one that's in
the wrong here?"

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:03.205
Maybe then you would have seen
the world in a brighter light.

It's gonna take a lot
