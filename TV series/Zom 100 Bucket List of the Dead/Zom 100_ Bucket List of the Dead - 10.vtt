NAGISA: Wow, I think
it's coming together now.

00:00:05.778 --> 00:00:08.116
SAKURA: Since your hair
is a little short, Akira,

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.089
we'll start by adding extensions
to give it some volume.

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:13.528
Then we'll sew them
into your natural hair using

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:14.896
an extension hook.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.432
And for the final touches,

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:18.938
we'll secure them by weaving in
any loose strands left

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:20.440
All done!

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:23.747
- Wow, it looks so good!

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.118
[AKIRA grunts]

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:29.927
From this moment on I
am Farmer Dreadlocks!

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.563
both: Yay!
[clapping]

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.027
AKIKO: You worked at a salon
in Tokyo for over ten years?

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.599
- That's right!
And I only did dreadlocks.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.468
So when I heard
that Akira wanted

00:02:14.502 --> 00:02:17.074
to get dreadlocks, I just had
to help him out, ya know?

00:02:17.107 --> 00:02:19.679
- I used to teach
at a university in Tokyo.

00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:22.919
- I used to be a professional
makeup artist for feature films.

00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:24.890
- Wow, for films?

00:02:24.923 --> 00:02:26.226
Which ones did you work on?

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.596
- Let me show you.

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.200
NAGISA: I did this one.
Heard of it?

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.471
AKIRA: Oh, yeah,
I've totally seen it!

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.710
I didn't know it
was made in Japan.

00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:36.145
- Cool, right?

00:02:36.178 --> 00:02:38.517
We were filming the sequel
the other day when...

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:43.260
- [exhales]

00:02:43.293 --> 00:02:45.497
- All of us were on set.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.936
We were in the middle
of filming when it started.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.271
- [gasps]

00:02:49.304 --> 00:02:51.544
- Thing is, you'd never expect

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:55.217
a zombie attack while working
on the set of a zombie film.

00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:57.956
I mean, what are the odds?
Am I right?

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.027
<i>NAGISA: We took too long
to notice.</i>

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.195

In order to get here...

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.681
AYUMI: We had to go through
a lot.

00:03:26.714 --> 00:03:29.752
It wasn't easy, but...

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:31.389
When we got here,

00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:35.063
everyone in the village
welcomed us with open arms.

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:37.268
Honestly, I'm forever grateful

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.238
for the kindness
they've shown us.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.413
I know saying this
is wishful thinking,

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:46.453
but I--I'd love
to continue living here

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:49.391
and practicing this way
of life in this village.

00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:52.498
That's how
I truly feel deep down.

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:53.567
- [gasps]

00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:58.677
I totally agree.

[SHIZUKA blows air slowly]

[inhales and exhales sharply]

00:04:08.263 --> 00:04:09.933
- Thank you, Shizuka!

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:13.239
It must be tough doing work
you're unaccustomed to.

00:04:13.272 --> 00:04:16.814
- Sure, but it's using
techniques like this

00:04:16.847 --> 00:04:19.018
that are key to keeping
the village off the grid

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.489
and safe from zombie attacks.

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:25.063
I'm intrigued by how you live.
I think it's fascinating.

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:27.001
- Oh?
[laughs]

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:28.470
Don't know about that,

00:04:28.504 --> 00:04:30.340
but I do know
you can't beat rice cooked

00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:31.910
on a hearth.

00:04:31.943 --> 00:04:35.250
You just add plenty of water
and place it on a strong fire

00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:37.221
and you'll have
the perfect rice every time.

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:39.425
- Yeah?

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:42.632
I guess all that extra effort
makes it taste even better.

00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:44.102
SHIZUKA: I find
it interesting that--

00:04:44.135 --> 00:04:47.240
- Akemi!

00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:50.681
- Cut it out, Old Man Hiko!
What do you think you're doing?

00:04:50.714 --> 00:04:53.186
OLD MAN HIKO: Where
have you been all this time?

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:54.589
[door slides shut]
- [stammering]

00:04:54.622 --> 00:04:56.292
- I'm sorry about that.

00:04:56.325 --> 00:05:00.100
He's been acting strange ever
since his old lady passed away.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.903
SHIZUKA: I--I see.

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.108
- Akemi!

not look it now,</i>

00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:08.817
the whole village.

00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:10.286
- Hey, Miss Tome,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.057
you got any rope
or something you

00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:13.861
can part ways with?

00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:15.431
I was haying
and accidentally sliced

00:05:15.464 --> 00:05:17.167
myself good with the scythe.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.338
- Oh!
- Oh, that looks terrible!

00:05:19.372 --> 00:05:21.275
Let me get some--
SHIZUKA: Remember.

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:23.246
Try not to bind
the wound too tightly,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.083
or you'll risk necrosis
of the tissue.

00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:26.586
both: Huh?

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.790
- First, try to raise
the injury above your heart.

00:05:28.824 --> 00:05:31.162
Tightly hold the wound
and then apply some pressure

00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:32.765
to the artery on the bicep.

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:33.934
both: Oh.

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:35.771
- You seem to know a lot.

00:05:35.805 --> 00:05:37.041
Are you a doctor?

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:39.412
- Huh?
Uh, oh, no.

00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:40.949
It's nothing like that.

00:05:40.982 --> 00:05:43.119
I just read about it when I
was little.

00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:44.923
[LIEUTENANT] What's this?
A doctor?

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:47.829
Good, my back's been killing me
since I woke up.

00:05:47.863 --> 00:05:50.000
Can you fix it?
SHIZUKA: Well, like I said,

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:51.168
I'm not--
- Wow!

00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:52.538
What a young
and beautiful doctor!

00:05:52.572 --> 00:05:54.943
- Doctor, I stumbled and hurt
my knee earlier.

00:05:54.976 --> 00:05:56.580
OLD WOMAN: My stomach
isn't feeling good.

00:05:56.613 --> 00:05:58.985
OLD MAN: My bladder's leaky.
- Wait, hold on.

00:05:59.018 --> 00:06:01.422
- Akemi!

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:03.026
[SHIZUKA screams]

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:07.133
- She said that she's a doctor.
- Oh, how wonderful!

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:09.438
- Hey, is that what
I think it is?

00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:11.777
Is that a cesspit?

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.547
OLD MAN: They're not used much
these days,

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.450
but it's a source
of good old-fashioned

00:06:15.484 --> 00:06:16.987
natural fertilizer.

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:18.724
- I see.

00:06:18.758 --> 00:06:20.761
- In Japan the rain washes away

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:23.099
a lot of the minerals that
are in our fields,

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:25.938
but if we recycle the food
that we eat by returning

00:06:25.972 --> 00:06:27.240
it to the soil,

00:06:27.273 --> 00:06:29.913
then we can replenish a lot
of those missing minerals.

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:31.683
- Ah.

00:06:31.716 --> 00:06:33.086
- And you know what they say.

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:34.589
A deep dive in the old cesspit

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:36.425
is sure to get you ahead
in life.

00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:37.995
Care to give it a try,
young man?

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:39.766

KENCHO: Who's she?

00:06:42.104 --> 00:06:43.574
OLD MAN: Hmm?
Oh.

00:06:43.607 --> 00:06:46.279
I believe she escaped
from the city, too.

00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:48.684
Unfortunately,
she lost her parents.

00:06:48.717 --> 00:06:50.788
I'm afraid that big dog you see
over there

00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:53.860
is the only family she has left.

00:06:53.894 --> 00:06:56.734
I haven't seen her smile once
since she got here.

00:06:56.767 --> 00:07:00.440
To be that young
and go through that...

00:07:00.474 --> 00:07:02.011
KENCHO: Hey there,
beautiful lady!

00:07:02.044 --> 00:07:03.648
Can I ask you a favor?

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.183
- Huh?

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.121
- I'm tryin' to become
a comedian

00:07:07.154 --> 00:07:08.456
and practicing my juggling.

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:11.262
Would you mind being
an audience member for me?

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:12.665
- Mm.

00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:15.971
ANJU: Why are you using daruma?

00:07:16.005 --> 00:07:17.340
- Why, you ask?

00:07:17.374 --> 00:07:19.311
Gunma's known for their daruma,

00:07:19.344 --> 00:07:21.783
and once I perfect my technique,

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.453
you better believe
I'm performing

00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:25.357
this juggling routine naked.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.094
- Hmm.

00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:31.201
So, does that mean you're
a pervert or something?

00:07:31.235 --> 00:07:33.941
ANJU: Why else would you
be talking to me right now?

00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:35.043
- [laughs]

00:07:35.077 --> 00:07:36.412
It's common courtesy

00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:37.982
to say hello to a lady,

00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:41.022
regardless of whether they're
a girl or an old woman.

00:07:41.055 --> 00:07:42.525
- Courtesy?

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:45.197
- Yep, in Italy
a woman never forgets

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.834
to show her smile,

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:49.873
and it's rude to deny women
a compliment when you see 'em!

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:50.874
- Huh?

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:55.116
[laughs]
Hey, mister.

00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:56.485
You're so weird.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:58.389
Why are you acting like you're
an Italian?

00:07:58.423 --> 00:08:00.394
KENCHO: There's
that beautiful smile.

00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:01.362
- Hmm?

00:08:01.396 --> 00:08:02.565
Oh.

00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:04.970
- My name's Kencho.

00:08:05.003 --> 00:08:07.207
And what might your name be,
little lady?

00:08:08.543 --> 00:08:10.080
- Anju.

00:08:10.113 --> 00:08:12.250
And this is Charo.

00:08:12.284 --> 00:08:14.121
- I'll call you Angie,
then, okay?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.125
- [exhales]

00:08:18.763 --> 00:08:21.068
KENCHO: Oh, could you watch
me practice my other acts?

00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:23.039
Like the one where I eat udon
with my butt!

00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:25.109
ANJU: I think I'll pass.
KENCHO: What?

00:08:26.078 --> 00:08:27.414
[BEATRIX speaking German]

00:08:27.448 --> 00:08:29.552
What a magnificent water wheel!

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:31.923

Go and help your friends.

00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:14.267
- What?
But Dad!

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.004
- Those friends
of yours supported you all

00:17:16.038 --> 00:17:17.474
the way here, right?

00:17:17.508 --> 00:17:18.877
You keep 'em safe.

Lock the door and barricade it

HIGURASHI: What's wrong?

00:18:04.434 --> 00:18:06.973
Going home already, are we?

00:18:07.006 --> 00:18:10.012
Why do that when
the night's still young?

00:18:10.046 --> 00:18:12.952
I think we should play outside
a little longer.

SHIZUKA: I have
to do something before

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:31.689
the whole village is destroyed.

- Oh, good,
I'm happy you're both okay.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.773
- We can talk later!

00:18:56.806 --> 00:18:59.411
Our top priority
is evacuating everyone here.

00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:00.948
Get them to the bridge.

00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:03.854
- But there's an electric fence
around the village.

00:19:03.887 --> 00:19:06.793
- I was told it was only meant
to deter zombie boars,

00:19:06.826 --> 00:19:08.329
so the shock is minimal.

00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:10.868
- So it's not that bad.

[electric buzzing]

- Ah!

00:19:15.543 --> 00:19:17.146
SHIZUKA: To save someone
from electrocution,

00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:19.618
take a non-conductive material
like wood--

00:19:19.652 --> 00:19:20.854
- [shouts]

00:19:20.887 --> 00:19:22.156
- And knock them off of it!

00:19:22.189 --> 00:19:24.060
- Go, Shizuka!

00:19:24.093 --> 00:19:26.365
- That was a close one.

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:29.203
But then why is the voltage
so high right now?

00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:31.542
Ah, could it be?

00:19:31.575 --> 00:19:33.813

the voltage and disabled

00:19:33.847 --> 00:19:35.116
the circuit breaker?

00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:37.521
- [gasps]
Then does that mean...

00:19:37.554 --> 00:19:38.790
SHIZUKA: The same
electric fence

00:19:38.823 --> 00:19:41.461
that protects the village
is trapping all

00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:42.831
of us inside right now?

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:45.537

You gotta move!

That guy's an idiot.

He hasn't figured it out yet!

00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:14.393
You're telling me this
was you guys?

00:20:15.262 --> 00:20:16.599
You did this?

00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:18.970
- [laughs]

00:20:19.004 --> 00:20:21.208
Oh, we got you.

All of us are destined to turn
into zombies one day, aren't we?

00:20:32.163 --> 00:20:35.469
It'd be a shame if I didn't get
to do whatever I wanted

00:20:35.504 --> 00:20:37.406
before that day happens, right?

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.277
- Wait, you have one, too?

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.980
- Huh? What?

00:20:41.014 --> 00:20:42.851
Were you making your own
bucket list

00:20:42.884 --> 00:20:44.120
of things to do?

00:20:44.153 --> 00:20:45.857
[HIGURASHI laughs]

00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:47.627
What a coincidence.

00:20:47.661 --> 00:20:48.863
Now, then,

00:20:48.897 --> 00:20:50.133
what should I do next here

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.137

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.474
Yeah, gotta be this one.

Hey, Akira, I'd love
nothing more than

00:20:57.446 --> 00:20:59.885
to see you become a zombie
with my own two eyes.

What did Akira do
to you to deserve that?

00:21:04.294 --> 00:21:07.434
- I hated you the moment
we met in college.

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:10.005
And I hate you now as much
as I did back then.

How could I not be disgusted

00:21:20.927 --> 00:21:22.865
- That's your reason for this?

00:21:22.898 --> 00:21:23.934
- Lighten up.

00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:25.069
What's so wrong about trying

00:21:25.102 --> 00:21:26.972
to enjoy our last
summer break before

00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:29.745
we all eventually become zombies

If you're gonna put
your freedom first,

you need to respect
others' freedoms, too.

00:21:50.052 --> 00:21:53.560
The people of this village
are struggling just to survive.

00:21:53.593 --> 00:21:56.800
You must realize that.

I have written down

anything like yours!

00:22:11.094 --> 00:22:14.768
And I still haven't repaid
my parents for raising me.

00:22:14.802 --> 00:22:17.574
And if I have to live with
the regret of not giving back

00:22:17.608 --> 00:22:19.978
to my parents,
well then I'd rather be

be surrounded by zombies!

00:22:37.748 --> 00:22:39.518
I hate it,
but we have to retreat!

00:22:39.552 --> 00:22:41.556
SHIZUKA: We need
to evacuate everyone in

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:43.526
the village.
- Charo?

00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:45.362
- I'll go to
the water wheel shed

00:22:45.395 --> 00:22:47.768
and try my best to shut down
the generator!

00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:50.272
- While you do that,
I'll repay my folks!

00:22:50.305 --> 00:22:51.876
- Your goal seems to be
a little different

00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:54.080
than everyone else's,
but whatever.

00:22:54.113 --> 00:22:55.651
We need
to get everyone else out.

00:22:55.684 --> 00:22:57.386
Once the electricity is off,

00:22:57.419 --> 00:22:59.090
meet me at
the suspension bridge.

00:22:59.123 --> 00:23:00.292

00:23:02.697 --> 00:23:05.269
Uh, Angie?

Akira, I'll get her.

00:23:10.847 --> 00:23:12.951
You go and try
and find your mom.

A game of tag followed
