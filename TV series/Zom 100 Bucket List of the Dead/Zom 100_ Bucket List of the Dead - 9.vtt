Akira.

- What am I doin'?

but I'm actually

You're a Japanese Tischler!

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:15.296
MASARU: You see, this here
is an oak tree.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.836
Since oaks have large, thick,
sturdy branches,

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:20.273
they make the perfect host
for a tree house.

00:05:20.306 --> 00:05:22.612
Southern trees rot too easily

00:05:22.646 --> 00:05:25.618
but you can find some
northern trees in this area.

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:28.089

AKIRA: Mr. Kumano, there's no
telling when another zombie boar

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.634
will attack before
your tree house is completed.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.003
This is a race against time.

00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:37.041
It would be better if I had help
from more people, right?

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:39.011
- Well, uh, sure, uh...

00:05:39.044 --> 00:05:41.884
- Aren't we racing against time
to see if your parents are safe?

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:43.654

you'd ignore someone

00:05:45.658 --> 00:05:48.129

- Hose?

00:06:29.478 --> 00:06:31.951
- It's very difficult
to eyeball how level things

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:33.219
are between the trees.

00:06:33.252 --> 00:06:35.992
A hose filled with water could
be utilized as a level.

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:37.460

00:06:37.494 --> 00:06:39.632
- So smart!
AKIRA: I see now.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:41.970
You're right!
I thought it was level at first,

00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:43.908
but it was totally off!

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:46.045
MASARU: And if you place
your nails and bolts in

00:06:46.078 --> 00:06:47.181
the right spots,

00:06:47.214 --> 00:06:48.917
they won't damage the tree!

00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:50.855
both: Whoa, amazing!

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:54.294
- Leave five centimeters between
the boards so fallen leaves

00:06:54.328 --> 00:06:56.499
don't get stuck!
both: Amazing!

00:06:56.533 --> 00:06:57.702
MASARU: The thing is,

00:06:57.736 --> 00:06:59.305
tree houses
are built differently

00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:00.608
from tree to tree.

00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:03.079
The tree itself
will tell you how to build it

00:07:03.112 --> 00:07:05.585
and what kind
of house it'll end up being.

00:07:05.618 --> 00:07:07.555
If you're not sure of something,

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:10.160
then just ask the forest.
- The forest?

00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:12.865
- [chuckles]
That's right!

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.671
The foundation of a tree house
is the tree itself.

00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:19.345
If the host tree dies,
the house is done for.

00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:20.815
MASARU: When you think
of a tree,

00:07:20.848 --> 00:07:23.754
think about the other trees
and the earth surrounding it.

00:07:23.788 --> 00:07:25.625
Once you start doing that,

00:07:25.658 --> 00:07:28.764
you'll soon become mindful
of the entire forest.

00:07:28.797 --> 00:07:32.571
And that, boys, is how you hear
the voice of the forest.

<i>When you think of a tree,</i>

<i>think about the other trees

<i>By doing that,</i>

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.116
<i>you'll become mindful

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.623
<i>And that's how you'll hear
the voice of the forest, huh?</i>

00:08:01.396 --> 00:08:06.205

Ever since I was a little kid

00:08:30.888 --> 00:08:32.758
I've always dreamed
about building a tree house.

That's great to hear!

was just a kid.

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:42.511
