no virus in history
has ever spread this rapidly.

- Hold on, are you saying
this started as a virus?

00:10:54.174 --> 00:10:57.347
- The zombies' aggression
is caused by hormonal changes

that affect the brain
which means it's very likely

00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:03.392
that the reason behind
this whole ordeal is a virus,

00:11:03.426 --> 00:11:07.234
in which case analyzing data
of the outbreak can help us

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:10.039
work out a possible
countermeasure for it,

among other potential solutions
that could be waiting out there.

00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:16.218
If we can create a vaccine
from the data,

00:11:16.252 --> 00:11:18.857
theoretically we can
counter any virus that's causing

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.895
this outbreak
and bring society back.

00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:23.432
The world isn't done.
There's still hope.
