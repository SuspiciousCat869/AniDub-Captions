AKIRA: Kencho, Shizuka,

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:06.379
have either of you heard
of mindfulness?

00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:08.685
- Immersing yourself in
the present

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:11.891
and freeing yourself from both
the past and future, right?

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:14.128
We covered that
in corporate seminars.

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:17.234
- That's right,
and moving forward,

00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:20.609
I'm aspiring to maintain
that mindset whenever I can.

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:25.250
- Okay, listen, Akira.
No offense, but...

00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:28.022
I don't think you need
to worry about maintaining

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:30.661
your mindfulness
or whatever it is you call it.

I've already crossed

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:42.318
At this rate I might be
able to finish it within one

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:46.092
- I feel like you might
get eaten by a zombie if you do.

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:47.830
- How much longer
till we're there?

00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:49.600
- I'd say about an hour!

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:51.870
- That's only
if nothing else happens.

00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:55.277
Just look how long it took
for us to get here from Tokyo.

a fan of Japan, Beatrix?

- Well, that explains the armor.

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:26.199

it's not a bad

- It may seem strange,

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:39.024
but I have reasons
to see this fish delivered.

00:04:39.058 --> 00:04:42.131
However, I can't anymore.

Seems that you
are all brave samurai.

May I request your aid?

00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:49.478
Though it may not be
your destination,

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:52.552
would you mind helping me
deliver this fish to Takasaki?

00:04:52.585 --> 00:04:53.788
- Huh?

00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:56.860
- I suppose we could stop by
Takasaki City.

- If she's transporting all
these fish to survivors

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:01.402
then we should help,
don't you think?

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:04.008

with going near a city.

00:05:05.343 --> 00:05:07.949
- Why are you transporting fish?

00:05:07.982 --> 00:05:10.454
- Ever since I was exposed
to Nippon's culture

00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:12.024
on TV as a child,

00:05:12.057 --> 00:05:13.727
I've dreamed of coming here

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:16.165

I've once dreamed of visiting

was gone forever.

00:05:29.124 --> 00:05:32.765
But after admiring
Nippon's culture for so long,

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.972
I just had to see it
and experience it for myself,

00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:38.409

00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:48.697
if I could deliver fish,

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:50.568

of us our very lives!

I'm just bad at romance.
