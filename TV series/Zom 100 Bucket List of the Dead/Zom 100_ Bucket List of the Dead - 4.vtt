REIKA: Heads up.
[both stammering]

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:56.303
While we're at it,

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:57.838
wanna help me look
for some snacks?

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.873
- Oh, sure.
KENCHO: Uh, yeah!

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:02.475
I'll help, too.
AKIRA: Huh?

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:05.145
MAKI: I'm surprised
this place hasn't been trashed.

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:07.414
YUKARI: Uh, I think
I found some ham!

00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:08.783
REIKA: Good find!
KENCHO: Oh, nice!

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:10.117
[grunts]

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.987
MAKI: So, uh, should we
introduce ourselves

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.454
or what?

00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:15.256

00:09:15.289 --> 00:09:16.523

00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:44.184
- Name's Reika.
- And I'm Maki.

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:45.686

Oh, the two of us

00:09:54.862 --> 00:09:56.363
How 'bout you three?

00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:58.699
You guys seem like friends.
Are you coworkers?

00:09:58.732 --> 00:10:00.000
- Pretty much.

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:02.335
Our last flight was returning
from LAX.

00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:04.805
REIKA: When we arrived in Japan,
this happened.

00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:06.573
[both gasping]

00:10:06.607 --> 00:10:09.844

are actually...

- [exhales]

00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:13.013
Yeah, we're flight attendants.

- Would you like beef
or chicken?

00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:26.827
- Good morning,
all passengers.

00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:29.430
<i>- No way! We're...</i>

Thank you for having us!

<i>Both: Wining and dining!</i>

00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:48.215
- Gimmie a break.

00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:50.317
Can we do something about
that noise?

00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:51.619
[groaning]

00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:53.286
I need more booze.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.224
<i>- Wh--what should I do?</i>

00:10:57.257 --> 00:11:00.995
<i>This is my chance to wine

00:11:01.028 --> 00:11:03.530

00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:07.535

in college was rugby,</i>

at work was work!</i>

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:13.607

in this kind of situation!</i>

00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:16.476
<i>Ah! Focus!</i>

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.846
<i>I need to bring up a topic!
Something, anything!</i>

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:20.780
<i>Just do it!</i>

[grunts]

00:11:25.119 --> 00:11:26.820
So, uh--
- [gasps]

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.655
- Yukari, right?
[chuckles nervously]

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.325
You don't happen to have
a boyfriend, do you?

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:32.392
- Seriously?

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:35.395
Are you really asking me
that question right now?

00:11:35.429 --> 00:11:36.430
<i>- She's right!</i>

00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:38.732
<i>This is the worst time
to ask that!</i>

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:40.601
<i>I totally blew my chance!</i>

00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:43.570
<i>There's gotta be a way for me
to turn this around!</i>

00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:46.006
<i>I know!
Kencho can be my wing man!</i>

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.041
KENCHO: Your nails
look fantastic!

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:50.377
How often does
a lady like you get a manicure?

00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:52.679
- I get them done once
a week back home in Hakata.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.281
- You gotta be kidding me.
You're from Hakata, too?

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:55.416
<i>- Don't go
solo on me now!</i>

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:58.151
<i>And he's even making
physical contact!</i>

00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:01.055
<i>Talking about their hometown
brought them even closer?</i>

00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:03.491
They're in a world of their own
<i>at this point!</i>

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:07.127
<i>Ah, I wish I had Kencho's
good looks,</i>

00:12:07.161 --> 00:12:08.695
<i>or even half of
his charisma!</i>

00:12:09.663 --> 00:12:11.498

<i>- [shouts]</i>

00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:19.240
- It's no wonder you can't get
a date, then.

00:12:19.273 --> 00:12:21.042
- Just you watch!
I'll get a girlfriend!

00:12:21.075 --> 00:12:22.476
<i>Good, 'cause you're gonna see
it today!</i>

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:25.779
<i>I--I can't let
it end up like this!</i>

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:28.615
After all, I wanna get cozy with
<i>a flight attendant, too!</i>

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:29.650
both: Huh?

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:31.151
I'd rather be eaten by a zombie

00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:33.053
than let this chance pass me by!

<i>If I'm goin' down,

My name is Akira Tendo,

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:39.293
and I held a job
for three years

00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:41.461
at a very
exploitative corporation!

00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:45.398
Behold my resolve as I snort
this tequila in one go!

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:47.501
[gagging]

00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:49.002

the way to show that, bud.

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:52.540

- [gagging]

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:03.984

Yeah!

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.393
A strainer, a strainer!
Ooh, another strainer!

[groans]

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.675
Maybe slamming
that tequila wasn't

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:30.110
the best idea.

00:13:30.144 --> 00:13:32.880
I failed but as your friend,
Kencho,

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:34.881
I hope you score with Maki.

00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:38.218

00:13:42.356 --> 00:13:44.625
Hmm?
- Are you all right?

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:45.859
I was worried.

00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:47.327
[chuckles]

[all groaning]

REIKA: Just shut up already!

00:14:15.322 --> 00:14:19.126
Anyway, the airline industry's
nothing but a shadow

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:21.662
of its glory days.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.432
Thanks to the price war,
our pay doesn't increase.

00:14:24.465 --> 00:14:26.367
The only thing that does
is our work hours

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.535
and 'cause of that
my back's always aching!

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:31.138
And don't get me started on

My elite status

you asked earlier,
