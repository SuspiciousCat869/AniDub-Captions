The amount, in terms of fleets,

Well, from what I understand,

their parents are the ones who
teach them to read and write.

This is not a practice drill.

[LAFIEL] I've been ordered
to take you to the bridge.

166
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,250
Can you join me?

167
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,125
[JINTO]
What in the world is going on?

168
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,541
Just what you heard.

I don't know any more
than what was announced.

170

It seems you've
happened to join us

171
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,833
just as a war is breaking out.

172
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,875
How fortunate.

173
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,375
[JINTO] Life is filled
with such unexpected,

174
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,166
fortunate occurrences.

175
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,583
It's when you're the happiest

00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,416
that you should worry
about hitting a wall.

177

[JINTO] If possible,
I hope it's all over

before my appointment.

179
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,458
[LAFIEL]
That is not likely.

180
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,833
We prefer not to end a war
before there's a clear victor,

181
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,041
and in this case,

182
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,708
the enemy appears to
be the United Mankind.

183
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,041
It's unclear if it'll
be over before I die.

184
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,041
I hope you mean a natural death.

Yes, 200 or 250 years.

I have brought His Excellency

Sorry for the inconvenience,
Your Excellency.

Pilot trainee Abriel,
please stay here

00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,250
while I speak with
His Excellency.

Yes.

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,875
Your Excellency.

196
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,708
I'm sorry I cannot
offer you a seat.

197
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:35,833
[JINTO]
Huh?

198
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,583
Oh, it's quite all right.

199
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,833
I'll just remain
standing, thanks.

200
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,250
I'm sure you understand

201
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,000
what is happening
from the announcement.

202
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,958
Right. We're likely
headed for battle.

203
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,458
We have a 37% chance
of winning this battle.

204
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,666
That's assuming that the enemy
is fighting with their best,

205
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,833
but even if they were sending

206
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,666
a bunch of rookies
on outdated vessels,

207
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,958
our chances of winning
still won't reach 50%.

208
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,875
It's bad, isn't it?

209
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,416
Right. The best option
now would be to escape.

210
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,416
But, unfortunately, our
circumstances won't allow it.

211
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,708
Therefore, I must have you
disembark, Your Excellency.

212
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,833
[JINTO]
I understand.

This ship is equipped

with a communications

00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,583
Although it's small,

216
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,541
it has the ability to
travel in Plane Space.

217

Please go to Sufugnoff
ahead of us.

218
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,083
You'll need to refuel
once along the way,

219
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,333
but you should be
able to get there

220

before those space-time shots.

221
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,750
You can catch another ship
once you're in Sufugnoff.

222
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,000
There is a communications
fleet base there,

223
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,958
so you shouldn't have to
rely on luck to find a ship.

You've completed the course
to captain a vessel.

You'll automatically
receive your license

once we've completed
this journey.

You are qualified, trainee.

I'd rather remain on this ship.

I will not debate
this with a trainee.

You don't serve for any battle

You're nothing but

But I gave you an order.

00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,875
An extremely important order
to take the Count Prince,

252

who is a non-combatant,
away from the battlefield.

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,791
I've ordered you to
inform the Empire

254
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,708
that we are being approached by
what is likely an enemy fleet.

255
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,833
Evading my orders would
be a prime example

256
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,541
of running away from enemies.

257
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,791
Your ignorance is so great
that you fail to recognize

258

the meaning of running away.

259

If that's your way of thinking,

260
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,666
then Abriels are not worthy
of the Abh allegiance.

If you still wish to talk back,

I'll restrain you on
grounds of disobedience.

263

You can discuss this further
at the ex-emperor's meeting,

And what is that?

I have one other thing
I'd like you to take,

295
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,750

But why in the world would
we need something like this?

303

You can never be too careful.

304
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,625
My hunch is that the objects
heading in this direction

305
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,541
are on their way to attack us.

306
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,458
There's no other reason
why they'd allocate

307
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,791
all that military
power to stop us.

308
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,291
I have this gut feeling that
they're simply acting on

309
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,500
an impulse to destroy,
and these weapons

310
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,041
will help to ensure your safety
once you leave the spaceship.

311
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,833
Which means that this ship may
have surrendered to the enemy

312
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,458
by the time we
arrive in Sufugnoff.

will not be the case, but...

00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,625
Her Royal Highness
escape, right?

317
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:20,333
Then wouldn't a skilled
royal guard be much better?

318
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,208
Oh, no, please don't
misinterpret me.

319
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,916
It's my duty to avoid
battles as much as possible

320
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,208
when I have any
non-combatants aboard.

321
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,958
If a battle cannot be avoided,

322
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,500
I must take measures to ensure
the non-combatant's safety.

323
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,833
This is a responsibility of
all Star Forces leaders.

324
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,708
It is also true that
pilot trainee Abriel

325
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,541
does not serve for any
battle divisions on board.

326
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,833
I'm sure I would've given
her the responsibility

327
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,541
of operating the spacecraft

328
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:52,083
even if she had come from an
unknown family, Your Excellency.

329
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,416
[JINTO]
Hmm...

330
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,375
I'm sorry. That was such
a thoughtless question.

331
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,000
I would be lying if
I said I wasn't glad

332
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,750
about the coincidence
that the Princess

333
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,958
also happened to be
a pilot trainee.

334
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:10,250
You've given this a lot
of thought. Captain?

335
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,791
[LEXSHUE] Although her social
status has no meaning

336
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,958
as a member of the military,

337
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,083
Her Highness could
become Empress.

338
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,333
She may even become a wise
and great Empress.

339
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,000
My ambition is that,
when the day comes,

340
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:27,000
she would reflect on her
days as a pilot trainee

341
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,791
and acknowledge she
was taught well.

342
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:35,500
I cannot possibly allow her
to die before she can bloom.

343
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,791
Yes, of course.

344
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,875
[LEXSHUE] Well, you should
be on your way now.

345
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,666
Please return to your room
and finish packing.

346
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,458
I regret that no one's
available to escort you,

347
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,583
but you do know your way to
the departure deck, don't you?

348
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,708
[JINTO]
I'll be just fine.

349
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,625
Oh, about the flag
of my family crest

350
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,125
you were going to hand me.

351
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,791
I'll leave it behind for now,

352
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,458
but I look forward to
receiving it one day

353
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,958
to commemorate my
time on this ship.

354
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:05,083
Your concern is very much that
of a nobleman, Your Excellency.

355
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,291
Oh, is that so? I'm glad.

356
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,291
[JINTO] Well, Captain,
I shall get going.

357
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,750
[LEXSHUE]
Your Excellency,

358
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:19,000
please, look out for
the Imperial Princess.

359
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,333
[JINTO] I can't imagine a
situation desperate enough

360
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,875
for Her Highness
to depend on me,

361
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:28,750
but should such a time come,
I will do everything I can.

362
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,958
[YUNSERYUA] The communications
spacecraft has left.

363
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,125
The young man and
woman are safely away.

364
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,541
I hope they don't encounter
any obstacles.

365
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,208
[LAIRIA]
I certainly hope not.

366
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,083
They both have quite
unique backgrounds.

367
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,166
I think they'll become quite
important people in the future.

368
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,458
Actually, they already are quite
important people right now.

369
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,791
[LEXSHUE chuckles]

370
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,916
You're right.

371
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,500
Bringing those two
children together

372
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,416
could become my most
significant accomplishment.

373
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,333
And yet, this accomplishment
depends solely on them

374
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,833
reaching the Capital safely
and without incident.

375
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,000
You're awfully worried about
those two, aren't you, Captain?

376
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,750
Is something wrong
with being worried?

377
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,333
Well, no.

378
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,833
The obvious thing is that the
crew and members on this ship

379
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,583
are in greater,
immediate danger.

380
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,291
I do regret having to
criticize my superior,

381
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:25,750
but we haven't got time right
now to worry about others.

382
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,875
It's an amazing discovery
for me to find

383
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,041
that you're actually
feeling regret.

384
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,541
Regret of criticizing
your superior.

385
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,041
Yet, you're absolutely right.

386
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:40,750
Right now I must carry out my
responsibilities toward my crew.

387
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:47,625
[JINTO] I kept thinking...
I've gotta say something.

[JINTO] There are only
two intelligent beings

flying through this
separate space.

One of them is stuck
in a deep depression

391
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:05,041
and the other is giving serious
thought on how to introduce

392
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,083
a brighter atmosphere
to this other space.

Captain!

Captain, we are within

of the unidentified

We'll introduce ourselves,

and request that the ships
identify themselves immediately.

400

[YUNSERYUA]
Yes, captain.

Nothing yet?

Hold on.

We have a response.

This is no correspondence!

This is a challenge signal!

Hey. Say something, Lafiel.

I can't believe I am so useless

at such an important
