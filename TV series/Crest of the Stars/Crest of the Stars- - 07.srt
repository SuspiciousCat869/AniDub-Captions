[NARRATOR speaking in Baronh]

2
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,750
Listen, Baron.

3
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,625
I hope you realize that our
mission is serious and sacred.

4
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:03,875
So, should anything
happen to Jinto,

5
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,666
I will not forgive you.

6
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,166
[WAITRESS 1]
Your Highness.

7
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,500
Her Highness is tired
and needs her rest.

8
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,791
Please show her to her room.

9
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,166
[JINTO]
Hm?

10
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,500
[FORMER BARON]
I see you're awake, young man.

11
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
Who are you?

12
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,041
[FORMER BARON] When you ask
someone for his name,

13
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,583
you should introduce
yourself first.

14
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:21,208
I am called Prince Jinto of
the Count Lin Syun Rock Hyde.

15
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:24,833
You're a count?
I wouldn't have guessed.

16
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:28,291
But you hardly look like an Abh.

17
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,916
Neither do you.

18
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,541
[FORMER BARON]
Well, I'm the former Baron.

Atos-ryua Syun Atos
Febdash Sluf.

20
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,458
So that makes you
the present Baron's--

21
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,541
[FORMER BARON]
Yes, I am his father.

22
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,041
Then what's the big idea--?

23
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,541
[JINTO groans]

24
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,541
Now calm down and
rest, young man.

25
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,041
It seems my son
has done something,

26
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,916
but I don't know what he's done.

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,416
I am not in the mood for jokes!

28
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,166
I'm not kidding you.

29
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,625
[gasps]

30
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,375
Oh, yeah. Lafiel.

31
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,416
Please, tell me, was I brought
to this place alone,

32
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,625
or was there an Abh girl
brought here as well?

33
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,291
I must know!

34
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,833
Was there a girl?

35
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,291
You were the only one I saw.

36
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,541
This girl you're talking
about, young man,

37
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,416
is she your girlfriend?

38
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,083
[JINTO]
My clyuno is missing.

39
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,708
My son is likely the culprit.

40
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:24,500
I have to see your son at once,
so please take me to him!

41
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,583
That would be impossible.

42
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,458
Why impossible?

43
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,000
[FORMER BARON] Because I am
confined here by my son.

44
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,416
[JINTO]
Huh?

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,500
[LAFIEL]
Jinto. Jinto!

46
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,041
[MACHINE 2]
The clyuno you're calling

47
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:44,041
is presently not being worn.

48
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,416
Show me where I'm
located, right now.

49
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,708
And show me the location
of the Baron's room.

50
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,750
Now then, how about
the guest rooms?

51
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,833
Which ones are
presently being used?

52
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,625
Are any of them used
for confinement?

53
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,458
[MACHINE 2] I cannot
understand your question.

54
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,291
Tell me the names
of everyone here,

55
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,750
and also tell me their
respective locations.

56
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,000
[MACHINE 2]
I cannot do that

57
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,000
without the approval
of the master.

58
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,625
Do you wish to get approval?
Please note--

59
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,916
Oh, forget it!

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,833
[gasps]

61
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,541
What about the space harbor?

62
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,000
Is there another possible
route I can take

63
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,958
to get to the moored
communications spacecraft?

64
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,208
[MACHINE 2]
Yes, there is.

65
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,541
And has the route been closed?

66
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,041
[MACHINE 2]
It is not closed,

67
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,416
but you'll need an electric-wave
crest key to get through.

68
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,708
Has my electric-wave
crest been registered?

69
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:41,791
[MACHINE 2]
No, it hasn't.

70
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,875
Can I register it now?

71
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,916
[MACHINE 2]
I cannot do that

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,625
without the approval
of the master.

73
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,333
Do you wish to get an approval?

74
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,791
Please note, however, that the
master is presently resting.

75
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,416
Tell me, whose
crests are registered?

76
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,625
[MACHINE 2]
Our master and every vassal.

77
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,208
The names of the vassals are--

78
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,958
That's enough!

79
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,416
The Baron's father
lives here, am I right?

80
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,083
[MACHINE 2] Yes. The former
Baron resides on this spaceport.

81
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,416
[LAFIEL]
Is the electric-wave crest

82
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,666
of the Baron's
father registered?

83
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,833
[MACHINE 2]
No. It is not registered.

84
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,291
Why is that?

85
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,041
[MACHINE 2]
Orders from the master.

86
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,625
So tell me why the
Baron ordered this.

87
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,666
[MACHINE 2]
I cannot do that

88
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,541
without the approval
of the master.

89
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,250
Do you wish to get an approval?

90
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,458
Please note, however, that...

91
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,125
Just skip that and tell me

92
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,791
where the former
Baron now resides.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,250
I would like meet with
the former Baron.

94
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,250
Please arrange an appointment.

95
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,291
[MACHINE 2]
I cannot do that

96
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,416
without the approval
of the master.

97
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,708
Do you wish to get an approval?

98
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,875
[LAFIEL]
I don't want approval!

99
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,500
Just tell me why should I need
permission from the Baron

100
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,875
just to meet with
the former Baron.

101
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,125
[MACHINE 2]
I do not have an answer.

102
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,541
Naturally.

103
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,875
Tell me, is there anyone else
with the former Baron?

104
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,333
[MACHINE 2]
Yes. One other person.

105
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,208
Tell me his name!

106
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,583
[MACHINE 2] The name
has not been registered.

107
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,916
[LAFIEL] That person's
not a vassal, right?

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,625
[MACHINE 2]
That's correct.

109
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,166
Would I need a valid
electric-wave crest

110
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,166
to get to the residence
of the former Baron?

111
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,958
[MACHINE 2] You will need a
general electric-wave crest key

112
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,625
and the approval of the master.

113
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,083
Do you wish--?

114
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,666
I think I know the rest.

115
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,041
[JINTO]
Confined?

116
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,083
[FORMER BARON]
That's right.

117
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,125
I'm given everything I need,

118
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,583
but I don't have the
freedom to go anywhere.

119
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,041
What other word than
"confine" is there

120
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,833
for the situation
I'm in right now?

121
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,041
[JINTO] But the Baron
is your son, isn't he?

122
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,166
That's precisely why, young man.

123
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,500
He is discontent,
because genetically,

124
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,583
I'm a person from Land.

125
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:52,666
He hides me away so that all
the vassals cannot see me.

126
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,250
Thus he keeps me confined here.

127
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm even more confused.

128
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,583
He's got a severe
inferiority complex.

129
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:05,291
The history of the Baron Febdash
family is still very short.

130
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,666
Only three generations ago,

131
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,666
the family didn't even
have warrior status.

132
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,458
He's always been quite
upset about that fact.

133
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,708
Which, I believe,

134
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,583
was the reason why he
decided to confine me.

135
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:21,666
He can't stand the sight of
his father, a Land person.

136
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,125
Land person?

137
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,500
That sounds a lot
like my problem.

138
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,500
After being locked up
in here for a while,

139
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,250
I kept reflecting on where
I must have gone wrong

140
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,083
in bringing up my son.

141
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,666
I've had lots of time to think.

142
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,875
Oh, I could give you plenty
of advice on raising a child

143
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,000
if you would like.

144
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,166
Maybe later.

145
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,750
But first, I must
get out of here.

146
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,458
Take it easy, young
man--uh, I mean...

147
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,958
Your Excellency
Count Prince, sir.

148
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,500
But I haven't got any time.

149
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,791
[gasps]

150
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,500
[JINTO]
How long was I unconscious?

151
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,291
Well, it's been about five hours

152
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,500
since you were
brought here, sir.

153
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,583
Five hours?

154
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,041
[SEELNAY]
Your Highness!

155
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,291
Your name is Seelnay, correct?

156
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:19,375
Oh! I'm honored beyond
belief, Your Highness!

157
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,625
You remembered the name
of a lowly servant.

158
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,416
Uh, where're you going,
Your Highness?

159
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,416
To the spacecraft.

160
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,458
Oh! Uh...

161
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm terribly sorry, but our
master asks that you stay away

162
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,041
from the communications
spacecraft.

163
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,791
Um... Um.

164
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,541
[SEELNAY]
Wait, please. Your Highness.

165
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,666
Please. Please!

166
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,291
Your Highness?

167
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,291
[SEELNAY yelps]

168
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,333
Your Highness!

169
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,708
Your Highness!

170
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,208
No! You mustn't!

171
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,500
Your Highness!

172
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,833
But our master asks
that you stay away

173
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,458
from the communications
spacecraft.

174
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,500
Why are you hesitating, Klowal?

175
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,916
[FEBDASH]
Your decision is correct.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,833
There is nothing to fear.

177
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:30,416
You even spoke your mind to
a real Abh, the Princess.

178
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
There's no mistake
that the enemy

179
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,583
is the Four Nations Alliance.

180
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,166
Should they come here,

181
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,875
do you think they'd allow this
Baron territory to continue?

182
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,125
No, they wouldn't!

183
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,416
So then, why not negotiate
trading the princess

184
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,958
for the Baron
territory's safety?

185
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,625
At the negotiating table,

186
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,041
I won't refuse to
cooperate with them.

187
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes, I'll convert
this Baron territory

188
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,625
into an important supply base
for the Four Nations Alliance.

189
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,041
Then they won't be able
to push me around.

190
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:11,416
However, what if ties with
the Empire are severed

191
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,666
and the enemies don't come?

192
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,250
Ah, yes. That would be
the best scenario.

193
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,666
I could build a
kingdom of my own!

194
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,125
I can become the sole
ruler of this small world

195
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,750
in both name and substance.

196
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,916
I don't need any more
than 50 vassals.

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,041
I can live on
cultivated meat alone.

198
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes, I can live without
Semryush apple wine if I want.

199
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,916
As long as I can retain
this world that I reign

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,125
as the absolute ruler.

201
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:55,708
[FEBDASH] Also, a Kingdom
does require a successor.

202
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:59,500
The Princess will
birth a successor.

203
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,500
[beeping]

204
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,125
Yes, what is it?

205
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,375
[GRIEDA] This is Grieda
from housekeeping.

206
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,250
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt
you while you're resting,

207
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,416
but we have an intruder in the
communications spacecraft.

208
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,000
What shall we do?

209
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,541
What's that?

210
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,541
Seelnay, listen!

211
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,791
Yes?

212
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,666
I want you to take me
to Jinto this instant.

213
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,541
To Jinto?

214
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,250
Oh, right, your friend.

215
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,291
The Baron has confined him.

216
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,333
Confined? By our master?

217
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,333
You know where the
former Baron is, don't you?

218
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,750
[SEELNAY]
Yes... but... um...

219
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,333
Well, but our master
must approve access

220
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,166
to number three block.

221
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,875
You must take us
there right now.

222
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,541
That's impossible!

223
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,250
Where can I contact him?

224
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,833
From housekeeping,
but they too--

225
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,083
What?

226
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:09,875
Then let's take it over.
You and me both.

227
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,833
Y-Your Highness... and myself?

228
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,541
You've used one before?

229
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,458
It's very easy.

230
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,791
[screams]

231
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,041
We have no time.

232
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,583
[SEELNAY]
B-But...

233
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,916
Listen to me.

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,625
At the same time that
you're the Baron's vassal,

235
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,458
you also belong to the Empire.

236
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:33,875
Is it more important to you
to wash the Baron's back?

237
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,125
Is it more important to
pour the Baron's wine?

238
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:42,791
Or... will you assist our Star
Forces mission together with me?

239
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,541
Well, I...

240
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,041
I'll follow your orders,
Your Highness.

241
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,583
I am grateful to you.

242
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,666
[SEELNAY] Your words are
too kind. Uh! Your Highness!

243
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,666
What's wrong?

244
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,166
I have one little
request for you.

245
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,666
Go ahead.

246
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,666
If I act against my master,

247
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,833
I will not be able
to remain here.

248
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,500
Please include me as one of
your vassals, Your Highness.

249
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,875
But I have no
vassals serving me.

250
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,125
You're joking!

251
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,750
Well, sure.

252
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,583
Many vassals serve the
Clyuve Royal family.

253
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,666
My father hires the vassals,

254
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,833
but I'll put in a good
word about you to him.

255
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,958
Oh my! I am truly honored!

256
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,041
You can do without that.

257
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,416
I don't have to do what,
Your Highness?

258
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,083
[LAFIEL sighs]

259
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:42,875
Hey, hey.

260
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,833
I realize you're in a hurry,

261
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,750
but you must have at least
an hour or two to spare.

262
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,083
How about relaxing for
a while, Your Excellency?

263
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,958
Could you take it easy

264
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,083
with the "Your
Excellency" bit, dear sir?

265
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,875
I'm not too comfortable
with that term.

266
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,666
[FORMER BARON]
Well, it looks like you've got

267
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,750
several problems of
your own, young man.

268
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:10,708
Just the same, a count has
the rank of a feudal lord.

269
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,541
My own mother did pretty well
for someone from the Land,

270
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,583
but straight from
citizen to count?

271
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,208
I don't know if it's your
father or your mother,

272
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,416
but he or she did very well.

273
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,416
It's my father.

274
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,375
You know, my father wasn't
even a citizen of the Empire,

275
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,791
so he certainly
turned a lot of heads.

276
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,500
Could you tell me
more about him?

277
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:40,750
I'm very sorry, but I
really must be-- Hm?

278
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:41,875
Really?

279
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,541
Well, then, I must
respect your wishes.

280
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,666
[JINTO]
There's not one window

281
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,541
where I could get
out from, is there?

282
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,041
Of course there isn't.

283
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,500
Even if there was, this area is
surrounded with tall pastures,

284
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,250
so you won't see anything.

285
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:03,541
In outer space, it's more
practical not to have windows.

286
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,208
[gasps]

287
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,875
[JINTO]
This is awesome.

288
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,208
[FORMER BARON]
Wait a minute.

289
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,750
Where've you been all your life

290
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,208
to be impressed by such
a common device?

291
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,458
[JINTO] It wasn't the
device I was impressed with.

292
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,416
I was moved by this
fascinating scenery.

293
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,208
[FORMER BARON]
Oh, sorry about that.

294
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,375
Is this an example of
Abh illusionary art?

295
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,000
So you know about it, young man.

296
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,583
I truly believe that
nothing of their culture

297
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:40,000
reflects the pride of the
Abh more than this scenery.

298
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,083
One can keep his
dignity to himself.

299
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,083
There's no sense going
around telling everyone.

300
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:50,708
However, that unworthy son...

301
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,333
Rather than become
the highest mountain,

302
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,833
he chooses to avoid the
mountains and dig deep valleys,

303
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,166
satisfying himself
that he's situated

304
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,500
higher than valley pits.

305
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,708
[JINTO]
Uh... Your Excellency?

306
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,083
[FORMER BARON]
Oh, right.

307
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:08,125
You haven't got time for this,
have you, young man?

308
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,500
[JINTO] Are there no
communicators in here?

309
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,083
[FORMER BARON]
Well, there is,

310
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,750
but it's only connected
to housekeeping.

311
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,791
I doubt they'll transfer
you to that girl

312
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,416
you were talking about.

313
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,625
[JINTO] Then how about either
of us acting like we're sick?

314
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,666
[FORMER BARON] Me getting sick
just after you come here?

315
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,333
They'll get awfully suspicious.

316
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,583
[JINTO] Then let's say
that I'm prone to illness.

317
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,125
[FORMER BARON]
Hmm...

318
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,583
I wonder if my son
would even care

319
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,291
whether you were dead or alive.

320
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,083
[JINTO]
Please take me there anyway.

321
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,291
If I can get through...

322
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,166
If she finds out,
maybe she could...

323
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,583
[FORMER BARON]
What confidence you have in her.

324
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,916
She must be a special girl.

325
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,958
[JINTO] She's a...
Princess of the Empire.

326
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,125
[FORMER BARON]
You don't say!

327
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,208
[LAFIEL]
Stay right where you are.

328
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,541
Direct orders from Star Forces.

329
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,583
I demand that you connect
me to the former Baron.

330
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,041
That is strictly prohibited.

331
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,583
[LAFIEL] Forget about the
Baron's orders. Hurry up!

332
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,375
[gasps]

333
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,375
Don't move, Kuhaspia!

334
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,166
How dare you!

335
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,583
[BOTH scream]

336
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,833
Tell me what's
happening, Seelnay.

337
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,041
[SEELNAY]
Look, Alisa!

338
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm a vassal of Her Highness.

339
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,583
[LAFIEL]
Hurry, now!

340
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,166
You're really serious,
aren't you, Your Highness?

341
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,083
Well, I wouldn't
shoot if I weren't.

342
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,500
[GRIEDA]
I understand.

343
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:52,708
[LAFIEL]
Hm?

344
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,291
[door opens]

345
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,166
What seems to be the
problem, Your Highness?

346
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,666
Well, you've come at
the right time, Baron.

347
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,000
You shall cooperate.

348
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,250
Why do you wait to protect me?

349
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:13,000
[VASSALS mumbling]

350
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:17,541
How dare you point your
guns at Her Royal Highness!

351
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:22,166
Seelnay! How dare you betray me!

352
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,500
Citizen Seelnay is
under my protection.

353
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh. Your Highness.

354
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,708
I couldn not be more grateful
to you than I already am!

355
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,125
Your Highness,
you're overreacting.

356
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,041
Have I not welcomed
you with open arms?

357
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,125
[LAFIEL] In that case,
you shall let us go.

358
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,666
You're not allowed.

359
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,375
I will rescue Prince Jinto
with or without your help.

360
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,000
All I have to do is slice
this spaceport apart.

361
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,750
I am a genuine Abh nobleman.

362
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:53,750
I will not submit to threats,
so you can do what you will.

363
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,875
[VASSALS chattering]

364
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,208
Wait. We're sorry. Don't leave.

365
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,833
[VASSALS chattering]

366
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,416
[KUHASPIA]
Hmph.

367
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,208
You always were the
Baron's favorite.

368
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,416
[KUHASPIA]
Hm.

369
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,250
[JINTO]
Huh?

370
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,833
Your Highness,
we're now connected.

371
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,791
Am I talking to the
former Febdash Baron?

372
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,250
[JINTO]
Lafiel?

373
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,666
Oh, it's you! Are you all right?

374
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,958
[JINTO]
Yeah, somehow.

375
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,833
And you, you're okay?

376
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,583
I'm okay.

377
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:41,666
Be careful, Jinto. The Baron
could be on his way there.

378
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,250
[JINTO]
Why? For what?

379
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:48,750
Jinto, sometimes your
naivete is so charming.

380
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,333
I think that he wants you dead.

381
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,208
What-What should I do?

382
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,875
We've got no weapons
around here anywhere.

383
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,875
[LAFIEL]
Is there any way out of there?

384
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,291
Lafiel, I'm at a complete
loss without you around.

385
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,041
[LAFIEL]
I thought so.

386
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:03,958
Not yet?

387
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,625
I'm trying.

388
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:08,958
[ALISA]
Oh...

389
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,833
What is it?

390
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,833
The controls have
been... taken over!

391
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,500
Did you hear that, Jinto?

392
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,625
It would seem that the
Baron simply has no time

393
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,333
to destroy you.

394
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,791
Well, what a shame.

395
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,875
[ALISA] I'm terribly
sorry, Your Highness.

396
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,625
I can't gain access
to number three block.

397
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,750
Try a sketch map.

398
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,000
[ALISA]
Okay.

399
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:37,541
Lafiel?

400
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,041
[LAFIEL]
Jinto!

401
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,500
Can you see the
ceiling from there?

402
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,666
Look straight at its center.

403
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,250
[JINTO]
Why, it's...

404
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,791
It's an exit!

405
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,916
Of course, the pier!

406
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,833
You do have your own
spacecraft, have you not?

407
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,708
[JINTO]
A pier? Way out here?

408
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,375
Long ago, this was an arrival
and departure hall for guests.

409
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,416
They've since gotten
rid of the elevator,

410
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,250
so that exit now opens
directly into space.

411
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,458
[LAFIEL] I'm going to take
our spacecraft there.

412
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,208
We'll depart as soon
as you get there.

413
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,625
[JINTO] The Baron has the
communications spacecraft.

414
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,083
That ship does not
belong to the Baron.

415
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,875
It's an official
Star Forces ship.

416
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,000
I'll be waiting.

417
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,583
[FORMER BARON]
Hmm...

418
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,375
Are you sure you
two aren't in love

419
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,583
with each other
just a little bit?

420
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,000
No. Not at all.

421
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,750
[FORMER BARON] But there
aren't many in the Empire

422
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,875
who can casually call
Her Highness by her name.

423
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,583
Well, uh... let's
say that's just a...

424
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,458
[FORMER BARON]
Uh-huh?

425
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,666
...a feat achieved through
ignorance and very good luck.

426
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,916
Well, that sounds like
a fascinating story.

427
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,375
[FORMER BARON laughing]

428
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:12,416
[JINTO] I still had no idea
that a genuine Princess,

429
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,625
who happened to
drop by this star,

430
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:19,041
was about to trigger a serious
incident, all on her own.

431
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:47,958
[ALISA]
A dispute has been started

432
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,791
on this Baronial spaceport.

433
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,125
[FEBDASH]
Can I really trust you women?

434
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:52,958
Question us?

435
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,208
[FEBDASH]
I-I see.

436
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,250
Yes, you can trust us.

437
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:13,250
[LAFIEL]
Well done, Baron.
