00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,541
Your Highness! Please wait!

3
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,000
Take this with you.

4
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,333
I'm sure His Excellency
will need a weapon, too.

5
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,375
But you will need a
weapon for yourself.

6
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,833
Oh, but I still have the gun

7
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,958
that Kuhaspia left
behind when she left.

8
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,458
All right then.

9
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,125
I have one more
favor to ask of you.

10
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,458
What a terrific honor!
Oh, Your Highness.

11
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,291
I need to speak to Jinto from
the communications spacecraft.

12
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,458
How can I?

13
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,458
[growls]

14
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,416
Can I really trust
any of you girls?

15
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,375
[MUINISHU] Trust? Are you
questioning our loyalty?

16
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,583
[FEBDASH]
Yes.

17
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,166
Yes, you can trust us, Master.

18
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,708
We will protect you, Master.
No matter what the cost.

19
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,416
That's-That's good.

20
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,291
You are my loyal
and true vassals.

21
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,541
Will you stick by me and make
the Princess your enemy?

22
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,916
Yes, we will stick by you,

23
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,166
and we'll make the
Princess our enemy.

24
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,583
[ALISA]
This is housekeeping calling

25
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,375
with a message to all vassals.

26
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:55,416
A dispute has begun on
this Baronial spaceport.

27
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,583
I repeat, a dispute has begun.

28
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:03,250
The reason is that our master,
His Excellency Baron Febdash,

29
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:07,166
has wrongfully kept the Princess
from proceeding on her mission.

30
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,250
The Princess wishes to leave
this territory immediately

31
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,000
with His Excellency
the Count Prince Hyde.

32
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,375
That is why she has
taken drastic action

33
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,916
against the Baron...

Activate the terminal! Now!

00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,500
[ALISA]
So, my dear friends,

44
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,041
let's cooperate
with the Princess.

45
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,041
She has promised to hire
everyone who cooperates

46
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,416
as a vassal of the
Clyuve Royal family...

47
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,791
That's a lie!

48
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,041
Royal families don't accept
vassals that easily!

49
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,500
Muinishu! The terminal!

50
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,000
No luck! I can't connect.

51

You vile, loathsome traitors!

52
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,583
How much more will
you get in my way?

53
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,083
As for you, come with me.

54
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,208
We'll find a terminal.

55
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,000
Muinishu, you wait here
and follow my orders.

56
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,125
Sir, just wait one moment!

57
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,583
There's an intruder
in the ship again!

58
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,000
What?

59
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,708
[LAFIEL]
Jinto.

60
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,041
Jinto!

It is not being worn.

Not yet?

63
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,083
Hmm...

64
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,416
Then I'll refuel first.

65
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,666
[LAFIEL] With these, I can
refuel without any help.

66
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,291
Exactly like in training.

67
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,875
Oh, no! I can't refuel!

68
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,916
[LAFIEL]
Huh?

69
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,583
He just released
and destroyed

70
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:36,416
all of the anti-substance
fuel at once.

71
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,333
Well done, Baron.

72
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,583
[LAFIEL]
After I rescue Jinto...

73
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,458
...I plan to kill you.

74
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,291
You can count on it, Baron.

[SEELNAY]
Your Highness.

Jinto.

81
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,125
Listen to me.

82
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,791
I can't dock the ship,

83
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,333
so I won't be
connecting to the exit.

84
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,833
What do you mean?

85
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,083
[LAFIEL] Well, if you have
pressure-proof space clothes,

86
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,625
there's no problem.

87
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,583
[sighs]

88
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,208
Why did you need even to ask?

89
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,916
No, we have nothing like that.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,166
[LAFIEL] All right, then you'll
have to swim through a vacuum.

91
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,666
When the ship's positioned,

92
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,125
open the exit when
I give the sign.

93
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,666
I'll send down a rope.

94
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,166
Oh, sure, that'll help.

95
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,041
You don't seriously think
this plan of yours will work,

96
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,416
do you, young man?

97
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,208
You will join us though,
won't you?

98
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,916
Even if I say no,
you'll open the exit,

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,791
and I don't intend to wither
and die in this place.

100
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,708
Oh, no, the spacecraft
has slowed down

101
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,583
above the former
Baron's living quarters.

102
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,375
You mean they haven't
given up yet?

103
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,125
We'll leave this place.

104
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,958
You girls will pick up a weapon
and follow me immediately.

105
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,708
I'm sure you know this.

106
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,208
It's above our rank to
receive the Count Prince,

107
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,208
but to also receive Her
Highness the Princess?

108
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,250
My late mother would be
thrilled to hear of this.

109
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,291
[chuckling]

110
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,333
Jinto, all is ready on my side.

111
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,458
[JINTO]
Same here.

112
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,583
[LAFIEL]
Step away from below the exit.

113
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm now shooting the rope down.

114
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,583
Okay.

115
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,875
[LAFIEL] Let me know once you've
grabbed hold of the rope.

116
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,875
I'll pull you up while
there's still air.

117
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,458
I hope so.

118
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,500
Ready?

119
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,458
I am.

120
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,750
Let's go.

121
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,333
Some work other than cleaning

122
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,208
would be delightful
for a change, right?

123
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,000
Turn it!

124
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,833
Right! Lafiel! Pull us up!

Hi, Lafiel.

128
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,541
That looks good on you.

129
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,750
[LAFIEL]
Uh! Jinto!

130
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,375
[JINTO]
Huh?

131
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,208
Jinto. Are you okay?

132
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,750
As you can see.

133
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,000
That's good.

134
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,041
You're a very important
commodity to this pilot.

135
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,458
I would be inconvenienced
if you got hurt.

136
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,333
See?

137
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,416
Well, I guess
that goes to show

138
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,958
exactly how much Her
Highness is in love with me.

139
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,750
The air is getting thin here.

140
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,708
Yeah, you're right.

141
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,250
[FEBDASH]
Blast. I know exactly why, too.

142
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,583
Hey, traitors, you hear me?

143
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,916
[RURUNE]
Shut up!

144
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,875
[SEELNAY] Would you be quiet?
You're being rude.

145
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,583
[GRIEDA]
Yes, Master?

146
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,916
Grieda?

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,500
Well! You've got some
nerve to say "Master."

148
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,291
You betrayed me.

149
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,208
[GRIEDA]
I'm terribly sorry.

150
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,708
[FEBDASH]
Well, that's not important.

151
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,958
Have we lost pressure
in the retirement block?

152
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,416
[GRIEDA]
Yes, exactly that.

153
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,416
[FEBDASH] Have you taken
measures to deal with it?

154
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,125
[GRIEDA] Yes, Master--
I mean, Your Excellency.

155
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,958
We've closed off all
air circulation vents.

156
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,208
[FEBDASH] What about the
garbage disposal vents?

157
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,291
[GRIEDA]
Uh! I forgot about that.

158
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,791
[FEBDASH] We'll all be in
trouble if the air runs out,

159
00:11:58,875 --> 00:11:59,625
won't we?

160
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,916
Take care of it immediately.

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,208
[GRIEDA]
But the garbage disposal vents

162
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,083
can't be closed automatically.

163
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,583
We can't do anything
about it from here.

164
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,125
You idiot!

165
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,000
Why don't you just start by
trying to send out space workers

166
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,833
to the retirement block
to restore the pressure?

167
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,166
If you're going to revolt,

168
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,833
at least think through
the logistics yourselves.

169
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,875
Where the hell are you
keeping your brains anyway?

170
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,333
[GRIEDA] You see, we're in
a state of confusion here.

171
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,500
No excuses!

172
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,000
You girls comb through
all the exits.

173
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,500
If you see Her Highness,

174
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,708
restrain her immediately,
you understand?

175
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,791
What will you be doing, Master?

176
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,833
I'm going outside.

177
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,125
This is a battle!

178
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,833
[SEELNAY] Just badmouth
the Princess one more time,

179
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,041
and I'll show you-- Ouch!

180
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,375
[SEELNAY, RURUNE grunting]

181
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,375
[RURUNE]
Let go of me! You traitor!

182
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,000
[GRIEDA]
Everyone, listen to me!

183
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,458
[BOTH]
What is it, Grieda?

184
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,958
I'm way too busy right now!

185
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,666
[GRIEDA]
We're even busier here!

186
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,875
No more games! And
turn that receiver off!

187
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,458
R-Right.

188
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,750
This is housekeeping.

189
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,916
The entire spaceport
is now depressurizing.

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,958
For right now, do not
use the garbage disposal.

191
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,458
Should you find any open vents
at all, close them immediately.

192
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,625
Depressurizing? No!

193
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,166
That's right.

194
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,041
It seems that Her Highness
opened and forgot to close

195
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,875
the exit on the roof of
the retirement block.

196
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,458
Why don't you face it?

197
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,916
Her precious Highness
simply doesn't care

198
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,208
what happens to us.

199
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,333
This proves it!

200
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,916
[GRIEDA]
Be quiet!

201
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,541
Seelnay.

202
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,708
You have a license for vacuum
operations, don't you?

203
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,958
Yes. It's mandatory.

204
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,333
What do... do you have in mind?

205
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,625
Well, quite obviously
we require you

206
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,875
to close the exit to the block.

207
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,958
[SEELNAY]
But I can't do it alone.

208
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,000
Everybody else, go with Seelnay.

209
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,416
She will be in charge.

210
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,625
But I'm just a simple waitress.

211
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,166
I'm not licensed
for vacuum work.

212
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,958
And I don't want to
work under Seelnay.

213
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,625
Get some specialized
technicians.

214
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,791
Grieda, what authority do you
have to order me to go and--?

215
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,666
Will you be quiet?!

216
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,041
Ugh!

217
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,250
This is no time for
your nonsense!

218
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,041
Hurry up before we all die!

219
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,375
Look, we're not used to this,

220
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,208
so it's going to
take extra time.

221
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,250
Hey, Grieda's right.

222
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,666
Come with me! If you don't
wanna die, that is.

223
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,166
Aren't you coming, too, Grieda?

224
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,958
No, because I'm the head
housekeeper of this area.

225
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,208
And so, I am needed here.

226
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,083
[JINTO] Lafiel, His
Excellency is on our side.

227
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,625
Your Highness.

228
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,291
It seems my unworthy son has
caused you great trouble.

229
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,125
I'd be so thankful if you could
provide some assistance

230
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,000
in teaching him a lesson
for his misbehavior.

231
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,250
I can't, unfortunately.

232
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,833
I'm now on my way
to destroy him.

233
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,750
Ah, but...

234
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,041
Don't you think that's a bit
too extreme, Your Highness?

235
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:08,208
Your son has made it impossible
to complete my mission.

236
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:12,208
He's blown up the fuel-filled
asteroids. All of them!

237
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,541
Jinto and I are stuck here
with no chance of escape.

238
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,958
Yes, that's a problem.

239
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,666
Is that all you feel about
this? Aren't you angry?

240
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,333
Of course I'm angry.

241
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,250
That is not true.

242
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,958
I'm tired, Lafiel.
I'll get mad later.

243
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,083
Jerk.

244
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,333
Now, now, Your Highness, please.

245
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,708
I might be able to do something
about the fuel supply.

246
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,083
But how?

247
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,458
Well, has my son destroyed

248
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,166
the anti-substance
fuel factories, too?

249
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,875
No. As far as I know,
they're untouched.

250
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,250
[FORMER BARON]
In that case,

251
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,875
you can use any fuel we
can find from the factories.

252
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,291
That's true, but the Baron
took over the control room.

253
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,375
Your plan won't work unless
we can override the controls.

254
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,916
The former Baron himself
designed the spaceport, Lafiel.

255
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,041
It'll be easy to override
the analysis crystal.

256
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,166
It'll be easy, will it?

257
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,625
In any case, let's attempt it.

258
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,458
And then, if all
goes as planned,

259
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,833
would you leave my son's life
with me, Your Highness?

260
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,583
The offer is conditional?

261
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,458
Is there a problem with that?

262
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,458
I really need to
discipline him myself

263
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,208
for the trouble he's caused.

264
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,458
All right, then.

265
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,750
However, if the Baron
dares to get in our way,

266
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,541
I deal with him.

267
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,833
We are agreed.

268
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,291
Okay now. Let's start.

269
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,875
[FEBDASH] I see Her
Highness is heading

270
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,416
for the number 11 factory.

271
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,250
[FEBDASH]
Control room, can you hear me?

272
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,375
[MUINISHU]
Yes, this is control room.

273
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,875
[FEBDASH]
Is our remote control connected

274
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,750
with the number 11 factory?

275
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,750
Well, actually, for some reason,

276
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,125
the functions of
the control room

277
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,375
are showing signs of
instability, Your Excellency.

278
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,958
The thing doesn't
react to any inputs.

279
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,916
How was Her Highness
able to pull this off?

280
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,250
[FEBDASH]
Father.

281
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,875
Your Highness. We may have
a small problem here.

282
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,416
What is it?

283
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,666
[FORMER BARON] My son is
patrolling in the <i>Ponyu</i> .

284
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,708
And is this <i>Ponyu</i>
armed with weapons?

285
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,875
Well, is it?

286
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:32,250
Yes, I think this is it.

287
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,041
The Segno 947 built in
the Dugteif shipyard.

288
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,000
It's equipped with
two specially-loaded

289
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,750
40 Lengarf cohesive beam guns.

290
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,833
Do you think that
we can control it?

291
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,125
Can't be done.

292
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,375
He's disconnected the
ship's analysis crystal

293
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,333
from the spaceport's
crystal network.

294
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,125
So, it would seem
that I might be forced

295
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,125
to destroy your son, after all.

296
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,291
I guess it can't be helped.

297
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,875
But I-I thought this spacecraft
was totally unarmed.

298
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,708
Yes, it is unarmed.

299
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,083
Well... uh...

300
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,916
You sure seem pretty confident.

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,875
Confident?

302
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,291
[FORMER BARON chuckles]

303
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,791
[FORMER BARON] This is typical
of how the Abh think.

304
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,208
Let me explain.

305
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,125
It's not as if Her
Highness believes

306
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,000
she can definitely win.

307
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,708
There's just no sense
thinking about

308
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,666
what will happen
after we're killed.

309
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,083
She's merely warning me,
in case we were to survive.

310
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,000
[LAFIEL]
Then, what did you think, Jinto?

311
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,333
Well, I, uh...

312
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,583
[FORMER BARON] His Excellency
misunderstood you.

313
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,083
That Your Highness
disregarded the possibility

314
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,750
that this ship may be destroyed.

315
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,291
Do you really think I'm a fool?

316
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,875
We've got a 10%
chance of winning.

317
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,916
Of course I know all about that.

318
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,333
[JINTO]
But you still choose to fight?

319
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,916
[LAFIEL]
What other choice do we have?

320
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,083
[FORMER BARON]
This is also typical of the Abh.

321
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,375
To fight with a 10% chance
rather than surrender.

322
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:02,958
To the Abh, this is the obvious
choice, without question.

323
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,125
[LAFIEL]
Is there a problem?

324
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,041
Not at all, Your Highness.

325
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,958
Genetics aside,
I am also an Abh.

326
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,958
I certainly know the
moment when I need to fight.

327
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,416
You, Jinto?

328
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,375
[JINTO]
I'm just a commodity, right?

329
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,500
So I don't have an opinion.

330
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:23,083
But thanks for asking for
it just the same, Lafiel.

331
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:29,708
Time to settle this thing once
and for all, Your Highness.

332
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,875
Goodbye, Father.

333
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,083
[LAFIEL]
He's near.

334
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,041
Yes, he is.

335
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,125
We're now within range.

336
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,291
Can you tell?

337
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,666
It's a hunch.

338
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,583
We can't detect light speed
weapons ahead of time,

339
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,125
so now it becomes
a battle of hunches.

340
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,791
[LAFIEL]
He's here!

341
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,291
You're only a young pilot
trainee, Your Highness.

342
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,958
You will not be
able to elude me.

343
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:07,791
[LAFIEL] This is no drill.
Remember, this is no drill.

344
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,541
I've got a split second
to make my move.

345
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:21,333
If I miss it, I don't
get a second chance.

346
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,250
Not yet. He's still too far.

347
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,541
A little more...

348
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,083
A little more...

349
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,125
Okay!

350
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,333
Terminate main engine now!

351
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,791
Decelerate, full power!

352
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,416
[FEBDASH]
What?

353
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,625
What's she thinking?

354
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,833
[LAFIEL]
Yes!

355
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,375
Ignite main engine!

356
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,041
Pathetic!

357
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,666
Try to damage my ship by
propelling ventilation?

358
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,208
Hm?

359
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,833
What's this...?

360
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,916
[yells]

361
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,666
She added...
anti-substance to the fuel.

362
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:24,666
Nicely done, Your Highness.

363
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,833
[LAFIEL]
It's over.

364
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,291
[JINTO]
Did you... kill the Baron?

365
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,000
[LAFIEL]
I killed him.

366
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,750
[LAFIEL] Former Baron,
I'm sorry for your loss.

367
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,875
It's all right.
It was an Abh battle.

368
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:53,583
"Sorry for your loss"?
That's all you can say?

369
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,166
Why're you upset?

370
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,583
[JINTO]
You just killed somebody.

371
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,833
[LAFIEL]
Hm?

372
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,333
If I didn't kill him,
he would've killed us!

373
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,833
I know that, okay! Still--

374
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,750
[FORMER BARON]
That's enough, young man.

375
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,958
There's nothing for you
to be excited about.

376
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,000
You just didn't want
to see Her Highness

377
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,958
kill someone, am I right?

378
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,375
[LAFIEL] Is it true what
the former Baron just said?

379
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,958
Well, yeah, I guess so.

380
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,250
[LAFIEL]
Why is that?

381
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,958
Huh. Well, that's...

382
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,541
[LAFIEL] Just so it's clear,
we were in a battle.

383
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,583
Yeah, I realize that.

384
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,000
[LAFIEL] Is there a problem
with me winning in a battle?

385
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,541
No, not at all.

386
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,416
After all, just think if
we had lost the battle.

387
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,875
[LAFIEL]
Then what is it?

388
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,625
Well, that's hard to answer.

389
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,000
Anyway. Sorry.

390
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:47,291
And thank you. You protected
me, after all, right?

391
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,750
Accepted. You should
be grateful.

392
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,625
And I am. Thanks, Lafiel.

393
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,333
Well, now that
everything is settled,

394
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:01,125
I think I'll go and seize
my rightful territory.

395
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,833
My... pitiful son...

396
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,000
[JINTO]
Huh?

397
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,333
[JINTO]
The former Baron was not crying,

398
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:16,666
but in his words was a
sense of deep sorrow.

399
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:51,250
[MACHINE 5] Let's give
thanks to the United Mankind

400
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:55,750
for liberating us from the rule
of the Humankind Empire Abh.

401
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,166
The reason we entered
this nation, Sufugnoff,

402
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,916
was to retaliate against
the reckless actions

403
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,583
taken by the
Humankind Empire Abh.

404
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:06,041
While we were investigating
the Plane Space

405
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,083
around a newly discovered Sord,

406
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:12,333
a warship of the Empire
suddenly opened fire on us.

407
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:13,958
That's a lie!
