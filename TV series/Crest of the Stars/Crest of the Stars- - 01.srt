00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:19,000
Did I do something wrong?
I apologize, Teal.

161
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,291
Teal, please.

162
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:30,750
[tapping]

163
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,125
[JINTO]
Teal. Can we win against them?

164
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,958
There is no win or lose.
And there will be no war.

165
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,333
[JINTO]
Then did we surrender?

166
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes, that's right! And Rock
has decided to surrender.

167
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,750
No, actually,
your father sold out.

168
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,958
[JINTO]
Sold out? What's that mean?

169
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,041
[TEAL]
Your father, Rock,

170
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,208
made a really foul deal
with the enemy.

171
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,333
[JINTO]
Made a deal?

172
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,708
[TEAL]
Stop repeating me like a parrot!

173
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:10,250
I-I'm real sorry.

174
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,541
[TEAL] Sure, I was also
against starting a war,

175
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,375
but I can't believe he
would make such a deal!

176
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,750
I've lost all respect for him.

177
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,666
Don't cry.

178
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,583
This is not your fault at all.

179
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,458
[JINTO]
What-What's happening?

180
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,250
I don't understand
what's going on.

181
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,083
[TEAL]
Yes. I know.

182
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,666
Rock made a very bad deal.

183
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,708
I told you that before.

184
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,333
There'll be an
announcement in a moment,

185
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,583
then everyone will find out how
your father betrayed us all.

186
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,750
[JINTO]
Betrayed us?

187
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,250
[TEAL]
And you're his son.

188
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,083
That's why you must hide out
in the official residence,

189
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,875
so they won't hunt you
down and beat you.

190
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,208
Someone wants to beat me up?

191
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,625
Either that or throw a bomb
through your window

192
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,291
while you sleep.

193
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,541
[JINTO]
Then what'll happen to Rina?

194
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,708
Everyone knows I'm living
at your house, Teal.

195
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,958
[TEAL] Don't worry,
I've already contacted her.

196
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,291
Rina's an adult,
so she can protect herself.

197
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,333
You mean she's not at home?

198
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,500
That's right.

199
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,083
She was very worried
about you, you know?

200
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,750
And now she's happy that
I'm looking after you.

201
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,041
[JINTO]
I see.

202
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,875
And, um, what's that
mean, "a deal"?

203
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,000
[TEAL]
Don't ask.

204
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,000
Nobody is allowed to find out

205
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,500
until the public
announcement is made.

206
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,791
Not even me?

207
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,250
[TEAL]
So it's started.

208
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,875
Acting like you're
from the upper class.

209
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,333
What do you mean?

210
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:56,000
[TEAL] Just start the holo.
And listen to it closely.

211
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,333
[REPORTER 1] At this time,
the Abh Army has not moved.

212
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,041
There were discussions held
between President Lin

213
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,583
and the invading army.

214
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,958
According to a source,

215
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,083
a decision has been made
to surrender to the Empire.

216
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,583
We hope these rumors
prove to be false.

217
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,666
We have been notified that
an important announcement

218
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,458
will be made at the
President's official residence

219
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,083
at exactly 25 o'clock.

220
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,000
In one minute.

221
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:29,166
[JINTO]
It was a very long one minute.

222
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,083
[WOMAN]
Hmm...

223
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,250
Aww...

224
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:06,375
At this time, we are saddened to
announce our final decision.

225
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,666
Today at 23:52,

226
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,166
our President Lin of
the Hyde solar system

227
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,833
informed the commander-in-chief
of the entire Empire fleet,

228
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,958
Lord Dusanyu,
his decision to give up

229
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,166
governmental independence.

230
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,333
And so therefore, as of today,

231
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:29,458
we are part of the
Humankind Empire Abh.

232
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,333
And there's still more.

233
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,000
[MAN 2] As a compromise,
the President made a request

234
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,333
which would allow our
citizens to make use

235
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,708
of the routes to
other solar systems.

236
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,916
Specifically, the request
was for a governing lord

237
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,083
to be selected
from our citizens.

238
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,500
[REPORTER 2]
Is that at all possible?

239
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,666
[MAN 2] The Abh ruler has agreed
to this on the condition

240
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,958
that he be given
the code to disable

241
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,500
the Space Defense System.

242
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,833
So, it seems the Abhs may
have actually been afraid

243
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:04,416
of our Defense System,
and we lost our one chance.

244
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,166
[REPORTER 3]
So who is our new leader?

245
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,791
[MAN 2] We're not
accepting questions yet.

246
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,166
[REPORTER 4]
Who's our new leader?

247
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,250
[REPORTER 5] Tell us who
our new leader will be!

248
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,458
Who is our new leader? Ha!

249
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,708
Well, I know who,
and so does everybody.

250
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,708
So why not just
come out and tell us?

251
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,166
Go ahead. Tell us the name
of our new leader--right now!

252
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,958
It's not true. It can't be.

253
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,791
All right then.

254
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,708
Yes, it is whom you
have all suspected.

255
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,458
Our solar system will
be led by Rock Lin.

256
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,125
That's right, it's now Rock.

257
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,583
That is the really foul deal
that your father made with them.

258
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,833
He didn't even bother
to consult me.

259
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,541
But then I guess he
has no use for me.

260
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,375
I guess the best I can
do is find his son

261
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,458
and take him to a safe place.

262
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,916
And I always thought
we were good friends.

263
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,916

00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,375
[TEAL]
That's right, where is he?

268
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:07,000
[MAN 2] Well, Rock Lin is
already on their ship,

269
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,958
headed for his official
ennoblement

270
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,875
in the Empire capital.

271
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,583
He fled. That's why
he delayed the news.

272
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,000
So will he come back?

273
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,583
[TEAL]
I'm sure he will.

274
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,458
Surrounded by guards
of the Empire's army.

275
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,416
No, he won't return
even if he could.

276
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,166
The Empire won't give
him noble status.

277
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,458
He's being tricked himself.
Serves him right.

278
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,458
[MAN 2]
I ask that you all--

279
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,416
You should know.

You're next in line
for his position, Jinto.

281

Oh, I really should be speaking
to you with more respect.

You are our Prince after all.

Please forgive me
for my rudeness.

Please, you're not being fair.

to me like this?

I know I'm not
being fair to you.

But I-I just cannot
cope with this.

I can't seem to control
myself. I just... Why this?

Why this?

[JINTO]
When you told Rina to run away,

296
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,791
did you tell her about
my father's deal?

297
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,875
[TEAL] No. Because it was
a secret to the public.

I came to this planet

to go to school and to
learn about the Abhs.

I will now go to the capital
to enter a military school.

However, I still have
never met an Abh.
