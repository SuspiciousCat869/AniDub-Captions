00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,250
[DORIN]
Jinto! Hey! Jinto Lin!

3
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,416
[JINTO]
Huh?

4
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,083
[DORIN chuckles]

5
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,625
Dorin Ku!

6
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,541
Hey!

7
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,583
[BOTH chuckle]

8
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,291
Man, you look well.

9
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,458
Thanks a lot.
Where are the others?

10
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:37,875
I'm here alone, Jinto.
No one else can come.

11
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,291
Yeah?

12
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
[DORIN]
Don't think badly of them.

13
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,875
They're just surprised.

14
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,250
They all know you commuted
to an Abh school,

15
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,791
although nobody
knew your status.

16
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,250
[JINTO]
It's okay.

17
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,916
It's my fault as well,
for keeping it secret.

18
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,500
But would you have let
me hang out with you

19
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,000
if you knew I was a nobleman?

20
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,208
[DORIN] We wouldn't have
let you hang out with us

21
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,416
if we knew what a
lousy player you were.

22
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,916
You what?

23
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,333
[DORIN]
It's a first for everyone.

24
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:26,250
Hey, nobody knows how
to act around noblemen.

25
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,458
Yeah, me neither.

26
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,583
That new outfit looks
really good on you.

27
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,166
Hey, stop kidding.

28
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,625
Here.

29
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,875
[JINTO]
Oh, thanks.

30
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,708
Look.

31
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,625
That lady over there
has the hots for you.

32
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,291
I envy you.

33
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,291
Older gals like you!

34
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,916
[DORIN chuckles]

35
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,750
H-Huh?

36
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:01,041
Man! If only I could have
your face for a single day.

37
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,916
They only stare because I'm
wearing clothes of the Empire.

38
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's like watching
a dog using chopsticks.

39
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,541
[DORIN]
A dog?

40
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,541
No, it's much more than that.

41
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,333
Well, for someone from
the Land, that is.

42
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,250
Guess so.

43
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,291
Hey. I've only ever seen
Abhs on 3-D images.

44
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:30,041
So are they really
as cute as they say?

45
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,250
[JINTO]
I dunno.

46
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,916
I've never seen them
in person myself.

47
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,125
No, he won't return
even if he could.

48
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,916
The Empire won't give
him noble status.

49
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,541
Yes, he's being tricked himself.

50
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,875
And it serves him right!

51
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,541
[JINTO]
I know now how animals feel

52
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,416
when they're taken to a zoo.

53
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,041
I came here in turmoil.

54
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,000
[JINTO] And now that
I can read and write,

55
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,208
I'm off to the capital.

56
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,500
What's that? Not back
to your home planet?

57
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:08,458
No. I'm going to a school
that trains war secretaries.

58
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,916
[DORIN] Are you gonna
become a soldier?

59
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,291
I must.

60
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,750
Ten long years at
the Star Forces,

61
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,875
and then I succeed the title.

62
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:22,083
I guess noblemen have
a really tough life.

63
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,041
[JINTO] The higher your rank,
the greater your obligations.

64
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,291
It makes more sense than
the other way around.

65
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,041
[DORIN] So does that mean
you'll be aboard warships?

66
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:37,166
[JINTO] Yup. In fact, one will
pick me up at 1800 hours.

67
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,958
What? A warship's
gonna come here?

68
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,500
Well, why the heck d'you
think I'm dressed like this?

69
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,250
So, some Abh soldiers
will be here?

70
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,333
Um, I'm not really
sure if he's Abh,

71
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,583
but I do know he is an officer.

72
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,000
I guess it's 1800.

73
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:57,125
Is it? Then I should be
leaving right about now.

74
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,375
Uh, you won't stay a minute
and watch me get escorted away?

75
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,958
No, siree.

76
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,416
I'll just start to pity you,

77
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,041
and then I'll probably
start to cry.

78
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:11,125
Yeah right! You are truly the
cruelest villain of Delktoe.

79
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,750
Oh, what flattery!
Don't make me blush!

80
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,666
Oh, yeah.

81
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,708
So just what is the formal
name you use as a nobleman?

82
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:25,666
Prince Jinto of the
Count Lin Syun Rock Hyde.

83
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,083
I think.

84
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,875
You mean to tell me you don't
even know your own name?

85
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,958
It's just not me yet.

86
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,166
It still sounds like
someone else's name.

87
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,083
Really?

88
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,250
Well, Prince Jinto "something,"

89
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,416
I hope you never forget me,
"Dorin Ku," okay?

90
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
'Cause, it's sure a lot
easier to remember

91
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,625
than "Jinto something."

92
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,250
Hey, I won't forget you.

93
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,125
And you can skip the
"Prince somethings,"

94
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,791
but don't forget the
name "Jinto Lin."

95
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,291
Gotcha.

96
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,958
By the way, Prince Jinto of the
Count Lin Syun Rock Hyde,

97
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,875
here's a farewell present.

98
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,166
Why, this is from...

99
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,291
Memories from planet Delktoe.

100
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,333
Are you leaving now?

101
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,666
[DORIN]
Yeah.

102
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,416
This is mine?

103
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,958
[DORIN] Yeah. Hope you have
a splendid trip in Space.

104
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,375
Would be nice if you
got to travel alone

105
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,291
with a beautiful room attendant.

106
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,666
[JINTO]
Stop it.

107
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,541
I'd rather be with you
than any room attendant.

108
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,875
[DORIN]
Not me.

109
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,666
[JINTO] Hey, I'm admitting
to something important.

110
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,041
[DORIN]
So we'll talk next time.

111
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,208
[JINTO]
Yes. Next time, when I return.

112
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,333
[DORIN] I'll even hire
you at my company.

113
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,083
[JINTO]
Heh. I'm counting on it.

114
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,916
[DORIN] I'll advertise
that our company employs

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,416
a former Empire nobleman.

116
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,750
[JINTO]
I look forward to it.

117
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,291
[DORIN chuckles]

118
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,791
[JINTO]
Heh. Dorin.

119
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,791
[DORIN]
Hm?

120
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,250
[JINTO]
Goodbye.

121
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,583
[DORIN]
Bye.

122
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,041
[JINTO] I continued staring
until he disappeared

123
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,583
beyond the doors.

124
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,625
He never looked back.

Are you Prince Jinto of the

thank you so much.

but I don't know your name.

163
00:11:54,875 --> 00:12:01,541
So I wondered, well, I-I
don't know Abh customs...

164
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:06,208
...but... but I...

165
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,625
Huh?

166
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,500
Lafiel, you shall say.

167
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:16,583
[JINTO] It was... as if she were
declaring a victory in war.

168
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,583
[LAFIEL]
In exchange for that,

169
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,958
I would like it if I could
simply call you Jinto.

170
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,125
Okay?

171
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,541
Uh, sure! Oh, yes, of course.

172
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,750
In fact, I'd rather
you call me that.

173
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,083
[chuckles]

174
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,000
[OLD LADY 1 speaking in Baronh]

175
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, right!

176
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,291
Lady!

177
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,625
Your bag.

178
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,916
Huh?

179
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,333
[OLD LADY 1 speaking in Baronh]

180
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,708
[OLD LADY 1 speaking in Baronh]

181
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,041
Huh?

182
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,791
[JINTO]
Lady.

183
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,708
Jinto.

184
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,500
Come.

185
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,875
[JINTO]
Mh-hm.

186
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,541
[LAFIEL]
Jinto.

187
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,125
[JINTO]
Yes?

188
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,208
[LAFIEL] Back there, I saluted
you and you stepped backward.

189
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,458
What was that for?

190
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,333
Oh, that? It's a...

191
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,583
It's just a greeting
from my planet back home.

192
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,041
[LAFIEL]
Hmm.

193
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:37,125
Very strange. It seemed as
if you had blocked a punch.

194
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,000
Really?

195
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,458
Uh, any custom can look strange

196
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,625
to those who aren't
accustomed to it.

197
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,916
Yes, but, Jinto,
you are an Abh,

198
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,708
so you should learn the ways
of the kin of the stars.

199
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,833
Kin of the stars.

200
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,666
[JINTO] Known as the
product of genetic art,

201
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,041
they generally appear
beautiful and do not age.

202
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:07,291
They have a life-span of over
200 years and blue hair,

203
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,958
and their body is built
for the lifestyle in Space.

204
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,291
From their affinity
with the stars,

205
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:17,916
the "kin of the stars" is a name
they prefer for themselves.

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,500
I was only recognized
as one of them

207
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,750
through a law introduced
by the Empire.

208
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,250
[JINTO gasps]

209
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,875
[JINTO]
So this is the <i>Gosroth</i> ?

210
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,833
Is that supposed to be a joke?

211
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,916
[JINTO] Please don't forget
that I still know very little.

212
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,416
[LAFIEL]
This is the Calicke.

213
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
This spaceship is loaded
onto the <i>Gosroth</i> .

214
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,041
It seats 50 people, although
you're the only passenger today.

215
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,875
[JINTO]
I'm quite honored.

216
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:50,583
Hm?

217
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,583
So, uh, who'll pilot it?

218
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,916
Oh, ah.

219
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,166
Now, will this suit you?

220
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,666
Are you asking if
I like this ship?

221
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,833
If you'll sit up front here--

222
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,666
or if you'd prefer,
you can sit in the back.

223
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,666
Well, uh, are any of the
maids in the back pretty?

224
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:13,500
There aren't any beautiful
maids, but there's a cute pilot.

225
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,416
Then I guess I'll
sit here up front.

226
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,041
Is it really true that you
can monitor the entire ship

227
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,083
just by connecting
with that thing?

228
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,583
Yes.

229
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,958
This chip allows me to feel
exactly what the ship feels.

230
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:42,916
Are you sure that you find
all of this that interesting?

231
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,500
Well, sure!

232
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:48,208
After all, no one on Land has
the ability to see behind them.

233
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,875
Yes, but in my case,
I was born with it.

234
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,791
[JINTO gasps]

235
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,708
[JINTO] C-Can you read
this? At this speed?

236
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,916
[LAFIEL]
No.

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,291
[JINTO] Then what are
you doin' this for?

238
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,750
[LAFIEL] The analysis crystal
is checking the spaceship.

239
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,625
If it detects any
irregularities,

240
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,583
the problem area is displayed.

241
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:12,083
Wow. Huh...

242
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,875
It's strange that you can use
that thing to steer the ship.

243
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,125
What do you mean?

244
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,458
Well, just think.

245
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,875
Operating such a huge ship
with only your fingers,

246
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,125
it seems really absurd.

247
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,375
Do you think there
could be a better way?

248
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,500
Well, uh...

249
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,125
Well, for instance,

250
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,250
what would happen if
you suddenly got the urge

251
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,000
to grab for something?

252
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,458
[LAFIEL]
Grab what?

253
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,875
Nothing in particular. Just...

254
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,208
[LAFIEL] I forget all about my
left hand while I'm operating.

255
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,166
[JINTO]
Hm?

256
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,000
Is that true?

257
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,583
[LAFIEL]
There. We're done.

258
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,541
[JINTO]
Pretty simple, isn't it?

259
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:57,541
Yes. It's all done with this
analysis crystal right here.

260
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,250
[JINTO] Yeah, but what
if it makes a mistake?

261
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,541
Humans make mistakes.

262
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,416
So reassuring, thanks.

263
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,666
You sure do worry too much.

264
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,750
I mean, judging
from your remarks,

265
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,000
there's absolutely
no way our equipment

266
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,875
will break down so fast.

267

Yeah, well, since I don't
have your sensors.

No. We will use our

291

Y'know, I kind of think

292
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,333
an electromagnetic boost
would be rather tough on you.

293

[JINTO]
It's flying.

301
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,000
Of course it's flying.

302
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,125
An Abh child can fly
a ship like this one.

303
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,041
Well, I-I'm sure that's true,

304
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,416
but you seem awfully
young yourself.

305
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,583
Are you saying
that I'm childish?

306
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,041
N-Not at all!

307
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,250
Your age is just difficult
to figure out, that's all.

308
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:44,458
And, well, anyway, it's
kinda rude to ask a girl.

309
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,041
I understand.

310
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,416
Actually, your guess
is quite accurate.

311
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Recently, I turned 16.

312
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:55,625
Sixteen! Huh.
One year less than me.

[beeping]

314
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,708
What's that?

315
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,333
It is now safe for
us to accelerate.

316
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,125
Oh, I see.

317
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,666
[LAFIEL]
Can we accelerate?

318
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,875
[JINTO]
Go ahead.

319
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,416
How long will it take us?

320
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,625
[LAFIEL] Are you sure you can
withstand the acceleration?

321
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,500
I'm a Land person.

322
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,250
I can take it, so don't worry.

323
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,583
We'll get there in
six minutes. Let's go.

324
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:25,041
[JINTO yells]

325
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,166
[JINTO]
What's going on?

326
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,166
[LAFIEL] We're accelerating.
You said you'd be okay.

327
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,791
[JINTO] I-I didn't expect this!
I'm not okay at all!

328
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,958
[LAFIEL]
Shall I slow it down a bit?

329
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,750
[JINTO]
Yes! Please!

330
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,750
How can you stand it?

331
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,541
[LAFIEL] Our ancestors'
ships were not equipped

332
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,791
with gravity control devices,
so to live in high speed--

333
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:51,250
Lafiel! Slow down. Please.

334
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,333
Okay.

335
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,916
Jinto, I've got a
question for you.

336
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,583
Wh-What?

337
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,083
Why is it rude when you
ask a girl what her age is?

338
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,791
[JINTO]
Huh?!

339
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:08,791
[JINTO]
It was a very strange beginning.

340
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,541
The beginning of our journey.

341
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:57,125
[LEXSHUE] I am Captain Lexshue
of this ship, <i>Gosroth</i> .

342
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,125
A-Abriel?

343
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,291
[LAFIEL]
I thought I told you earlier.

344
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,916
[LEXSHUE speaking in Baronh]

345
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,166
Tell me.

346
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,416
Please tell me if I'm
a "daughter of love"?
