00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:18,250
[LAIRIA] Direction: 78 degrees.
Distance: 1,539.17 gedrels.

00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,750
Heading on an 18 degree
course toward Sufugnoff.

5
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,833
We have located
120 space-time orbs,

00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,041
of approximately 90 zezabo.

7
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,166
The amount, in terms of fleets,

8
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,875
would equal the total
output of four vessels.

9

Lairia, do you know which
Sord they entered from?

00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,083
I'm afraid I can only
narrow it down to 47.

[LESHIKURIA]
No.

Not only are they all closed,

Not one.

4.1 light years from Keish gate

The enemy is now

From its volume,
the space-time shots

What do you mean running

You don't serve for any battle

You're nothing but
an extra body here.

But I gave you an order.

47
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,250
An extremely important order
to take the Count Prince--

48
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,250
who is a non-combatant--
away from the battlefield.

49

I've ordered you to
inform the Empire

that we are being approached by
what is likely an enemy fleet.

Evading my orders would
be a prime example

of running away from enemies.

Your ignorance is so great

I guess you'll find roses there

So why is it called
"Nation of Roses"?

94

The man who first explored
the area loved flowers,

95
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,791
so he gave names of
flowers to territories.

Nation of Camellias.

[LAFIEL] There's nothing
special about it.

There's a fixed, yellow star
with seven planets orbiting it.

With a little work,

102
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,333
the second planet could
be made inhabitable.

103
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,833
I thought I'd dedicate my life

104
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,250
once I finished my
duties as a princess.

105
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:06,250
I'd cover all the land to suit
the name "Nation of Roses."
