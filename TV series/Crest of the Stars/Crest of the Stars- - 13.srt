1
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,000
[LAFIEL sighs]

2
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,458
[LAFIEL]
Jinto!

3
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,541
You hurt?

4
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,625
[JINTO] You sure look
awful for a princess.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,166
You should talk. [gasps]

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,500
[ANNOUNCER 2] I repeat.
We are in a state of emergency.

7
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,458
We apologize for
the inconvenience,

8
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,708
but the Guzonyu
Fantasy Park is closing

9
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,375
due to extraordinary
circumstances.

10
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,583
Well, I guess
that we were right.

11
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,833
[JINTO] The cave's connected
to a place like this?

12
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,958
What do they mean by
a "state of emergency"?

13
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,708
Well, if it has nothing to do
with us, then I've got no idea.

14
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,833
In any case, let's hurry.

15
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,500
[PENGUIN]
Please stop where you are.

16
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,500
Please stop where you are.

17
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,875
You did not enter this park
through a proper entrance.

18
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,333
Please stop where you are.

19
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,458
A security officer
will be here to help you.

20
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,666
Get out of the way!

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,041
[BEAVER]
Please stop where you are.

22
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,791
Hey, you're not intelligent
living beings, are you?

23
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,375
[PENGUIN] No we're not, but
don't tell that to the children.

24
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,500
[BEAVER]
It'll break their hearts.

25
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,583
Jinto, we must destroy them.

26
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,208
But I really don't feel
that good about it, you know.

27
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,833
Neither do I, but...

28
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,541
[LAFIEL] They'll catch up
to us unless we do something.

29
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,791
[ANIMALS]
This is a warning!

30
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,833
You have committed
a crime of vandalism.

31
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:51,833
[overlapping chatter]

32
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,666
Your best choice is to leave
before you get damaged.

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,708
Sorry.

34
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,458
[ANIMALS] This is a warning.
You have committed a crime...

35
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:02,041
Look. A true display of cruelty.

36
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,000
Move away from the trespassers!

37
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,208
Cancel security functions!

38
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,291
We must hurry, Inspector.

39
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,625
Get the mechanical animals out
of our way right this minute.

40
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,333
I'd like to, but I'm not able.

41
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,916
Something's obstructing
transmission signals.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,666
So we're limited
to the use of speakers.

43
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,458
[ENTRYUA] I'm sensing you know
more than what you've said.

44
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,583
You're right.

45
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,125
I've been told that
as of 1,200 hours,

46
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,208
open air transmission
will be totally obstructed.

47
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,083
Communication will therefore
be absolutely impossible

48
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,000
during this time,
so we're to continue

49
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,166
with our present orders.

50
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,916
It's imperative
I know the reason

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,916
for obstructing
all transmissions.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,958
I really don't know.

53
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,583
Is that right?

54
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,583
I'll bet the Abhs are back.

55
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,458
[UNDERTAKER] The Abhs
are full of strange customs.

56
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,333
[MARCA] The spaceship
isn't too far away.

57
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,833
[MIN] We can see it
with our own eyes.

58
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,000
[MARCA] No. I'm talking
about our own spaceship.

59
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,041
Let's hurry.

60
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,833
[LAFIEL]
What's that?

61
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,500
[JINTO] It's as if we're
running through a maze.

62
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,416
[JINTO]
Let's ask him!

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,958
[LAFIEL]
Good idea.

64
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,041
Welcome, welcome,
welcome, welcome.

65
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,833
[JINTO] We'd like to
know where the exit is.

66
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,583
[OTTER] The exit!
Oh, you're not leaving already.

67
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,125
The Park is shutting down.
Didn't you know?

68
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,208
Can't be.

69
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,958
This Park is open
24 hours a day...

70
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,625
[JINTO]
But, it's an emergency!

71
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,208
Are you going to tell us or not?

72
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,875
[OTTER]
I guess I'll have to.

73
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,916
[ENTRYUA]
What in the world was that?

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,791
[MANAGER] To the people,
or rather, the trespassers

75
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,791
who bombed the emergency exit.

76
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,958
Please remain quiet
while you're in the Park!

77
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,791
Well, it looks like
your friends are here.

78
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,875
--Are you sure?
--Hey, faster!

79
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,458
I just can't do it, Inspector.

80
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,333
The animals here don't
seem to know anything

81
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,875
regarding the rules of the road.

82
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,333
These roads aren't
made for cars.

83
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,583
We should've been brought
here in a helicopter instead!

84
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,208
Want me to call for backup?

85
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,166
Just forget it!
We haven't got the time!

86
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,708
[KYTE]
Look! Over there!

87
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,750
Oh, no!

88
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,416
Stop! Get 'em!

89
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,000
No, not here!

90
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:12,958
[ENTRYUA]
Stop where you are!

91
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,208
This is the police!

92
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,541
I'll bet there's isn't
single person in this Galaxy

93
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,000
who would stop when told to.

94
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,000
[ENTRYUA]
Get outta your cars!

95
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,666
Officers, prepare to shoot!

96
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,083
After them!

97
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,166
[JINTO]
Sorry. Coming through!

98
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,250
[LAFIEL]
You'll forgive me!

99
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,375
[OWL]
Bad children!

100
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,416
[JINTO]
Sorry!

101
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,041
Can I point something out?

102
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,291
What?

103
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,833
We seem to be heading
back the way we came.

104
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,083
[JINTO]
We've got no choice. Do we?

105
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,583
[JINTO gasps]

106
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,625
Those guys from
the caves are here!

107
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,583
Oh, did you forget?

108
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,875
Well, well. I'm impressed
you're so divinely carefree.

109
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:54,916
[JINTO]
Thanks.

110
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,666
Hey, I thought
you were leaving.

111
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,083
Are you guys back
to buy something now?

112
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,625
[JINTO] Have you got
an aircraft or a spaceship?

113
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,041
[OTTER]
Of course!

114
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,166
Here!

115
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,541
This isn't good!

116
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,958
Lafiel, this way!

117
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,583
[OTTER] Hey, there!
My valuable customers!

118
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,208
[ENTRYUA]
I'm telling you to stop!

119
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,583
[SOLDIER 8]
There they are!

120
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,208
[SOLDIER 8 yells]

121
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,125
Let's go!

122
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,958
He just contacted
the other soldiers.

123
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,708
[JINTO] Hey, you don't
need to convince me.

124
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,083
[ENTRYUA yelling]

125
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,250
What's going on?!

126
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,500
[SOLDIERS yell]

127
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,250
We're withdrawing now!

128
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,375
Not on your life! Never!

129
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,750
[ENTRYUA]
This is a battlefield.

130
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,125
Entering here would be
like some drunken yahoos

131
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,375
jumping into the ring while
two professional boxers

132
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,416
duked it out.

133
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,125
This is no place for cops!

134
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,791
Get moving now!

135
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,166
Let's retreat to our cars!

136
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,541
Inspector!

137
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,708
We can't back down now
when the enemy is right there

138
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,000
in front of our noses!

139
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,166
Hey, if you want
to catch them that bad,

140
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,208
why don't you just go
join your soldier buddies

141
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,833
over there?

142
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,625
Y'know, the biggest
mistake was coming here

143
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,875
in the first place.

144
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,625
[SOLDIERS yell]

145
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,000
Now, Jinto!

146
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,041
Come on!

147
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,208
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

148
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,250
[JINTO]
Get back!

149
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,291
[RABBITS scream]

150
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,416
[JINTO]
No!

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,166
[JINTO]
You okay?

152
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,041
Of course I am.
I'm a kin of the stars, right?

153
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,208
[JINTO]
Then we'll continue.

154
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,250
[LAFIEL]
Whoa!

155
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,625
[JINTO]
Lafiel!

156
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,125
[LAFIEL]
I'm embarrassed to say...

157
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,208
I'm feeling very exhausted.

158
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,333
[JINTO] Hey, the Land's
got double the gravity

159
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,458
you're used to,
and we did run a lot.

160
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,875
[LAFIEL laughs]

161
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,583
[LAFIEL] The Grand Chamberlain
would have a convulsion

162
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,666
if he ever saw me like this.

163
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,791
[JINTO]
Is he strict with manners?

164
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,750
[LAFIEL]
Yes.

165
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,375
He always used to scold me.

166
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,625
But y'know, he probably
wouldn't mind right now,

167
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,250
since I behave properly
whenever the time and place

168
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,291
calls for it.

169
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,541
[JINTO]
Oh, I believe you.

170
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,666
Unfortunately, I guess
I've never been with you

171
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,291
during any of those times or
places that call for manners.

172
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,708
You watch your mouth.

173
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,208
I am always proper.

174
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,666
[JINTO]
Really?

175
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,500
Say anything else and I'll
tear you into little pieces.

176
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,125
That might be a problem.

177
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,375
Y'know, we wouldn't
have a chance

178
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,458
if those guys charged
in right now.

179
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,500
Let's go.

180
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,291
I can carry you on my back
if you want me to, Lafiel.

181
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,375
I'm fine.

182
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,250
[JINTO] I wonder if she would
have obediently put her arm

183
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,208
around my shoulder
back when we first met.

184
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,500
No. She would've told me
to take the logbook

185
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,541
and go on alone...

186
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,166
Huh. I'm happy that
she trusts me.

187
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,833
[HORSE]
Are you tired?

188
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,833
Uh, yes we are.

189
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,166
[HORSE]
You children are awfully heavy.

190
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,750
Are you sure you aren't adults?

191
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,291
No, we're children concerned
about our excess weight.

192
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,166
[HORSE] It's my first time
carrying two kids at once

193
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,083
that are as big as you.

194
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,041
[JINTO]
Sorry.

195
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,416
[HORSE]
I'm okay.

196
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,041
[JINTO] Great. Then can you
go faster? To the exit.

197
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:50,833
[HORSE]
Of course.

[LAFIEL]
They're coming!

[JINTO yells]

203
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,125
Lean back now!

204
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,541
[JINTO]
Go faster!

205
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,625
[LAFIEL]
To the left!

206
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,166
[LAFIEL]
We can't go that way!

207
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,333
[HORSE]
It's a shortcut!

208
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,291
[LAFIEL]
Stay low!

209
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,750
[LAFIEL]
There's no end to this.

210
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,291
[HORSE]
What are they doing?

211
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,208
They make it difficult to run.

212
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,291
[LAFIEL]
Ugh. They're coming.

213
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,375
[JINTO]
They're copying our idea!

214
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,083
[LAFIEL]
I'll leave them to you.

215
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,208
I've got my hands full.

216
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,958
[JINTO]
What do you expect me to do?

217
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,375
[JINTO]
Faster!

218
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,458
[HORSE]
Really?

219
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,125
Sure, but tell me
when it's unsafe.

220
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,541
[JINTO]
Okay!

221
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,375
[SOLDIERS growl]

222
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,750

Here's the last one!

00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,666
[SOLDIER 22 yells]

224
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,208
[SOLDIER 23 yells]

225
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,000
[HORSE] You shouldn't be
throwing garbage on the streets!

226
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,583
[JINTO] Well then, I guess that
makes me a really bad boy.

227
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,791
[HORSE]
There's the exit.

00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,416
You okay?

231
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,083
I'm just not able
to go any further now.

232
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,750
Listen, thank you so much.

233
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,500
[SOLDIER 24 yells]

234
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,291
There'll be more soldiers soon!

235
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,125
Yes, I know.

236
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,250
So please,
do come again, children.

237
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,291
Sorry.

Don't do it!

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,791
[LAFIEL] Why not?
Are you gonna just give up?

247
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,666
[JINTO]
That's right.

248
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,791
Look. They're the local police.

249
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,875
It's better than being
caught by the enemy.

250
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,083
[LAFIEL]
What if they hand us over?

251
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,500
[JINTO] We'll tackle that
problem when we get to it.

252
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,208
If we fight here...

253
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,458
...we're guaranteed to die.

254
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,458
My name is Inspector Entryua

255
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,458
of the Lune Biga City Police.

256
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,250
I'd like to ask you a few
questions regarding a hover-car

257
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,708
that was stolen
about five days ago.

258
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,333
Are you gonna
arrest us or something?

259
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,500
[ENTRYUA]
No. You'll come voluntarily.

260
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,375
Although I should easily
be able to arrest you

261
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,708
on charges of property damage
and unlawful use of weapons.

262
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,458
I claim legitimate
self-defense for my actions.

263
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,458
[ENTRYUA]
That's what I thought,

264
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,250
so I didn't count
all the murders.

265
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,250
However, it would be in your
best interest to come with us.

266
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,791
Besides, at this rate, the
occupying army will destroy you.

267
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Lafiel...

268
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,625
Well I'll trust your
judgement on this.

269
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,041
[ENTRYUA] Great, we won't
need to use unnecessary force

270
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,291
if you cooperate.

271
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,375
You're too easy on them! Ugh!

It's a trick!

00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,416
Wait, let me explain.

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,916
We are not
collaborating with them!

I'm the officer in charge here!

There's no problem as
long as you do as I say!

He's wrong! There is a problem.

279
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,375
We haven't checked
whether or not

280
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,458
they're completely unarmed yet!

281
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,500
How can you trust
them like that?

282
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,291
I promise I have
no more weapons.

283
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,291
In the name of the Abh.

284
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,416
Enough!

285
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,125
If you want me
to really believe you,

286
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,791
take all of your clothes
off and lie on your back.

287
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,000
I will check you
out thoroughly myself.

288
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,166
All right, that's enough
for now, Lieutenant.

289
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,500
[KYTE] Hurry up and
do as I say right now.

290
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,208
You disgusting synthetic beings.

291
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:40,625
You are all a bunch of shameless
creatures with no ethics.

00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,541
That's enough!

00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,083
[KYTE] Inspector, how old
do you think I am?

295
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,083
Let's see...
I'd say about 27, 28.

296
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,375
I'll be celebrating
my 49th year.

297
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,416
What?

298
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,041
But how can you
be older than I am?

299
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,250
[gasps]

300
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,583
You've gone through
genetic reconstruction.

301
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,041
Have you ever
heard about a place

302
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,750
which is called the Silejia
Republic, Inspector?

303
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,041
[ENTRYUA]
No.

304
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,750
[KYTE] It's a nation
that lost in a war

305
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,250
and became part
of the United Mankind.

306
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,708
Genetic reconstruction
was practiced there.

307
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,541
Actually, they were
working on a way

308
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,083
to reverse the aging process.

309
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,458
[ENTRYUA]
So you're the recipient.

310
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,375
[KYTE] My grandfather
received the treatment.

311
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,750
[ENTRYUA] Wha--
That's three generations ago!

312
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,666
[KYTE]
It doesn't matter how long ago.

313
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,083
My birth certificate
classifies me as a Silejia

314
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,000
non-aging citizen.

315
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,333
[ENTRYUA] So, then,
the organization sees you

316
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,916
as an outcast.

317
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,916
Then what is it that
makes you so enthusiastic

318
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,916
about your duties,
if that's the case?

Are you okay, Jinto?

[JINTO]
It's just a scratch.

[MARCA] Daswani,
please treat his injury.

[JINTO] How'd you know we'd
be coming out from there?

357
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,750
[MIN] Well if you had reached
the main stream,

00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,583
it would've been
difficult to find you.

So we surrounded
the Fantasy Park

in case you took that route,
and there you were.

[JINTO] Would've been nice
if you'd come before I was shot.

[UNDERTAKER]
Oh, by the way...

00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,041
Isn't there something
that you'd like to share

365
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,458
with the group?

366
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,625
Like, for instance,
a "thank you.

367
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,208
Or maybe a "thank you."

368
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,416
Or perhaps even a "thank you"?

369
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,083
A million thanks.

370
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,666
But you still plan
to use us as hostages?

371
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,125
It's like I've said.

372
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,958
We want a spaceship
we can call our very own.

373

[JINTO] So... why go
through all this danger?

374
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,666
[MARCA] We realized something
about our hostages

375
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,208
only after we left you.

376
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,541
Just how very valuable you were.

Stupid of me.

00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,708
for the Abh girl there.

380

[LAFIEL]
What is it?

381
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,208
[MARCA] I just wondered
if any Abhs other than

382
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,500
the Imperial family
possessed those ears.

383
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,083
They don't.

384
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,333
Well. I thought so.

385
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,541
Will you honor me by
revealing your name to us,

I brought you here

alone with me?

390
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,375
What, because you
have a crush on me?

391
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:54,083
You're gonna be my navigator
on our road to the madhouse.

393

[KYTE] Once I catch that Abh,
I'll kill you on the spot.

394
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,625
Next, I'll kill the accomplices
that got in the way

395
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,250
of the arrest,
and then that pet youngster

she drags around with her.

has even a speck of emotion,

send you back to space.

477
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,208
[JINTO]
What do you mean?

478
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,083
The Undertaker
is an undertaker.

479
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,375
I'd been wondering

480
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,708
what these were
when I first saw them.

481
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,125
So they're huge graves.

482
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,250
This is a funeral center, kid.

483
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,250
Don't ever call
it a "graveyard."

484
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,666
[JINTO]
Oh. Then what are they?

485
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,416
[UNDERTAKER]
They're coffins.

486
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,875
[JINTO]
Huh? Those are coffins?

487
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,875
[UNDERTAKER]
The graveyard's up there.

488
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,833
Man, it's scary to think
how today's youngsters

489
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,375
lack common knowledge.

490
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,291
[LAFIEL]
It's common Sense, Jinto.

491
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:22,333
Naturally, when someone dies,
the corpse is sent into space.

492
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,375
Wow.

493
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,791
You're not thinking...

494
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,125
Found them!

495
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,541
It says right here they've
located an Abh girl.

496
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,375
[ENTRYUA]
Oh? Have they been caught?

497
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,250
[KYTE]
I'm going to catch them myself!

498
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,250
Hey, head to the
northwest district!

499
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,916
[UNDERTAKER]
Prepare for funeral.

500
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,583
[KYTE]
What is that?

501
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,791
[ENTRYUA]
I wonder...

502
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,416
I'm not too familiar
with this part of town.

503
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,416
Well, we can easily find out.

504
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,041
Yeah. Easily find out.

505
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,916
[KYTE]
The Abhs have nowhere to run.

506
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,666
I'm going to get them!

507
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,958
Marca! They're at our door now.

508
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,958
But don't you worry.
It's only the fire department.

509
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,625
We'll be ready to launch
in under one minute.

510
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,125
What will you people do?

511
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,583
Well, you look like
you're feeling better.

512
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,375
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

513
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,166
We were all born
and raised here.

514
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,750
We won't get caught
by those nitwits.

515
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,666
As for you, hold tight when
you're in the launch tube.

516
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,333
There's enough armor
to cover you.

517
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,833
[JINTO] Thanks, but I don't
know how we can hold tight.

518
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,083
We can't even steer the thing.

519
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,083
[MARCA]
There's one way.

520
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,750
You can pray.

521
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,708
I don't believe it.

522
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,791
Are they serious about using
this crazy method to escape?

523
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,708
Why didn't you
mention before now

524
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,291
about these Clasbul
funeral traditions?

525
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,000
Because you never
bothered to ask.

526
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,916
Where's our backup, soldier?

527
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,583
They've just arrived right now!

528
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:52,583
[KYTE]
How many?

529
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:53,625
[SOLDIER 26]
Five aircraft.

530
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,333
[KYTE]
Only five?!

531
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,750
They're asking us
where they should

532
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,916
land all their planes.

533
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,083
[KYTE] Look for anything
that's preparing to launch!

534
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,666
Attack as soon as they see it!

535
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,750
[KYTE]
As soon as they see it!

536
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,583
[MIN] Hurry!
We launch in 30 seconds!

537
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:09,791
So...

538
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,666
Please don't forget
about that spaceship.

539
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,916
Yes. I give you my word.

540
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,000
[JINTO] I never imagined I'd
experience being a corpse

541
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,458
while I'm still alive.

542
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,791
[LAFIEL]
Does it still hurt?

543
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,083
[JINTO]
It's just a scratch.

544
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,375
[LAFIEL] Oh, it's humiliating to
ride a ship with no exterior

545
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,666
area sensors or guhakes.

546
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,125
[JINTO] This is not
a ship. It's a coffin.

547
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,041
C-O-F-F-I-N.

548
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,500
[LAFIEL]
It's cramped in here.

549
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,708
I suddenly have the urge
to get away from you.

550
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:43,625
[JINTO]
Ouch! Be careful, I'm injured.

551
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,750
[LAFIEL] I thought it
was just a scratch.

552
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:46,791
[JINTO sighs]

553
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,333
[LAFIEL]
Jinto.

554
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,833
[JINTO]
Yeah?

555
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,375
[LAFIEL]
Please forgive me.

556
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,458
[JINTO]
For what?

557
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,958
Hey, Jinto, do you know that...

558
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,291
[JINTO]
Yeah.

559
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,583
The next time that we get
on something like this,

560
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,791
we definitely won't be
talking to each other.

561
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:04,708
[LAFIEL]
You're hopeless.

562
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,416
I've made a big decision.

563
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,958
Care to know what it is?

564
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,375
[LAFIEL]
About what?

565
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,166
I'll stay by your side
right up until the next time.

566
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,166
[KYTE, ENTRYUA]
Whoa! What the--?

567
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,416
What're you fools waiting for?!

568
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,333
Why aren't you shooting?

569
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,958
Ram into it!

570
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,541
Direct your aircraft at it!
Now!

571
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:29,250
Get assistance!
Where's the anti-aircraft unit?

572
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,791
Just shoot down that trouble
soaring through the skies

573
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,166
before it spoils everything!

574
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,583
No!

575
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,791
I won't allow them to get
away with such good luck!

576
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:46,791
[SOLDIER 26]
It's no use.

577
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,458
That trouble soaring
through the skies

578
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:51,000
is now trouble soaring
through heaven.

579
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,458
[ENTRYUA chuckles]

580
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,458
Trouble soaring
through heaven! Ha!

581
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:55,625
Now there's a good one!

582
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,666
[laughing]

583
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,833
[KYTE]
Why?!

584
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,250
Why are they always
the lucky ones...?

585
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,916
God will praise us,
but not grant us luck.

586
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,916
Not even with a sacrifice
of one person!

587
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That's all I'm asking for,
to comfort my soul!

588
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:16,458
[crying] Why is it...

589
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,541
[CREW 10] Senior Officer,
I have an urgent message.

590
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:33,875
[KUFADIS]
Transfer it to me.

591
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:34,958
[CREW 10]
Yes.

592
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,541
[KUFADIS]
Calling headquarters.

593
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,208
[SPOOR]
What is it?

594
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,916
[KUFADIS] A scout ship of the
Lardbyursh has rescued castaways

595
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,541
drifting in orbit.

596
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,125
[SPOOR]
And?

597
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,291
[KUFADIS] The castaways
claim they are Her Majesty

598
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:49,875
Viscountess Paryunu and
His Excellency Count Hyde.

599
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,625
Oh, is that so?

600
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:55,416
You happen to look like that
because you, Count Prince,

601
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,166
dressed Her Majesty
in those silly clothes,

602
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,250
and dyed her hair black?

603
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,666
[laughs]

604
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,375
[JINTO]
Yeah, well, you see...

605
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,541
I, uh... I had no choice.

606
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:08,500
No, no, that's beautiful,
my dear prince.

607
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,166
I heard you were training
to become a supply officer,

608
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,416
and I would absolutely love
it if you served under me.

609
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,416
--[JINTO] Huh?
--Don't worry, Jinto.

610
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,458
She's getting a kick out of
using you to poke fun at me,

611
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:20,375
that's all.

612
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,083
It's her way of amusing herself.

613
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,250
[SPOOR laughs]

614
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:28,375
Anyway, we must first
tend to the prince's injury.

615
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,875
Someone will escort you both.

616
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:33,000
I'd love to hear about
your adventures

617
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,833
after we get you both
fed and clothed.

618
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:37,875
In any case...

619
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,375
I find it truly amazing.

620
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,166
You dare to dress
Her Majesty in that thing,

621
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,875
and you're forgiven
with just a bullet hole.

622
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,291
I'm not the one who shot him!

623
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,083
[JINTO] Finally,
we made it to the Capital.

624
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,125
And it was there that

625
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:55,666
we were informed
of Gosroth's death.

626
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,666
[DUBUS]
Those were wonderful days...

627
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,250
Plakia and I were truly in love.

628
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,666
We'd make use of our
privilege to cause trouble

629
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,333
for each other.

630
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:13,791
[LAFIEL] Privilege?
To cause trouble for each other?

631
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:16,000
[DUBUS]
To be able to cause trouble...

632
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,916
Oh, I'm relieved, my child.

633
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,083
It seems you're still
too young to fall in love.

634
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:24,083
[LAFIEL]
Do you think so? Tell me.

635
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:27,500
Was it your idea to have
me board Plakia's ship?

636
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,791
[DUBUS] It's too far-fetched
to be a coincidence,

637
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,125
don't you think?

638
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:37,125
I wanted her to refine
the jewel I'd brought up.

639
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,208
[LAFIEL]
Tell me one more thing...

640
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,916
Do you know...

641
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,083
Plakia's evaluation of me?

642
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,708
She told me very simply

643
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,625
that she couldn't be more
proud of her own daughter.

644
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,458
Proud of me...?

645
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,125
[LAFIEL crying]

646
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:01,666
[DUBUS] Your ancestors have
built a solid reputation

647
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,458
over the years,
so others would know them

648
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,750
to be heartless and senseless.

649
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,250
What would they
think if they saw

650
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,250
one of the Abriels crying?

651
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:12,916
Those born to the Abriel family
do not have the right to cry.

652
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,083
Don't even let one person know.

653
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:18,250
If you must cry,
do so where you're not seen.

654
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,708
[LAFIEL]
Father, that's not fair.

655
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:22,791
[DUBUS]
What's not fair?

656
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,458
[LAFIEL]
You never taught me how to cry

657
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:27,416
without showing any tears,
like you do.

658
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,458
[crying]

659
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,583
[JINTO]
Later...

660
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,666
I was told that ties
with my home planet

661
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,833
had been completely severed.

662
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:38,500
Strangely, I felt no sadness.

663
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,666
I wonder why?

664
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,541
Perhaps I had already lost
my home planet back then.

665
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:55,583
of the execution of the
former Count Hyde, my father.

666
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:58,166
The Hyde Constellation
had decided to join forces

667
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,250
with the United Mankind
to fight against the Empire,

668
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,666
under the orders of
their new leader, Teal Clint.

669
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:08,750
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

670
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,458
Uh... That cat...

671
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:11,791
[LAFIEL]
His name's Diaho.

672
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,958
He's Zanelia's son.

673
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:15,708
Zanelia is Holia's daughter.

674
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:16,875
Then...

675
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,000
That officially makes
you Diaho's aunt.

676
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,000
Not funny.

677
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,041
[DIAHO meows]

678
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:26,291
Tomorrow you beginclasses at the
Accounting Institution, right?

679
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,625
[JINTO]
Yeah.

680
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,625
I'll be going to school
for the next three years.

681
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:32,791
I'm not looking forward to it.
How about you?

682
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,583
[LAFIEL] No decision yet
as to which ship I'll be on.

683
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:38,416
[JINTO] Oh.
Well, take it easy until then.

684
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,875
Once that's decided,
you'll be living

685
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,458
in the battlefield, right?

686
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:44,375
[LAFIEL]
Right. Three years...

687
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:47,541
And you'll be a
supply officer, right?

688
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,833
[JINTO]
Yeah. If it all goes well.

689
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,541
[LAFIEL] I'll likely be
captain in three years...

690
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,041
Then I may be given my own ship.

691
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,625
It would be an attack ship
or an escort ship,

692
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,875
though I'm hoping
for an attack ship.

693
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,083
Right.

694
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,333
An attack ship
needs a supply officer

695
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,750
to keep accurate
records, you see.

696
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:11,875
And it's customary within
the Star Forces for the captain

697
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:15,000
to have some say in
selecting the ship's crew.

698
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:18,000
Umm, a position
is usually granted

699
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,208
whenever it's agreed upon
by both the captain

700
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:22,125
and prospective crew member.

701
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,625
[JINTO] And so I ask the
future Chief Officer Abriel.

702
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:29,000
Should you come across a Supply
Officer Lin in the future,

703
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:33,375
please invite him
to serve as your secretary.

704
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,791
Well, um...

705
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,458
If you insist, I'll just
have to accept you.

706
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:40,750
It's pretty much a given
that I'm going to be captain

707
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,541
in three years,
so the rest is up to you.

708
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:46,000
Devote your time to your
studies and get that title

709
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,416
of supply officer.

710
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:52,083
Okay. I'll do my best, Lafiel.

711
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay.

712
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,583
See you again at dinner, Jinto.

713
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:57,291
I'll be busy until then.

714
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,958
[JINTO gasps]
Hey! Diaho!

715
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,916
Well, you've got nothing
better to do, correct?

716
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,291
Why not keep him company, huh?

717
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,541
He likes you.

718
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,833
You're fantastic.

719
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,750
[DIAHO meows]

720
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:13,541
[JINTO] Oh, Lafiel.
You're still a lousy liar.

721
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:16,458
But I'm happy I'll be
by your side again...

722
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,916
Even though I'll
start getting old.

723
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,666
'Cause I only have
half your lifespan.

724
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,458
But I will be by your side
as much as possible.

725
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,125
Whether it be the day you
first sit on the jade throne,

726
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,708
or it be the day you
vanish into Plane Space,

727
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,500
I will be by your side.

728
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,041
[JINTO]
Those are my intentions.

729
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,125
And the future I've chosen.

730
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,166
You have some nerve taking my
precious ship away from me--

731
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,833
[UNYUSHU]
As I'm sure you're aware,

732
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:39,000
we happened to lose
many ships in our battle

733
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,833
three years ago.

734
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:44,666
It's taken that long
to reassemble our fleet.

735
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,833
You'll command some ships
while assisting Admiral Trife.

736
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:49,583
You'll start in three days,

737
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:52,083
so please prepare
for your departure.

738
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,416
We'll talk about personnel
for your new headquarters

739
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,791
sometime later.

740
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,541
Congratulations, Captain Spoor.

741
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:59,791
Congratulations?!

742
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,916
Does he truly believe
I was actually hoping

743
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,625
for a promotion or something?

744
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:06,333
Doesn't the guy know
I'm already a duchess?

745
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,875
Would you like to
share with the crew

746
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,541
why you're looking
so delighted,

747
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:10,833
dear Chief of Staff?

748
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:11,875
Ah, nothing.

749
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:14,125
Oh, it's okay
to look delighted.

750
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:17,291
However, you should
also prepare for departure.

751
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,458
Huh? Captain, why?

752
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:21,916
[SPOOR] Because you are
my new Chief of Staff.

753
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,125
What?! But wait just a minute!

754
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,833
You are all promoted!

755
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,291
You're all coming with me!

756
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,916
[CREW chattering]

757
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
This isn't an exciting
space-wars lifestyle at all.

758
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,708
Not the kind I had in mind.

759
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,791
[UNDERTAKER] There's nothing
we can do about it.

760
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,708
[MARCA] I said goodbye to
my dear husband and child

761
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,708
to come to the depths of space,

762
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:43,708
so why should I be stuck with
shipping the Empire's freight?

763
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:45,416
Nothing we can do about it.

764
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,625
And it's not as if we're
allowed any kind of control

765
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,166
over the shipping.

766
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,125
The actual operations
of the spaceship

767
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:52,458
is done by an Abh...

768
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,916
We haven't got much to do
but drink booze all day

769
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,791
and stare at our big,
fat bank accounts.

770
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,958
[UNDERTAKER]
Nothing we can do about it.

771
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:02,333
Come on.

772
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,791
Just remember we're saving
for the upcoming Clasbul

773
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:05,958
independence war.

774
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,666
With the Empire's help.

775
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,333
You know, it's pretty great
if you think about it.

776
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,041
Yeah, it's pretty great.

777
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,916
What's so great about it?

778
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,625
[MIN] Just sit back and
enjoy it until the war's over.

779
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,833
Just sit back
until it's over, huh?

780
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:21,666
In case you don't know,
it's hardly even begun.

781
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,291
[UNDERTAKER]
Nothing we can do about it.

782
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,375
Say something besides
"nothing we can do about it."

783
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,958
Did I ever tell you
about the guy

784
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,750
who decided to jump
into the thorn bush?

785
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:33,208
Oh, yeah. Hundreds of times!

786
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,250
Wow. That was a
really close call.

787
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:44,125
The magnetic density
was dangerously low.

788
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,791
However, the analysis crystal

789
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:48,541
to the remote observation
structure had deteriorated

790
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,416
to the point that it
was reading from--

791
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,833
Y'know, your lies aren't
going to cut it this time.

792
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,583
You've done it again, Seelnay.

793
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:55,875
[SEELNAY]
She saw through it.

794
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:57,625
Why'd you go to the
trouble of repairing

795
00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:59,916
a perfectly fine fuel tank?

796
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,916
[SEELNAY] Well we can charge
more for "checks and repairs"

797
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,250
than we can for just check-ups.

798
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,916
I suppose that's true.

799
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,583
But there's more than
enough work around here

800
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,458
without us doctoring our bills.

801
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,250
And I'm sure the Bureau's
starting to get

802
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,833
a bit suspicious.

803
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,125
It's okay.

804
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:17,291
We have the Clyuve
Royal Family backing us up.

805
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,958
[ALISA] You shouldn't be relying
on the Royal Family so much.

806
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,416
Hey, don't you forget
that I'm the chairperson

807
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,333
of Seelnay and Company.

808
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:26,458
Oh.

809
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,125
So then you can
make it without the help

810
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,625
of Grieda and myself?

811
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,166
No, I can't.

812
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,208
Well, then, I'll pretend we
didn't have this conversation,

813
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,875
and for this job, we'll just
charge for the actual check-up

814
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:36,708
you did.

815
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:37,750
Aww!

816
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:53,666
Captain.

817
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,333
We have just finished
loading all the necessary

818
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:56,583
food and supplies.

819
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:01,208
Hey, the two of us are all
alone in the room now, Jinto.

820
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:02,458
Aren't we?

821
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:05,458
Heh, right.
I really have missed you.

822
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,625
Listen.

823
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,083
I'll let you in on
a really huge secret.

824
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,500
I missed you, too.

825
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,833
Hey, your secret
is safe with me.

826
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:17,166
It's been three years
since I last saw you, Lafiel.

827
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,541
Yet you haven't changed one bit.

828
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,500
[LAFIEL] I certainly hope
I don't look any different

829
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,041
in only three years.

830
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,250
You look older, though.

831
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,916
Ahem, I think you meant
I look more adult.

832
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,125
[LAFIEL chuckles]

833
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,541
I heard that
small chuckle, Captain.

834
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:33,708
I told you, there's only
the two of us here.

835
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,708
Well, we can't act too
friendly with each other

836
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,291
while the crew's
milling about the ship.

837
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:41,166
Yeah. It's bad for their morale.

838
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,125
Just so that we don't slip up,

839
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:45,375
I should make it a habit
of referring to you

840
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:49,916
as Captain or Chief Abriel,
on all occasions.

841
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,041
[LAFIEL]
You want to call me that?

842
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,250
Tell me what you think I want.

843
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,791
[LAFIEL]
In that case...

844
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,666
Lafiel is what you'll call me!

845
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:13,041
