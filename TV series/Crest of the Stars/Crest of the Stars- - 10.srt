1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:35,458
[NARRATOR speaking in Baronh]

2
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:29,000
Things are taking shape
exactly as I'd expected.

3
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,166
Excellency,

4
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,000
we've received a report
on the situation

5
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,166
from patrol ship Adlas.

6
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,833
I see. Show me.

7
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,666
[KAHYUL]
The enemy knows of our presence.

8
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,166
Judging from the ship's output,

9
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,125
we assume they have an
equivalent of three yudhyul.

10
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,250
They're definitely in
counterattack mode.

11
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,041
[TRIFE] So this is the full
force of the enemy?

12
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,208
[KAHYUL]
I assume it is.

13
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,958
Don't give me
assumptions. Just facts.

14
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,541
Unfortunately...

15
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:58,833
We would need more information
to confirm anything.

16
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,750
The Information Bureau
wasn't even able

17
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,625
to pick up on
the enemy's attack,

18
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,875
so it would be impossible
to determine their full force.

19
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,041
[TRIFE]
Hmph!

20
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,958
Information Bureau!

21
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,083
Why, they couldn't find
a fact even if it ran up

22
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,416
and bit them on the ankle!

23
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,666
Aren't you being a bit
harsh on them, Excellency?

24
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,166
[TRIFE]
Oh, you think so, Nastorya?

25
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,250
You've just been transferred
from the Information Bureau,

26
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,416
haven't you?

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,250
I take that back, then.

28
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,291
[NASTORYA gasps]

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,458
We know the workers
at the Information Bureau

30
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,500
are good at protecting
their ankles!

31
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,833
[NASTORYA]
Hm?

32
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,208
I'm sure the people
at the Information Bureau

33
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,083
will be very honored
you feel that way.

34
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,583
Do you think? Heh.
And so they should.

35
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,375
[gasps]

36
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,625
It's me, Lafiel.

37
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,583
Hey, where did you go?

38
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,416
Just searchin' around.

39
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,666
I asked where you went, Jinto...

40
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,500
And not what you were doing.

41
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,916
[JINTO]
Up on the cliff.

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,791
[LAFIEL groans]
You jerk!

43
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,875
Hey, what's wrong?

44
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,875
The enemy is out there!

45
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,958
[JINTO] Don't worry.
There was nobody around.

46
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,291
[LAFIEL] They could be
looking for us from above.

47
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,916
These aren't royal clothes,

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,500
so they'll just think
I'm a local citizen.

49
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,875
Don't count on the
enemy's ignorance.

50
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,041
[JINTO]
Uh... All right.

51
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,541
I'll never act as hastily again.
I promise you.

52
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,833
That's right.

53
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,833
Never leave my side
without telling me first.

54
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,666
But you were
sound asleep, Lafiel.

55
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,708
Oh!

56
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,000
Were you worried
because you woke up

57
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,583
and saw that I wasn't here?

58
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,625
Shut up!

59
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,666
Huh?

60
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,333
Let's see.

61
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,791
Think we should
move on, just in case?

62
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,458
[LAFIEL]
That would be wise.

63
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,458
There's nothing interesting
about this place anyway.

64
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,583
[JINTO]
I think I'll go into town.

65
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,583
[LAFIEL]
Into town?

66
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,958
[JINTO]
Right.

67
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,791
It's better than playing
hide-and-seek in the fields.

68
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,750
[LAFIEL]
But isn't that dangerous?

69
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,333
[JINTO]
It is.

70
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,041
But it's just as
dangerous staying here.

71
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,500
You're the one who said
we should proceed

72
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,833
if we're undecided.

73
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,625
Besides, we can't
get food here, right?

74
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,083
Starving to death in the
fields is probably about

75
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,791
the second least
dignified way to die.

76
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,125
[LAFIEL]
You're right.

77
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,833
[LAFIEL]
Jinto...

78
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:18,833
[JINTO]
Yeah?

79
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,000
You go on ahead
and I'll catch up.

80
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,375
[JINTO]
Huh? But why?

81
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,708
Don't ask.

82
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,000
[JINTO]
Are you tired?

83
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,333
Don't you dare say I'm tired!

84
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,125
Why would you suggest
such a thing?

85
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,166
Well... then
what else could it be?

86
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,083
I told you not to ask.

87
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,208
But wait.

88
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,041
There aren't any signposts here.

89
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,291
If we ever got separated...

90
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,833
Then you shall wait
exactly where you are!

91
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,000
Hey, tell me what's wrong.

92
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,541
Leave me alone.

93
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,666
Lafiel.

94
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,208
I can't leave you
alone in this place.

95
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,458
Whether you like it or not,
right now,

96
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,250
we've gotta help each other...

97
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,250
We've gotta discuss everything

98
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,000
and come up with
solutions together.

99
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,291
Forget it!

100
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,916
You're about as numb
as a frozen block of ice!

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,958
[JINTO]
Huh?

102
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,291
You just wait right here.

103
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,250
And--don't you dare
look this way!

104
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,125
Lafiel!

105
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,000
[JINTO gasps]

106
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,333
[JINTO]
Lafiel.

107
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,458
[LAFIEL]
What is it?

108
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,000
[JINTO]
Are you okay?

109
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,458
[LAFIEL]
Why do you ask?

110
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,041
[JINTO]
Don't your... feet hurt?

111
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,500
[LAFIEL]
They do.

112
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,041
[JINTO]
Aren't you hungry?

113
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,208
[LAFIEL]
Uh-huh.

114
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,041
[JINTO] Watch your step.
There's a hole. Careful.

115
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,500
Right. Ah...

116
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,750
[LAFIEL]
Jinto.

117
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,791
[JINTO]
Yeah?

118
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,500
[LAFIEL]
Be quiet.

119
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,625
[JINTO]
Right.

120
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,416
[JINTO] Come on.
It's your turn, Lafiel!

121
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,458
[LAFIEL]
I'll be right there!

122
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,250
[LAFIEL]
Ah...!

123
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,250
[LAFIEL]
Ow...

124
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,625
[LAFIEL groans]

125
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,000
[JINTO groans]
Whew! Are you okay?

126
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,166
Well, yes, of course I'm okay!

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,791
Hey, don't overdo it, Lafiel.

128
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,583
Who's overdoing it?

129
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,500
So I'm gonna go
into town now, Lafiel.

130
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,375
Are you going alone?

131
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,166
Well, yes.
Of course, I'm going alone.

132
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,541
But why?

133
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,375
Is there a reason why I
can't go with you into town?

134
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,041
We can't go into a town
that's occupied by the enemy

135
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,708
dressed like this, can we?

136
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,750
Besides, you, uh...
stand out too much.

137
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,958
[JINTO]
Uh...

138
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,208
I suddenly realized

139
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,458
that this princess
who set foot on land

140
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,666
for the first time knew
nothing of this world.

141
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,500
[LAFIEL]
He's unlike anyone I've known.

142
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,083
Can I really trust him?

143
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,291
I'll get clothes for you while
I'm scouting out the town.

144
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,041
So wait here and I'll be
back as soon as possible

145
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,208
[JINTO]
She needs to loosen up a little.

146
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,083
Are you going now?

147
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,166
[JINTO] Yeah.
'Cause we should act quickly.

148
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,458
[LAFIEL] You realize we could
be hurrying toward disaster.

149
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,833
[JINTO]
Hm?

150
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,375
[JINTO gasps, yells]

151
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,000
[JINTO]
Ow... that hurt.

152
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,166
Well... here goes...

153
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,041
[JINTO grunts]

154
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,166
I guess I trust him.

155
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,833
[JINTO, LAFIEL] You're the only
one I can trust within a radius

156
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,791
of 100 light-years.

157
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,500
[JINTO grunts]

158
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,500
I wish she'd say something
like that to me just once.

159
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Good evening.

160
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,041
[SOLDIER 1] You there.
Citizen! Stop at once!

161
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,458

162
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,000
What are you doing to me?

163
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,333
Let go of me!

164
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,666
[SOLDIER 1]
That citizen, too!

165
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,708
[SOLDIER 1]
There's nothing to worry about.

166
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,166
No one will get hurt as
long as you cooperate.

167
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,958
[WOMAN 7]
What are you doing?

168
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,333
Listen, 'cause we
won't tell you again.

169
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,375
You must change the color
of your hair at once.

170
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,333
Let go!

171
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,375
[SOLDIER 1] We are from
the public education unit

172
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,333
of the "United Mankind."

173
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,666
If you know of a friend
or family member

174
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,166
dying their hair blue,

175
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,958
advise them to change it to
a color that suits humans.

176
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,125
I repeat...

177
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,750
Forget it!

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,291
[JINTO]
This is convenient.

179
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,666
All you do is spray this
onto your hair. See?

180
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,708
I'm not doing it!

181
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,375
Don't you like black?

182
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,458
I was sure that you'd prefer
it over red or blonde.

183
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,208
It's not that it's black.

184
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,583
I like my hair the color it is!

185
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,083
It's nice, isn't it?

186
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,875
It's not too dark,
not too light.

187
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,666
Mm-hm. I think it's looks great.

188
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,416
However, people who dye their
hair blue are being arrested.

189
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,166
I have never dyed my hair!

190
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,500
Something tells me
you'd be in greater trouble

191
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,083
if they knew your
hair is not dyed.

192
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,833
It'll only be for a while. 'Kay?

193
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,041
[LAFIEL]
I guess I have no choice.

194
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,958
[JINTO] All this hesitation
coming from someone

195
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,708
who flirts with gene pools.

196
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,416
There is... something else...

197
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,250
Those clothes
sure look good on you.

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,541
[LAFIEL] If so, then why
do you keep laughing?

199
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,125
I'm not laughing.

200
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,083
[LAFIEL] I can't believe
how relaxed you are.

201
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,583
[JINTO]
That goes for you, too.

202
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,916
You slept like a baby.

203
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,041
[LAFIEL]
Shut up. I was exhausted.

204
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,791
[JINTO] Do you think we look
like brother and sister?

205
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,083
[LAFIEL]
Of course I don't.

206
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,208
We're not brother and sister.

207
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,083
[JINTO]
Then we have a problem.

208
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,916
Why?

209
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,875
[JINTO] I thought we'd
go into town as siblings.

210
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,250
[LAFIEL] Why should we have
to make up such a lie?

211
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,625
[JINTO] Well, we can't
possibly tell the truth.

212
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,833
[LAFIEL]
That's a strange thing to say.

213
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:37,000
Only you and I have to know
what our relationship is.

214
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,458
[JINTO]
Well, that's true.

215
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,125
But there may be people
who insist on knowing.

216
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,375
Back in Dirkuto, the cops
would come running

217
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,208
the moment they heard
of a juvenile couple

218
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,875
staying at a hotel.

219
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,416
[LAFIEL] I don't know about you,
but I'm not a juvenile.

220
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,791
I don't consider
myself a juvenile either,

221
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,416
but we are still
juveniles to the cops.

222
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
But this is not Dirkuto.

223
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,916
Do we really need
to be that cautious?

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,541
We should avoid things
that call attention to us.

225
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,208
We need to blend in.

226
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,708
[LAFIEL]
Jinto.

227
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,166
Am I just getting in
your way, by any chance?

228
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,166
[JINTO]
Huh?

229
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,000
What would make you say that?

230
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,291
[LAFIEL] If I weren't here,
you'd have no problem

231
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,291
blending in with
the townspeople.

232
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,208
[JINTO]
Well, that's true.

233
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,041
It's really obvious that
I'm originally from the Land,

234
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,708
so I would have an
easier time blending in.

235
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,708
But, you are an Abh...

236
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,875
Or are you unhappy being an Abh?

237
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,541
I'm not sure.

238
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,750
Sometimes I think it's a burden.

239
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,166
But it doesn't make me unhappy.

240
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,083
If I was asked what I am,

241
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,083
I'd answer that
I was from the Land.

242
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,291
After all, that's where
I was born and raised.

243
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,916
I never realized you
felt that way about our race.

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,791
Don't let me or the Empire
get in your way...

245
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,041
And if you please,

246
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,375
you can give up your
title as Count right now

247
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,833
and say goodbye.

248
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,625
As I've said, I do not want
to become a burden to you.

249
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,458
Are you serious, Lafiel?

250
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,666
I'm serious.

251
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,583
I can get by just fine
without you, Jinto.

252
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,583
No chance!

253
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,708
I don't mind giving up
my title as Count,

254
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,958
but there's no way
I'm leaving you here.

255
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,125
Why not?

256
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,875
Because I wouldn't
be the least bit happy

257
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,083
if that's what I had
to do that to survive!

258
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,791
First you say that you
don't want to be a burden.

259
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,708
And then you say you
can get by fine without me.

260
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,708
That's a contradiction, Lafiel!

261
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,500
How can anyone
who's become a burden

262
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,333
get by on her own, huh?

263
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,708
You were the one who
brought me down here.

264
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,583
If you'd needed me
to fly the ship,

265
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,208
I would have failed.

266
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,375
Therefore, I needed you.

267
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,291
Everyone has strengths
and weaknesses,

268
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,166
and we help each other by
relying on our strengths.

269
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,250
So what's all this nonsense
about being a big burden?

270
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,041
Do you get it, Lafiel?

271
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,791
Am I making any sense to you?

272
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,291
Or is the truth that I've
become a burden to you?

273
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,208
If that's the case,
then so be it.

274
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,833
Go ahead and discard
this worthless commodity.

275
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,041
In any case, I won't be
the one leaving you!

276
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,250
I get your point.

277
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,833
Please forgive me, Jinto.

278
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,375
You are a man of enormous pride.

279
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,958
Hey, look. I'm a guy
who can't even decide

280
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,208
whether he's a
Land person or an Abh,

281
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,916
but I do have a grain
of self-respect.

282
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,291
--Huh?
--Huh?

[MEN chuckle]

284

[ENTRYUA]
What is it this time?

285
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,416
I'm an extremely busy man.

286
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,666
I can't take the occupation
forces throwing me.

Oh... but...

I appreciate your help...

Lieutenant Kyte of the
"United Mankind" Peace Corps.

290
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,750
Meet Inspector Entryua,

291
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,958
the pride of our criminal
investigation division.

292
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,375
Hello, Inspector.

293
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,541
So... how can I help you?

294
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,708
A few hours ago,
some citizens of this town

295
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,750
were assaulted and
had their car stolen.

296
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,833
We have a great
personal interest

297
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,708
in this particular
incident, Inspector.

298
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,916
And why is that?

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
One of the offenders
spoke in Abh.

300
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,333
And was reported to be
as beautiful as an Abh.

301
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,208
[ENTRYUA]
What's the file number?

302
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,000
[IZAN]
04 337 8404.

303
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,583
[ENTRYUA] Why would an
Abh decide to walk on land?

304
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,125
[KYTE] Although speculative,
we think it might have

305
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,041
something to do
with a landing pod

306
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,291
belonging to the Empire Army.

307
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,875
It was discovered not too
far from the crime scene.

308
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,791
[ENTRYUA] So you're saying
that whoever was in the pod

309
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:43,875
stole the car?

310
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,458
[KYTE]
That is a strong possibility.

311
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,875
[ENTRYUA]
Can't we get any concrete facts?

312
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,833
[KYTE] It's certainly
worth looking into.

313
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,875
I'd like to help out
in this investigation.

314
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:57,500
And in return, you will hand
over the two offenders to us.

315
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,083
Hey, hey. Wait a minute.

316
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,333
[IZAN]
Ah, Inspector Entryua...

317
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,666
It's already a done deal, okay?

318
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,208
You have no choice
but to go along with it.

[KYTE] That Abh is accompanied
by a particular citizen

00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,375
of the Empire.

322
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,875
A detestable human being who,
although born a free citizen,

323
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,458
decided to assist
in our oppression.

[JINTO]
Huh?

What's not?

00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,791
You have a sad,
puzzled look on your face...

It's not you.

I like you more with
your comical expressions.

So you think
my face looks comical?

334
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,958
Mm-hm. And it keeps me calm.

335
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,041
[JINTO] I remember dreaming
of a scene just like this one

where I'd be driving
with a girl by my side.

[LAFIEL]
What are those?

00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,208
[JINTO] Wonder if they're
some sort of monument.

something wasn't right...

Then?

Well, let's see.

00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,125
First we'll check with
the hotels and the hostels.

351
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,125
There won't be too many
people travelling

352
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,500
during this period of chaos.

What a great day, Lafiel.

of the truth.

Another declaration
by the Occupying Forces.

00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,208
Is it interesting?

363
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,500
Not at all.

00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,708
But there's nothing else to do.

365
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,750
Your leader accepted Abh rule

366
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,791
as if there was no other
choice to be made at all.

367
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,583
As a true democrat, the leader

oppressive ruling structure.

Oh, can't you tell by

I'm from room service.

From room service?

That's right.

your sheets with fresh ones.

Do you do this
task every morning?

00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,458
[MARCA]
Yes, if the guest desires.

387
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,916
[JINTO]
In that case, it's fine.

388
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,416
Just leave the
sheets at the door,

389
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,416
and we'll just do it ourselves.

390
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,833
It's okay with me, but--

391
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,833
[JINTO]
Oh, and another thing.

392
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,000
I want you to enter
only after you're told

393
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,166
that it's okay to
come inside the room.

394

always do for guests.

Uh... is there... anything else?

Please, sir.

Excuse me for asking,
but are you aware of a "CIF"?

[JINTO]
Um, well, ah...

00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,958
Or perhaps I should use the
more familiar term "gratuity"?

401
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,583
[gasps] Right. I gotcha!

[JINTO]
Whew.

404
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,541
And what was that all about?

00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,791
Hmm... Yeah, really.

406
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,208
[TRIFE]
We can win.

407
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,625
[KAHYUL]
Yes.

408
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,958
However, only if we assume
that the forces before us

409
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,958
belong to the enemy.

410
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,291
I hate a fighting strategy
based on assumptions.

411
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,916
Then do you wish to retreat?

412
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,708
Let's just forget
our personal preferences.

413
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,750
We will take Sufugnoff.

414
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:05,250
Does that include the
elimination of the enemy, too?

415
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,666
I suggest that we go
around and attack them

416
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,000
from the side.

417
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,333
Well. Intriguing alternative.

418
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,791
Huh... well we do
have the Futune.

419
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,541
Then our armored cavalry
could gallop through space...

420
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,125
No, no, that won't do!

421
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,833
Our objective is strictly to
recapture Nation Sufugnoff.

422
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:25,916
[SHURIL]
But sir...

423
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Shut up!

424
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,208
Don't try to tempt me
into it again.

425
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,083
So we'll threaten
the enemy as our ship

426
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,416
proceeds on forward?

427
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,750
Yes. That's right.

428
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,125
We'll display our fighting
power with a broad,

429
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,541
slow formation.

430
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,541
The enemy will surely retreat.

431
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,208
Officers!

432
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,291
We will recapture
Nation Sufugnoff!

433
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,791
Should we go into battle,

434
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,291
I look forward to seeing
a beautiful display

435
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,583

[TRIFE]
Proceed forward!

437
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,750
[JINTO] Suddenly, a roar
was heard from the engines

438
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:20,208
of the Star Forces'
2,000 vessels.

439
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:50,458
It isn't hatred.
I think it's love.

440
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:52,291
Prepare for surround attack!

441
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,958
Odds of destroying mine, 80%.

442
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,333
Odds of mine
entering space-time, 90%.

443
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,875
[LAFIEL]
I don't get it either.

444
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,666
But my father taught me
that every Abh is destined

445
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,791
to carry the responsibility
of the mission

446
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:06,333
on one's shoulders.

447
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,041
And I believe he's right.

448
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,833
Clearly, Abhs are
not human in any way.

449
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:13,208
Then do you then
regret becoming an Abh?
