1
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:28,125
[NARRATOR speaking in Baronh]

2
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
[TRIFE]
What's this?

3
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,291
[KAHYUL]
There's a 99.7% possibility

4
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,041
it's the enemy fleet.

5
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,916
Yes, I'm well
aware of that fact!

6
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,416
But we displayed our fighting
power so they'd retreat.

7
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
[KAHYUL] Yes, perhaps
more than necessary.

8
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,166
[TRIFE] The enemy has no
chance of winning, right?

9
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,208
[KAHYUL] Any rational
commander would have come

10
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,500
to that conclusion.

11
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,625
[TRIFE]
Then why...?

12
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,708
Why do they still
remain in this area?

13
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:01,875
There's a 99.7% possibility?

14
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,541
What's the remaining .3%?

15
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:08,208
Deceptive information,
failure of the sensor device,

16
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,375
an unknown natural phenomenon,

17
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,416
unidentified
intelligent beings...

18
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,166
Okay, okay, I've heard enough.

19
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,791
I was under the
distinct impression

20
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,458
that you wanted a battle.

21
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,375
Look, I prefer not to
fight with so many doubts.

22
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,875
What on earth do you
see as the reason

23
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,333
why they won't leave?

24
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,166
Well, first of all,
there's the possibility

25
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,916
the enemy thinks they can win.

26
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,333
[TRIFE] Win? With this much
difference in military power?

27
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,166
[KAHYUL] The enemy's
warships may be capable

28
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,875
of far more than we estimated.

29
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,916
[TRIFE] We've incorrectly
analyzed their technical skills?

30
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,041
[KAHYUL] You expect more
from a division

31
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,416
that's in charge of
protecting their ankles?

32
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,958
Oh, right!

33
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,291
I forgot the Information Bureau
is good at ankle protection.

34
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,458
[KAHYUL] Actually, I rate
the Information Bureau

35
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,333
somewhat higher than you do.

36
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,583
It's hardly possible the
enemy would be capable

37
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,666
of more than what we expect.

38
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,333
If the enemy thinks
they can win,

39
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,125
perhaps there's a problem
with their leader's

40
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,375
state of mind.

41
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,250
If the enemy
is unpredictable,

42
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,750
that makes things difficult...

43
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,000
There is a second possibility.

44
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,666
Their main force is
the United Mankind.

45
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,916
[TRIFE]
What are you getting at?

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,916
[KAHYUL] Their military
command units are known

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,791
to give out inflexible orders.

48
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,208
They may have been told
to protect Sufugnoff,

49
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,833
even with their
tiny military power.

50
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,375
[TRIFE]
If they were ordered to--

51
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,458
[KAHYUL] In that case,
the rational move would be

52
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,000
to gather all their
forces to this area.

53
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,875
Why, of course, that's it!

54
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, that must be the reason!

55
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,708
Just now, my doubts have
vanished like cosmic dust,

56
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,500
wiping away in my mind all
misgivings of our chances,

57
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,125
and now I feel very confident
of our glorious victory!

58
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,500
Thank you so much, Major Kahyul!

59
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,208
I'm quite honored.

60
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,625
[TRIFE] Now, there's
no reason to hesitate!

61
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,083
Prepare for surround attack!

62
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,416
That wouldn't be wise.

63
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,833
[TRIFE sighs]
And why not?

64
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,583
[KAHYUL]
We're too close to the enemy.

65
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,416
If we spread apart
to surround them,

66
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,916
we'd risk isolating our fleet,
making them vulnerable.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,958
Although we'd still win,
we could incur great losses.

68
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,625
And you, Shuril?

69
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,250
I think he's
absolutely right.

70
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,833
Well, in that case,

71
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,041
we'll just head
straight at them.

72
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,583
I think that would
be a better tactic.

73
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,541
[OFFICER 2] Inspector, the
Condrin group says they're done

74
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,541
with the investigation
and wants to know

75
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,583
where to go next.

76
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,416
[ENTRYUA] I'll check
with the reserve forces.

77
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,583
Standby until you
hear back from me.

78
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,625
[OFFICER 2]
Roger.

79
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,208
[OFFICER 3] Inspector,
I'm with Chief Ramashdi.

80
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,208
We're stuck here at one
of the Occupation Forces'

81
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,291
road blocks.

82
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,916
[ENTRYUA]
Not again!

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,708
Well, this has gotta
be the tenth time!

84
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,833
Why can't they be more
flexible with their policies?

85
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,041
Looks like this call is
definitely for you again.

86
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,708
I'll speak with the officer
in charge from our army.

87
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,833
Yes...

88
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,833
Three more hotels to search.

89
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,916
Where are you, young Abh lady?

90
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,958
[KYTE]
Thank you very much.

91
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,916
[JINTO]
I'll put yours here.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,791
[LAFIEL]
Okay.

93
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:21,000
[NEWSCASTER 1] Their purpose
was to investigate deep space.

94
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,625
They thought organic machinery
would be more suitable

95
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,291
than genuine machinery.

96
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,166
And that's what the Abhs are.

97
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,000
Clearly, Abhs are not
human in any way.

98
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,333
They are nothing more
than organic machinery.

99
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,458
[JINTO]
I should've added more salt.

100
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,375
Listen, all free humans.

101
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,166
We all must place the Abhs
where they belong.

102
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,541
As living machinery
made to serve humanity!

103
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,166
It would also be crucial--

104
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,750
They're full of lies!

105
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,500
[LAFIEL]
What she said is no lie.

106
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,625
[JINTO]
Huh?

107
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,041
It's an actual fact
that our ancestors

108
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,291
were first created
as living machinery...

109
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,708
Did you not know that?

110
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,375
No, I had no idea.

111
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,833
[LAFIEL]
Not surprised.

112
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,458
Well, the Abhs will never
discuss the issue in public.

113
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,500
And you won't find it
written anywhere.

114
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,791
It's told within the family,
from generation to generation.

115
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,041
It's very salty.

116
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,708
Oh. I'm sorry.

117
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,125
Next time I'll try and make
it the way you like it.

118
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,583
[LAFIEL] Our ancestors.
They were sent on an expedition

119
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,416
by their mother space-city
to search throughout space,

120
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,000
but during this journey
they discovered a new resource

121
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,083
we now call Sord Reza.

122
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,625
They then decided that
they would sever all ties

123
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,625
with their mother space-city
and live independently.

124
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,125
I understand.

125
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,166
Let's see... And then,

126
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,291
they quickly arranged
their own military

127
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,916
and they manufactured
their own weaponry,

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,750
so they'd be ready if
disciplinary forces were sent.

129
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,708
[JINTO] But the space-city
didn't have the resources

130
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,000
to send any forces, did they?

131
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,333
Yes, that's right.

132
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,875
But the Abhs ended up
destroying it anyway.

133
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,291
Huh? But why?

134
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,000
I asked my own father
the same question.

135
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,916
My father said
that our ancestors

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,416
were afraid of the space-city.

137
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,375
They were almost crushed
by their own mounting fear.

138
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,375
The shadow of their
mother space-city

139
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:19,166
loomed ever so
powerfully over them.

140
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,500
I don't get it.

141
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,083
[LAFIEL]
I don't get it either.

142
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,333
But my father taught
me that all Abhs

143
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,208
are destined to carry
the guilt on their shoulders

144
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,958
and also to retain the
sense of the mission.

145
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,291
The guilt of destroying
the mother space-city, huh?

146
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,791
And the mission was...?

147
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,500
Protect and convey the culture
of the mother space-city.

148
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,250
Even if they hated it?

149
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,791
It isn't hatred.

150
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,583
It's love.

151
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,333
At least that's what
our ancestors said,

152
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,458
as they watched the remains
scatter through space.

153
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,416
I have to go to bed now.

154
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,250
Yeah.

155
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,333
Hey, Jinto.

156
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,916
What is it?

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,083
So, now do you regret
becoming an Abh?

158
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,250
No, why should I regret it?

159
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,375
Hey, an Abh is what I am.

160
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,125
You told me that yourself.

Good night!

162
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,416
Good night, Lafiel.

163
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,375
There are still some things
I don't understand.

164
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,666
In fact, my mind's filled
with things I don't understand.

165
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,750
Yet...

166
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,583
I've accepted a
new destiny called Abh.

167
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,041
Wh-Why this is...

168
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,125
What's that?

169
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,083
The military police left.

170
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, how delightful, huh?

171
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,666
So I guess they will
no longer need us.

172
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,416
No, no, we'll
inform headquarters

173
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,833
as soon as we find
the offenders.

174
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,083
Then we'll keep
an eye on on them.

175
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,625
So what you're saying is that

176
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,375
we can't make the
arrest ourselves?

177
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,083
[KYTE] No. The military police
will be making the arrest.

178
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,583
[ENTRYUA]
That's ludicrous!

179
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,125
We're told to do all the work,
yet we can only watch

180
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,875
as they move in
on the offenders?

181
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,208
[KYTE] There's a strong
possibility that these Abhs

182
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,750
were on a ship that entered
from Plane Space.

183
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,500
[ENTRYUA]
So what?

184
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,708
[KYTE] Well, it's also likely
they came from the enemy ship

185
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,875
that our forces destroyed
in Plane Space.

186
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,208
If that's the case, they could
have some crucial information.

187
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,666
Some crucial information, huh?

188
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,250
I have no idea.

189
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,708
And I couldn't tell you
even if I did know.

190
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,875
[ENTRYUA chuckles]
Likely not.

191
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,625
But you need to know that
the value of these Abhs

192
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,083
has increased.

193
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,416
If we find them, I'm sure
your personnel department

194
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,291
would look favorably on you.

195
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,208
Ah, I've figured this out.

196
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,750
You don't want our local police
to be the front-page heroes

197
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,250
of this story, is that it?

198
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,666
No. They just don't want
me to be a hero here.

199
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,208
Why not?

200
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,791
You're certainly a high-ranking
member of the upper echelon,

to reject the Imperial system,

[KAHYUL]
...that it's an enemy mine.

00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,458
I already know that.

Merging with space-time orbs.

We'll direct the Futune at them.

Yes. "Trample them." That's it.

[SPOOR]
Well.

00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,583
This is only my first
mission with Admiral Trife,

362
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:01,500
but I can see that his
orders are nice and concise.

Units one through six,
exert space-orbs

364

and prepare for
mobile positions.

00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,541
Each squadron form
a horizontal line,

366
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,583
and proceed to
the front of the fleet.

Unit four has fallen behind.

Oh, I hate slowpokes.

372
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,000
Well we'll attack with
just the other five units

373
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,500
and the laggards
will have to catch up.

374
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,750
But ma'am...

375
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,333
That's what we'll do.

There's a real battle going on.

[SPOOR humming]

384
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,541
Your Excellency,
it would seem the enemy

385
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,541
is focusing their
attack on the Futune,

386
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,416
so shouldn't we then counter
with our defense mines?

387
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,791
So tell me, where were you
posted before you came here?

388
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:23,250
I was a senior staff officer for
the number 184 attack fleet.

389
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,416
Really...

390
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,416
Then I understand
why you couldn't know.

391
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,750
Listen, scouting fleets
don't have a single mine

392
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,041
that can be used for defense,

393
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,750
so your tactic would
be useless if employed...

394
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,541
The few mines loaded
on a scouting fleet

395
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,166
must be used to
destroy other vessels.

396
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,750
Just remember that.

397
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,166
But still...

398
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,541
There are no buts about
the fact that a scouting fleet

399
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,000
cannot panic at the first
sign of a low-level

400
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,833
enemy mine attack.

401
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:51,166
So please try to remember
that we are the Futune.

00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:20,708
Is it that you're stupid?
Or are you just acting that way?

412
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:21,833
[KUFADIS]
Huh?

I'm very sorry!

Well, which is it?

416
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:31,375
I was just acting
stupid, really.

417
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,416
[SPOOR] Why would you
do something like that?

418
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,875
Well, I guess because...

419
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,833
[SPOOR] You were testing
whether or not your superior

420
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,250
was foolish, right?

421
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,666
Never! No, not...

422
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,750
[SPOOR]
Then why did you?

423
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,208
I'm terribly sorry!

424
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,666
It's exactly as you guessed.

425
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,125
I will allow myself
to forgive you this time,

426
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,500
but make sure you
never do it again.

427
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:56,541
I'll tease you without mercy
the next time you do it.

428
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,083
Yes. I'll remember that.

Our destination lies at the
front line of the battlefield.

431
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,208
Leave the smaller
fish behind us,

432
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,875
like the guard vessels
for the fleets

[JINTO]
The Undertaker was right.

435
