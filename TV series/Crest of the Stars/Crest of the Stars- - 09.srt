[NARRATOR speaking in Baronh]

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,333
[LAFIEL]
Vassal Seelnay, Vassal Alisa,

3
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,083
and although I don't
know your names...

4
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,458
All the other Empire citizens
who cooperated with me...

5
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,083
I thank you very much.

6
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,041
I will return as soon as I can.

7
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,208
I ask that you wait
for me until then.

8
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:46,208
[FORMER BARON] You still
insist on going to Sufugnoff?

9
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,125
[LAFIEL]
It's my mission.

10
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,500
There is a chance
you could find yourself

11
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:54,208
in the midst of a battle
without any protection.

12
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,833
[LAFIEL]
I'm going.

13
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,875
I was taught that
when uncertain whether

14
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,791
to stop or go, I go.

15
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,041
[FORMER BARON]
Farewell, young man.

16
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,666
Come again when
you have some time.

17
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,208
Tell me the story of
how the Count Hyde family

18
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,458
was formed.

19
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,125
In return, I'll give you
a thorough explanation

20
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,541
on the know-how of the Abh.

21
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,791
Yes, sir. I'd like that.

22
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,750
If possible, before you
decide to have children.

23
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,833
Sure.

24
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,041
[JINTO]
And so we refueled our ship,

25
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,208
said our goodbyes
to the former Baron,

26
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,250
and finally left
the Febdash territory.

27
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:37,041
Then we headed for what
was likely a battlefield.

28
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,875
[LAFIEL]
Jinto.

29
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,458
The gates to Sufugnoff
now appear within range.

30
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,250
What's the situation?

31
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,625
[LAFIEL] There are a
number of space-time orbs.

32
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,125
I don't know if they're
enemies or allies.

33
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,541
And if they're enemies?

34
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,000
We'll force our way.

35
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,333
Of course.

36
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,250
In about seven hours,

37
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,000
we'll enter the Sufugnoff gates.

38
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,250
I hope they'll greet us with
a much warmer reception.

39
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,708
Possibly they'll greet us
with intense, hot firepower.

40
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,958
[LAFIEL]
Jinto. I've got some bad news.

41
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,375
[JINTO]
I figured.

42
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,625
You don't have
to tell me any more.

43
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,250
They're asking whether
or not we're allies.

44
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,291
From the Empire?

45
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,708
[LAFIEL] I don't know
whose signal it is.

46
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,541
But I do know it's
not the Empire's.

47
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,125
Can't we deceive them,
and just tell them that...

48
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,041
...that we're allies?

49
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,916
How can you even think
of such a foolish tactic?

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,541
I guess it's my upbringing
showing through...

51
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,625
[beeping]

52
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,791
--[JINTO] Huh?
--[LAFIEL] That's it!

53
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,458
Wh-What is?

54
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,041
It's an order to cease.

55
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,333
They say that unless
we come to a halt,

56
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,125
they will open fire on us.

57
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,458
You're not about
to stop now, are you?

58
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,708
[LAFIEL]
Do you want me to stop?

59
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,125
[JINTO]
No.

60
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,666
Then, here we go.

61
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,750
[JINTO yells]

62
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,041
Did we dodge 'em?

63
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,250
Please don't follow us!

64
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,708
--I'll elude them.
--[JINTO] Can we?

65
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,083
If the mines run out
of fuel, we can.

66
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,750
[JINTO]
What about our fuel?

67
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,958
Oh, please, God...

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,333
[beeping]

69
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,625
[JINTO]
There's more!

70
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,750
Who in the universe
ordered extra mines?

71
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,416
We just might be
able to beat them.

72
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,333
It seems that they're
almost out of fuel,

73
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,625
so they sent out more mines.

74
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,125
[JINTO]
All right! Oh, no...

75
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,708
No, we're okay!

76
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,875

I bet they'll just
keep on chasing us

83
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,500
right up to normal space!

00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,291
[LAFIEL]
They followed.

[JINTO chuckles]

92
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,750
[JINTO] They misjudged
where we'd come out.

93
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,958
Won't there be enemies in
this section of space, too?

94
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,791
I don't think so.

95
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,458
[JINTO]
But it is possible, right?

96
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,250
[LAFIEL] They're too
busy with other things.

97

Look over there.

You see, the enemies
in Plane Space

99
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,208
were not guarding
against the Star Forces

coming from afar...

101
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,541
They were blocking
access to Sufugnoff.

102
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,291
So then they're in
the midst of a battle, huh?

Mm-hm.

But... may the

Yes, of course they are!

163
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,708
Are you telling me you weren't
even thinking of landing

164
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,166
until I asked?

165
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,333
Well...

166
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,416
Then what were you planning?

167
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,666
Thought I'd help
with the battle.

168
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,041
But... how?
This spacecraft is unarmed!

169
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,125
I wasn't thinking.

170
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,333
Yet...

171
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,083
There just might be
something we can do...

172
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,291
There are those three
enemy vessels on our tail...

173
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,000
You brainless jerk!

174
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,250
[LAFIEL]
Hmph!

175
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,791
I'll have to accept
whatever you say.

176
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,458
After all, I did
trivialize your life, Jinto.

177
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,083
[JINTO]
Your own life, too.

178
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,250
You people are able to
live a much longer life,

179
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,583
so why are you
in a hurry to die?

180
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,958
We are not in a hurry to die.

181
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,875
It certainly does look that way.

182
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,375
But the battle
has already begun.

183
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,583
Look, when a soldier
goes out to a battlefield,

184
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,541
there's only one thing to do.

185
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,666
[JINTO]
Then do as you wish!

186
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,541
But as for me,
I am not a soldier...

187
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,750
Please let me off
at this planet!

188
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,125
Well, fine then,

189
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,375
your presence is of
no practical use out here

190
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,416
in the battlefield anyway.

191
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,416
Yeah, neither is your presence.

192
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,458
[LAFIEL gasps]

193
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,541
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,625
You're right, of course.

195
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,833
I know it...

196
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,208
I am useless.

197
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,333
[JINTO]
I told you before.

198
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,208
You're a great help to me.

199
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,333
You see, I may be
useless right now,

200
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:52,000
but someday someone
might rely on me.

201
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,208
I'd like to live until then,

202
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,166
and I'd also like you
to live until then.

203
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:00,916
[LAFIEL]
Yeah.

204
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,583
[beeping]

205
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,333
Is it the base?

206
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,416
No...

207
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,000
It's from the
spaceship up ahead.

208
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,166
Enemies... Close?

209
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,333
Yes. Very.

210
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,791
They're saying they'll
open fire unless we halt.

211
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,791
I hoped they would say
something more humorous.

212
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,500
I wouldn't want to
be killed by people

213
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,333
who lacked a sense of humor.

214
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,625
Neither would I.

215
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,875
[BOTH chuckle]

216
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,750
Well, then,

217
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,375
we really should hurry
on down to that planet.

218
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,333
First, we'll have to elude them.

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,125
[JINTO grunts]

220
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,375
Are we safe now?

221
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,250
Even if they changed
direction now,

222
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,958
there's no way they'd
catch up with us.

223
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,708
We're entering the atmosphere.

224
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,500
Try and stay calm, okay?

225
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,250
Try and be gentle, 'kay?

226
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,125
[JINTO grunts]

227
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,916
What's that?
What's the matter?

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,416
Hey, don't worry.

229
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,750
I only disengaged
the main engine.

230
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,458
[JINTO]
What do you mean "only"?

231
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,625
We can't enter
the atmosphere--

232
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,791
not with tanks containing
anti-substance fuel.

233
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,666
We have to think
about the residents.

234
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,583
[JINTO]
But...

235
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,125
The communications
spacecraft is not designed

236
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,916
for landing on ground.

237
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,541
Landing is not any different
than an emergency escape, Jinto.

238
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,041
[JINTO yelling]

239
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,958
Are we really gonna be fine?

240
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,666
I'm just as scared as you.

241
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,458
It's my first time, too!

242
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,416
[JINTO grunts]

243
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,125
It's your first time?

244
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,750
I already said...

245
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,625
I've never been to the
Land world in my whole life!

246
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,333
[JINTO] But haven't you
trained in landings?

247
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,833
[LAFIEL]
I did train!

248
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,708
Which one scares you more?

249
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,208
Landing, or the
Land world itself?

250
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,791
Both scare me!

251
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,041
[yells]

252
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,250
Did we make it in one piece?

253
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,291
Yeah...

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,541
Jinto, let's hurry...

255
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,458
They may be watching
us from above.

256
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,500
[JINTO sighs]

257
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,875
Right.

258
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,333
[LAFIEL]
Open!

259
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,583
You shall hold this.

260
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,208
Uh... yeah.

261
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,625
All set?

262
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,250
All set.

263
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,875
[LAFIEL]
Prepare to nullify.

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,958
[JINTO gasps]

265
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,000
[MACHINE 4] Preparations
complete to nullify.

266
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,250
Goodbye.

267
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,416
Launch self-destruct.

Well, that sure
makes me feel better.

273
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,375
Now. Let's go.

274
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,125
[LAFIEL gasps, groans]

275
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,416
What's wrong?

276
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,625
[LAFIEL]
Uh... It's nothing.

277
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,333

278
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,875
[LAFIEL grunts]

279
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,333
[LAFIEL]
Jinto. Wait a minute.

280
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,375
What's the matter?

281
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,416
Jinto...

282
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,333
I think there's something
wrong with my eyes.

283
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,125
Oh, no. What is it?

284
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:36,333
[LAFIEL] To me, the stars
look like they're flickering.

285
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,375
[JINTO]
Huh?

286
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,166
[LAFIEL] I don't want
to become a burden.

287
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,166
Should I be going blind,

288
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,750
take this logbook with you,
and proceed without me, please.

289
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,625
[JINTO chuckles]

290
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,125
Lafiel...

291
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:01,083
I hate to punch holes in your
self-sacrificing spirit...

292
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,666
...but stars naturally
twinkle when looked at

293
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,375
from within the atmosphere.

294
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:10,541
[LAFIEL gasps]
Does it look the same to you?

295
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,208
[JINTO]
Mm-hm.

296
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,666
[LAFIEL]
Really?

297
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,875
Well, why would I want to
trick you in our situation?

298
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,250
Stunning.

299
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,541
[JINTO] You know, I'm
beginning to see real results

300
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,458
in the education
you've received.

301
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,500
[LAFIEL]
Shut up, Jinto.

302
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,791
[JINTO]
We slept overnight in a cave,

303
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,583
and when I woke up,
it was already evening.

304
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,041
[MACHINE 5] Let's give thanks
to the United Mankind

305
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,041
for liberating us
from the rule of the

306
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,208
Humankind Empire Abh.

307
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,250
[JINTO]
The area was very quiet.

308
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,625
No sign of war anywhere.

309
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,666
However...

310
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,458
[MACHINE 5] This is a message
from the United Mankind.

311
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,708
[MACHINE 5] The reason we
entered this Nation Sufugnoff

312
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,291
was to retaliate against
the reckless actions

313
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,083
taken by the
"Humankind Empire Abh."

314
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,250
[JINTO]
I knew it.

315
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,666
[MACHINE 5] While we were
investigating the Plane Space

316
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,750
around a newly discovered Sord,

317
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,291
a warship of the Empire
suddenly opened fire on us.

318
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,416
[JINTO]
That's a lie!

319
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:53,208
Ambassador, it is clear to me
that you are telling a lie.

320
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,625
A lie?

321
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,416
You have stated that a warship

322
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,541
of the Empire suddenly
appeared and opened fire,

323
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:03,125
but there aren't any in our
highly respectable Star Forces

324
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,625
that would challenge
anyone without just cause.

325
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,500
It seems obvious to me

326
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:14,125
that this case has
been an exception.

327
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,458
If it were such
an exceptional case,

328
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,250
the ship would not have lost.

329
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,166
[MACHINE 5] We were able
to drive this warship back.

330
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,083
However, we cannot
justify such an attack

331
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,250
without warning.

332
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,125
[MACHINE 5] We therefore have
occupied this Nation Sufugnoff

333
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,916
as a form of retaliation,

334
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,875
and to guarantee our safety
around this new Sord.

335
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,375
[JINTO] What if this is Gosroth
that they're talking about?

336
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,541
Ambassador.

337
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,250
I had such great expectations
you would bring me lies

338
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,000
that were served
with more taste.

339
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,583
So I'm quite disappointed.

340
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,000
It's too bad.

341
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,750
[MAKALI] We should investigate
this matter further

342
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,166
before jumping to conclusions.

343
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,041
I suggest that we form a
joint investigative committee

344
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,333
between the
"Humankind Empire Abh"

345
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,333
and the United Mankind,

346
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,791
and select supervising members
from the three neutral nations.

347
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,500
So then, are you also
lying to me?

348
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,875
You have formed an
alliance with each other,

349
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,833
and that makes you
far from being neutral.

350
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:23,875
[MAKALI]
Majesty!

351
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,125
[MAKALI]
Majesty.

352
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,875
Should you make
a declaration of war

353
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,166
against the United
Mankind nation,

354
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,666
in accordance with
the Nova Sicily Treaty,

355
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,791
the People's Sovereign
Union of the Planets

356
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,625
must declare war
against your own nation.

357
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,291
[RAMAJ]
I'm aware of that.

358
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,208
And I suppose it will
be the same for the

359
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,291
"Republic of Greater Alcont"
and the "Federation of Hania."

360
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,708
Okay, then...

361
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,625
Let's go to war.

362
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:53,666
[SANGALINI gasps]

363
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:00,500
Majesty...
Please think this matter over.

364
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,458
You must realize that
you will have to fight

365
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,750
against half of all humankind.

366
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,916
[RAMAJ] Have you forgotten,
Ambassador?

367
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,750
The other half belongs
to this Empire.

368
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,125
I'll tell you this
much for certain.

369
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,708
The Empire lacks the faith
in a higher being.

370
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:20,041
There is absolutely
no way you can win.

371
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,375
[RAMAJ]
Of course.

372
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,958
Our Empire does not
have such faith. However...

373
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,125
I never knew such faith
had anything to do

374
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,875
with the outcome of a battle...

375
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,416
It must be one
of your superstitions.

376
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,333
Thank you all for coming.

377
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:43,458
I do hope you have a
safe journey back home.

378
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,958
Your diplomatic privileges
will be nullified

379
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:49,083
in exactly 24 hours.

380
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,416
Finally, one more issue.

381
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,541
Should we win
this battle with you,

382
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,916
it will be the final war
for humankind.

383
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,166
An everlasting peace?

384
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,250
People have dreamed
of this thing for ages.

385
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:06,125
However, it has never
actually happened, Majesty.

386
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,375
That's because

387
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,041
there haven't been
any Abhs until now.

388
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:15,833
[JINTO] Above our heads,
far away in outer space,

389
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,875
a war had officially just begun.

390
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,625
You jerk.

391
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:48,958
Lafiel!

392
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,541
I'll be back as soon
as possible, so wait here.

393
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,583
[LAFIEL]
Mm-hm.

394
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:57,333
Besides, you, uh...
stand out too much.

395
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,083
[LAFIEL]
Huh?

396
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:08,291
Come on, don't overdo it.

397
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,375
You're the only one
I can trust within a radius

398
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,000
of 100 light-years.

399
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,791
[JINTO] It'd be nice if
she'd say something like that

400
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,041
just once.
