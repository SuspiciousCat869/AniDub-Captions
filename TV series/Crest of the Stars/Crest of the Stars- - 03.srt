That's right.

Uh, well, it's just...

It's tough from a

00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,708
[LAFIEL] What's wrong, Jinto?
You're being awfully quiet.

162
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,041
And why are you
walking behind me?

163
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,916
Well, you see,
Imperial Princess...

164
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,166
[LAFIEL]
Huh?

165
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,250
[gasps]

166
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,208
I'm not an Imperial Princess,

167
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,041
though my grandmother
is the Empress.

168
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,083
I'm only royal, since
my father is a king.

169
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,000
P-Please forgive me,
Royal Princess.

170
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,791
[LAFIEL] If you insist
on harping on the fact

171
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,250
that I'm related to the Empress,

172
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,125
call me the granddaughter
of the Empress,

173
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,458
even though that's not used,

174
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,500
since "Your Highness
Imperial granddaughter"

175
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,791
doesn't sound right, does it?

176
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,833
[JINTO]
You're exactly right.

177
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,958
I mean, I agree, Your Highness.

178
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,833
Incidentally, when I was born,

179
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,041
I was also bestowed
with the title and domain

180
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,333
of Viscount Paryunu with my
father acting as guardian,

181
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,541
so on occasion,

182
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,375
I am also referred to
as Viscount Paryunu.

183
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,833
And even more recently,

184
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,958
I've been referred to
as pilot trainee Abriel.

185
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:10,708
However, I thought
I told you earlier

186
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,041
that you shall call me Lafiel.

187
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,708
Uh... Sure.

188
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:18,375
So your friends call you Lafiel?

189
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,625
[LAFIEL]
Not necessarily.

190
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,500
None of my friends refer
to me without a title.

191
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,250
[JINTO]
Then... why?

192
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:29,291
[LAFIEL] It was the first time
anyone asked me for my name.

193
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,333
It seems as a granddaughter
of an Empress,

194
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,541
I'm well known, and
everyone knows my name

195
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,875
and recognizes me.

196
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,541
Instantly, people call you
"the Royal Princess."

197
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:41,208
My best friends call
me "Your Highness."

198
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,166
I sort of envy the other
trainees at the institution

199
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,208
who call each other by name.

200
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,125
Sorry. I, uh...

201
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,791
It got even worse
when I began to notice

202
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,291
that others found it difficult
to relax when I was around.

203
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,083
I'm really very sorry.

204
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,541
[LAFIEL] There's nothing
to be sorry about.

205
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,000
I mean to say, you've done
nothing wrong, have you?

206
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,708
You may have erred in calling
me "Imperial Princess,"

207
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,708
but it wasn't out of spite.

208
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,833
I haven't been brought up

209
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,166
to tolerate
disrespectful references,

210
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,125
but I shall accept any
title if it is correct.

211
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,250
So call me "Royal Princess,"
"Viscount Paryunu,"

212
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,333
or whatever you wish to call me,
Your Excellency Count Prince.

213
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,708
No. I'll call you Lafiel.

214
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,291
[LAFIEL]
Don't get me wrong,

215
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,833
I'm not insisting that
you call me Lafiel.

216
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,083
Yes. Please.

217
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,375
I want to call you Lafiel,
and nothing else.

218
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,791
You don't have to.
You know that.

219
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,375
But I really do want to.

220
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,291
How about "Imperial
granddaughter"?

221
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,541
Oh, this is insane.

222
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,916
What do I have to say to have
you forgive me, Lafiel?

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,916
[giggles]

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,166
[JINTO]
Huh?

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,291
I can sort of relate to that.

226
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,333
Since I was actually the only
flesh-and-blood nobleman

227
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,166
at my school.

228
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,125
[LAFIEL]
This is your room here.

229
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,125
[JINTO]
I meant to ask you.

230
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,875
How come there are so many
paintings around here?

231
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,291
For decoration.

232
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,750
Wouldn't you agree that a
warship needs some charm?

233
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,166
But it doesn't seem to match.

234
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,166
I'm sure there are pictures more
appropriate for a spaceship.

235
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,458
Lafiel, what feeling do you
get when you see these?

236
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,833
What do you mean by that?

237
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:39,125
[JINTO] Well, you've never seen
real sunflowers, have you?

238
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,791
[LAFIEL]
Sure, I've seen sunflowers.

239
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,083
The capital does have
a botanical garden,

240
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,291
and our residence has
its own flower garden.

241
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,958
[JINTO]
I see. Then how about this one?

242
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,250
[LAFIEL] I'm sure I've never
seen anything like it.

243
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,750
[JINTO] So, what does
it look like to you?

244
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:58,333
[LAFIEL] Let's see.
Like a scenery in a dream.

245
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,708
[JINTO] Of a place that
doesn't really exist?

246
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,166
[LAFIEL]
No, not really.

247
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,500
I can tell we initially came
from places like this one.

248
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,291
[JINTO]
A home you've abandoned?

249
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:13,125
[LAFIEL]
Our home is now in Outer Space.

250
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,500
We are the only citizens
of the Cosmos,

251
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,083
and we're very proud of that.

252
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,750
[LAFIEL] How does that
picture look to you, Jinto?

253
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,375
Is that scenery common on Land?

254
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,625
[JINTO]
No.

255
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,708
A scenery like that one
is quite rare on Land.

256
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,875
[LAFIEL]
Then how does it look to you?

257
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,375
[JINTO]
Hmm...

258
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,625
Whenever I see a
blue sky like that,

259
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,000
I remember my mother who died.

260
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,166
[LAFIEL]
Hm?

261
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,958
I was once told
when I was little

262
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,416
that my mother had
gone to the skies.

263
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,166
Your mother?

264
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,416
But aren't you--? I thought you
were the son of a father.

265
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,333
Aren't you the son of His
Excellency Count Hyde?

266
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,541
[JINTO]
He's my father.

267
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,333
Hm.

268
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,208
Oh, I see!

269
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,250
You've heard of a spousal system
called marriage, haven't you?

270
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,083
I have! I see!

271
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,416
So what's it like for you
to live with two parents?

272
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,750
Were you sad when
your mother died?

273
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,416
Oh, yes.

274
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,958
I was devastated.

275
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,208
[LAFIEL]
Oh.

276
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,791
You must forgive me.

277
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,833
I should not have asked you
such a thoughtless question.

278
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,958
No. It's okay.

279
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,458
I don't quite remember her death
since it happened long time ago

280
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,333
when I was just a child.

281
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:38,250
Although, I do often remember
the parents who brought me up.

282
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,375
But that way,

283
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,791
you can't possibly have
any birth secrets, true?

284
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,208
What do you mean by that?

285
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,083
I'm not sure what you're saying.

286
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,750
[LAFIEL]
I had a birth secret.

287
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,125
I didn't know whether or
not I was a daughter of love.

288
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,708
Wouldn't that make you uneasy?

289
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,250
[JINTO]
A daughter of love?

290
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,833
What's that?

291
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't you know?

292
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,250
Well, there was a great
deal of material

293
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,375
that wasn't taught in
the classes I attended.

294
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,416
Do you know how Abhs are born?

295
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,875
[JINTO]
Huh?

296
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,583
Well, I-I do know
that it's traditionally

297
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,500
not through conception
into a human body.

298
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,583
Oh, sometimes we do.

299
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,833
But to examine the genes...

300
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,000
[LAFIEL] First, the fertilized
egg is taken out of the body.

301
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,916
Often it's transferred
to an artificial uterus,

302
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,166
but some women transfer
it back inside them

303
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,416
for the unique experience.

304
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,083
[JINTO]
Oh. I see.

305
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,583
[LAFIEL] But it is true that
conception normally takes place

306
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,625
in an artificial uterus.

307
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,958
To our race,

308
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,250
it seems that every single
Abh has a birth secret.

309
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,375
Oh, I did study about it,

310
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,000
but the information was
completely out of whack.

311
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:55,791
[LAFIEL]
In what way?

312
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,291
[JINTO]
Huh?

313
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,916
Well, like cloning yourself
to make your own child,

314
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,458
or mix the genes of
a complete stranger,

315
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,500
or even combine the
genes of someone

316
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,750
of the same sex with your own.

317
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,875
In addition, the other
person may be a relative.

318
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,291
How can you even think
of such a thing, huh?

319
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,166
[LAFIEL]
We do all of those things.

320
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,166
We should be free to
do just as we want.

321
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,750
B-But...

322
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:23,083
Yet, the most natural
way to make a child

323
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,166
is to combine the
genes of yourself

324
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,583
with the genes of
the person you love.

325
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,541
I'm so relieved to
hear you say that.

326
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,416
To tell a person that
you want their genes

327
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,291
is a very highly regarded
way to express one's love.

328
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,083
[JINTO]
Hmm.

329
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,833
[LAFIEL] And children born as
a result of this disclosure--

330
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,791
[JINTO] I get it!
"The daughter of love," right?

331
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,000
[LAFIEL]
Right.

332
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,416
Or the "son of love"
if the child is a boy.

333
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,208
Then why don't you ask your
father who your mother is?

334
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,500
Just ask him directly.

335
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,958
Or is it that your
father has...?

336
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,166
[LAFIEL]
Hmm?

337
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,041
Oh, no, my father's
still alive and well.

338
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,166
He should be around
for another 200 years.

339
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,916
Is that what you were assuming?
Or did I misunderstand?

340
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,583
[JINTO]
No, you're right.

341
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,791
Why didn't you just ask him?

342
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,708
[LAFIEL]
I did ask him, in fact.

343
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,916
But my father would not tell me.

344
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,625
He'd say that a child's
personality becomes richer

345
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,166
when the child has
a birth secret.

346
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,750
[sighs]

347
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,208
[JINTO chuckles]

348
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,458
It's not funny.

349
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,666
[JINTO]
Sorry. Can't you check into it?

350
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,083
No, regulations dictate
that my genetic records

351
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,791
cannot be released until
I become an adult.

352
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,666
[JINTO]
Is that so?

353
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,416
My father was always teasing me.

354
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,833
[JINTO]
What?

355
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:46,000
I'd pester him daily about
the supplier of my genes.

356
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:50,125
One day, he said he'd
bring home the supplier.

357
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:54,875
And here's the other half.
Where you came from.

358
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,041
[meows]

359
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,916
[LAFIEL]
She was the cat we owned!

360
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,458
[laughing]

361
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,125
[JINTO] You didn't
believe that, did you?

362
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,416
What do you expect?
I was only eight years old!

363
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,875
I cried all night and day.

364
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,583
I grew sick with worry and fear.

365
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,291
[LAFIEL] I'd wonder if my
palms would start to swell

366
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,791
and become paws, or if
I'd start growing claws,

367
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,916
or if the shape of
my iris would change.

368
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,625
Holia was a great little cat,

369
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:43,583
but I didn't want her
to be half of my origin.

370
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,083
What I also couldn't
stand was thinking

371
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,750
what a weirdo my father was
to have his child with a cat.

372
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,250
[JINTO laughs]

373
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,458
--[LAFIEL] Hey!
--[thud]

374
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,166
Stop laughing!

375
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,666
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,208
But you really don't believe
that story anymore, do you?

377
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,708
No.

378
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,958
But I still remember
those worrisome days.

379
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,166
The main reason I
entered the forces

380
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,416
to become a pilot so quickly
was to get away from my father.

381
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,333
[JINTO]
Do you dislike your father?

382
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't dislike him.

383
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,750
I love him, and I'm
very proud of him.

384
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,083
It's just that,
when we're together,

385
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,208
he can sometimes
be quite irritating.

386
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,000
[JINTO]
Hmm.

387
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,541
Hey, I noticed you've been
speaking in the past tense.

388
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,666
Did he ever tell
you who she was?

389
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,833
[LAFIEL]
Mh-hm.

390
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:43,208
And she's a woman
that I know very well.

391
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,250
I know now that I'm
a daughter of love.

392
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,583
[chuckles]

393
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,666
I'm glad for you.

394
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,750
[JINTO] At that time,
we had absolutely no idea

395
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:05,000
that a long, long war
was about to begin.

396
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,125
The United Mankind.

397
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:49,791
Now, go on. Get moving.

398
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,416
Lafiel.

399
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,708
Nothing?

400
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,291
Hold on.
