[NARRATOR speaking in Baronh]

2
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,041
[SPOOR]
I'm bored.

3
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,291
[SPOOR] I had always
dreamed of becoming a captain

4
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,041
and fighting against an enemy,

5
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,375
but while I was Captain,
there was no war,

6
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,166
and now that
there's finally a war,

7
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,208
I get these boring duties.

8
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,708
Am I unlucky or what?

9
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:53,333
Ah, commendable!
Yes, Rear Admiral Spoor!

10
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:58,583
Send most of
our mines right here!

11
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,958
We cannot allow it
to close again...

12
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,958
We must help the Futune!

13
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,916
[CREW 10]
There are enemy space-time orbs

14
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,041
coming from direction 010,
quantity about 300!

15
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,291
[KUFADIS] Looks to be the
enemy's main formation!

16
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,416
They're sending additional
forces toward us,

17
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,041
so we must take action!

18
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:01,041
Please stop making such a fuss
on my generally relaxed bridge.

19
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,583
[SPOOR] Make the calculations.
Do we have time?

20
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,083
Uh... Yes! Sure!

21
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,500
Let's maintain present route.

22
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,583
[SPOOR] We should arrive
at the enemy's battle line

23
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,291
any time now.

24
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,208
The enemy's strategy

25
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,458
is focused only on
stopping the Futune.

26
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,333
No threat to the main fleet.

27
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,083
[TRIFE] Agreed!
All vessels prepare to advance.

28
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,041
Lokale, annihilate the
front-line vessels to the right.

29
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,791
Wakapeil, wipe out
the vessels to the left.

30
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,541
Buledef and Kitil, follow me.

31
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,333
Now, if we don't start
getting aggressive,

32
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,208
Futune will steal the show!

33
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,375
[SPOOR]
It's taking too long.

34
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,208
We'll send half of
our fleet immediately

35
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,833
to destroy those ships.

36
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,333
Kufadis.

37
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,375
Captain?

38
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,000
[SPOOR]
I detest these little jobs.

39
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,416
Please inform each unit
of its respective target.

40
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,666
[KUFADIS]
Hmm.

41
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,750
Oh, and tell them not
to leave targets for us.

42
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,875
So are we going to
stand-by on reserve?

43
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,916
No, I want the targets
right over there!

44
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,791
[KUFADIS]
But they look like...

45
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,750
...oversized transport ships,
which are non-military

46
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,333
and pose no threat to us.

47
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,125
[SPOOR]
They could be backup war vessels

48
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,000
merely disguised as such.

49
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,958
They may be hoping to
pass through unharmed

50
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,666
and then pounce on us.

51
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,416
And so I would just like
to force their hand first.

52
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,791
Uh, right...

53
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,916
[CREW 10] Target orders
acknowledged from all units.

54
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,458
Very well.

55
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,958
Charge!

56
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,125
Let the main event
of fire dancing begin.

57
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,625
We are Futune,
the Goddess of Dance.

58
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:10,083
Let us step out and show them
what great dancers we are.

59
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,375
[KYUA]
Inspector.

60
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,791
We've located
two suspicious kids.

61
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,250
Where are you?

62
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,166
[KYUA] At the Limzale Inn,
but they're no longer here.

63
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,208
Ugh!

64
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,541
So they got away.

65
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,875
[KYUA] No, they were gone
by the time we arrived.

66
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,500
[ENTRYUA] So, you think
they were suspicious?

67
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,458
[KYUA] Yeah. Neither left
the room even once

68
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,750
during their stay.

69
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,375
Any witnesses?

70
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,083
[KYUA] The girl had black hair
and eyes and tanned skin.

71
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,250
She was apparently
very beautiful.

72
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,458
"Very." Uh-huh...

73
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,583
[MARCA] You think we're
just a bunch of dreamers,

74
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,666
don't you?

75
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,958
That there's no way
the Empire will recognize

76
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,416
our independence just
because we happen to have

77
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,958
you as our hostage, huh?

78
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,333
Oh, so you are aware of that.

79
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,416
What we are after
is a new spaceship.

80
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,750
And not independence?

81
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,666
No, for our independence.

82
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,458
Min is very eager to gain
independence right away.

83
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,000
But I believe we should just
approach it step-by-step.

84
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,916
Well, if you want
to get on a spaceship,

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,083
why don't you just
become citizens?

86
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,416
Our objective is not
just to ride spaceships,

87
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,416
but to finally acquire
one of our own

88
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,458
and that will make us
all free! Yeah!

89
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,041
You know that's impossible.

90
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,000
All interstellar
ships of the Empire

91
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,958
belong to Her Majesty
the Empress,

92
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,833
and not even the
top noblemen own their

93
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,500
own personal spaceships.

94
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,375
But we see numerous
ships of companies

95
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,416
and lords coming in and
out of the space harbor

96
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,791
all the time.

97
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,916
Those are all leased out
to the Empire merchant group

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
as a package which
includes the crew,

99
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,250
and the lessee has
control over the ship size

100
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,583
and contract term,
but the merchant group

101
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,291
has control over the crew.

102
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,458
Well, then, what's
going to become of

103
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,083
all our dreams?

104
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,041
[JINTO]
So then...

105
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,458
What are your plans?

106
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,250
This is our destination.

107
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,958
Was our destination.

108
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,666
That's my town which
we were gonna use

109
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,208
as a secret place
to confine both of you,

110
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,583
but I'm not sure it's
of any value now.

111
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,041
Think about it carefully.

112
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,958
Why do Abhs have
to be so arrogant

113
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,500
when they say things to us?

114
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,250
Don't let it bother
you too much.

115
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,625
You'll get way too stressed out.

116
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,708
I was trying to be helpful!

117
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,083
[MARCA]
Look over there!

118
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,708
Min, did you
purchase that thing?

119
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,875
No...

Are all of you

124
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,000
Why, I ask you the same thing!

125
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,083
My name is Lieutenant

of that town over there.

129
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,791
You see, Lieutenant, my friends
and I were making our way

130
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,458
to my house for a party.

131
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,416
[ALANGA]
Then you must be Min Kulsup,

132
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,583
a member of the

[MIN]
That's right!

136
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,208
You are now under arrest.

137
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,916
Oh, yeah? What for?

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,833

a hidden organization

[UNDERTAKER whimpers]

There's simply no

They've misunderstood. Yikes.

Get out of the way!

00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,458
[MIN]
Is everyone here?

171
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,083
Sure are!

172
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,666
Great! This way.

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,291
[JINTO gasps]
Oh, yeah...

174
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,333
[JINTO]
What is this?

175
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,000
It's a lava cave.

176
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,708
Well, what was that hole
we just dropped through?

177
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,416
That's an escape route
I made just in case

178
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,041
we had to use it someday...

179
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,500
You know, you guys have
made it really difficult!

180
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,541
Can you believe they now
think that I'm a collaborator?

181
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,875
With the Empire,
of all things! [yells]

182
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:45,791
[LAFIEL]
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,875
[MIN]
Huh?

184
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,541
I feel really terrible
about involving

185
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,208
all of you in this situation,

186
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:54,250
but we simply can't afford
to get caught ourselves.

187
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,000
[UNDERTAKER]
Long ago...

188
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,666
I once knew this guy, see,
who decided to jump into

189
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,875
a thorn bush.

190
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,333
Save the stories, okay?

191
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,166
[gasps]

192
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,041
[UNDERTAKER]
Hm? Hm?

193
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,083
Shh...!

194
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,416
Can you hear it?

195
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,416
They're here...

196
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,666
Turn out the light.

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
[UNDERTAKER] Naturally, the
guy was covered in scratches.

198
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,458
Who was?

199
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,500
[UNDERTAKER] The guy that
jumped into the thorn bush.

200
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,166
So, I went to
the hospital to see him,

201
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,083
and asked him
why he did it

202
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,833
and the guy replied...

203
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,666
"At the time, it seemed
like a good idea!"

204
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,375
[MARCA gasps]

205
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,416
[MIN] This path leads
to the main stream,

206
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,500
which has several outlets
taking you to the surface.

207
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,583
[LAFIEL] I want everybody
to go ahead of me.

208
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,083
What are you talking about?

209
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,625
Look, I can't afford to
cause you any further trouble...

210
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:55,416
I'll stop them
right here... go on.

211
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,375
I've never heard of
kidnappers being saved

212
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,416
by their own hostages before.

213
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,708
We better go now,
'cause nothing's gonna change

214
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,083
that girl's mind.

215
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,625
Hurry up. The enemy's close.

216
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:07,750
All right.

217
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,291
I hope that we
get to meet again.

See you later, girl.

Hmph...

Hey...

You're not trying to
get rid of me, are you?

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,916
Well, you're really not
much of a sharpshooter,

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,875
but having you is sure
better than nothing at all.

224
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,583
[JINTO] I hope they don't
use a fire cannon here.

225
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,750
We'd be buried alive.

[LAFIEL]
Don't worry.

I see they got here first.

[KYTE]
So what do you think?

231
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,500
Should we go underground
after them, too?

232
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
[ENTRYUA] Leave the game
of "underground tag"

Oh, but Inspector...

You see, around here
we refer to the officers

00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,416
of the Guzonyu local
police as "moles."

237
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,750
We can use the detailed
information they get

00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,458
about this lava cave.

only one knee on the ground.

Right.

make any difference.

Here they come.

262
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,166
There are six space-time orbs
of attack ships on route 45

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,458
with a distance of 16 units.

264
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,625
Are you certain?
Could they be mines?

265
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,208
[CREW 10]
No.

266

Weapons Officer, please tell me
how many of our mines are left.

267
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,958
Four on this ship,
four on Bogbyursh,

268
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:27,500
and five on Hasunbyursh, all
for a grand total of 13 mines.

269
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,208
I am capable of
adding up small figures.

270
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,666
Front-line vessels will now
commence launch of all mines.

271
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,000
Tear them to shreds!

272
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,041
Tell me, Kufadis.

273
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,458
What is it, Captain?

274
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,833
What would be the worst
crime an officer could commit?

275
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,916
I would think it's to
disobey one's superiors.

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,708
No, the worst crime
is to be a fool.

00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,083
What kind of fool sends
only six attack vessels

278
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,208
to get rid of
three patrol ships?

279
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,250
I see.

280
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,000
I may not take
my job seriously,

281

but I'm not foolish enough
to sacrifice your lives

picks her own playmates.

playing against?

adjustments for our three ships

[CREW 15]
Yes, Captain!

their electromagnetic rifles

at once upon
merging with space-time!

297
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,541
Now. I do wonder what
we'll uncover in there.

298
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,916

Well, here we go.

Five, four, three, two, one...

303
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,875
It looks like they're
surrendering to us!

304
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,166
We've received a
surrender signal by radio.

305
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,375
Inform all ships
that we must halt attack!

306
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,416
I'd ruin my name if I shot
at those who surrendered

307
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,916
so willingly.

308
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Hasunbyursh has just shot,
so we now must use our rifles!

309
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,416
Detonate mines!

310
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,125
[SPOOR] Why couldn't they
tell us by inter-orb radio?

311
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,208
Did they think they
could get away?

312
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:34,458
[KUFADIS]
They're transport vessels.

313

[SPOOR] Even I have incorrect
hunches every once in a while.

[KAHYUL] A craft has
arrived from the Futune.

315
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,916
[TRIFE]
What's the situation?

316
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,625
[KAHYUL] They've imprisoned
a group of bureaucrats.

317
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,041
Why are there government
officials at a battle?

318
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,250
It would seem that
the United Mankind

319
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,291
has a custom of having
bureaucrats attend battles.

320
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,916
Their methods are totally
incomprehensible to me.

321
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,125
Well, in any case, I guess what
that means is we have won.

322
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,375
It's the obvious conclusion.

323
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,291
[TRIFE] It's too obvious
to get thrilled,

324
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,041
but order all fleets to assemble
for a big celebration.

325
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,416
[KAHYUL]
Right away.

326
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,083
And finally, I do have
one more job for the Futune.

327
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,416
[KUFADIS]
Detecting enemy fleet!

328
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,583
Direction 105, distance 0.12
light seconds,

329
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,500
speed 217 wesdash per second.

330
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,041
Fleet consisting
of about 20 vessels.

331
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,666
[CREW 14] Type of vessels
in enemy fleet confirmed.

332
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,250
They're believed to be 12
large-scale transport ships,

333
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,333
one patrol ship,
and six attack ships.

334
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,375
Ninety-eight percent
chance of our victory.

335
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,208
[KUFADIS] Shall we issue
a call to surrender?

336
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,250
[SPOOR]
There's no need.

337
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,041
They'll surrender
if they want to.

338
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,625
[CREW 10]
Message from enemy ship.

339
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,541
"We have 22 prisoners on board,

340
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,791
including the
Marquis of Sufugnoff.

341
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,041
Cease fire and
allow us to pass."

342
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,458
Oh, communications!

343
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,291
[CREW 10]
Yes, Captain!

344
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,000
Send this reply.

345
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:56,958
[CREW 10]
Yes, Captain.

346
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,083
And the message?

347
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,416
That I am the
Rear Admiral Spoor,

348
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,875
the commander of the
scouting fleet Futune.

349
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:07,208
You should be thankful for
the generosity shown by us.

350
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,125
I will allow you the
opportunity to surrender.

351
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,625
I will wait until we are
.08 light-seconds apart.

352
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,166
Should you miss this
opportunity to surrender,

353
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,583
we have an even sweeter destiny
in store for your spaceships.

354
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,458
As a bonus, you will
have the honor of dying

355
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:27,458
with Abh nobility as you
disintegrate into particles.

356
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,833
Notify all vessels!

357
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,916
[CREW 10]
Yes, Captain.

358
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,833
We will open fire
as soon as they come

359
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,458
within .08 light-seconds,
and by then,

360
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,791
you can promptly ignore
all surrender signals

361
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,125
from the enemy.

362
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,958
Shower them until there's
absolutely nothing left!

363
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,583
Wait one moment!

364
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,791
What is it, Senior Officer?

365
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,458
Firing at a surrendered
enemy will scar the honor

366
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,791
of the Empire and Star Forces.

367
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,625
You know,
you're right in suggesting

368
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,125
that it's not a pretty sight,
so we won't do it.

369
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,208
Yes.

370
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,000
Thanks for accepting
my suggestion.

371
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,333
So then, am I free to
decide on how to transport

372
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,541
the enemy prisoners?

373
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,833
Yes.

374
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,666
You govern as the
chief commander.

375
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,958
Very well.

376
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,541
How many people are
there in the enemy fleet?

377
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,750
[KUFADIS] Well, they have
12 large-scale ships,

378
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,291
so I'd guess 25,000?

379
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,416
So we can fit them on
one Talse transport ship?

380
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,833
One ship?

381
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,708
Well, it's not impossible...

382
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,666
Calculate this for me...

383
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,666
If there were 24,000
on the Talse,

384
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,875
and it had to sail through
Ordinary Space

385
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:37,000
right to the Capital,
how much time would it take?

386
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,166
Through Ordinary Space only?

387
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,375
Yes, that's right.

388
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,083
[KUFADIS]
Approximately 58,300 years.

389
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,500
I can't imagine the
prisoners being too happy

390
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,333
about such an extended holiday.

391
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,750
[KUFADIS]
I wouldn't think so.

392
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,083
[SPOOR] Then let's shorten
the travel time for them.

393
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,958
Well, there won't be any use
for space-time orb generators.

394
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,916
Nor is there a need for
stabilizers or crew members.

395
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,041
Omit gravitation.

396
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,083
Still seems heavy. Did you
factor in food and water?

397
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,750
[KUFADIS] I've included
a one-year supply,

398
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,125
and hydroponic farming
facilities to supply them

399
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,625
with basic food.

400
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,583
There's no need
for farm facilities.

401
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,958
Please delete that as well.

402
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,083
While we're cutting
out luxury items,

403
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,083
should we also delete food,
water, and air?

404
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,875
The prisoners would
die if we did something

405
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,416
so utterly stupid as that.

406
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,250
I can't dream of
something so brutal.

407
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,708
That'll make it a lot lighter.

408
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,625
Recalculate the travel time.

409
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,166
[KUFADIS] I don't think it makes
that much of a difference.

410
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,125
It's still about 49,100 years.

411
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,708
We should be proud we managed
to reduce the travel time

412
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,500
by almost 10,000 years.

413
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,666
[KUFADIS]
Yes, but...

414
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,041
[SPOOR] Communications
Officer, inform all units

415
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,208
that we will respect their
wish to surrender at any time,

416
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,083
and add that those surrendering
after the battle has begun

417
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,833
will unfortunately be
thoroughly obliged to travel

418
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,750
to the Capital through
Ordinary Space only.

419
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,833
To save travel time,
the ship will unload

420
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,708
space-time orb generators,
gravitational devices,

421
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,166
and stabilizers,
and there will be no crew.

422
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,458
The prisoners will be
given a one-year supply

423
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,041
of food and water.

424
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:18,333
Arrival time is estimated
at 49,000 years.

425
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,208
That should do.

426
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,750
[KUFADIS]
Please wait, Your Excellency.

427
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,375
Quiet, Senior Officer.

428
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,666
Any further suggestions from you
will be considered dissention.

429
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,750
A lady of chaos...

430
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,125
[SPOOR laughing]

431
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,250
Y'know, I kinda
like that title for me.

432
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,583
[JINTO] Well it looks like
they haven't given up.

433
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,041
[LAFIEL] On the bright side,
they've marked the route for us.

434
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,416
[JINTO]
Yeah.

435
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,166
Y'know, when I'm with you,
I don't get as worried,

436
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,333
and everything just
seems more hopeful.

437
00:22:58,708 --> 00:22:59,833
[JINTO]
We have a problem.

438
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:00,916
What's wrong...?

439
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,500
They're closing in.

440
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,750
It's a dead end.

441
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,041
Jinto! Get down!

442
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,916
[JINTO] I never imagined I'd
experience being a corpse

443
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,791
while I'm still alive.

444
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,458
[LAFIEL]
Does it still hurt?

445
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,666
[JINTO]
It's just a scratch.

446
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,166
[LAFIEL] Oh, it's humiliating to
ride a ship with no exterior

447
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,125
area sensors or guhakes.

448
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,375
[JINTO] This is not a ship.
It's a coffin.

449
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,833
C-O-F-F-I-N.

450
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:07,250
[LAFIEL]
It's cramped in here.

451
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:10,708
I suddenly have the urge
to get away from you.

452
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:14,458
[JINTO]
Ouch! Be careful, I'm injured.

453
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:16,500
[LAFIEL] I thought
it was just a scratch.
