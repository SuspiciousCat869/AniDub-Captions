1
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,583
[PLAKIA]
See that Fiel?

2
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,166
That's just the
remains of a star.

3
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,708
[DUBUS] Do you have to be
quite so negative, my dear?

4
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:58,625
It's actually the
source of a new star.

5
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:02,666
Everything that's needed
for the birth of a new life!

6
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,875
[PLAKIA]
I've been doing some thinking...

7
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,875
What do you say we go home?

8
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,000
[DUBUS]
But we've only just arrived!

9
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,750
We haven't even taken
in the scenery yet!

10
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,750
We should stay for at
least a couple more days

11
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,625
before we get back to work.

12
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,166
[PLAKIA]
That's not what I mean.

13
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,333
I was thinking maybe we
should go back to Lakfakalle.

14
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,875
Now where did that
come from all of a sudden?

15
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,708
Don't you love me anymore?

16
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,083
[PLAKIA]
Mm-mm.

17
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,750
You know I love you,
my precious Imperial Highness.

18
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,041
In fact, even though
I hate to admit it...

19
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,041
I love you more than
anyone else in the universe.

20
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,416
[DUBUS]
Then why?

21
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,833
[PLAKIA] It's been wonderful
spending all this time

22
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,916
alone with you, but
I miss our friends.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,125
We could have just as
wonderful time back there

24
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,375
with them.

25
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,666
I want to go back
to the Star Forces.

26
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,791
If that's really
what you want to do...

27
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,583
Sometimes I wish
you weren't so easily

28
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,125
persuaded about things--

29
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,958
that you'd fight your corner
a bit more forcefully!

30
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,916
What do you want me to do?

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,625
Don't leave me!

32
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,500
I could even throw in
a few tears if you want,

33
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,541
just for effect...

34
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,583
That was almost convincing.

35
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,708
You know full well
I'd rather die

36
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,958
than actually let
someone see me cry.

37
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,625
Is that some of your
Abriel pride talking?

38
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,916
No, just regular human pride.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,333
Speaking of being human,

40
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,208
did you hear what the
people of Lakuryuush

41
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,666
have been saying about us?

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,958
They've decided that we're
just artificial life forms,

43
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,875
and that we were
created to look, sound,

44
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,125
and act exactly like humans!

45
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,458
Come on, that can't
be the official opinion.

46
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,875
I'm afraid so. It's as
official as official can be!

47
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,208
You can find it written in any
of their school textbooks!

48
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,958
All we did was discover
these isolated human worlds

49
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,583
and conquer them for the Empire.

50
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,291
But from their perspective
they'd have you believe

51
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,625
it was some huge alien
invasion from outer space!

52
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,791
[DUBUS]
You know...

53
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,916
Sometimes I think
that your imagination

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,916
gets the better of you.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,333
How do you know
what's in their school

56
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,000
textbooks anyway?

57
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,541
You mean you don't remember?

58
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,166
We had orders to
carry them all the way

59
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,375
from Lakuryuush to Gamuteesh.

60
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,791
Really? Are you sure?

61
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,541
Ah... that curriculum package!

62
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,083
Now I know what
you're talking about.

63
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,166
[PLAKIA]
That's right.

64
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,458
I think there's still
a back-up copy

65
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,458
in the ship's
information system.

66
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,000
[DUBUS] No, I deleted it.
It was part of our contract.

67
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,125
Incidentally, our contract
also stated that we weren't

68
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,500
allowed to make use
of the cargo we carried.

69
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,583
[PLAKIA]
Don't be such a spoilsport!

70
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,208
[DUBUS] Sticking to our contract
is an important Abh ethic.

71
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,375
[PLAKIA]
What a shame.

72
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,958
Then I guess you don't
want to hear about

73
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,166
all the other interesting
stuff I found?

74
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,583
[DUBUS]
Knowing you, you probably went

75
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,625
straight to the juicy bits
where they make us out

76
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,291
to be evil tyrants!

77
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,708
[PLAKIA] It's quite
amusing when they get

78
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:30,916
the wrong end of the stick.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,750
It's only if their
criticisms hit home

80
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,041
that I get annoyed.

81
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,416
[DUBUS]
That's understandable.

82
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,833
[PLAKIA]
You see?

83
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,458
Besides, they praise the
Empire's distribution system,

84
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,000
saying that by
using it their trade

85
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,458
has progressed
in leaps and bounds.

86
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,541
Here's another
interesting little fact.

87
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,875
Do you know what they call
the territorial representative

88
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,500
of Lakuryuush?

89
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,875
[DUBUS]
No.

90
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,000
[PLAKIA] "The person
in charge of maintaining

91
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,958
the Abh Aggregate"!

92
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,166
[DUBUS]
What's that all about?

93
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,458
It looks like we're
not the first ones to arrive

94
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,875
in this sector of space...

95
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:07,333
Ah! You're not the only
curious one exploring this area.

96
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,416
They're only about
three light-seconds away.

97
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
That's very close.

98
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,750
We're near the Sord.

99
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,875
It wouldn't surprise me
if we saw another ship.

100
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,083
It's a strange orbit.

101
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,625
If they're going
to use the Sord,

102
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,500
you'd think they'd approach
it from a different angle

103
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,666
instead of circling
it like that.

104
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,958
Maybe they're doing some sort of
scientific research in the area.

105
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,750
[DUBUS] They seem to
have some sort of radiation

106
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,583
surrounding them, but I don't
think it's a defense shield.

107
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,416
Then maybe it's not a ship.

108
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,708
That's a possibility.

109
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,125
Whatever it is,
I'll bet that it's manmade.

110
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,750
Well if it's not
an active ship,

111
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,625
then maybe it's a
shipwreck or something.

112
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,875
There must be quite
a few floating around.

113
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,166
Let's ask the computer.

114
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,083
I would like to run a
search of your database

115
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,708
of survey reports to see if
you can identify this object.

116
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,000
[COMPUTER VOICE]
Object not identified.

117
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,708
--Hey, Plakia?
--[PLAKIA] Huh?

118
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,583
How about you
and I go and explore?

119
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,541
This little detour of ours
might not have been

120
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,916
such a bad idea.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,583
[DUBUS] It looks to me
like an interplanetary

122
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,083
navigation ship--
one of the older models.

123
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,416
But surely the computer
should have been

124
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,791
able to identify it?

125
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,291
[PLAKIA] Not if the
surveys aren't complete.

126
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,458
[DUBUS] Do you think we
should try to go on board?

127
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,958
[PLAKIA] If I say no,
you'll go anyway, right?

128
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,291
Okay... I'll go with you.

129
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,083
[DUBUS] If we're so perfect for
each other, which we are,

130
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,250
why did you want to cut the
honeymoon short and go home?

131
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,875
[PLAKIA] I'm not sure we're
perfect for each other yet.

132
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,375
But I'm afraid we might
be getting that way.

133
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,833
I think I'll let you take
care of the preparations

134
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,875
for boarding, my precious
Imperial Highness.

135
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,750
[DUBUS] How many times
do I have to tell you?

136
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,875
I can just about put up with
you calling me by my title,

137
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,250
but cut out the slushy
precious bit, will you?

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,291
[PLAKIA]
Hurry up and get a move on.

139
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,583
[DUBUS] With that attitude
you could be an officer!

140
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:08,083
[PLAKIA] Over here,
my precious Imperial Highness.

141
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,916
Didn't I just tell you
about calling me precious?

142
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,375
[DUBUS]
Can you get it open?

143
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,333
[PLAKIA]
I expect so.

144
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,500
What do you mean?

145
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,208
Are you saying you
haven't tried it yet?

146
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,083
It might need some muscle power,
in which case that's your job.

147
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,541
Oh, really? Why's that?

148
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,583
As far as I remember,
this little detour

149
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,833
was all your idea,
so you should do the work,

150
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,125
Your Highness!

151
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,916
Okay. Your point is taken.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,583
I just wanted to
make sure, that's all.

153
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,625
I think that the air's
safe to breathe in here.

154
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,708
It's been exposed
to radiation for so long

155
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,666
there'll be no
harmful bacteria left.

156
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,333
What a pleasant thought...

157
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,125
[DUBUS gasps]

158
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,333
[DUBUS] All right!
Time to start exploring!

159
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,541
Maybe now you
understand why I call you

160
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,708
"my precious Imperial Highness."

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,958
Uh...

162
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,458
Are you sure we
should be doing this?

163
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,458
Shouldn't we let
the experts handle it?

164
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,708
It could be dangerous.

165
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,541
After we've come this far?

166
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,875
It's exciting being the first
to discover something.

167
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,583
Look, you can go back
if you want to.

168
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,750
What? And leave you here
all by yourself? No way.

169
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,416
It's out of the question!

170
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,750
You've always trusted me before,
although sometimes I wonder why!

171
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,375
How come you trust me so easily?

172
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,541
What have I done to
earn that trust from you?

173
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,458
[PLAKIA]
Are you sure you want to know?

174
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,541
[DUBUS]
Maybe not.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,833
You know something?

176
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,166
It's kind of a weird feeling,

177
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,875
but I think I've actually
been here before.

178
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:00,958
Really?

179
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,750
[PLAKIA gasps]

180
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,583
Look! Something's alive!

181
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,625
Maybe...

182
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,583
[PLAKIA]
Don't!

183
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,416
I'm beginning to wonder
if we should leave this

184
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,750
to people who know
what they're doing...

185
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,833
Are you frightened?

186
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,958
What if I was?

187
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,583
Being timid isn't normally
your style, Plakia.

188
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,333
There's a difference
between being cautious

189
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,625
and being timid.

190
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,541
[DUBUS] I can't stop now
or I'll lie awake

191
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,791
at night regretting it.

192
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,333
[PLAKIA]
You losing sleep?

193
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,583
I don't think so!

194
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:46,916
[DUBUS]
It's not working...

195
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:54,708
[PLAKIA gasps]

196
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,916
What's the matter?

197
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,708
I think we should get
out of here, Your Highness...

198
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,000
I see... so I'm not
precious anymore, am I?

199
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,041
[PLAKIA]
You fool!

200
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,625
Look!

201
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,125
It seems like the same
type of hatch as the one

202
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,666
we came through
to get in here.

203
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,333
If it is, then we should
be able to get it open.

204
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,458
[PLAKIA]
What are you doing?

205
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,166
If this leads outside,
we'll get sucked into space!

206
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,583
Hey, don't worry about it!
We'll be prepared.

207
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,750
What do you think they are?

208
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,583
[DUBUS] It could be some
sort of cargo, but I doubt it.

209
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,791
I've never seen
anything like it!

210
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,500
Hey, isn't that...

211
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,625
[DUBUS, PLAKIA grunt]

212
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,708
[DUBUS, PLAKIA grunt]

213
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,750
[PLAKIA gasps]

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,125
The Roomasel!

215
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,583
What in the hell?!

216
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,625
[grunts]

217
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,416
Apparently this shipwreck
isn't a wreck at all!

218
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,916
[PLAKIA] Our ship is
drifting off into space...

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,291
If we can't get it back,

220
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,250
we'll end up spending
the rest of our lives here!

221
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,000
If that means I can be with you,
that's not so bad.

222
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,791
I think I need to
correct you on something.

223
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,750
The one that's drifting
away isn't the Roomasel.

224
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,875
It's us.

225
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,250
[PLAKIA] Do you think
them suddenly changing

226
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,708
the course of their
orbit like that

227
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,458
is some sort of message for us?

228
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,666
[DUBUS] If their invitation
had been a bit more graceful,

229
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,541
I would have been
happy to accept it.

230
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,875
But we weren't invited!

231
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,750
We just came aboard the ship
like we were intruders!

232
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,166
Maybe they're only trying
to get us off the ship.

233
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,625
The power reactor,
the control room...

234
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,166
There's gotta be a
couple of ways for us

235
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,333
to get back there.

236
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,125
[PLAKIA]
This is quite an antique!

237
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,291
[DUBUS] It wouldn't surprise me
if it was hundreds of years old.

238
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,833
It's probably been
traveling across

239
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,875
the different star systems
for a long, long time.

240
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,583
Y'know, this looks
similar to the inside

241
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,458
of the Imperial Palace.

242
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,291
Are you sure?

243
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,416
How is it powered?
Nuclear fusion, perhaps?

244
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,833
I wish I'd been
able to figure out

245
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,875
how to get control
of the ship's reactor

246
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,833
so I could realign its orbit.

247
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,583
We'd have to be careful not
to cause a radiation leak.

248
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,791
Remember that we are
the Kin of the Stars,

249
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,375
so as long as there are
stars around, we'll be safe.

250
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,250
You've got an idea forming
in that head of yours,

251
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,750
--haven't you?
--[PLAKIA] Why do you say that?

252
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,833
I can see it written
all over your face!

253
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,416
I never knew that reading faces
was one of your many talents.

254
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,875
I have got an idea,
but it's fairly basic.

255
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,958
It's probably not
stylish enough for you.

256
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,291
I could force myself
to forget about style.

257
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,500
Have you figured out
the orbit we need yet?

258
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,833
We're lucky this
system doesn't have

259
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,375
a large number of planets.

260
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,958
It's difficult enough
altering the orbit

261
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,666
without having to factor in
other gravitational influences

262
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,208
to the calculations!

263
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,375
Oh, don't worry so much. It
could've been worse, you know.

264
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,333
[DUBUS] Except now you're
making us alter the orbit

265
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,541
with explosives.

266
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,041
I'm sorry if it offends
your sense of style.

267
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,458
Well, it might just work!

268
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,208
[DUBUS grunts]

269
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,541
That was the third one!

270
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,000
Are you sure?

271
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,083
Wasn't it timed to go off
a bit later than the others?

272
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,458
The longer this goes on,
the harder it's going to be

273
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,708
for us to reunite
with the Roomasel.

274
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,583
[DUBUS] I guess this
means our honeymoon

275
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,500
is well and truly
coming to an end!

276
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,333
[PLAKIA grunts]

277
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,166
You okay?

278
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,458
[PLAKIA]
Yes, I'm fine.

279
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,666
The fourth one...

280
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,708
Watch out!

281
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,625
[PLAKIA yells]

282
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,500
[DUBUS, PLAKIA yell]

283
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,041
Are you all right, my dear?

284
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:35,916
Yes...

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,416
So did we succeed?

286
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,833
[beeping]

287
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,083
[DUBUS]
The explosions pushed the ship

288
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,000
a bit too far over...

289
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,166
You mean we have
to recalculate the orbit?

290
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,250
[gags]

291
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,125
You didn't use your Kiseegu?

292
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,250
But what about
all the radiation?

293
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,833
I had to rely on the headband.

294
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,875
It would've been
too difficult without it.

295
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,958
[PLAKIA]
Where are you going?

296
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,916
I've gotta get this ship
on a better orbit

297
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,291
before it's too late.

298
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,541
How will you do that?

299
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,541
I figured I'd have
another go at your idea

300
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,875
and try more explosions.

301
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,083
I'm going to come with you.

302
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,458
[groans]

303
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,416
Once this is over, we're
going home to Lakfakalle.

304
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,708
[PLAKIA]
As long as I'm with you...

305
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,125
Now you stay here.
I'll be all right on my own.

306
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,708
Or don't you trust me?

307
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,041
It might be completely
stupid of me,

308
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,500
but I'll trust you.

309
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,291
If you didn't trust me,
that would be stupid.

310
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,541
If that's really what you want,
then of course I'll stay.

311
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,333
[DUBUS] You should try and get
close to the front of the ship.

312
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,458
As far as you can.

313
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,666
[PLAKIA]
Don't be too long,

314
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,458
otherwise I'll
leave without you.

315
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,250
[DUBUS]
I'll be back as soon as I can.

316
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,833
This type of
reunion wasn't exactly

317
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,166
what I had in mind...

318
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:11,916
[PLAKIA gasps]

319
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,833
Do you want to
go back that badly?

320
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,833
Dubus, are you okay?

321
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:00,833
[PLAKIA gasps]

322
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,250
[DUBUS]
Plakia!

323
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,958
Plakia!

324
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,875
Are you all right?

325
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,708
Dubus, you're here...

326
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,000
What happened?

327
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,416
[PLAKIA]
Don't go in!

328
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,000
My darling, I hear you.

329
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,166
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

330
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,583
But I have to go in there.

331
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,750
I've got to.

332
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,500
[PLAKIA]
Stop it!

333
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,000
[DUBUS] What are you
afraid of? The truth?

334
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,208
[PLAKIA]
Let's just leave him alone.

335
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,125
[DUBUS]
I need to know, Plakia...

336
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,291
[PLAKIA]
Your Abriel pride again?

337
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,416
[DUBUS]
No, just good old human pride.

338
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,083
[PLAKIA] Do you have to
take the headband off?!

339
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,208
If you already know
who it is, Plakia,

340
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,541
then does it really
matter whether or not

341
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,125
I remove the headband?

342
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,750
[DUBUS] Well it would appear
that he's related to us.

343
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,333
[PLAKIA]
Why? Why did they come back?

344
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,583
They must have known
it was useless!

345
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,291
[DUBUS] They were probably
created with the specific

346
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,958
intention of coming back.

347
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,875
Coming back in a more advanced
form than our ancestors.

348
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,291
[PLAKIA]
Don't say that!

349
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:08,416
[NARRATOR speaking in Baronh]

350
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,125
That means...
those things we saw were...

351
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,750
But why?!

352
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,000
[DUBUS] I hope we can get
back to Lakfakalle safely.

353
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,500
[PLAKIA]
Why shouldn't we?

354
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,041
Once upon a time,
I thought the world

355
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,500
was based on common sense.

356
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,708
But if we keep coming
across situations like this,

357
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,750
I might have to
revise my opinion.

358
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,958
I wonder if they
managed to find

359
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,875
their way back home...

360
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,208
[DUBUS]
I expect so.

361
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,958
They simply came here
before having their wings

362
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,833
taken away.

363
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,333
[PLAKIA] I wonder if we'll
find our way back home.

364
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,708
[DUBUS] It's difficult
when you're on your own.

365
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,250
[PLAKIA] But we're not...
we have each other, right?

366
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,208
Of course we do, Plakia.

367
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,833
[DUBUS] I wish I had
some of your genes.

368
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,666
[PLAKIA chuckles]

369
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,291
I must admit I've heard
better compliments.

370
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,125
[DUBUS]
I'm sorry!

371
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,458
Oh, that's all right...

372
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,541
I still love you, my precious
Imperial Highness.

373
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,708
[PLAKIA] I still think
this place looks like

374
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,125
a burial ground.

375
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,708
No, it's the source of
a new star and a new life.

376
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,583
[DOCTOR]
The water's breaking...

377
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,750
[baby crying]

378
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,375
[DOCTOR]
Congratulations!

379
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,041
Is she really ours?

380
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,500
She doesn't look
anything like you!

381
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,041
She doesn't look
anything like you either!

382
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,875
Aren't her ears a bit
small for an Abriel?

383
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,208
[DUBUS]
That doesn't matter...

384
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,041
I name her Lafiel.

385
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,375
Captain.

386
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,250
Trainee Pilot Lafiel
reporting for duty!

387
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,458
At your service!

388
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,541
[PLAKIA]
Thank you.

389
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,875
I'll let you handle the
Third Calike.

390
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,291
I want you to take the
Calike and immediately

391
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,041
make your way to the
Planet Delktoe Spaceport.

392
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,500
There you will rendezvous
with Prince Jinto,

393
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,583
Count Lin Syune Locke Hyde.

394
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,916
If you need to brush up
on any of the details,

395
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,166
it's all written down
for you in part 14

396
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,583
of the ship's report.

397
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,208
Understood, Captain!

398
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,666
And I want you to promise
that you'll behave yourself.

399
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,750
Yes. Of course, Captain!

400
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,000
[PLAKIA]
Lafiel?

401
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,125
[DUBUS]
That's right.

402
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,291
"Laf" is the Abh word for "gem"

403
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:04,291
and also tells us that she
is a brave Abriel princess.

404
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,541
"Fiel" means the source of life.

405
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:10,750
Every new star has a mist
surrounding it called a Fiel.

406
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,166
In that mist are all
the elements needed

407
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,708
to create and sustain new life.

408
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,083
[DUBUS] Now please don't
go and say anything

409
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,375
that might bring
bad luck to the baby!

410
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,666
[PLAKIA]
Of course not!

411
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,791
[DUBUS] Lafiel... you do like
it as a name, don't you?

412
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:31,125
[PLAKIA] Considering you
thought of it, it's not bad!

413
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:34,208
[DUBUS]
Praise indeed, coming from you!

414
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,625
There's one more thing...

415
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,458
Would you keep the fact
that you're the genetic mother

416
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,791
a secret from her?

417
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,375
[PLAKIA]
Why?

418
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,375
[DUBUS] I believe that
secrets help build a richer,

419
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,833
more interesting personality.

420
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,250
[PLAKIA] I'm not going
to interfere with how

421
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,750
you want to bring her up,

422
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,500
but I don't think I've
ever heard anything

423
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,916
so stupid before in my life!

424
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,416
[DUBUS] Really?
I thought it was a great idea!

425
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,333
[PLAKIA] Well, you're the one
she's going to hate for it,

426
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,875
so it's up to you, I guess.

427
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,375
Don't you pay any
attention to what

428
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,000
he tries to teach you,
and you'll be just fine,

429
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,208
Your Highness!

430
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,625
[DUBUS] I wonder what kind of
person she'll grow up to be.

431
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,750
[PLAKIA] Well, if you're
the one who's raising her,

432
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,250
with any luck
she'll turn out to be

433
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,291
the complete opposite of you
and be a nice gentle child!

434
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,333
[DUBUS] What do you mean,
the opposite?!

435
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,458
[PLAKIA]
Are you sure want to know?

436
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,750
[DUBUS]
Not really!

437
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,875
[DUBUS] I've often
wondered if people learn

438
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,125
how to behave from the
people around them...

439
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,583
[PLAKIA]
I'm sure if you remember that,

440
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,166
you'll be just fine
bringing her up.

441
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,000
As for what the people of
Lakuryuush might think...

442
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,375
Who cares?

443
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:46,583
At the end of the day
they're just people like us.

444
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,791
[DUBUS] And you used
to be so concerned about

445
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,166
what people thought!

446
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,750
[PLAKIA] My precious
Imperial Highness...

447
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,875
[DUBUS] That's the nickname
I'm going to hand down

448
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,208
to this child!
