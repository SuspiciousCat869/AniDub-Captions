1
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:23,583
[NARRATOR speaking in Baronh]

2
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,791
We are the <i>Gosroth</i>
communications spacecraft.

3
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:00,750
We are calling the Baron
Febdash Area Control.

4
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,875
[MUINISHU] This is the Baron
Febdash Area Control.

5
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,375
[LAFIEL]
Requesting to refuel.

6
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:10,250
Communications spacecraft
of a patrol ship?

7
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,958
Roger.

8
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,208
We welcome you, communications
spacecraft of <i>Gosroth</i> .

9
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,291
Please indicate where
you wish to refuel.

10
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,250
[LAFIEL] Since this is
a light-weight craft,

11
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,041
we request to refuel
at the pier.

12
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,458
[MUINISHU]
Roger.

13
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,875
So what amount
of fuel do you...?

14
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,375
[gasps]

15
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,916
[MUINISHU]
Your Highness!

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,916
[JINTO]
Huh?

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,875
[JINTO]
They know her everywhere.

18
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,500
Can you lead us
over to the pier?

19
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:37,375
Of course, Your Highness!
Yes! Right away!

20
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:42,666
Baron Febdash Area Control,
I have important news for you.

21
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,208
[JINTO]
Hm.

22
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:49,250
[JINTO] We were unaware
of the death of <i>Gosroth</i> .

23
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:55,541
[JINTO] That may have been
a fortunate thing for us.

24
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,750
[JINTO] How long will
we be able to stay here?

25
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,375
[LAFIEL]
I'd say 30 minutes.

26
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,791
[JINTO]
That's it?

27
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,500
[LAFIEL] We must get to
Sufugnoff as soon as possible.

28
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,375
[JINTO]
I know that.

29
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:56,625
But how far ahead are we of the
enemy fleet in terms of time?

30
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,166
[LAFIEL] About 27 hours
in Sufugnoff time.

31
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,875
In that case, can't we...?

32
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,875
[gulps]

33
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,291
Uh, forget I mentioned it.

34
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,833
I'm grateful you
haven't forgotten.

35
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,125
[JINTO gasps]

36
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,958
Your Highness, we bid you
and your companion welcome.

37
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,291
I will escort you
to your quarters now.

38
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,166
I shall have you
do that, but...

39
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,666
I am presently a trainee
of the Star Forces.

40
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,833
I ask that you treat me as such.

41
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,500
Yes, we understand
what you say.

42
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,541
This way now. Please,
Your Highness.

43
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,500
It's always this formal?

44
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,083
Not at all!

45
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,625
[JINTO]
Huh?

46
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,416
[JINTO]
Hey...

47
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,583
[JINTO]
Hm?

48
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,791
You may sit over
here in this chair.

49
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,666
Huh? Why over there?

50
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,166
That's because...

51
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,291
[JINTO]
I get it.

52
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,583
I'm just no more to them

53
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,500
than a suspicious
person from the Land.

54
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:22,000
Jinto. Why are you
waiting there? Come here.

55
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,250
Okay.

56
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,708
What can I get you to drink
that would please you most?

57
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,958
Perhaps later.

58
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,125
I would like you to tell me

59
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,375
where I can take
a shower instead.

60
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:43,083
[MUINISHU] We cannot allow
a princess to bear a shower.

61
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,625
We will show you to our
executive bath hall.

62
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,000
Please give us a moment.

63
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,458
We don't have a lot of time.

64
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,500
And Imperial family
members shower, too.

65
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,083
I didn't realize.

66
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,625
I haven't the authority
to respond to that.

67
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,458
What drink can I prepare
for you to enjoy?

68
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,250
[LAFIEL]
Hmm...

69
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,500
Hm?

70
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,916
[JINTO]
Huh?

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,833
Uh... I'll have a
lemonade, please.

72
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,500
A nice cold one.

73
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,500
I'll have a hot til nom.

74
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,750
And with a slice of lope in it.

75
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,583
You out lope in your til nom?

76
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,750
That's a strange combination.

77
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,500
Huh?

78
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,666
[gasps]

79
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,708
[MUINISHU]
Very well.

80
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,875
I shall bring you your
til nom right away.

81
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,541
Just one moment.

82
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,000
Gee, I wonder if they'll
bring my lemonade.

83
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,708
Seelnay! How-How could you?

84
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,333
I'm terribly sorry,
Your Highness!

85
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,458
What's the matter?

86
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,333
[SEELNAY] I spilt the drink
I just served you.

87
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,125
I-I don't know how I can
repay you for my failure.

88
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,791
I-I beg you to please
accept my apology.

89
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,583
Your failure? You mean this?

90
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,958
Oh my goodness gracious!

91
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,541
L-Let me clean your fingers
for you immediately, okay?

92
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,250
You needn't bother with that.

93
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,333
I'm not sure how much you know
about Abhs raised in palaces,

94
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,750
but I can wipe my own fingers.

95
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,541
[SEELNAY]
I realize that, but I...

96
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,791
[JINTO] But y'know,
I think it'd be really silly

97
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,583
to take this subject
any further.

98
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,583
Uh, yes, uh...

99
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,875
I don't feel
comfortable in here.

100
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,708
Maybe I'll wash up elsewhere.

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,291
I'm sorry for not
greeting Your Highness.

102
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,541
I know you as Lafiel of
the Clyuve Royal Family.

103
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:04,041
I am Viscountess Abriel
Nei Dobrusk Paryunu Lafiel.

104
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:08,583
I'm Baron Atosryua Syun
Atos Febdash Klowal.

105
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,958
The pleasure is all mine.

106
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,541
[LAFIEL] Mine as well, Baron.

107
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,125
This is His Excellency,

108
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,333
Prince of Count Lin
Syun Rock Hyde, Jinto.

109
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,708
[JINTO] Nice to meet you,
Your Excellency.

110
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,416
I'm very pleased to have you
as a guest, Your Excellency.

111
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,166
Your Highness, I beg you.

112
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,166
Please accept my apology
for a most grievous error.

113
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,750
Which is?

114
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,375
[FEBDASH] We've made
an unfortunate mistake.

115
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,541
We've just realized that
we lack the fuel you need.

116
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,125
That can't be! Your Controller
confirmed to me--

117
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,708
[FEBDASH]
I'm terribly sorry.

118
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,833
I've accelerated a
fuel-filled asteroid.

119
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,958
It should be here soon.

120
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,833
[LAFIEL]
How long will it be?

121
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,958
[FEBDASH] It shouldn't
be more than 12 hours.

122
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,000
Twelve hours?

123
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,250
Your Highness, please.

124
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:01,333
In the meantime, you may sit
back and relax in my palace.

125
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,583
Thanks for your offer,
but we can't.

126
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,041
I'm still on duty.

127
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,291
We'll fly out on our ship
to meet the asteroid.

128
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,166
But I understand that your
communications spacecraft

129
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,583
is in need of a check-up,
Your Highness.

130
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,708
[JINTO]
Hm?

131
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,333
A check-up, huh?

132
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,750
[FEBDASH]
Your Highness,

133
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,416
please accept my sincere
desire to welcome you.

134
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,458
[LAFIEL] I've already explained
our situation to the vassal.

135
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,833
I'm sure you've got things to
do other than welcoming us.

136
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,250
Don't you need to plan an
escape from this territory?

137
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,541
[FEBDASH]
I appreciate your concern.

138
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,875
However, we do not
have ships here.

139
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,583
There are no means of escape.

140
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,875
I see. Yet--

141
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,541
A vassal will show
you around the place.

142
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,125
I shall see you at
the dinner table.

143
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,958
That man was obviously
ignoring you.

144
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,416
I guess.

145
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,875
[LAFIEL] I can't trust
someone with that attitude.

146
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,375
To welcome me properly,

147
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,750
he should also make
you feel welcome.

148
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,708
You're right.
But it can't be helped.

149
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:12,166
You're a royal Princess, and I'm
some insignificant nobleman.

150
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,500
It's a trick.

151
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,250
I think he's lying about
the check-up of our ship.

152
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:20,500
It's as if he's deliberately
trying to hold us back here.

153
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,250
For what purpose?

154
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,208
[LAFIEL]
I don't know.

155
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,333
Aren't you perhaps becoming
a little too suspicious, Lafiel?

156
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,250
I seriously don't
like him at all!

157
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,291
In that case, let's think
this through logically.

158
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,333
Is there any benefit for him
to go to the trouble of lying

159
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,041
just to keep us back?

160
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,791
[LAFIEL]
Hmm...

161
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,291
You have that "I just might
think of something" look.

162
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,708
How 'bout this?

163
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,625
The Baron is keeping us back

164
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,333
so he can steal our
communications spacecraft

165
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,250
to get away from
the enemy fleet.

166
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,958
[LAFIEL]
That ship is double seated.

167
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,000
It only handles two people.

168
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,500
[JINTO]
It would be plenty if the Baron

169
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,583
was planning to escape alone.

170
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,916
[LAFIEL]
And leave his vassals behind?

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,708
You don't trust
the Baron at all,

172
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,125
but you do trust his
sense of righteousness?

173
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,333
Stop it! Just leave
his ethics out of it.

174
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,708
Nothing is worse than deserting
one's vassals and citizens.

175
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:22,000
The laws of the Empire against
that act are severe!

176
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,625
With the added crime of
stealing a spaceboat,

177
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,250
he'd have a better future
in a concentration camp

178
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,958
of the United Mankind,

179
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,041
rather than remaining
within the Empire.

180
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,208
I see. So a title is a duty.

181
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,583
Right. A title is a duty.

182
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,250
[JINTO] So you're
saying that the Baron

183
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,916
is not planning any
sort of conspiracy.

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,958
[LAFIEL]
I guess that would be true.

185
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,833
[JINTO] In that case,
let him welcome you.

186
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,083
I'll also do what I can.

187
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,416
[MUINISHU]
Your Highness.

188
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
A luxurious bath has been
prepared. Please follow me.

189
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,125
The others will escort
you, Your Excellency.

190
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:09,125
Huh? Uh, we can't take
a bath together, right?

191
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,541
[MUINISHU]
Hmm.

192
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,375
[JINTO]
Huh?

193
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,708
Why don't you just go ahead?

194
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,833
We haven't got much time.

195
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,625
[LAFIEL]
That's true.

196
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,916
Bye.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,291
[LAFIEL]
Goodbye.

198
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,208
See you later.

199
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,416
[SEELNAY]
Let me wash your back for you.

200
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,583
[LAFIEL]
No.

201
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,166
[SEELNAY]
Let me wash your hair for you.

202
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,208
[LAFIEL]
No.

203
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,708
[SEELNAY] Please. Do not
hesitate to let us serve you.

204
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:45,416
I'm not hesitating, thanks.

205
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,791
Hm?

206
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,375
Are you all aware
that an enemy fleet

207
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,333
is heading toward Sufugnoff?

208
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,375
Yes.

209
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,625
[LAFIEL]
Aren't you afraid?

210
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,833
No. I'm sure our master
will handle everything.

211
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,125
The Baron? And how
will he handle things?

212
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,833
I don't know how exactly.

213
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:06,875
[LAFIEL]
Hmm...

214
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,541
The Baron is
certainly well trusted.

215
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,875
Of course he's well trusted!

216
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,958
If it weren't for his kindness,
I would not be where I am today.

217
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,041
What do you mean?

218
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,500
It had been a dream of mine

219
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,208
to become a citizen
of the Empire.

220
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,083
However...

221
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,708
The status of women
is extremely low,

222
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,208
and there's little
hope of being more

223
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,416
than a good wife and mother.

224
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
[LAFIEL]
I can't imagine it.

225
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,708
[SEELNAY] My master
saved me from that world.

226
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,375
And he even gave
me an education.

227
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:40,958
[LAFIEL]
Education?

228
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,375
[SEELNAY]
Yes.

229
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,458
I am normally in charge of
inspecting fuel equipment.

230
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,125
I received my education
in that field.

231
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:51,208
[LAFIEL] So serving in the bath
hall is not your main duty.

232
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,708
[SEELNAY]
No.

233
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,208
In fact, this is my first time
to serve at the bath hall.

234
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:59,291
I've never been called upon
to give the master a bath.

235
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,916
Are the other vassals called
upon to wash the Baron's back?

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
[SEELNAY]
Yes.

237
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,875
Oh, the master is
a very kind person.

238
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,166
[LAFIEL]
He certainly doesn't look it.

239
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,041
[LAFIEL] How many people are
there in this territory?

240
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,333
About... 50 people.

241
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,375
[LAFIEL]
How many of them are Abh?

242
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,000
[SEELNAY] There are two.
The master and his father.

243
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,000
[LAFIEL] It seems to me
like an awfully lonely life.

244
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,625
[SEELNAY] It's true that
it somewhat lacks

245
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,041
challenge and excitement,

246
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,916
but it's a worry-free lifestyle,

247
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,291
so I really have no complaints.

248
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,458
So I'm a convenient
piece of entertainment.

249
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,333
[gasps] Not at all!

250
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,500
[gasps]

251
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,458
And what is this?

252
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,000
Do you expect me to wear this?

253
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,333
Those were the
master's orders.

254
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,750
[LAFIEL] Where did you
put my military uniform?

255
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,291
It is presently being washed.

256
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,208
You treat guests well.

257
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,375
[VASSAL 2] Also, military
uniforms are considered savage

258
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,500
at the dinner table.

259
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:07,750
Savage? I only wear
military uniforms.

260
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,125
But...

261
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,833
Your Highness! Please.

262
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,416
Please.

263
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,625
[LAFIEL] I'll wear the dress
over my military uniform.

264
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,750
That should be okay, right?

265
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,250
A very warm welcome
to you, Your Highness.

266
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,166
Where's Jinto?

267
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,875
[FEBDASH]
Jinto?

268
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,833
Oh, you refer to
Prince of Count Hyde.

269
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,958
My father is entertaining
His Excellency.

270
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,291
[LAFIEL] Why is your father
not joining us for dinner?

271
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,625
My father doesn't like company.

272
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,208
[LAFIEL]
That seems strange.

273
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,375
Why send a guest to your father
who prefers to be alone?

274
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,375
Fellow sufferers do pity
one another, don't they?

275
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,833
What do you mean?

276
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,416
Never mind. Nothing.

277
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,125
I cannot ignore this.
I have orders to take Jinto,

278
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,500
Prince of Count Hyde,
to Sufugnoff.

279
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,291
[FEBDASH]
Pardon me, Your Highness.

280
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,250
You're not insinuating that
we'd do anything to harm

281
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,458
His Excellency, are you?

282
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,208
You're acting suspicious.

283
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,041
This saddens me.

284
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,583
In any case, please have a seat.

285
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,833
Allow me to resolve these
misunderstandings over dinner.

286
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,333
[LAFIEL] I do hope they
are misunderstandings.

287
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,458
What wine would you
like with your meal?

288
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,208
I'm on duty. Something
non-alcoholic, please.

289
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:39,583
As you wish. How about
some tule lashban?

290
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,333
[FEBDASH]
By the way,

291
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,958
I noticed that you address
that young man by his name.

292
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:51,625
Please feel free to do the same
with me and call me Klowal.

293
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,375
No thank you.

294
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,791
Why is that?

295
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,166
I don't want to call
you that, Baron.

296
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,375
[FEBDASH]
Please. Go right ahead.

297
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,750
Delicious!

298
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,875
I'm honored, Your Highness.

299
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,416
[LAFIEL]
I wasn't complimenting you.

300
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,708
I was referring to
whoever prepared this.

301
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,041
This was prepared by
hand, not machines.

302
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,500
Am I right?

303
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,333
Yes, very observant.

304
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,833
I'm not too fond of machines
preparing my meal.

305
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,625
[FEBDASH] But I sense
you are terribly upset

306
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,708
about something, Your Highness.

307
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,791
Very observant, Baron.

308
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,000
I am angry.

309
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,416
[FEBDASH] Is it about that
young man from the Land?

310
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,583
Jinto is an Abh noble.

311
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,000
[FEBDASH]
Yes, I recall.

312
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,000
[LAFIEL]
It's not only about Jinto.

313
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,208
Are you sure the
communications spacecraft

314
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,375
needs to be checked?

315
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,250
You've got no shortage of fuel.

316
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,791
I'm doubting you on
a number of issues.

317
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,041
Oh, yes, I have been lying
to you about those things.

318
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,916
We do have plenty of fuel,

319
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,291
and we are not checking
your spacecraft.

320
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,500
Then why did you lie?

321
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,916
You wouldn't have accepted
my invitation for dinner

322
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,708
no matter how much I
asked, Your Highness.

323
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,375
[LAFIEL] Of course not.
We're in a hurry.

324
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,666
So then, it only
proves that lying

325
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,166
was the correct thing to do.

326
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,708
Now that I know you've lied,

327
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,875
you will let me leave
here, will you not?

328
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,625
[FEBDASH] Your Highness,
in regard to you leaving...

329
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,875
Would you be able to delay
your departure a little,

330
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,375
for your sake and for mine?

331
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,791
For how long?

332
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,750
[FEBDASH] Until the next ship
from the Empire arrives.

333
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,541
In other words, until the safety
of our territory is guaranteed.

334
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,833
We don't know how
long it'd take.

335
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,208
[FEBDASH]
Exactly.

336
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,208
[LAFIEL] So you're trying to
hold us up until then?

337
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,541
[FEBDASH]
Yes.

338
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,291
[LAFIEL] What do you wish to
gain in keeping us from leaving?

339
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,625
Do you have some sort
of grudge against us?

340
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,750
[FEBDASH]
Not a chance.

341
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,666
As long as you're
here, Your Highness,

342
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,916
I will do everything to
make your stay enjoyable.

343
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I couldn't even think of doing
anything to harm you.

344
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,500
Oh?

345
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,541
I am no longer sure if you
understand what you are doing.

346
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,791
Your actions are very serious.

347
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,708
[FEBDASH]
Of course I understand.

348
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:38,083
I am doing my best
to protect the territory.

349
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,375
[LAFIEL] What does confining
us to your spaceport

350
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,875
have anything to do with
the safety of your territory?

351
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,791
[FEBDASH] Nation Sufugnoff
is a large area.

352
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,833
The United Mankind
knows where it's situated.

353
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,375
However, our Baron territory
is much smaller,

354
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,208
with a short history.

355
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,833
There is a great possibility

356
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:01,416
they have never heard of our
Febdash Baron Territory.

357
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,833
However, what if they
observed a ship

358
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,083
pass through the
gates of Febdash?

359
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,958
If this territory had
not been recorded

360
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,791
on their information network,

361
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,125
it would be the deciding
factor for them to attack.

362
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,500
But we already passed through
the gates of Febdash, right?

363
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,291
How can you be certain
we weren't observed?

364
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,375
It's true you may
have been seen.

365
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:25,375
However, let us not give them
another chance to see your ship.

366
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,166
There's no sense giving the
enemy a second chance.

367
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,000
You do have a point.

368
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,625
So, therefore, Your Highness,
I understand your reluctance,

369
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,958
but could you please
remain at this spaceport

370
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,916
until the enemy has
left the vicinity

371
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,583
and you're safe once again?

372
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,583
You know that you're
obstructing the progress

373
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,041
of a communications
spacecraft.

374
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,416
Aren't you worried that
the Empire may take away

375
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,208
a territory which you
tried to protect?

376
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,208
I don't believe so.

377
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,291
I am very passionate to
protect the territory.

378
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:59,708
The higher courts of the Empire
will deem my actions proper.

379
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,875
[LAFIEL] Even if Sufugnoff
comes under attack

380
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,041
before we have a
chance to warn it?

381
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,166
[FEBDASH] That shouldn't
be a problem either.

382
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,791
There's a lot of traffic
surrounding Sufugnoff.

383
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,166
If not you, I'm sure someone
else will inform them

384
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,125
that an enemy fleet
is approaching.

385
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:18,375
In which case, there should be
nothing wrong with my actions.

386
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,458
I do trust that you will
indeed testify favorably

387
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,583
to the courts that I took
very, very good care of you,

388
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,625
Your Highness.

389
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,958
As a faithful Abriel.

390
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,958
How dare you.

391
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,750
[LAFIEL] Forget about me.
How is Jinto doing?

392
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,416
[FEBDASH] My father is looking
after Prince of Count Hyde.

393
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,666
[LAFIEL] You shall stop
with the games, Baron.

394
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,000
I hate being deceived.

395
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,583
[FEBDASH]
I understand.

396
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,125
Since that young man
doesn't deserve

397
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,750
to be treated as a nobleman,

398
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,791
he is receiving the appropriate
treatment for someone from Land.

399
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,750
How many times should
I say this? He's a nobleman.

400
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,541
I understand that you
have a peculiar opinion

401
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,708
toward the rank of citizens.

402
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,541
I've never seen such servile
citizens as your vassals.

403
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:15,875
They're like cats trained to do
tricks. It's painful to watch.

404
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,625
The relationship between
a lord and his vassals

405
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,833
is no one else's business,
Your Highness.

406
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,375
[LAFIEL]
You're right.

407
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,458
I'd like to know what you regard
as the appropriate treatment

408
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,083
for someone from Land.

409
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:32,791
[FEBDASH] It's nothing for you
to worry about, Your Highness.

410
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,666
[LAFIEL]
Another thing I noticed.

411
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,958
Are there no men at all
among your vassals?

412
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:45,958
[FEBDASH] No. I can't stand
having men from Land around me.

413
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:54,333
You've given me another
reason to dislike you.

414
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,333
[JINTO]
I hear that Abhs sometimes smile

415
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,208
in front of those they hate.

416
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,291
"The smile of an Abh."

417
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,958
It is so gruesome-looking
that they say it is much like

418
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:10,250
a poisonous flower
in all its glory.

419
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:14,416
I have yet to see Lafiel
make such an expression.

420
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,958
The Baron has him confined.

421
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,500
It's quite important
that you take me

422
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,791
to your son, immediately.

423
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,750
I'm not able to, young man.

424
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,708
And why is that?

425
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,625
[ALISA gasps]

426
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,125
[LAFIEL]
Stay exactly where you are!

427
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,041
I am going to rescue Jinto
with or without your assistance.

428
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:06,750
[screams]

429
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,458
It's an exit!

430
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,958
Why it doesn't belong
to the Baron at all.

431
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,875
It belongs to the
Star Forces ship.
