[MOGUZO]
Breakfast is gonna be a feast!

00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,500
You must really like cooking

to go to all this trouble.

00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,583
I mean, you aren't
even on breakfast duty.

What do you like better?

7
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,000
Eating food or making it?

Oh, no!

[MOGUZO]
I can't choose. I like both.

I think I always have.

11
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:12,000
Cooking for people must've
been a hobby of mine.

You know, before Grimgar.

13
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,875
Even if people don't
like the stuff I make,

14
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,333
I like to make it.

What? Are you crazy?

Everybody loves your cooking!

It doesn't matter what you make.
It's delicious.

Do you mean it?

19
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,166
Of course I do!

20
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,000
Thanks for that.

I'm not sorry.

26

It was an accident.

27
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,583
An unfortunate accident.

Quit digging the hole deeper!

Just apologize!

Y'know, I don't get why
you're making such

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,250
a big deal out of this.

You're a peeping tom,
and you know it!

I should call the police!

What police?

There aren't any here.

And besides,
we didn't see squat.

Your damn towels were
covering all the good bits.

I thought you weren't looking!

Come on, you're
as flat as a board.

I'll give you one chance to
admit the complete truth.

Do it right now and I
won't get angry with you.

Okay, cool.

Then yeah, you're right.

I tried to climb
the bath house wall

and it just kinda crumbled.

I've learned my lesson, though.

Maybe we can catch up.

00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,625
[HARUHIRO]

I count two,
maybe three of them.

[YUME]
Not a lone boblin, then, huh?

00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,500
I'm just gonna assume
you meant "goblin."

Let's go back.

74
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,125
[YUME] I think Shihoru might
be pretty upset for a while.

75
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,833
[HARUHIRO]
I know. I really am sorry.

76
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,833
[YUME]
It might be okay if it was you.

77
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,916
I'm not saying it would
be okay if you saw stuff,

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,791
'cause it wouldn't.

79
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,291
Not at all.

80
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,583
But if you did see stuff,

81
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,458
I know you would apologize.

82
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,416
Not that apologizing
makes it okay,

83
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
because it doesn't.

I'm sorry, but to be honest

87
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,250
I'm not entirely sure
what you're saying.

88

Yeah. Neither am I, actually.

Well...

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,791
I'm just guessing here,
but maybe,

91
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,166
what you're saying
is that you forgive me?

That sounds good.

But that doesn't mean
what happened was okay.

00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,625
I know that.

So what's the plan, then?

is go back to Ortana.

"Great pains but all in vain."

that what I just said?

Did it come out wrong?

106
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,666
[HARUHIRO]
A little bit.

107
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,875
That's it, then.
No money today.

108

[HARUHIRO] The next day,
the day after that,

109
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,166
and the day after that,

110
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,750
we barely earned
anything at all.

111
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,416
And when I say barely,

112
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,958
what I really mean
is next to nothing.

113
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,458
Okay, fine.

114
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,333
To be honest, we made nothing.

115
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,166
We bought new clothes
when we got here,

116
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,500
but they're already
starting to wear out.

117
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,833
They're sturdy enough,

118
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,125
but they aren't really
made for fighting goblins

119
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,541
and hiking mountain
trails every day.

120
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,250
We're trying to make them last,

121
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,833
but we can only do so much.

122
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:07,166
I'd give anything for
a new pair of underwear.

123
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,833
But the clothes in this
world are really expensive.

124
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,250
At least relatively.

125
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,333
Given how little we've made,

126
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,666
we can't afford
to buy anything new.

127
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,375
Not even underwear.

128
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,583
So we've got no choice but
to wash them every night

129
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,458
and go to sleep without them.

130
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,750
We put them on again
in the morning,

131
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,708
even if they're a little damp.

132
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,166
Damp underwear
is better than none.

133
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,833
No! Enough is enough.

134
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,708
Tomorrow I will make enough
money for new underwear!

They can't go around

Wandering the halls at night
without any underwear on--

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,041
It won't work.

It won't work at all.

160

164
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,250
What's wrong?

165
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,375
I'm fine, okay?

166
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,416
[RANTA]
Hm?

167
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,208
What the hell?

168
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,708
No point washing
your clothes in this rain.

169
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,958
Nothing's gonna dry.

170
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,625
Why don't you just
do it tomorrow?

171
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,625
Who knows if it'll
let up tomorrow?

172
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,000
Besides, you're
the one who told me

173
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,916
I should wash my clothes
out once in a while

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,083
to get rid of the stink.

175
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,250
Why the change of heart?

176
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,666
[HARUHIRO]
I'm just trying to help you out.

177
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,500
I wish I hadn't washed
my stuff, y'know?

178
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,750
[laughs]

179
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,833
[HARUHIRO]
Whatever I do,

180
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,125
I can't let Shameless
the Great here

181
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,916
get close to
the girls right now.

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,708
I don't know what he would do,
but I doubt it would be good.

183
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:17,583
[RANTA]
I guess you're right.

184
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,083
Doing laundry sucks, anyway.

185
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,208
Yeah, totally.

186
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,666
Good call.

187
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,708
I was hoping that I might
run into the girls, though.

188
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,583
[cackles]

189
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,958
Oh, yeah?
That doesn't surprise me.

190
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,500
[HARUHIRO]
That was a close one.

191
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,083
I don't think it's a good idea
for them to go commando.

192
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,500
I should tell them.

193
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,708
Or should I?

194
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,416
No! I'll tell them.

195
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,500
[HARUHIRO]
This is Damuro.

196
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,500
It was the second city
of the Arabakia Kingdom.

197
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,708
Damuro was much
bigger than Ortana.

198
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,583
But now it's in ruins,
and overrun by goblins.

199
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,833
There are a lot of goblins
in the new city area,

200
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,250
but they're strong
and well organized.

201
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,416
Too difficult for us.

202
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,166
So we're headed to the old city

203
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,833
to target the ones who
have gotten separated

204
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,083
from their groups.

205
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,875
[HARUHIRO]
We're careful,

206
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,083
but this isn't
the forest anymore.

207
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,583
There's more of a chance
for encounters here,

208
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,000
and that means there's
more of a chance to get hurt.

209
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,791
[HARUHIRO]
Guys, we've got a loner.

210
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,958
And he's sleeping.

211
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,500
[MANATO]
All right. Let's do it.

212
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,916
[MANATO] Moguzo's armor will
make his approach noisy.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,791
So Haruhiro, Ranta, and I will
handle the initial attack.

214
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,541
If we can close in on the
goblin without waking him,

215
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,083
the three of us will finish it.

216
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,541
If we do wake him...
Yume, use your bow.

217
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,250
Shihoru, back us up with magic.

218
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,916
And Moguzo, take the front.

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,333
If it becomes a head-on fight,

220
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,416
we'll use the same
formation as before.

221
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,458
Surround him so
he can't get away.

222
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,833
[GOBLIN yells]

223
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:55,458
[MANATO]
Keep at him!

224
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,708
Oh, crap!

225
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
[RANTA]
Dammit!

226
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,000
[RANTA]
Is he dead?

227
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,041
[HARUHIRO] It's a lot
easier this way--

228
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,750
Going after them in their sleep.

229
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,041
[RANTA] I need to get
a claw or something.

230
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:18,833
For my Vice.

231
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,791
[coins clinking]

232
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,041
[YUME]
Wow! Look at all that!

233
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,916
This is our best haul yet!

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,416
Of course, I guess it is
only our second, huh?

235
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,083
Four whole silvers.

236
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,166
[MOGUZO]
Whoa.

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,166
We did well, but we
can't celebrate just yet.

238
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,500
We got lucky.

239
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,208
Today was easy, but it
won't always be like this.

240
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,541
Stay sharp and look
for our next target.

241
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,750
[RANTA]
Aw, c'mon, Manato.

242
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,208
Don't be such a killjoy.

243
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,750
Thanks to my skill and daring,

244
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,375
we killed ourselves a goblin
and got our biggest score yet.

245
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,208
But that's not a good enough
reason to celebrate for ya?

246
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,666
You're right, Ranta.

247
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,875
Maybe we should
enjoy today's success.

248
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,583
You did a really
good job back there.

249
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,916
I know, right?

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,166
And didn't I seem totally
like a Dark Knight,

251
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,125
the way I stabbed that
dirty gob in the neck

252
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,958
and smiled cruelly while he
struggled and bled all over?

253
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,625
[HARUHIRO] That's not how
I remember it happening.

254
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,666
[RANTA]
Shut up!

255
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,750
I got him good,
with one clean blow.

256
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,000
Come on, Haruhiro,
where are your eyes?

257
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,666
Oh, wait, there they are!

258
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,833
They're so small I almost
thought they'd disappeared,

259
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,208
but I see them now!

260
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,291
[HARUHIRO] Seriously, are we
going to do this again?

261
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,791
[RANTA]
Is that all you're gonna say?

262
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,541
Come on, man, defend yourself!

263
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,916
[HARUHIRO]
How many times is that now?

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,875
It's getting old.

265
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,375
[HARUHIRO] We'd defeated an
enemy and earned some money.

266
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,125
That seemed to lighten
everyone's mood a little bit.

267
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,750
Not completely though.

268
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,125
We still have a lot
of work ahead of us.

269
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,875
But at least
we're getting better.

270
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,750
Who knows, before long
maybe we'll be thinking

271
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,125
and acting like real
Volunteer Soldiers.

272
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,666
[HARUHIRO]
We'd found a system that worked.

273
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,583
We targeted lone goblins
and defeated them

274
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,666
by working together.

275
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,791
In Damuro, we'd
sometimes run into groups

276
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,083
of five or more of the monsters.

277
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,875
A pair was hard enough
for us to handle,

278
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,583
so five would have
been ridiculous.

279
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,875
Fighting kept us busy,

280
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,083
but we had another
task to work on.

281
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,750
As we roamed the old city,
we added to a map we'd begun.

282
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,041
We explored new places
whenever we could,

283
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,583
learning our way around.

284
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,750
Before long, we were navigating
the ruins pretty well.

285
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,208
It was always nerve-wracking
to map a new area,

286
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,125
but bit by bit,
our map expanded.

287
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,041
Our confidence grew.

288
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,166
Finally, things were going well.

289
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,416
[CLERK]
That'll be thirty coppers, boy.

290
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,250
[HARUHIRO]
Thirty?

291
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,833
It's secondhand!

292
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,416
I might consider it
for fifteen, but no more.

293
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,083
It'd go for a hundred new,
but since I'm in a good mood,

294
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,666
I'll let you have it
for twenty-eight.

295
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,416
[HARUHIRO] I could go
as much as twenty coppers,

296
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,958
but even that's stretching it.

297
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,000
I've still got more
things left to buy.

298
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,791
Twenty-five,
and not a copper less.

299
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,875
Though this is robbery
if you ask me!

300
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,458
You've got a deal!

301
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,708
[HARUHIRO]
Woo-hoo!

302
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,916
[slurping]

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,083
[RANTA] Man, I could eat
a whole bucket of this stuff.

304
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,333
What's it called again?

305
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,083
[MOGUZO] I think I heard
somebody call it soruzo.

306
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,916
[RANTA]
Whatever it is, it's awesome!

307
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,916
[slurping]

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,125
[MOGUZO]
Can we get another order?

309
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,250
[CHEF]
Comin' up.

310
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:11,916
[SHIHORU gasps]

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,708
[YUME]
Huh?

312
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,583
Why are you hiding?

313
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,625
[SHIHORU]
I... I can't.

314
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,500
I'm still too embarrassed.

315
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,791
[YUME giggles]

316
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,958
Huh? Oh, I see.

317
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,833
You were hoping he actually
would stop and talk to you.

318
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,708
[YUME chuckles]

319
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,500
[MANATO] The blade
was pretty nicked, huh?

320
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,875
It's taken a beating.

321
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,416
Before I do anything
else at night,

322
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,041
I like to make sure that my
weapons are in good condition.

323
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,458
I get antsy otherwise.

324
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,666
Yeah. I understand that.

325
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,958
Just listen to us,
talking about cleaning weapons.

326
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,000
We sound like Volunteer
Soldiers already.

327
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,750
Well, that makes
sense, doesn't it?

328
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,875
We are Volunteer Soldiers.

329
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,416
Just trainees, technically.

330
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,333
[door opens]

331
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,833
[MANATO]
Wow. Good job!

332
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,375
I'm sorry.

333
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,416
We would have been back sooner,

334
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,375
but Ranta just
kept haggling, so...

335
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,416
[RANTA]
Of course I haggled!

336
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,708
That's what you're
supposed to do.

337
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,208
And look what it got us.

338
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,791
Are you sure you
didn't get too much?

339
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,916
Some of it might go bad
before we can finish it.

340
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,291
Anything that rots is yours.

341
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,250
[MANATO] We can buy weapons,
clothes, and food.

342
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,875
That's fine.

343
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,833
But you know what I've
been thinking lately?

344
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,125
What if we tried
saving up a little

345
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,708
so we can learn new skills?

346
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,125
You sure about that?

347
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,541
I don't think you guys
could handle it

348
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,291
if my skills got any sharper.

349
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,166
Oh, please!

350
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,208
And what do you mean "skills"?

351
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,375
You've only got
one skill right now.

352
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,791
Shut up, you!

353
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,791
That just means I can
focus on polishing

354
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,916
that one skill
as much as possible.

355
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,666
Until it shines with dark light!

356
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,375
[MANATO]
Did you buy that, too?

357
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,458
[MOGUZO]
This? No, I made it.

358
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,958
You carved this?

359
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,416
You're better with your hands
than I would've expected.

360
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,083
[HARUHIRO] You know, Moguzo,
you could sell that.

361
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,583
Oh, I'm not really
doing it to make money.

362
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,708
Carving just helps me
relax, that's all.

363
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,125
[MANATO]
Oh.

364
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,416
I bet Yume would
like something like this.

365
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,750
[HARUHIRO]
Yeah?

366
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,375
What made you think about
Yume all of a sudden?

367
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,916
Nothing.

368
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,083
Girls just like
that kinda thing.

369
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,458
[YUME] You know,
Haru had a great idea.

370
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,083
He said if we earned
a little extra money

371
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,041
we could buy some
spare sets of clothing.

372
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,375
That way we wouldn't have
to do laundry nearly as often.

373
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,666
Wouldn't that be nice?

374
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah. That sounds
like a good idea.

375
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,958
Doing laundry all
the time is a pain.

376
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,916
Isn't it?

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
[SHIHORU]
Yeah.

378
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,708
[YUME]
Oh, look at that!

379
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,750
What a pretty hair clip.

380
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,916
You have great taste!

381
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,625
Oh... You mean this?

382
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,416
Thank you.

383
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
[YUME]
Yup.

384
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,333
Shihoru...

385
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,916
I know that you have a really
hard time talking to the guys,

386
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,833
but maybe you should
try once in a while.

387
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,500
Join in a conversation or two.

388
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,083
I think it would
do you some good.

389
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,458
[SHIHORU]
Yeah, you're probably right.

390
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,208
[YUME]
You don't have to.

391
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,291
It's not like I can
tell you what to do.

392
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,041
I just worry about how
quiet you are sometimes.

393
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,500
I don't want you to feel like
you're not part of the group.

394
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,666
You know?

395
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,458
I'll try to talk more.

396
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,875
Glad I didn't upset you.

397
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:26,916
You know me.

398
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,833
I'm not always
so good with words.

399
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,541
[HARUHIRO]
Manato?

400
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,625
Yeah?

401
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,375
[HARUHIRO]
Uh...

402
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,458
Just... thank you. That's all.

403
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,125
[MANATO laughs]
Where did that come from?

404
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,291
[HARUHIRO chuckles]

405
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,583
Sorry, I was going
to say something

406
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,708
completely different,
and that just came out.

407
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,541
[MANATO laughs]
You shouldn't thank me.

408
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,791
I'm the one who's
grateful to all of you.

409
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,791
[HARUHIRO]
Huh? Really?

410
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,583
You feel grateful to us?

411
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,958
What for?

412
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,541
Plenty of stuff, but
mostly for being my friends.

413
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,791
It means a lot.

414
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,625
I don't know.
Maybe I didn't say that right.

415
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,125
It came out sounding
kinda cheesy or fake.

416
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,416
It didn't.

417
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,250
That was actually a
really nice thing to say.

418
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,625
It's just...

419
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,500
How should I put this?

420
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,250
Anyone can see that we need you
more than you need us.

421
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,458
If you weren't around,

422
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,041
we wouldn't have the
first idea what to do,

423
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,333
you know?

424
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,250
And that's assuming
we'd even still be alive.

425
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,708
Trust me.
I need all of you, too.

426
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,500
If it wasn't for our group,

427
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,375
I don't know what
would've happened to me.

428
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,083
We wouldn't last very long
in this world by ourselves.

429
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,166
None of us.

430
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,333
[HARUHIRO]
I totally agree, but, well...

431
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,750
I don't want you to
take this the wrong way

432
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,458
or anything, but...

433
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,875
Don't you think
you could've joined up

434
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,333
with another group pretty
easily if you'd wanted to?

435
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,916
You might not
have been the leader,

436
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,375
but you could've asked to
join someone else's party.

437
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,083
[MANATO] That never
really occurred to me.

438
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,750
Honestly, I'm not sure
it would've worked.

439
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,250
I think I kind of
like being a leader.

440
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,250
Who knows, maybe I
used to have problems

441
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,416
with authority or something.

442
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
[HARUHIRO]
Heh. Nah.

443
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,708
I can't see that.

444
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,000
I bet I did, though.

445
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,166
Well, anyway,
that's why I'm grateful.

446
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,125
I get the feeling I'm
not the kind of person

447
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,541
who makes friends easily.

448
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,416
I don't think that's true.

449
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,750
[HARUHIRO]
That's easy to say,

450
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:52,166
but the fact of the matter is
I have no way to prove it.

451
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,375
I only know the Manato
in this world,

452
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,500
not the one you were before.

453
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,125
But still...

454
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,500
It doesn't really matter
what you were like before.

455
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,958
Nobody cares.

456
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,083
We're in Grimgar now.

457
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,250
The Manato in this world
is our friend and leader.

458
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,000
The guy we count on.

459
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,458
That's all that matters to us.

460
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,708
Let's get some sleep.

461
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,708
We have an early day tomorrow.

462
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,083
[HARUHIRO]
Did I say too much?

463
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,708
I hope I didn't
embarrass him or anything.

464
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,666
I just...

465
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,375
I just wanted him to know
we really are his friends.

466
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,583
[HARUHIRO]
Day twenty-three in Grimgar.

467
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,750
I'm actually getting
used to the red moon.

468
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,000
I guess people can adapt
to pretty much anything.

469
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,666
Maybe it just takes time.
