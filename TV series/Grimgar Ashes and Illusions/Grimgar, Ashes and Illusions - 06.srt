1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,166
[SHIHORU]
I'm sorry!

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,708
[SHIHORU]
I, um...

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:25,666
I just sort of assumed that
you two were in a relationship.

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,666
I shouldn't have
jumped to conclusions!

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,333
Well, thanks, but it could've
waited until breakfast.

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,583
[RANTA]
Relationship?!

7
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,625
Who is in a
relationship with who?

8
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,000
What's goin' on here, huh?

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,208
It's nothing, man!

10
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,666
Yeah, right. Like I'm
gonna believe that!

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,458
Who is it?

12
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,666
Well? Who?

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,458
It was a misunderstanding,
that's all.

14
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:44,625
Just like Shihoru is saying.

15
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,125
[RANTA] What kind
of situation leads to

16
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,500
that kinda misunderstanding?

17
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,791
If you'll just calm down
for a second, I'll explain!

18
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,375
[HARUHIRO]
This can't end well.

19
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,500
Haru and I were on the ground,
and he had his arms around me.

20
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,583
That's all.

21
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,791
That's what Shihoru saw.

22
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,375
It's no big deal.

23
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,708
[HARUHIRO]
That oughta do it.

24
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,458
[RANTA] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

25
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,708
What the hell, man?!

26
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,375
What were you doing with
your arms around her?!

27
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,416
What's really going on with you?

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,166
How could you
cross that line, huh?

29
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,375
Line? What line?

30
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,958
Really, this is all
just a misunderstanding!

31
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,958
No! Not buyin' it! No way!

32
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,750
You were definitely
trying something, admit it!

33
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,416
I was crying,
and so was Haru.

34
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,750
We both needed
to talk to someone.

35
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,166
[RANTA]
Yes! Keep going!

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,666
And don't leave out any details.

37
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,083
They're very important, okay?

38
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,416
I need to know everything!

39
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,416
[screaming]

40
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,458
Stop!

41
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,041
[RANTA]
Pfft. That's it?

42
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,000
Seriously?
That's all that happened?

43
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,250
You're so lame.

44
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,583
You're like the lamest
person who ever existed.

45
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,291
You know that, right, Haruhiro?

46
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,791
Yeah, yeah.

47
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:14,333
[YUME] So, anyway, Shihoru
and I have decided something.

48
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,958
We're going to try to be
nicer to Mary from now on.

49
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,833
[MOGUZO]
You know... I was thinking.

50
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,916
Just healing us would fix a lot.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,041
Maybe we should try
talking to her about it?

52
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,250
Don't waste your breath.
She's made up her mind.

53
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,541
There's no changing it.

54
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,125
I know it's not easy.

55
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,708
We can't just automatically
accept her as one of us.

56
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,041
But, if we always
treat her as an outsider,

57
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,791
then she'll always be one.

58
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,125
She'll never become part
of the group that way.

59
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,625
I think Haru's right.

60
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,541
Obviously, Mary hasn't
been real friendly to us so far.

61
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,541
But Shihoru and I
haven't exactly been

62
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,333
friendly to her, either.

63
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,458
Yeah. I guess you're right.

64
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,708
[SHIHORU]
Sh-She could be a good person.

65
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,083
Maybe we just need to
give her more of a chance.

66
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,083
She's in our party,

67
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,583
so doesn't that
make her a friend?

68
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,041
Or an ally, at least?

69
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,500
Well, having her is better
than having no Priest at all.

70
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,666
I can admit that much.

71
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,666
Yeah.

72
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,000
And you know what?

73
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,958
Another girl in the party
increases the chances

74
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,791
of one of them falling for me.

75
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,333
That's it.

76
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,583
Maybe all I need is to get past
that tough exterior of hers.

77
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:13,875
Yeah right, Ranta.

78
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,583
Mary's never gonna fall for you.

79
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,416
No way.

80
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,166
Shut your big mouth, Moguzo!

81
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,541
Wait, Moguzo?

82
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,500
Did you just say
something snarky?

83
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,583
You did, didn't you?

84
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,166
I can't freakin' believe it!

85
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,458
[HARUHIRO]
Good morning.

86
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,416
[HARUHIRO]
This won't be easy.

87
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,916
How do you make
friends with somebody

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,708
who looks at you like that
just for saying good morning?

89
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,458
Good morning to you too.

90
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,875
You can keep going.

91
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,833
I'm fine walking in the back.

92
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,000
[YUME]
So, Mary,

93
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,750
you weren't with the
rest of us at breakfast.

94
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,958
What did you eat?

95
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,666
[MARY]
Food. What else?

96
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,875
[SHIHORU] So how long
have you been doing this?

97
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,666
Working as a Volunteer Soldier?

98
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,750
A while.

99
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,500
[YUME]
Do you have a favorite snack?

100
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,000
I've got tons!
I'm always snacking.

101
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,541
[MARY]
I honestly don't care.

102
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,416
[HARUHIRO] Moguzo, Ranta,
you'll get one each.

103
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,166
Yume and I will get the third.

104
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,166
Shihoru and Mary will
back us up from the rear.

105
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,333
[RANTA, MOGUZO yell]

106
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,000
[SHIHORU]
Marque, Em, Parc!

107
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,250
[RANTA yells]

108
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,791
[MARY] Retreating from
such a weak attack?

109
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,083
I thought you were a Warrior!

110
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,500
[MOGUZO]
Yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

111
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,208
Damn it, don't
let her get to you!

112
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,000
You're not helping
anything, Mary!

113
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,916
[RANTA yells]

114
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,916
Thank you!

115
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,750
[SHIHORU]
Ohm, Rel, Ect, Well, Dash!

116
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,541
[GOBLIN 6C growling]

117
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,333
[YUME yelling]

118
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,375
[YUME]
There!

119
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,833
[HARUHIRO]
Got him!

120
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:40,750
[HARUHIRO] I can tell
by the resistance I feel

121
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,541
if I hit a vital spot.

122
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,583
[RANTA]
I'll take my Vice now!

123
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,083
[grunts]

124
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,208
[RANTA] I can't say much
for our teamwork.

125
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,750
At least we beat 'em, though.

126
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,458
Or maybe I shouldn't say "we."

127
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,333
It was obviously more my
victory than anyone else's.

128
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,458
Mary, my hand hurts. Heal it.

129
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,625
Sit down.

130
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,333
Sorry about before.

131
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,208
O light, return to
Lumiaris' divine protection.

132
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,375
Cure!

133
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,791
[HARUHIRO] So it looks like
maybe she will heal us.

134
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,875
As long as it's after
the fighting's over.

135
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,875
[RANTA] Enough with
him already! He's done.

136
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,083
My turn!

137
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,625
You don't need healing.
It's just a scratch.

138
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,750
Come on, Mary.

139
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,291
It's bleeding everywhere!

140
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,875
Or, well... uh, it was.

141
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,875
Why don't you spit on it?
That might help.

142
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,291
And it's Miss Mary to you.

143
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,416
Another word, and I
might lose my temper.

144
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,333
[RANTA]
What?!

145
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,750
[RANTA whining]

146
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,541
[HARUHIRO]
Different methods.

147
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,791
Maybe that's our problem.

148
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,250
Mary, you have a set way
that you work as a healer,

149
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,750
and I think it's just
not what we're used to.

150
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,083
So?

151
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,458
It's not bad.

152
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,583
I'm just thinking there might be

153
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,333
different types of
Priests, you know?

154
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,708
Our first Priest
was a perfectionist.

155
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,250
He couldn't stand it
if all of us weren't in

156
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,916
perfect fighting condition,
so he healed us constantly.

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,333
That was just his way.

158
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,750
[MARY]
All right.

159
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,916
Will you tell us
about your method?

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,041
I'm a Thief, so I don't
know much about Priests,

161
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,250
to be honest with you.

162
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,583
Well, I'm okay with that.

163
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,291
I don't see why you
would need to know more.

164
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,083
How can you not see?

165
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,083
We won't pry into
your personal life.

166
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,041
We don't need to know about that
if you don't want to tell us.

167
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,500
But it would be nice
if we could talk about

168
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,083
our roles and
responsibilities in battle.

169
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,750
So we can work together.

170
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,208
[MARY] If you aren't
happy with the way I work,

171
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,666
go ahead and say so.
I'll leave.

172
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,541
Happily.

173
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,083
That's not what I
was trying to say.

174
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,458
I only wanted--

175
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,875
[MARY] Then I don't understand
what the problem is.

176
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,000
[HARUHIRO] Someone tell me
how to do this, please.

177
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,333
How do I communicate
with this girl?

178
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,958
There's got to be a way.

179
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,416
[RANTA] Close your mouths
or bugs'll start flyin' in.

180
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,375
There's nothin' special
about this place.

181
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,166
It's just a regular old tavern.

182
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,083
[YUME] Wow, there are
so many people here!

183
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,625
What do you think we
should order? Juice?

184
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,166
Yeah, sounds good to me.

185
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,458
[MOGUZO laughs]

186
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,916
Would it kill her
to say hi to us?

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,666
Well, you know how Mary is.

188
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,500
She doesn't really behave
like a normal person

189
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,291
in social situations.

190
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,291
But that was pretty cold,
even for her.

191
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,125
I mean, she could have
at least waved or something,

192
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:10,916
couldn't she?

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,625
Well, but, think about it.

194
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,166
We didn't say anything
to her either.

195
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,291
Maybe she wasn't sure
how we would react,

196
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,875
so she was waiting
for us to say hi first,

197
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,041
and then we didn't.

198
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,541
[YUME]
That's possible.

199
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,250
[RANTA] Why do we have to
walk on eggshells around her?

200
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,791
Can't she just suck it up?

201
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,291
Right there, Ranta, that's it.

202
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,541
In case you were wondering,

203
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,666
that's the reason girls
will always hate you.

204
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,250
Gah! Who asked you?

205
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,500
I don't need advice
from flat-chested chicks.

206
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,791
Quit calling me that!

207
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,750
[RANTA] Flat-chest!
Flat-chest! Flat-chest!

208
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,208
[taunting continues]

209
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,541
[HARUHIRO]
I don't get it.

210
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,708
She doesn't seem especially
flat-chested to me.

211
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,333
Hey you guys, look.

212
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,791
Somebody's talking to Mary.

213
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,875
[HARUHIRO]
Huh?

214
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:49,916
Yeah, you're right.

215
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,333
[MOGUZO]
I recognize him.

216
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,250
That's Shinohara from Orion.

217
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,791
[RANTA gasps]
You serious?

218
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,541
That clan's totally famous.

219
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,333
And Shinohara's the
master of Orion, isn't he?

220
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,708
[HARUHIRO]
Before he died,

221
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,041
Manato said he
was counting on me.

222
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,041
I've been thinking about it,

223
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,458
and I'm pretty sure
what he meant

224
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,000
is that I have
to take his place.

225
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,791
I think he wants me to
become the party's new leader.

226
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:02,125
I know somebody's got to do it,
but does it have to be me?

227
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,500
Honestly, it's not a job I want.

228
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,000
It's too big a burden.

229
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,541
The whole situation just sucks.

230
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,250
[MANATO]
It's okay, Haruhiro.

231
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,833
You can do it.

232
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,583
[HARUHIRO]
Sorry, but you're wrong.

233
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,333
I can't.

234
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,708
I'm not you.

235
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,583
I don't know how to do this.

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,375
[MANATO] Stop doubting yourself,
Haruhiro, and just do it.

237
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,291
[MANATO] I can't wait
to see how our party does

238
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,541
with their new leader.

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,500
[HARUHIRO]
New leader, huh?

240
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,041
[swords clashing]

241
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,333
[HARUHIRO] Moguzo is being
more cautious than usual,

242
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,458
and I think it's because
he doesn't have a helmet.

243
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,250
Which makes sense.

244
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,500
Without a helmet, a blow to
the head could kill him.

245
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,250
The classes fight differently.

246
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,791
As a Thief, I usually
attack from behind.

247
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,666
Moguzo doesn't have
that option, though.

248
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,208
[MOGUZO]
Thank you!

249
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,500
[HARUHIRO] Since our roles
in battle are so different,

250
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,208
I never really understood
Moguzo's fighting style.

251
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,708
Well, honestly...

252
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,208
I guess I never really tried
to understand it before.

253
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,916
[HARUHIRO]
Huh. That's unexpected.

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,125
I wouldn't think she'd be
the type to pray over the dead.

255
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,958
Of course, how would I know?

256
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,083
I've never asked her about it.

257
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,833
I don't actually
know Mary at all.

258
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,375
[HARUHIRO]
Moguzo.

259
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,708
I think you should
buy yourself a helmet.

260
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,250
Even if it's just a cheap one.

261
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,416
I'll help.

262
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,583
I'll keep saving and
buy one when I can.

263
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,125
You don't need to chip in
on something that's for me.

264
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,083
[HARUHIRO]
Hey, don't worry.

265
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,291
If you have the wrong
equipment, we all suffer.

266
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,500
I'm not being selfless.

267
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,083
Once you have the proper armor,

268
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,916
you'll be able to fight without
holding anything back, right?

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,541
So it'll work out
better for me, too.

270
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,833
[YUME]
Yeah, good point, Haru.

271
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,791
I hadn't thought
about it that way.

272
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,208
I'll contribute a little
from my savings, too.

273
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,125
And then maybe we can all go
shop for a cute helmet together!

274
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,250
[SHIHORU giggles]
Me too.

275
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,833
I wanna help you out.

276
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,333
Thanks. That's nice.

277
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,000
Come on! Don't just
stand there! Do something!

278
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,083
I'm doing something! See?

279
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,125
[HARUHIRO] Mary said
her staff is just for show,

280
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,708
but that's not true.

281
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,916
She has learned
some skills for it.

282
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,458
She may not want
to fight in the front,

283
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,291
but she protected Shihoru.

284
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,833
[HARUHIRO]
Thanks for earlier.

285
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,083
[MARY] Hm?
What are you talking about?

286
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,625
[HARUHIRO]
Hey. Mary, hold on.

287
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,166
Yes? What do you want?

288
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,916
[HARUHIRO] Man, she sure doesn't
make this easy, does she?

289
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,916
It's like she doesn't know
we're all in the same party.

290
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,708
Does she want
people to hate her?

291
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,958
Is that it?

292
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,208
I wish I could
ask her about it,

293
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,083
but I can't, of course.

294
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:11,208
If I say anything too personal,
she would probably just leave.

295
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,791
[HARUHIRO]
Well, uh, it's no big deal,

296
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,541
but we're gonna grab some food.

297
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,375
Would you... wanna join us?

298
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,041
Thank you, but no.

299
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,958
That was really polite.

300
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,333
[MARY gasps]

301
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,500
Of course it was.
Aren't I always polite?

302
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,666
[HARUHIRO]
Yeah. I mean, sure.

303
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,916
Of course.

304
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,958
[MARY]
It's not that--

305
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,416
[MARY]
See you.

306
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,416
Man...

307
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,583
I don't know why you even try.

308
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,000
She's impossible.

309
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,291
Well, I don't know.

310
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,541
She seemed a little
different to me somehow.

311
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,333
I agree.

312
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,125
Like she thawed out a bit.

313
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,791
I think it's a good sign.

314
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,333
[HARUHIRO]
That was really awkward,

315
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,458
but I'm pretty sure Mary
was trying to be friendlier.

316
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,916
At least, that's what
I'd like to believe.

317
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,291
[HARUHIRO]
Hey, everyone, listen.

318
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,083
I'm gonna go see Shinohara.

319
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,375
I want to ask him something.

320
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,333
If you don't mind,
I'd like you all to come too.

321
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,541
That okay?

322
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,416
[SHINOHARA] You want
to know about who? Mary?

323
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,750
[HARUHIRO]
Yeah.

324
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,291
I noticed you were
talking to her yesterday.

325
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,000
[SHINOHARA]
I was.

326
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,125
What did you want to know?

327
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,708
[HARUHIRO]
Maybe stuff about her past?

328
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,875
Or anything, really.

329
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,250
We'd like to get to know her,

330
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,208
but she doesn't
make it very easy.

331
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,875
[SHINOHARA]
If that's what you want,

332
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,125
don't ask me.

333
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,333
You'll have better luck
talking to Hayashi.

334
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,458
Hayashi knows Mary well.

335
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,083
They used to be in
the same party together.

336
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,208
[HARUHIRO]
Oh.

337
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,958
[HAYASHI] Mary and I were
friends when we were

338
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,875
Trainee Volunteer Soldiers,
just like you all are now.

339
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:27,250
Like Shinohara said,
we were in a party together.

340
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,125
[HAYASHI]
Michiki and I were Warriors.

341
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,333
Mutsumi was our Mage,
Ogu was our Thief,

342
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:37,708
and Mary, she was our Priest.

343
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,125
Our party was lucky.
Things began smoothly for us.

344
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,125
Ten days, and we had our badges.

345
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,458
and we didn't have
any encounters

346
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,500
we couldn't handle easily.

347
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,750
Until the kobold
in the Cyrene Mine.

348
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,875
[HAYASHI] Things seemed
to go so easily for us,

349
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,750
and we took it for granted.

350
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,833
We thought our party
was invincible.

351
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,000
Of course, we didn't
realize how much of a burden

352
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,833
we were putting on Mary.

353
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,000
She was so bright and cheerful.

354
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,083
Always smiling and laughing.

355
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,250
With her around,

356
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:12,208
it was impossible
to feel nervous or sad.

357
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,666
She would heal us right away,
even if it was just a scratch.

358
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,458
And if Mutsumi or Ogu
were in trouble,

359
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,208
she'd jump in to help.

360
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,250
So of course we had it easy.

361
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,833
How could we not,

362
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,583
when Mary was doing
enough work for three people?

363
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,750
The more battles
we fought and won,

364
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,625
the more our confidence grew.

365
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,083
We weren't afraid
of anybody or anything.

366
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,916
Now I know the line
between victory and defeat

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,541
is paper-thin.

368
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,875
But we didn't realize
that back then,

369
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,375
and we grew arrogant.

370
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,000
We were foolish,
but fortunately,

371
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:54,208
we always had Mary around,
so every mistake was fixable.

372
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,083
She kept the worst
from happening.

373
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,750
She kept us alive.

374
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,000
We set out to seize
the Cyrene Mine.

375
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,166
We weren't the only
party going after it.

376
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,708
We were determined not to lose.

377
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,458
So deeper and deeper
into the mine we went.

378
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,750
We got to the fifth layer down,

379
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,083
and that's where we met it.

380
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,916
What's "it?"

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,083
[HAYASHI] An enormous black
and white-spotted kobold.

382
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,708
Many Volunteer Soldiers had
been killed by it already.

383
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,416
The kobold was known
as "Death Spots."

384
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,958
We should have run
away as soon as we saw it.

385
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,083
We could've. We had the chance.

386
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,083
I think I regret that
more than anything.

387
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,375
But we fought.

388
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,416
The kobold hit me, and I
was knocked unconscious.

389
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,083
When I came to
a short while later,

390
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,500
Ogu and Mutsumi
were already dead,

391
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,583
and Michiki, who was
covered in wounds,

392
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,250
was desperately trying
to hold Death Spots back.

393
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,125
He needed to be healed.

394
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,625
I shouted at Mary over and over.

395
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,750
She'd always healed us before.

396
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,250
"Hurry!" I yelled at her.

397
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,250
"You have to hurry!"

398
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,375
[MARY crying]

399
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,458
My magic...

400
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,041
I used it all... I can't!

401
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,416
I'm so sorry!

402
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,333
[HAYASHI] On that day,
our "invincible" party

403
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,500
lost three of its members.

404
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,666
Gone for good,
along with Mary's smile.

405
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,458
It must have been awful--

406
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,375
What she went through.

407
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:46,208
Sometimes I feel like I can
imagine what she was thinking.

408
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,500
"Three of my friends died
because I ran out of magic,

409
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:53,083
so what right do I
have to be a healer?"
