1
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,375
[HARUHIRO]
Oh, right... I forgot.

2
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,083
We're not going hunting today.

3
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,250
[HARUHIRO] We talked it over,
and it was unanimous.

4
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,375
We decided to take the day off.

5
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,041
We've been working
hard for a long time,

6
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,291
preparing for yesterday.

7
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,041
It feels like a good day
to take a breather.

8
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,416
Resting does sound nice,

9
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,791
but I'm not really
sure I know how to.

10
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,166
There are so many hours to fill.

11
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,916
What do you do on a day off?

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,458
Huh, relaxing is
kind of hard work.

13
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,041
You seem distracted.

14
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,958
[HARUHIRO]
Ah, it's nothing.

15
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,458
Just, now that we
actually get a break,

16
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,875
I don't know what
to do with myself.

17
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,916
[MOGUZO] I guess Ranta
didn't have that problem.

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,208
He went out early.

19
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,458
Really? He did?

20
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,875
That's weird.

21
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,208
[MOGUZO] I think there are
some people who only like

22
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,458
to sleep in when the other
option is going to work.

23
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,541
[HARUHIRO chuckles]

24
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,416
Oh yeah.

25
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,041
That sounds like Ranta.

26
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,208
[HARUHIRO spits]

27
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,833
[HARUHIRO]
This bread's really good!

28
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,625
My timing's still a bit off.

29
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,375
I'm supposed to change
the temperature as it cooks,

30
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,416
but it's tricky.

31
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,333
I haven't figured out
how to do it

32
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,666
with a wood-burning fire...

33
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,166
I'll keep trying, though.

34
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,541
We're taking the
day off, you know.

35
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,583
You don't have to
worry about cooking duty.

36
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,708
Of course...

37
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:24,583
I'm still gonna eat
every bite of it.

38
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,833
[MOGUZO]
It's not a big deal.

39
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:29,375
I was hungry too,
so why not make extra?

40
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,416
[HARUHIRO]
Where did Ranta go, anyway?

41
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,791
[MOGUZO] Not sure,
but he took his fishing rod.

42
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,750
[HARUHIRO]
What about Yume and Shihoru?

43
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,083
[MOGUZO]
I don't know.

44
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,583
I haven't seen either
of them yet this morning.

45
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,291
[HARUHIRO] Maybe they're
still in their room.

46
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,000
[HARUHIRO]
I bet they stayed up late,

47
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,250
so they're sleeping in now.

48
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,666
Shihoru was really
upset after yesterday.

49
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,625
She and Yume probably needed
some time to talk about Manato.

50
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,250
So, what about you?

51
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,458
Oh, me?

52
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,208
I'm still deciding, actually...

53
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,916
I thought I might bring my
armor in to get patched up.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,166
It took a beating
in our last fight,

55
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,000
so it really needs some work.

56
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,208
My sword was in bad shape,
so I left it to get sharpened.

57
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,250
I should probably
pick it up soon.

58
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,916
You sure you don't want to do
something a little more fun?

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,083
It's pretty rare
that we take a day off.

60
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,041
Well, what about you?

61
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,166
What are you gonna do?

62
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,958
Uh... Um... I don't know yet.

63
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,083
[MOGUZO] We're all meeting
up at Shelly's tavern

64
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,083
later on tonight, aren't we?

65
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,208
[HARUHIRO]
Mm-hmm.

66
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,750
[HARUHIRO]
What should I do?

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,708
[HARUHIRO]
Oh, hey.

68
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,916
I didn't know you were up.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,416
Feeding birds?

70
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,125
You an animal lover?

71
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,083
It's just something I do.

72
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,875
Kind of a habit.

73
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh yeah?

74
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,458
[HARUHIRO] Well...
I don't know if you're hungry,

75
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,291
but Moguzo baked some
fresh bread this morning.

76
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,916
Did he? That must be
what smells so good.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,541
You can smell it?

78
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,583
[SHIHORU]
Yeah.

79
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,291
Wow. Good nose.

80
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,791
This is a great spot...

81
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,458
Remember when we all
watched the sunset from here?

82
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,125
[SHIHORU]
Yeah...

83
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,958
Um, hey, Haru...

84
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,166
I just want to say...

85
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,125
I'm glad we get to
keep working together.

86
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,916
Uh... yeah.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,833
I mean, so am I.

88
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,166
But why do you say that?

89
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,708
[SHIHORU]
I just felt like it.

90
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,250
[HARUHIRO]
Oh.

91
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,250
[SHIHORU chuckles]

92
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,500
Sunrise is nice here, too.

93
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,166
It is a great spot.

94
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,125
[HARUHIRO]
It sure is.

95
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,333
I can see why you
come here so much.

96
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,875
[SHIHORU]
Mm-hmm.

97
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,291
[YUME groans]
So sleepy...

98
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,541
I just want five more minutes.

99
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,833
Then I promise I'm gonna get up.

100
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,875
[ANIMAL meows]

101
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,333
[ANIMAL meows]

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
[HARUHIRO]
Oh.

103
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,208
Hey, Hiro.

104
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,208
You want to sit down?

105
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,541
[MARY]
This is where I've been staying.

106
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,625
It's been my home since I left
the Volunteer Soldier housing...

107
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,708
It's a pretty nice
place, actually...

108
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,500
Women only.

109
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,625
Then I shouldn't be here!

110
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,416
You're fine out on the deck.

111
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,333
[MARY] If the rest of you ever
decide to leave your quarters,

112
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,000
I can tell Yume and
Shihoru about this place.

113
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,041
They might like it.

114
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,375
[HARUHIRO]
Yeah...

115
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,666
I'm sure they'd be really
happy to hear about it.

116
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,250
Although...

117
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,666
I think we're all pretty used to
it there, to tell you the truth.

118
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,000
Not that we're
gonna stay forever.

119
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,250
We'll have to move on...
eventually.

120
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,708
I have some
good memories of it.

121
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,166
It's not that bad.

122
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,291
[HARUHIRO] I guess it's
not surprising that Mary

123
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,291
would want to live
somewhere else.

124
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,041
When she stayed in
the soldier housing,

125
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,166
it was probably with
her original party-mates.

126
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,625
[HARUHIRO]
It must have felt so empty...

127
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,041
...after they were gone.

128
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,458
[HARUHIRO]
What? This was in Damuro?

129
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,916
[KIKKAWA]
Yep, that's right.

130
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,333
And from the stories I've
heard, it was pretty gnarly.

131
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,000
Mm-hmm. Seems the gobsters
are gettin' more ferocious.

132
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,583
[HARUHIRO] Wait a sec,
what are you saying?

133
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,166
Gobsters? You mean goblins?

134
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,083
[KIKKAWA] Anyway, looks like
some rooks got themselves

135
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,500
in big trouble.

136
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,750
[HARUHIRO]
Hold on, "rooks"?

137
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,916
Oh, rookies...

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,208
Volunteer Soldier trainees?

139
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,791
It's what I said, isn't it?

140
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,041
A party of newlings tried
their luck in Damuro.

141
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,583
Turns out they weren't so
lucky, if ya know what I mean.

142
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,875
Things got really ugly.

143
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,500
It was bad, man.

144
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,833
You remember that band
of goblins we took down?

145
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,916
I'm pretty sure they
were from the new city.

146
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,541
I could tell that they were
different from their equipment

147
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,666
and the way that they fought.

148
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,875
Maybe we stirred them up.

149
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,375
[KIKKAWA]
Oh, you did that, all right!

150
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,791
Mad gobsters from the new city

151
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,916
are patrolling all
over the place now.

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,875
You kicked a beehive, and the
bees aren't happy about it.

153
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,083
So what are we supposed
to do with them now, huh?

154
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,750
Lay low and wait
for them to buzz off?

155
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,875
That sure sounds like
the easiest plan to me.

156
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,291
Personally, I'd
rather not get stung.

157
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,250
[HARUHIRO]
Nice talking to you...

158
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,625
[KIKKAWA]
Hey, boys! How's it going?

159
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,833
Hanging in there?

160
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,666
[RANTA]
Two more over here!

161
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,458
[YUME] So the gobs
are making trouble, huh?

162
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,166
[HARUHIRO] Yeah, it sounds
like Damuro's not a good place

163
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,375
to be.

164
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,666
Have you heard?

165
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,791
[YUME]
Yep.

166
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,958
All right, what are
we gonna do then?

167
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,250
[HARUHIRO]
Well, honestly, I don't know...

168
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,250
I haven't really
thought about it yet.

169
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,958
We were planning to go to
Damuro tomorrow like always.

170
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,208
The way things are now,

171
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,958
it could be a total bust
if we go there tomorrow.

172
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,208
So you ready to take
responsibility for that?

173
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,875
[HARUHIRO] What do you
mean, "take responsibility"?

174
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,666
If we earn squat,
you better fork over

175
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,583
your portion to pay
for bad decision-making.

176
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,750
[HARUHIRO]
Seriously, Ranta...

177
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,708
Sometimes you say
the stupidest things...

178
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,416
Think about it.
If we make nothing,

179
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,875
my share is also nothing.

180
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,291
[MOGUZO]
Maybe...

181
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,791
We should think about
changing our hunting grounds.

182
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,291
There's the Cyrene Mine.

183
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh... no.

184
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,208
Sorry... I was just thinking--

185
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,125
Hey! Haruhiro!

186
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,625
Once in a while, a very
long while, you make sense!

187
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,625
I'm totally up for it.

188
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,000
I say let's go!

189
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm not so sure about that...

190
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,083
It sounds dangerous.

191
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,833
Isn't Tetra Pod
in the Cyrene Mine?

192
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,250
The bounty on him
is thirty gold.

193
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,500
Think how much
that could buy us!

194
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,041
And, um, I think
you mean "Death Spots,"

195
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,208
not "Tetra Pod"...

196
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,083
The Cyrene Mine monster.

197
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,791
[HARUHIRO]
Well, the bottom line is

198
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,000
we need to change
our hunting grounds,

199
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,458
at least for a little while...

200
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,333
We don't really
know too many places

201
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,000
outside of our regular area,

202
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,166
so the mine just kind
of popped in my head.

203
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,291
[HARUHIRO] Obviously,
Death Spots is a danger,

204
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,250
but we'll be careful
to avoid him.

205
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,583
And does anyone else
feel like staying

206
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,625
in the same area
can get a little boring?

207
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,500
Plus... Sticking to a routine
can make you careless.

208
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,250
It's easy to stop
paying attention

209
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,125
and start making mistakes.

210
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,250
Maybe it would be good for
us to get some excitement--

211
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,208
to see how well we
perform under pressure.

212
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,208
So there you have it.

213
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,375
That's my take.

214
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,416
I think we should try
our luck in the Cyrene Mine.

215
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,000
That's that, then.

216
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,708
[YUME] Is it really
such a bad thing,

217
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,500
following the same
routine every day?

218
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,541
I sorta like that things haven't
been as dangerous lately,

219
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,583
and I've been able to save
money a little at a time.

220
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,083
I just don't see why
things have to change.

221
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,458
[HARUHIRO] Well... we can't
go to Damuro right now,

222
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,708
so that's part of it.

223
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,708
I forgot about that...

224
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,625
So we don't have much
of a choice, then, do we?

225
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,250
Hm... Well, if nothing else,

226
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,833
I guess switching up
our prey could make

227
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,125
for a nice change of pace.

228
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,500
[MARY panting]

229
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,291
[HARUHIRO]
Mary?

230
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:51,708
[MARY panting]

231
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,166
Excuse me. I need a moment.

232
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,500
Hold on...

233
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,166
[MARY]
I'm sorry about this.

234
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,416
[HARUHIRO]
No...

235
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,875
I should apologize.

236
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,791
[HARUHIRO] If we go
to the Cyrene Mine,

237
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,416
Mary will have to
confront her past.

238
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,000
She'll be forced to
set foot in the place

239
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,708
where her friends died.

240
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,291
That's a lot to ask.

241
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:28,916
It'll be difficult,
and very painful.

242
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,375
At least, I imagine it will be.

243
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,916
It's not like I'm
speaking from experience,

244
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,750
considering we haven't
been anywhere near the spot

245
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,291
where Manato died
since that day.

246
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,666
If it was up to me,
I would erase it entirely--

247
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,083
Forget that place even existed.

248
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,125
[MARY] You want us to
go to the Cyrene Mine.

249
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,791
That's the place
of my nightmares.

250
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,458
I don't know if I could
go in there calmly,

251
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,375
without my hands shaking,

252
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,208
and my heart racing...

253
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,041
I would be afraid.

254
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:05,208
Now... and maybe even
for the rest of my life.

255
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,500
I understand.

256
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,041
[MARY]
But even so...

257
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,583
I want to be able
to face my fear.

258
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,208
You know?

259
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,666
I have to try...

260
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,416
I've got to find the
courage to walk in there.

261
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,791
Otherwise...

262
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:22,916
I'll be stuck.

263
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,416
Unable to move on with my life.

264
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,541
I can't face it alone.

265
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,458
I know that.

266
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,000
But maybe if I have help...

267
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,875
Maybe if you guys
are down there too...

268
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,125
I can do it.

269
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,000
[MARY]
At least I think so.

270
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,958
It feels possible.

271
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,000
Because you called
me your friend.

272
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,416
Or maybe...

273
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm just holding you back.

274
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,125
[HARUHIRO] We've never
thought anything like that!

275
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,000
You aren't holding
us back at all.

276
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,333
[MARY]
Hiro?

277
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,916
I don't know
why I'm crying...

278
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,458
They're happy tears, I guess.

279
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,250
I feel like an
idiot now... Sorry.

280
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,166
For what it's worth...

281
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't think you're
an idiot at all.

282
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,500
[MARY]
Thanks for this.

283
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,958
[HARUHIRO] We knew the Cyrene
Mine was going to be dangerous.

284
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,416
We wanted to make sure
we were as prepared

285
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,041
as we could possibly be.

286
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,791
We polished our equipment
and honed our skills.

287
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,416
I decided to learn
the sneak attack "Spider."

288
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,333
It cost me forty silvers
and a whole lot of pain.

289
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,541
[BARBARA]
Welcome back, Old Cat.

290
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,416
Good to see you.

291
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,708
Are you ready to get started?

292
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,208
[HARUHIRO]
Yes, ma'am. I'm ready.

293
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,416
[BARBARA] You've gotten a
little stiffer since last time.

294
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,291
That's not what I
look for in my students.

295
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,458
Well, not for the
most part, anyway.

296
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,208
Um... I'm not stiff there--

297
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,333
[HARUHIRO yells, groans]

298
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,375
Good thing, too,

299
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,708
or you'd have a big,
red smile right in the middle

300
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,875
of your neck...

301
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,416
And if I didn't have
my dagger with me,

302
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,375
snapping your spine would do.

303
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,125
[HARUHIRO yells]

304
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,291
[BARBARA] Now, then,
you'll want to become

305
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,208
intimately acquainted
with my Spider

306
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,875
before you try it on your own.

307
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,458
Be warned: I plan to
give you a hard time.

308
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,291
[HARUHIRO] You're not going
to kill me, though, right?

309
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,000
No. I wouldn't do that.

310
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,833
I'm always careful not to
be too rough with my students.

311
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,166
Very few have died as
a result of my training.

312
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,500
"Few"? So there
were some, then?

313
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,625
[BARBARA chuckles]

314
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,083
[HARUHIRO yells]

315
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,833
[HARUHIRO groans, yells]

316
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,375
[HARUHIRO grunts, groans]

317
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,083
There's no point practicing
if you can't stand.

318
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,083
Why don't we mix things up?

319
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,250
There are lots of
things we can do

320
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,583
while you're lying down.

321
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,500
We could work those
abs with sit-ups...

322
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,166
Or we could review the best
ways to withstand torture.

323
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,166
Please! I'm dying here.
Seriously.

324
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,666
[BARBARA]
All right.

325
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,208
If you're going to be a baby
about it, we can just chat.

326
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,500
[HARUHIRO]
I don't think I can.

327
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,750
Okay, so you want
to do sit-ups then?

328
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,666
Chatting. Right.

329
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,708
Sounds good... About what?

330
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,541
I don't know.
Just tell me a little story.

331
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,458
[HARUHIRO] But...
I don't know any stories.

332
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,625
You are a spectacularly
boring man.

333
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,500
I guess that's why you're
no good with the ladies.

334
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,916
[HARUHIRO]
That's not nice.

335
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,541
True, but not nice.

336
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,333
[BARBARA] You've got girls
in your party, right?

337
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,791
Not just guys?

338
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,708
Yes... three of them.

339
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,250
[BARBARA] So why don't you
go out with one of them?

340
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,208
Well... all three
would be better,

341
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,833
but it's best to start small.

342
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,666
You know, I think I'd
rather not, honestly.

343
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,333
Oh, come on. You're interested
in at least one, aren't you?

344
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,041
[HARUHIRO grunts]

345
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:47,750
You are!

346
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,083
You just pictured her.

347
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,166
Oh, hey... um,
I almost forgot...

348
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,500
There... There was
something I've been wanting

349
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,208
to ask you about.

350
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,541
Why am I not surprised?

351
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,458
Something about women?

352
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,291
Well, no, actually.

353
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,458
That's not it at all.

354
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,708
It's not?

355
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,375
In that case, I don't
know if I'm interested.

356
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,750
You might be once
you hear what it is.

357
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,416
At least give me a chance.

358
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,833
The light, huh?

359
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,041
If you're seeing it at this
stage, that's a good sign.

360
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,291
[HARUHIRO]
A sign of what?

361
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,458
Easy now.

362
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,958
It's not like it's
something super special.

363
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,458
I wouldn't want you getting
the wrong idea or anything.

364
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,333
How... can I
get the wrong idea...

365
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,666
...when I don't...

366
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,333
...have any idea what
it is in the first place?

367
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,166
[BARBARA]
You really are slow, aren't you?

368
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,125
You're even more like
an old cat than I thought.

369
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,833
[HARUHIRO]
I am? Agh!

370
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,208
[BARBARA]
Yeah, you are.

371
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,708
You've got decent intuition,
but you're slow.

372
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,458
Like a cat past his prime.

373
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,166
But back to the
streak of light...

374
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,791
Anybody who's got
enough experience

375
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,416
will see it once or twice.

376
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,125
I see it pretty often, actually.

377
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,375
Not every day or anything,
but fairly frequently.

378
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,875
Is that normal?
[gasps]

379
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,541
It's certainly not unheard of.

380
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,791
It differs from thief to thief.

381
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,291
And what about you?

382
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,541
[groans]

383
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,500
I see it here and there,
but not all the time.

384
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,541
It's not something you can do

385
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,041
just by concentrating
hard enough.

386
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,166
Oh...

387
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,541
f you want to see it
more consistently,

388
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,041
your best bet is
to hone your skills

389
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,375
and increase your
physical strength.

390
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,875
Yes ma'am!

391
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,916
You've got enough breath
in your lungs to talk?

392
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,333
We'd better work harder.

393
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,208
[HARUHIRO yelling]

394
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,041
Is this really it?

395
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,458
It looks like a
normal mountain to me.

396
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,500
Yeah.

397
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,250
[HARUHIRO]
Long ago,

398
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,250
the Cyrene Mine was established
by the Arabikia Kingdom.

399
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,166
A nation of humans.

400
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,708
It was part of their
effort to take control

401
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,791
of the frontier lands.

402
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,375
Unfortunately for Arabikia,

403
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,666
their dominance
would be short-lived...

404
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,625
Under the command
of the No Life King,

405
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,583
kobolds assaulted
the Cyrene Mine,

406
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,041
seizing it and
ousting the humans.

407
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,708
The kobolds have inhabited
the mine ever since.

408
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,291
All right. Let's do this.
