Poke some holes
in its hide already!

If it's so easy, why
haven't you done it yet?

Oh my gosh, you guys!
I'm sorry about that!

We've gotta stick with

This is real!

We have to kill them
before they kill us.

Remember that. We can't lose.

If we lose here, it's all over.

Shouldn't we be
doing better than this?

aren't goblins the weakest
monsters in Grimgar?

41
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:09,708
Yeah. Well, they're
supposed to be, at least.

42
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,083
The weakest monsters.

43

The sun's up. You should be too.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,041
What's up with your eyes?

55
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,541
You still half asleep?

56
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,208
Like I've told you before,
this is just how my eyes look.

57
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,291
It's how they've always looked.

58
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,833
It doesn't mean that I'm sleepy.

59
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,458
Oh, come on.
Just admit you're sleepy.

60
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,500
It's not a big deal.

[MANATO]
Good, you're both up.

62
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,750
Huh... I thought I'd
have to wake you.

63
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,250
Come on out to the courtyard
once you're dressed.

64
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,166
It's time for breakfast.

65
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,791
Whoops, I forgot.

66
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,708
I was on breakfast duty.

67
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,666
No, it's okay.

68
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,500
I don't mind filling in for you.

69
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:50,541
Honestly, you seemed pretty
tired from yesterday's fight.

70
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,416
Thanks, Manato.

71
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,541
And I'm sorry.

72
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,375
Sleeping while someone
else picks up the slack?

73
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,541
Shame on you!

74
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,375
Hey, I thought you
had breakfast duty, too.

75
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,250
Why're you here?

76
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,500
I got off.

77
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,125
When I woke up, Moguzo'd
already taken my shift.

78
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,458
Hey!

79
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,333
If you slept in, what are
you harping on me for?

80
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,041
[RANTA]
'Cause you make it so easy.

81
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,458
Now come on and get dressed.

82
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,166
I'm hungry and breakfast
is waiting for us.

[YUME]
Mmm! Ooh!

84
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,166
It's starting to smell yummy!

85
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,750
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

86
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,375
I like cooking for people.

87
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,750
I like being cooked for,
so this should work out well!

88
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,250
Yume, Moguzo.

89
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,583
Look. I gathered these on
our way back yesterday.

90
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,791
Do you have any use for them?

91
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,291
Um... I can take them.

92
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,125
[MANATO]
All right, then.

93
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,291
They're all yours.

94
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,500
[MOGUZO] It could use
some more salt, huh?

95
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,166
[YUME]
I think it's delicious.

96
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,250
[SHIHORU] And salt isn't
exactly cheap, either.

97
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,875
Shihoru's got a point there.

98
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,125
We really need to be frugal.

99
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,583
For a little while, at least.

100
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,125
We haven't even defeated
a single monster yet.

101
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,666
Yeah. Thanks for the reminder.

102
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,791
Are the two of you
doing okay?

103
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,708
My Light Magic is good
for healing wounds,

104
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,250
but it can't do everything.

105
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,083
Replenishing lost blood
is up to your body.

106
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,000
No problems over here.
I'm as fit as a fiddle.

107
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,583
[HARUHIRO] Well, I have been
getting occasional dizzy spells,

108
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,791
but I'm okay, I guess.

109
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,208
Great.

110
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,458
Then why don't we give the
forest another try today?

111
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,375
Two goblins might have been
more than we can really handle.

112
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,041
We have to take it slower
and build up our strength.

113
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,291
Let's go for a loner
next time instead.

114
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,708
It'll take too long
doing it that way.

115
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm never gonna
accumulate any Vices

116
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,291
if we just keep running
away from monsters

117
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,083
instead of fighting them.

118
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,458
Renji and his
group aren't hiding

119
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,708
like scared little kids,
are they?

120
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,375
We're better off hiding
than getting beaten

121
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,166
like we did yesterday.

122
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,958
This isn't a video game.

123
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,416
Wait, what did you say?

124
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,625
[MANATO]
Huh?

125
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,916
That phrase you used.

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,208
"This isn't a video game."

127
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,458
What does that mean?

128
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,458
I don't actually know.

129
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,291
I was talking and I guess
it just sort of came out.

130
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,291
It felt like the right thing
to say at the time, but...

131
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,833
What does it mean? Huh...

132
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,125
[HARUHIRO] This kind of thing
happens to us sometimes.

133
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,875
We use words that seem familiar

134
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,541
only to realize
a few seconds later

135
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,625
that we don't know
what they mean.

136
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,250
It's a really annoying
feeling, actually.

137
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,750
Like when you've got
an itch you need to scratch

138
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,875
but you can't quite reach it.

139
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,750
Lots of things
are strange here.

140
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,750
When I came to Grimgar from--

141
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,625
Well, I don't actually
know where I came from.

142
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,208
That's part of the problem.

143
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,000
Everything about
my life before Grimgar

144
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,666
is a complete blank.

145
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,500
My oldest memory is from
less than two weeks ago.

146

[MALE VOICE 1A]
Awaken.

147
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,125
[HARUHIRO]
I awoke in a strange room,

148
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,875
unable to remember anything
before that moment.

149
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,875
I didn't know
how I'd gotten there,

150
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,208
how long I'd been there,
or where I'd come there from.

151
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,416
Um, excuse me...

152
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,458
Is anyone there?

153
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,958
[MANATO]
Yes. Hello?

154
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,041
[SHIHORU]
I'm here.

155
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,000
--[RENJI] Yeah.
--[MOGUZO] Anyone else?

156
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:14,958
[ADACHI]
How many are there?

157
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,041
[YUME]
We could take a count.

158
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,708
[SASSA]
This place is strange.

159
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,750
Where are we?

160
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,083

Good question. Anyone know?

And how'd we get here, anyway?

162
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,916
[RON]
What's going on?

163
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,291
Look over there.

164
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,458
That a town?

165
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,166
Or maybe a castle?

166
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,708
That's what it looks like to me.

167
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,041
No one looks familiar.

168
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,166
They're all strangers.

169
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,958
[SHIHORU]
I'm sorry, what was that?

170
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,958
Nothing, just talking to myself.

171
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:56,750
[HARUHIRO]
At least...

172
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,791
I think they're strangers.

173
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,375
Because actually, I can't
remember anybody.

174
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:07,083
No friends. No family. No one.

175
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,875
[SHIHORU]
So where are we?

176
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,208
Surely someone knows.

177
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,500
Um, excuse me, everybody,

178
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,291
but does anyone know
where we are?

179
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,791
Anyone?

180
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,208
Anyone at all?

181
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,166
[KIKKAWA]
Hmm...

182
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,208
Here's an idea!

183
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,041
Why don't we ask those
guys over there

184
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,250
wearing the armor?

185
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,625
They look like they
might know some stuff.

186
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,083
Maybe they'll help us out.

187
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,666
Hello, kittens.
Welcome to Grimgar.

188
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,875
You're now in
the town of Ortana.

189
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,291
Please accept
my warmest regards.

190
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,708
The name is Brittany.

191
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,416
I am the chief and host
of the Red Moon office

192
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,541
of the Volunteer Soldier Squad
for Ortana's Borderland Brigade.

193
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,125
You can call me Chief.

194
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,875
Bri works too
if you're looking for

195
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,083
a more affectionate
form of address.

196
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,125
The point is that
I'm the one in charge here.

197
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:57,916
Got it?

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,541
Fine. I just want answers.

199
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,083
What does this
soldier squad of yours

200
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,291
have to do with me?

201
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,291
What am I even doing here?

202
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,291
You're going to be
a demanding one.

203
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,750
Fortunately, I like a man
who knows what he wants.

204
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,125
My name's Renji.

205
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,833
And pervy guys like you
make me sick to my stomach.

206
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,583
You're new here,

207
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,166
so let me tell you
a little something.

208
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,833
Calling me a pervert can
have a very negative effect

209
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,958
on a person's life expectancy.

210
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,416
Shall I demonstrate?

211
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,708
Knock yourself out.

212
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,833
If you think you can get me,

213
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,875
you're welcome to try,
Chief Pervert.

214
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,375
Oh, I will.

215
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,458
Just you wait, kitten.

216
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,833
I'm going to get you
very, very good.

217
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,958
It'll be unforgettable.

218
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,625
I promise.

219
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,500
Ten silver coins.

220
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,083
Join the Volunteer
Soldier Squad,

221
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,458
and that's what you'll get.

222
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,291
Ten silvers per person
should be enough

223
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:49,291
for you to get by on until you
can get your feet under you.

224
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,416
I didn't even
think about money.

225
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,666
Hey, where's my phone?

226
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,916
[HARUHIRO]
My "phone"?

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,541
Wait, what's a phone, again?

228
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,208
All right, my darlings,
take a look.

229
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,833
Do you see this
little beauty here?

230
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,041
This is what marks you
as a trainee soldier.

231
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,000
For the price of twenty silvers,
you can buy an official badge.

232
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,458
Costly, but it comes
with its own benefits.

233
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,125
We have to buy 'em from you?

234
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,916
I hope you're ready
to fight, poor lambs.

235
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,583
Around here you either
get strong or you die.

236
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,958
[HARUHIRO]
Die?

237
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,708
I didn't realize we were
talking life or death here.

238
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,958
How about you just
tell us what we need to do?

239
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,750
My dear Renji,
you disappoint me.

240
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,958
I thought you would
have some idea by now.

241
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,750
It's simple:
you must defeat enemies

242
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,666
using whatever wit
and skill you possess.

243
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,916
That's the duty of
a Volunteer Soldier.

244
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,250
So what you're saying is

245
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,875
we get ten of those
silver coins for signing up

246
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,041
and after that we're
pretty much on our own.

247
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,833
Yes, exactly.

248
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:43,583
You know, I absolutely
adore fast learners.

249
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,750
Find monsters, defeat
them, and sell the spoils.

250
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,250
Those are the basics.

251
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,791
There's more to it
than that, of course,

252
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,500
but you'll have to figure out
the rest as you go along.

253
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,250
Unless you want to become
one of my little pets.

254
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:59,083
I warn you, life in Grimgar
isn't going to be easy.

255
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,750
I do have one little
piece of advice to offer.

256
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,250
Whatever happens, don't quit.

257
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,041
Remember: If you fight,
you may die.

258
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,666
But if you give up,
you will definitely die.

259
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,500
That, I can guarantee.

260
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,500
Congratulations.

261
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,000
As of today, you are all
volunteer soldier trainees.

262
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,500
[HARUHIRO]
The borderlands of Grimgar

263
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,250
are a dangerous frontier.

264
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,958
A number of other
races and monsters

265
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,291
hostile toward humans
make their home here.

266
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,833
The Borderland Brigade's mission

267
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,166
is to clear the area
of such creatures.

268
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,583
In theory, at least.

269
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,125
In reality, however,

270
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,166
the regular army has its hands
full just maintaining Ortana

271
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,208
and garrisoning the forts
on the front line.

272
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,750
The Brigade can't do it all,

273
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,375
so that's where we
Volunteer Soldiers come in.

274
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,291
Well, technically we're
still trainees, I guess.

275
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,750
Renji and his party
have already managed

276
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,000
to buy official Borderland
Brigade badges from Bri.

277
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,291
Apparently you can collect
horns and claws and stuff

278
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:19,625
from monsters you kill and
sell them for a good price.

279
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,708
I don't know.

280
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,041
At the rate we're going,

281
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,416
twenty silvers might
as well be a million.

282
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,916
[RANTA]
Meat! I want some meat!

283
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,416
Something hearty
I can sink my teeth into.

284
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,250
[MANATO]
Meat costs four coppers.

285
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,000
You'll have to wait until we're
actually earning a living.

286
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,416
Yeah, well when
I can afford it,

287
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,250
I'm gonna eat
that whole meat cart.

288
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,375
I mean it!

289
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,416
Every last scrap,
including the bones!

290
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,250
There'll be nothing left!

[RANTA laughing]

292
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,625
Hungry or not, you probably
shouldn't eat the bones.

293
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,541
Or the cart, either.

294
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,875
Quit nagging me all the time.

295
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,833
You'll tire yourself out.

00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,208
You know, Ranta...

297
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,958
I've noticed that the longer
I spend talking to you,

00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,333
the more tired I get.

[RANTA]
Wow, seriously?

300
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,625
I guess you're even
weaker than I thought.

Poor baby. Poor little weakling.

[HARUHIRO]
I'm weak, am I?

And I guess you're
really strong?

[YUME]
Coulda fooled me.

00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,125
[RANTA] Heh!
You bet I'm strong.

307
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,333
Always have been.

308
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,166
I was famous for
my hidden strength,

309
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,875
even when I was a baby!

310
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,041
[HARUHIRO]
If you're famous for something,

311
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,083
it's not really hidden, is it?

312
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,166
[HARUHIRO]
That day,

313
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,250
after we learned
that we basically

314
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,791
had to become soldiers,

315
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,416
Renji picked some of the
stronger people and set out.

316
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,458
The rest of us decided
to form a party of our own,

317
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,791
and I think it's
becoming obvious

318
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,500
that we're the weaker group.

00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,458
so we each have two left.

321
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,625
Even accounting for
minimum living expenses,

322
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,541
we'll only last two weeks.

323
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,541
One silver equals
a hundred coppers,

324
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,875
which sounds like a lot.

325
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,541
But if we want a roof
over our heads,

326
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,125
we need to spend carefully.

327
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,958
[HARUHIRO] Something Bri
had neglected to tell us

328
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,916
was that in order
to work in Grimgar,

329
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,041
you have to join
one of the guilds.

330
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,750
Luckily, Manato's good at
finding out stuff like that.

331
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,875
As a party, we discussed which
class we would each belong to.

332
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,541
Then we all set out to join
our respective guilds.

333
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:13,208
[BARBARA] So you want to join
the Thieves' Guild, do you, boy?

334
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,458
Well, yeah.

335
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,375
That's what I came here
hoping to do, anyway.

336
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,958
Sorry, where...?

337
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,541
[HARUHIRO yells]

338
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,291
This is a bit unorthodox.

339
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,541
A Volunteer Soldier trainee

340
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,541
choosing to be a Thief
as his first job?

341
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,541
You come to this
decision by yourself?

342
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,166
[HARUHIRO]
I didn't make the choice alone.

343
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,500
I talked it over with
my party leader, Manato.

344
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,125
We decided together.

345
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,833
I don't really seem
to have any skills,

346
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,958
so I thought I'd
try being a Thief.

347
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,416
Are you trying to kill me?

348
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,583
Everyone realizes the
value of having a Thief

349
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,583
in their party, but
usually not until they've

350
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,541
got some experience.

351
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,333
The first part of your
training'll take seven days.

352
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,833
I'll be teaching you personally.

353
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,375
You should feel honored.

354
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,541
[giggles]

355
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,708
[BARBARA]
Something wrong?

356
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,041
You're awfully quiet.

357
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,083
Should I get someone else
to handle your training?

358
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,333
No, please!

359
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,041
I'm very happy to
have you as an instructor.

360
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,375
[BARBARA]
Fine,

361
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,708
but I'm warning you,
it's going to be hard work.

362
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:25,916
You'd better keep up.

363
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,375
Fall behind and you'll
have to be punished.

364
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,208
[HARUHIRO]
I understand.

365
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,833
I promise I'll do my best.

366
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,083
I'm Haruhiro, by the way.

367
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,791
So, "Teacher"?
Is that what I should call you?

368
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,041
[BARBARA laughs]
I like that.

369
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,166
It sounds so very respectable.

370
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,708
Maybe I'll make it
my new nickname.

371
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,458
Uh, I'm sorry. I don't--

372
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,583
You are green!

373
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,416
All us thieves get
nicknames, you see.

374
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,541
In fact, if you manage
to complete your training,

375
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,833
I'll give you one of your own.

376
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,208
Sounds good. Thank you.

377
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,416
[giggles]
My name's Barbara, by the way.

378
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,166
I think that you and I
have a fun week ahead of us.

379
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,166
[HARUHIRO] Just like she
warned me she would be,

380
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,250
Teacher Barbara was
strict and demanding.

381
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,125
As merciless as
she was beautiful,

382
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,583
she pushed me hard.

383
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,333
but even though that
week was difficult,

384
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,250
I did get a nickname in the end.

385
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,291
Though if you ask me,

386
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,500
"Old Cat" isn't
much of a nickname.

387
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,916
It's because of your eyes.

388
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,666
They look sleepy all the time,
like an elderly cat's.

389
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,916
[HARUHIRO] If I hear one
more thing about my eyes...

390
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,208
[HARUHIRO]
And so, I became a Thief.

391
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,166
Moguzo became a Warrior.

392
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,333
Ranta, a Dark Knight.

393
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,541
Yume, a Hunter.

394
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,708
Shihoru, a Mage.

395
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,375
And Manato, our leader...

396
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,041
...became a Priest.

397
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,333
It's gonna take a while to
get used to these funny clothes.

398
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,375
[HARUHIRO]
Honestly...

399
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,333
I find them a
little embarrassing.

400
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,625
[YUME coughing]

401
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,166
[HARUHIRO]
Are you all right, Yume?

402
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,833
Yeah. Something just went down
the wrong pipe, that's all.

403
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,375
[MOGUZO] Well maybe you should
try eating a little slower.

404
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,625
That might help.

405
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,666
Yeah, you're probably right.

406
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,041
I don't know why,
but for some reason

407
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,000
I always rush when I eat.

408
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,916
Master scolded me for it a lot.

409
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,375
He'd say,
"If you don't slow down,

410
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,958
you'll eat the table too
one of these days."

411
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,875
Which is kind of a weird thing
to say, when you think about it.

412
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,541
Surely he wasn't actually
worried I'd eat the table...

413
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,875
...was he?

414
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,458
I guess you don't have
to be a genius or anything

415
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,458
to use a bow and arrow,
but still.

416
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,791
You seem a little too spacey
to be a good Hunter.

417
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,333
Yeah, archery is difficult.

418
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,250
I was such a bad shot
that Master even said

419
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,416
it might be too tough for me.

420
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,458
I tried and I tried, but I just
couldn't get the hang of it.

421
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,500
[RANTA] Yesterday you
came closer to hitting us

422
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,416
than the goblins.

423
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,166
[YUME]
Sorry! Hmm...

424
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,791
Maybe in the back of my mind,
I actually wanted to hit you.

425
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,291
[RANTA]
What'd you say?!

426
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,833
Except I was the one who almost
took an arrow to the face.

427
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,291
Maybe I'd forgive you for that
if you weren't so flat-chested.

428
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,458
Excuse me?

429
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,708
Like Shihoru.

430
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,416
I'd forgive her, even if
she does try to disguise

431
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,791
her big boobs.

432
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,416
Oh, um...

433
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,875
I... I'm...

434
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,458
I'm sorry.

435
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,375
No. Don't worry about it.

436
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,833
Squish 'em down, cover 'em up

437
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,000
however you want,
you can't hide 'em.

438
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,666
If there are
big boobs to be found,

439
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,583
I will find them,
no matter what!

440
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,333
[HARUHIRO] What kind skill
is that supposed to be?

441
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,458
[RANTA]
It's not a skill!

442
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,375
It's a gift granted
to me from above!

443
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,833
An ability!

444
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,708
[SHIHORU]
I wish I wasn't big-chested.

445
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,583
They're only big
because I'm fat.

446
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,000
[YUME]
What are you talking about?

447
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,500
You don't look fat at all to me.

448
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,916
[SHIHORU] Well, my clothes
hide it a little bit.

449
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,333
Oh. I see now.

450
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,083
You're the type of girl
that other girls don't like,

451
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,916
aren't you?

452
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,250
Girls hate other girls
who complain about being fat

453
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,458
when they really aren't.

454
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,125
Come on, everybody
knows about that!

455
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,000
[HARUHIRO] Both guys
and girls hate you, though,

456
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,541
so you must be pretty special.

457
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,083
[RANTA]
Yeah, everybody hates me.

458
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:45,916
The whole world.

459
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,625
That's how special I am.

460
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,583
[HARUHIRO] You're actually
proud of that, aren't you?

461
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,916
And what about you, Haruhiro?

462
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,625
It's not like you're
some kind of saint!

463
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,000
You were taking
a good, long look

464
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,250
at Shihoru's boobs, too.

465
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,458
Yeah, I saw you.

466
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,000
I saw you clear as day
with my mind's eye.

467
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,541
Moron.

468
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,166
You know that means you didn't
really see anything, right?

469
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,041
I wasn't pretending
to think I'm fat.

470
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,083
I... I really am.

471
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,166
Can't you see it?

472
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,666
[SHIHORU crying]

473
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,833
Whoa, what's wrong?

474
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,166
I wasn't trying to make you cry.

475
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,333
[SHIHORU]
I'm not crying.

476
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,541
Yes, you are!

477
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,083
I can see the tears
dripping off your face.

478
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,041
It's like a waterfall.

479
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,041
Don't worry, Shihoru.

480
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,333
I'll take care of him for you.

481
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,416
[RANTA]
Hey!

482
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,750
Why are you aiming
that thing at me?

483
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,125
You know, this is one shot
I feel pretty confident

484
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:29,833
about making.

485
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:30,666
[RANTA]
Well, yeah!

486
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,750
You're like two steps away!

487
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,000
Don't listen to him.

488
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,833
It doesn't matter
if you're thin or fat.

489
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,500
Or what size your chest is.

490
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,541
Personally, I think you're
beautiful just the way you are!

491
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,208
Um... Do you
think we could stop?

492
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,625
This is kind of embarrassing.

493
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,541
[YUME]
No fair!

494
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,750
How do you smell so good?

495
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,458
[SHIHORU]
Please stop sniffing at me.

496
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,250
[YUME] I could sit here
and smell you forever!

497
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,208
Now this is what I call
quality entertainment!

498
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,166
Keep it up, girls.

499
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,458
I'll stay here all day!

500
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,291
[MANATO] Sorry to break
up the fun, everybody.

501
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,250
But we need to get going.

502
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,208
Sunset's not long off.

503
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,750
It won't be safe after dark.

504
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,541
There will be
dangerous monsters out.

505
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,875
Yeah, stop messing around.

506
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:09,541
Let's get going.

507
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,875
[HARUHIRO]
Geez!

508
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,958
You changed your tune
pretty quickly there.

509
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,791
It's just one of
my many talents.

510
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,000
I can make precise
choices about how I react

511
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,750
in any given situation.

512
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,708
That's why they call me
Master of Choices.

513
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,958
Someday I'm gonna be
King of the Choices!

514
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,458
[RANTA chuckling]

515
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,541
[YUME] One, two, three,
four of them!

516
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,333
[HARUHIRO]
Three too many.

517
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,625
[YUME]
Ahhh!

518
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,958
Quiet! You'll give us away!

519
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,458
[YUME]
I can't help it!

520
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,666
The gobs are eating.

521
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,791
And the food they've
got looks really yummy!

522
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,625
It's making my stomach growl!

523
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,000
[GOBLINS laughing]

524
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,958
[HARUHIRO]
Day thirteen in Grimgar.

525
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,916
We didn't earn any
money today, either.

526
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,583
Our coin purses are starting
to get a little--No--

527
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,916
Very empty.

528
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,166
I'm hungry.
Is anybody else hungry?

529
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,375
[HARUHIRO]
"If today doesn't work out,

530
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,625
we can always
try again tomorrow."

531
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,500
That's what I keep thinking.

532
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,583
But how much longer
is it going to be true?

533
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,958
One thing's for sure.

534
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,791
It sure isn't easy--

535
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,791
Life here in Grimgar.

536
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:46,958
[YUME]
Huh?

537
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,666
[HARUHIRO]
Oh, it's nothing.
