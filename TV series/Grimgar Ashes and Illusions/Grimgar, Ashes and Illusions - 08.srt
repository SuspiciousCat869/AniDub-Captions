1
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,000
So, like this?

2
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,583
Am I doing it right?

3
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,916
[HARUHIRO]
Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,583
[RANTA]
Well, come on, Haruhiro.

5
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,166
Say something.

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,666
[HARUHIRO]
Hm? Oh... right.

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,791
Gimme a sec.

8
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:39,791
So, did, uh...

9
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,291
Did everyone sleep
well last night?

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,416
Not what I meant, man.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,208
[YUME giggles]

12
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,083
Yeah, I slept like a baby.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,041
Closed my eyes,
then it was morning...

14
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,375
But it's always
like that for me.

15
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,958
Okay, are we
done with this yet?

16
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,166
I didn't sleep
very well, actually.

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,708
Me neither.

18
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,916
I just... couldn't stop
thinking about Manato.

19
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,375
If you don't mind,
I have a question...

20
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,041
Hiro...

21
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:02,750
[RANTA]
"Hiro"?

22
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,875
Are you ready for this?

23
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,875
How do you feel?

24
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,541
I feel more ready,
thanks to you guys.

25
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,041
If I were trying
to avenge him alone,

26
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,750
I would probably
do something stupid,

27
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,208
like rushing in there headlong
with nothing but my dagger.

28
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,625
Doesn't sound like me, huh?

29
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,125
But I think I would.

30
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,500
[MARY] Yes, I can
imagine you doing that.

31
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,791
But... you're not
alone, are you?

32
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,041
[HARUHIRO]
No.

33
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,458
Luckily for me, I'm not.

34
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,708
We're all in this together.

35
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,916
Let's keep it that way.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,500
Let's all get out of here alive.

37
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,208
She called you "Hiro."
You heard that, right?

38
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,458
Be quiet! Now's not the time.

39
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,875
It's our fault.

40
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:43,041
That day, we let Manato die.

41
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,625
And I know I'm going to
carry that pain with me

42
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,250
for the rest of my life.

43
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,083
I can't bear to
lose anybody else.

44
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,750
We have a new Priest,
and we're a strong party.

45
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,583
We can do this.

46
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,666
[MARY]
Are you sure?

47
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,250
I failed my friends,
and they died.

48
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,041
Is that the kind
of Priest you want?

49
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,875
[HARUHIRO] We failed our
Priest, and he died.

50
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,791
Let's just do all we can
to prevent any more deaths.

51
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,291
How does that sound?

52
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,791
No more deaths.

53
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:25,375
I will protect all of you,
whatever it takes.

54
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,125
As long as I'm still living...

55
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,291
...I'll never let
another friend die.

56
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,375
[HARUHIRO]
And... fight!

57
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,375
[ALL]
Let's go!

58
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,000
[MARY]
Let's go.

59
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,416
[RANTA]
So what's the deal?

60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,708
You're "Hiro" now?

61
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,916
[HARUHIRO]
Hm?

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,041
[RANTA] Why did she
call you that before?

63
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,208
What do you mean?

64
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,083
[RANTA] You can't really
be that oblivious.

65

68
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,708
[GOBLINS]
Huh?

69
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,500
All clear on our end.

70
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,708
Same over here.

71
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,333
Good. Let's get to the stairs.

72
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,875
[GOBLINS chattering]

73
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:26,750
[GOBLINS]
Huh?

74
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,666
[MOGUZO yelling]

75
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,000
[RANTA]
Hatred!

76
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,250
[MOGUZO]
Thank you!

77
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,041
[HARUHIRO]
To the top!

78
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,166
Move it!

79
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,458
[RANTA]
Whoa!

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,041
[GIANT GOBLIN]
Huh?

81
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,250
Hey, I got him!

82
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,791
It's not enough. He's too big.

83
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:17,791
[BIG GOBLIN growls]

84
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:18,916
Get ready!

85
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,291
[MOGUZO growls]

86
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,166
Exhaust!

87
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,000
Come and get me!

88
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,458
Why the hell are they just
standing there like that?!

89
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,541
[HARUHIRO] 'Cause your
strategy is too obvious!

90
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,708
[HARUHIRO]
These guys are good.

91
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,166
They know how humans fight.

92

You bastard!

00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,500
Get away from her!

[HARUHIRO yells]

103

[HARUHIRO] I don't know
if I can take him alone.

Hiro! Give me some room!

Are you okay?

110
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,375
[HARUHIRO]
Yeah. I think so.

111
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,208
[MARY] O light,
return to Lumiaris' protection.

112
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,458
Now, heal.

113
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,625
[HARUHIRO]
He got away!

114
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,916
[RANTA]
Give me a hand, here. Hurry!

115
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,833
[MOGUZO chuckles]

116
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,416
That all you got?

117
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,333
Well, it's not gonna be enough!

118
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,291
[HARUHIRO] He seems like
a totally different person.

Om, Rel, Ect, Well, Dash!

All right!

128
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,166
You really scared me,
you know that?

129
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,583
Sorry.

130
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,916
I thought I could get him
if I was a little closer.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,875
That was reckless, Shihoru.

132
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,500
But totally awesome!

133
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:06,875
[HARUHIRO]
Good work, you guys,

134
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,291
but we're not done here yet...

135
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,583
We have to keep going
a little longer,

136
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,416
so let's stay strong and
finish what we started.

[BIG GOBLIN wheezing]

138

[RANTA]
Look at him.

139
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,791
He's already half-dead.

140
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,333
Around here,
it's kill or be killed.

It's not about fighting fair.

Please, no!
This can't be happening!

Sorry. It's hard
to talk just now.

I thought that it would.

[GOBLIN 4E laughing]

166
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,541
[YUME]
Haru!

167
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,833
[HARUHIRO growling]

168
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,125
You've always got my back.

169
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,458
Thank you.

170
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,750
[coughs]

171
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,583
Of course I do, Haru.
No problem.

172
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,000
[HARUHIRO] I'd thought
about it for a long time--

173
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,791
What this day would be like...

174
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,000
What I'd say to Manato
when it came.

175
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,958
Time can be funny.

176
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,416
It felt like we we'd
been in Grimgar,

177
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,958
fighting together
as a party for years.

178
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,666
But we weren't, of course.

179
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,916
In reality, it was
a pretty short time.

180
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,041
Much, much too short.

181
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,791
So here I am,

182
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,166
not exactly sure what to say.

183
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,208
Because when you
get right down to it...

184
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,416
How well did I know him?

185
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,458
He was friendly and smart.

186
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,625
Reliable and easy to talk to.

187
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,166
I thought he could do anything.

188
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,791
I thought he was perfect.

189
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,208
Except...

190
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,000
Nobody's perfect.

191
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,291
He must have had some faults...

192
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,208
Just because I didn't see them
doesn't mean they weren't there.

193
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,875
If only we'd had
more time together...

194
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,500
Maybe I would have seen
another side of him.

195
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,875
[HARUHIRO] I wish I'd
gotten to know him better.

196
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,041
For that matter,

197
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,000
I wish he'd gotten
to know me better, too.

198
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,666
Strong friendships
take time to build.

199
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,708
And no matter how much
I wish it were otherwise,

200
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,708
our time is over for good.

201
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,625
Who knows what might have
happened if he'd lived.

202
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,083
Maybe we be getting
on each other's nerves

203
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,583
and fighting all the time,

204
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,916
but somehow I doubt it.

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,375
I think we only would have
liked each other more.

206
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,666
Well, we did it.

207
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,833
We're real
Volunteer Soldiers now.

208
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,583
I thought it
would never happen.

209
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,458
Remember how broke we
were when we started out?

210
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,125
Forget buying badges.

211
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,833
We could barely even buy food.

212
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,583
We didn't know if we'd
have a roof over our heads

213
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:12,375
from one day to the next,
and underwear was a luxury!

214
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm not gonna lie;
there were a lot of days

215
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,250
I had to go commando.

216
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,083
Ugh!

217
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:16,875
[RANTA]
Calm down!

218
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,708
I'm wearing underwear now!

219
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,666
Despite everything, here we are.

220
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,250
We're finally
not trainees anymore.

221
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,166
Well, we actually could
have bought the badges

222
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,958
themselves a while ago,
but we decided to wait...

223
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,166
There were some loose ends
we wanted to tie up first.

224
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,791
We all thought it was best.

225
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,666
[RANTA]
Hmph.

226
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,833
Speak for yourself.

227
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,500
That wasn't how I
wanted to do things...

228
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,375
But you all kept nagging,
so I gave in.

229
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,541
You idiot!

230
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,958
Now is not the time
to be maliciousful.

231
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,125
Even you should
be able to see that!

232
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,708
Do you want people to hate you
more than they already do?

233
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,458
Go ahead.
Bring on the hatred.

234
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,833
What does it matter?
I'm a Dark Knight, remember?

235
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,250
People are supposed to hate me.

236
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,375
And I think what you
meant was "malicious," Yume.

237
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,000
Not "maliciousful."
You were close, though.

238
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,583
So... what do you think?

239
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,000
Maybe we should do it now?

240
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,250
Oh!

241
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,666
Well, um...

242
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,625
This is for you, from all of us.

243
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,416
We weren't sure what to do
with the money you left us.

244
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,666
So we saved it...

245
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,291
Then we all added some
of our own to buy this.

246
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:25,291
And Mary helped, even
though she didn't know you.

247
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,000
Anyway, here you go.

248
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,083
[HARUHIRO]
If you're watching, Manato...

249
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:48,125
You're probably shaking
your head at us right now.

250
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,166
I'm sure you'd think
it was a waste,

251
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,916
that we should've used
that money for equipment,

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,375
not a badge.

253
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,333
Even if that was how
you felt, it wouldn't matter.

254
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,375
We would have done it anyway.

255

[SHIHORU crying]

256
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,000
[crying continues]

257
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,208
It wasn't easy,

258
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,375
but we've become a good party.

259
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,958
[HARUHIRO]
So... how are your wounds?

260
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,375
[MARY] I used my
magic to heal them.

261
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,416
[HARUHIRO]
Oh, right. Makes sense.

262
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,583
[MARY] I wish my clothes were
doing as well as my injuries.

263
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,625
They've got holes everywhere.

264
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,166
[HARUHIRO] Too bad you can't use
magic to mend clothes, too, huh?

265
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,166
[MARY]
Yeah, it is.

266
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,250
[MARY] You know, I've
noticed something, Hiro.

267
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,458
You finally got to
avenge your friend,

268
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,625
but you still don't
seem very happy.

269
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,250
[HARUHIRO] Why did you
start calling me Hiro?

270
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,291
I'm sorry. I can stop.

271
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,875
You don't like it?

272
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,416
I've just never
been called that before.

273
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,916
It caught me off guard.

274
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay then. I'll still use it.

275
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,333
[HARUHIRO]
So... I was thinking...

276
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,875
[HARUHIRO] Clothes...
you have to mend yourself.

277
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,083
Grief and loss
are like that, too.

278
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,083
All the magic in the
world won't heal them.

279
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,875
Or, at least...
none that I know of.

280
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,541
Losing Manato was hard.

281
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,458
It still is.

282
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:15,458
We'll be grieving a long time.

283
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,250
But we're lucky...

284
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,750
Because our party

285
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,833
has only had to go through
the death of one member.

286
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,083
You lost three friends at once.

287
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,833
You know everything?

288
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,041
I'm sure you don't want
to talk about it.

290
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,541
[HARUHIRO]
Whoops. I shouldn't--

291
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,083
Geez. I really am sorry!

292
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,375
[MARY]
You were right.

293
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,958
What you said before...

294
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,375
There are wounds even the
strongest magic can't heal...

295
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,625
Not ever.

296
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,541
But, you know,

297
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,000
even though it was painful,

298
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,833
hearing you talk
about what happened--

299
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,583
You don't have to be sorry.

300
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,125
I'm glad you said it.

301
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,208
We can talk more...
if you want.

302

[clock chimes]

303

Well then, Hiro,
