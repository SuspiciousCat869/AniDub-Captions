--Gee, watch where you're going!
--Oh, it's you. Shut up!

00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,791
You're not the only
one who's fighting here!

5
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,541
Sometimes I think
I might as well be.

6
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,166
[MOGUZO]
Thank you!

7
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,541
[HARUHIRO] This is Yume's new
skill. It's called Star Strike.

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,000
I've got this one.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,791
Go help that idiot. He needs it.

10
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,250
You're the only idiot I see.

13
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,375
[MOGUZO]
Huh?

14
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,791
Stay back!

15
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:00,750
[HARUHIRO]
Huh?

16
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,166
Exhaust, now!

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,083
I call upon your power,
Dark Skullhell!

18
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,166
Bring never-ending fear
to those who refuse to obey!

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,041
Dread... Terror!

20
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,291
[HARUHIRO]
This generates fear,

21
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,083
making it difficult for
your opponent to fight

22
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,250
with a clear head.

23
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,291
It's magic only a
Dark Knight can cast.

24
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,083
This isn't how it's
supposed to work!

25
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,458
Exhaust!

26
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,166
He does seem confused,

27
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,041
but that's only making him
fight more fiercely.

28
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:30,208
[RANTA]
Exhaust! Exhaust! Exhaust!

29
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,208
Anger! Exhaust!

30
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,083
So... should I
still "stay back"?

31
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:36,666
[RANTA] Exhaust! Mind your
own business, will ya?

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,833
He's mine! My prey!
My nemesis!

33
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,250
[SHIHORU]
Um...

34
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,666
Are you sure you
don't want help?

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,458
I can handle this on my own!

36
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,125
Hatred!

37
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,333
All right, now's my chance!

38
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,500
Die!

[KOBOLD D groans]

40
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,166
[MARY]
Do you see that nose ring?

41
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,750
It's a kobold's
protective charm.

42
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,166
Every kobold has one.

43
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,791
They're like talismans to
keep the wearer from harm.

44
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:47,916
Really?

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,541
Well, for something
so important,

46
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,750
that ring sure doesn't look like
it would be worth very much.

47
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,583
[MARY] The kobolds in
the first level of the mine

48
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,875
are outsiders among
their own kind.

49
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,958
Sort of low-level ruffians.

50
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,250
They're poorly equipped

51
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,791
and by far the weakest
of the creatures.

52
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,041
Obviously, that means they're
also the easiest to defeat.

53
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,166
Volunteer Soldiers refer
to these as lesser kobolds.

54
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,375
[HARUHIRO] So these guys are
the poorest of the bunch, then.

55
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,750
I guess the others we face
will have better talismans.

56
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,958
[MARY]
Yes.

57
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,166
[RANTA] Hmph.
That's all very interesting.

58
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,375
I'll be taking this now.

59
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,666
What's that look for?

60
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,000
Nothing.

61
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,416
[HARUHIRO] I'm pretty sure
there's a nicer way

62
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,375
of claiming the spoils
from a fight.

63
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,208
But that's Ranta for you.
What can I do?

64
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,166
Whatever. Its fine.

65
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,500
[HARUHIRO]
This is where they live.

66
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,416
The mine is the kobolds' home.

67
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,583
So as far as they're
concerned, we're invaders.

68
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,000
But what does it matter
if we feel guilty?

69
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,166
It doesn't change anything.

70
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,208
We can remove their
talismans respectfully

71
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,916
or rip them off violently.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,250
The end result
is still the same.

73
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,000
The outcome's the same.

74
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,125
It's us who are different.

75
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,916
Ranta takes what he
wants without hesitation.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,750
But I'm trying to make up
for the guilt I feel.

77
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,875
Maybe that means
I'm a hypocrite.

78
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,083
Oh well.

79
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,500
That's not going to
make me change the way

80
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,458
I handle this sort of thing.

81
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,750
Doesn't matter if we're talking
about a friend or an enemy.

82
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,458
I think that all the dead
deserve respect.

83
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,541
C'mon, let's go.

84
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,083
[MARY] The Cyrene Mine
has more than ten levels.

85
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,250
Its population is broken
down into three castes.

86
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:27,583
There are lesser kobolds, normal
kobolds, and elder kobolds.

87
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,291
Status determines a lot.

88
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,666
Only the elders may
freely use the gondola.

89
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,125
[HARUHIRO]
The gondola?

90
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,208
[MARY] There is a gondola
installed in the mineshaft.

91
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,166
It operates from
the third layer down.

92
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,125
But when it comes to
navigating between levels,

93
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,750
we'll mostly be using the wells.

94
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,458
[MOGUZO] The gondola
must be heavily guarded,

95
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,500
so it makes sense to avoid it.

96
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,083
[MARY]
Exactly.

97
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:51,333
Now, the Elders are the leaders,
the normal ones are the workers.

98
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,875
As for the lesser kobolds,

99
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,416
they don't really have
any status to speak of.

100
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,750
[YUME]
Sounds like life's pretty tough

101
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,791
unless you're one of the elders.

102
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,000
We've only fought the
lesser kobolds so far,

103
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,916
but that's going to change.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,166
The higher castes
are further down.

105
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,125
That means we all need
to keep our guards up.

106
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,750
[howling]

107
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,958
[gasps]

108
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,541
Wow, they sure are noisy.
What's all the howling about?

109
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,541
[MARY] They do a lot of howling,
especially certain times of day.

110
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,083
But don't worry.

111
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,791
Sleeping kobolds only wake up
if something big's going on.

112
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,375
Does anyone else hear that?
It's like a low rumbling?

113
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,916
[RANTA]
Whoa!

114
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,041
[HARUHIRO]
They really are heavy sleepers.

115
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,250
Think I should kill 'em?
It'll be nice and quick.

116
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,708
It wouldn't take a lot of effort
or put us at much risk.

117
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,083
Easy money.

118
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,208
What's wrong with you?
Are you some kind of demon?

119
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,625
Come on, you know
better than that.

120
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,500
I'll tell you some stuff about
my class; maybe that will help.

121
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,750
Dark Knights aren't demons.

122
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,291
Just warriors serving
the Dark God Skullhell.

123
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,708
Our beliefs are simple.

124
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,416
Everyone's equal in death,
good or bad, rich or poor.

125
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,750
You've all heard me talk
about collecting Vices before,

126
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,916
haven't you?

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,458
Well, Vices are what
Dark Knights value.

128
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,541
They're the antithesis of
what you narrow-minded people

129
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,125
care about, like "morals"
or "good deeds," you follow?

130
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,583
The antithesis.

131
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,958
It's important so I'll
say it one more time.

132
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,916
Antithesis! Got it?

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,166
We're all gonna die anyway,

134
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,333
so why should we be
bound by stupid ideals

135
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,375
that do nothing but make
our lives a whole lot harder

136
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,750
and less enjoyable?

137
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,250
We should be driven by
our instincts, our impulses,

138
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,583
our desires.

139
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,083
Not some useless moral
code dictated by society.

140
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,500
We live our lives and
then we die. All of us.

141
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,583
We're equal in the end.
See what I'm saying?

142
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,416
[HARUHIRO]
You coming?

143
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,833
[RANTA]
Hey, listen to me!

144
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,000
[HARUHIRO] Yeah, yeah.
I'm listening, I'm listening.

145
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,250
[RANTA]
Ugh. You're so full of it!

146
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:13,041
Ohm, Rel, Ect. Nemun, Dash!

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,875
[HARUHIRO] Shihoru learned
a new skill, too.

148
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,666
It's called Shadow Bond.

149
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,500
It binds enemies' legs to
the ground so they can't move.

150
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,708
Like Sleepy Shadow,
it becomes less effective

151
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,375
the more worked up
an opponent is.

152
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,416
And strong opponents
can break free of it.

153
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,000
Shadow Bond isn't a foolproof
weapon, but it sure is handy.

154
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,916
Thank you!

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,041
[KOBOLDS groaning]

156
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,208
[HARUHIRO]
There it is. I know what to do.

157
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,166
[HARUHIRO] If I trust
the light, it will guide me.

158
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,125
I need to concentrate,
but stay calm,

159
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,375
and keep my breathing even.

160
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,833
If I move too quickly,
the light will disappear.

161
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,500
But I can't hesitate, either.

162
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,666
There's no time to worry

163
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,833
about whether I'm doing
everything right.

164
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,041
When I see the streak,

165
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,208
my body should already
be moving with it.

166
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,166
Almost like they're connected.

167
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,416
Otherwise, it won't work.

168
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,750
[YUME]
That spell is amazing!

169
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,666
It was like those guys
were glued to the ground.

170
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,666
Oh... Um, thank you.

171
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,041
These are the normal kobolds?

172
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,083
They weren't much tougher
than the other ones.

173
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,083
The third layer won't
be quite so easy.

174
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,750
That's where the elders are.

175
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,416
They're better equipped and
they know how to strategize.

176
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,333
[RANTA]
Hey, what're you waiting for?

177
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,125
Aren't we going down there?

178
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,500
[HARUHIRO]
No.

179
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,583
I think that we should head
back to Ortana for now.

180
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,958
[RANTA]
Wha?

181
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,000
We've done enough
here for today.

182
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,208
We'll come back, don't worry.

183
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,083
I just don't want us
to wear ourselves out.

184
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,166
[RANTA] Speak for yourself.
I'm not tired at all.

185
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,333
[HARUHIRO]
Mary?

186
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,750
I'm okay.

187
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,291
Really. I'm all right.

188
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,375
[HARUHIRO] Ranta and I
are having some issues.

189
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,791
Our personalities aren't
exactly what you might call

190
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,208
"compatible."

191
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:26,208
We barely avoided having
a full-on fight today.

192
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,916
From what I can tell, he doesn't
seem to be getting along

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,791
with Yume, Shihoru,
or Mary either.

194
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,083
Should I be doing
something about him?

195
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:38,541
Is it my job as the leader?

196
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:42,541
What would Manato do
if it were up to him?

197
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,333
It's hard to know for sure.

198
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,291
Honestly, I don't think
he liked Ranta very much.

199
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,583
But maybe liking him
wasn't important to Manato,

200
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,875
as long as he still
got the job done.

201
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,041
Ranta wasn't nearly as
disrespectful or defiant

202
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,250
with Manato as he is
now that I'm the leader.

203
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,875
And even if he tried to hide it,

204
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,291
he was pretty shaken up
when Manato died.

205
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,083
[sighs]

206
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,583
[HARUHIRO]
Why are things so different now?

207
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,166
Is it something I'm doing?

208
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,375
Hey, Ranta?

209
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,041
[RANTA]
What do you want?

210
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,708
Good, you're awake.

211
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,125
Think we could talk
about some stuff?

212
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,375
[RANTA grumbles]

213
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,375
Here might not be
the best place.

214
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,125
Why don't we go outside?

215
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,208
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

216
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,625
[HARUHIRO] I started this, but
now I don't know what to say.

217
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,583
I probably should've
thought it through more.

218
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,416
But I feel like we have
to talk to each other

219
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,833
if we ever want
things to get better.

220
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,333
I was just wondering...

221
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,500
[RANTA grumbles]

222
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,958
How are you feeling?

223
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,125
About our party, I mean.
Do you think we're doing well?

224
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,375
I guess. Our party's our party.

225
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,458
We earn enough to stay
alive, so that's good.

226
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,958
Really? That's all?

227
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,916
Do you care about anything
besides how much money we earn?

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,916
Why should I?

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,708
Get off my case.
What do you want from me?

230
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,166
I fulfill my duties
as a party member.

231
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,583
[HARUHIRO]
You think so?

232
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,791
Yeah. Haven't you been watching?

233
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,458
Like when we were fighting
in the mine today.

234
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,708
I proved I could take on
an opponent single-handedly

235
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,500
and win.

236
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,666
That was reckless.

237
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,916
It would've been
over a lot sooner

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,458
if all of us had
surrounded the kobold.

239
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,958
Can you guarantee
we'll always be able

240
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,458
to work as a group like that?

241
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,958
I don't think so.

242
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,000
But if I can reliably deal
with one opponent on my own,

243
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,708
well, that allows us to broaden
our tactics, doesn't it?

244
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,916
I just don't see how
that's a bad thing.

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,666
You can't just decide--

246
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,958
[HARUHIRO] I need to calm down.
I'm getting too worked up.

247
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,166
Even if I don't agree
with his actions,

248
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,958
at least he's given
them some thought.

249
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,750
Ranta does fight at
the front with Moguzo.

250
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,291
He's one of our lead
attackers. I respect that.

251
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,291
It's not a role I could take,
or Yume or Shihoru,

252
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:05,875
and we wouldn't
ask Mary to do it.

253
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,000
We've been through some changes

254
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,791
since Manato died
and Mary joined us.

255
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,208
Ranta's been reassessing
his role in the party,

256
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,666
just like the rest of us.

257
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,833
But that can only go so far.

258
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,500
Okay, I get what you were doing

259
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,833
since you told me,
but I didn't before.

260
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,541
It might've been better
if you'd said something

261
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,250
during the fight.

262
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,333
[RANTA]
And should I check with you

263
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,083
before I go and
take a leak, too?

264
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,833
Hey, come on. You know
that's not what I'm saying.

265
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,583
What I'm getting at is
that I won't always know

266
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,208
what you're doing or why you're
doing it unless you tell me.

267
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,125
On top of everything,
you're just...

268
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,541
Well, you're easily
misunderstood,

269
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,916
you know what I mean?

270
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,250
Hah.

271
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,291
Misunderstood, right. Like
that's actually what you think.

272
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,833
What?

273
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,125
What you're really saying is
that I'm wrong. It's my fault.

274
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,166
Let's blame it on poor,
misunderstood Ranta.

275
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,500
Well, if it's not your fault,
then whose is it?

276
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,708
Is it mine? Is it Yume's?

277
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,125
Or Shihoru's maybe?
Or Moguzo's?

278
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:02,916
No, wait its Mary's!

279
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,166
Easy.

280
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,166
Like it or not, we're a party,
so we're in this together.

281
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,208
We're supposed to be a team.

282
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,083
I wish we would act like it.

283
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,583
[RANTA] You don't think I'm
working as part of the team?

284
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,583
Well, do you think you are?

285
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,291
[RANTA]
Hell, no.

286
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,750
Do you wanna try?

287
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,666
Why bother? Everyone's got
their strengths and weaknesses.

288
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,250
Maybe teamwork's my weakness.

289
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,375
What about you, Oh Great One?
Don't you have any weaknesses?

290
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,875
Of course I do.

291
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,250
[HARUHIRO] Weaknesses?
I have plenty of those.

292
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,666
If anything, it's my strengths
I would have a hard time naming.

293
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,250
[HARUHIRO]
I know I have weaknesses.

294
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,375
I don't see why I need
to talk to you about them.

295
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,666
So we can talk about my faults,
but yours are off limits?

296
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,250
I think it's about time to wrap
up this little heart-to-heart,

297
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,416
okay?

298
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,833
Listen, Haruhiro.

299
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,375
You're the one who brought
all this stuff up, not me.

300
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,750
Remember that.

301
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,625
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but you wanted to talk,

302
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,041
so hey, here we are.

303
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,041
Fact is, I'm not interested
in being all buddy-buddy.

304
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,500
Play at being friends all you
want. Just leave me out of it.

305
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,583
If you want to spend your time
and energy hating me,

306
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,458
you're welcome to.

307
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,083
Really, I couldn't care less.

308
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,666
We're just a party,
not a family.

309
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll do my duty, don't worry.

310
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,958
That's what being
a team is about.

311
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,750
But don't expect me
to be your best friend.

312
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,541
I'm goin' to bed.

313

314
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,750
[HARUHIRO]
Nice!

315
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,416
I've been practicing.
You use knives too, right?

316
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,833
Yeah, but I'm not
as good as you.

317
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,666
That's some serious aim.

318
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,041
Oh, and thanks for the blanket.

319
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,583
That was nice of you.

320
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,833
I thought you looked cold.
Why'd you sleep out here?

321
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,833
I... must've dozed off.

322
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,791
[YUME] I'm still getting the
hang of knives, you know.

323
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,791
There's so much
to learn about them.

324
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,666
I had no idea which kind
was best for throwing.

325
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,625
Luckily, Master offered to take
me to the market and show me.

326
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,083
Oh, yeah?

327
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,583
It was so great.

328
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,208
We went to a merchant and
Master picked out two knives.

329
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,375
He said I had to choose
the one I liked best.

330
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,166
So I did, and Master bought it
for me. Nice, right?

331
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,000
Anyway, I was really happy
with the quality of the knife,

332
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,541
so happy that I went back and
bought the other one myself.

333
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,916
It looks like a good one.

334
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,958
That was really nice
of your master.

335
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,291
Yep!

336
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,166
[HARUHIRO]
Hm?

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,083
[MARY] O light, return
to Lumiaris' protection.

338
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,583
Blame, ready!

339
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,916
[HARUHIRO] This is the new
Light Magic that Mary learned.

340
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,708
Its range isn't very long, and
it doesn't do a lot of damage,

341
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,666
but it numbs the opponent,
slowing him down considerably.

342
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,208
Mary wanted to
increase her ability

343
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,375
to support Moguzo and
Ranta at the front.

344
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,416
[MOGUZO]
Thank you!

345
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,083
[RANTA]
Anger! Hatred! Hatred!

346
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,250
You won't have enough breath
to fight if you keep shouting.

347
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,416
Shut it!

348
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,916
I'm not complaining
about how you fight!

349
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,375
[gasps]

350
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,000
[yelling]

351
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,958
That was too close!
What if you had hit me, huh?

352
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,750
Well, if you'd have died,
I would've gotten an extra Vice.

353
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,958
Seems like a win-win.

354
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,833
[HARUHIRO]
What the hell is his problem?

355
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,750
No, I have to calm down.
That's just the way he is.

356
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,166
There's no point
in getting angry.

357
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,916
Too bad. I am angry.
Furious, actually.

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,250
I have to find a way
to get past it.

359
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,375
[MOGUZO]
Here I go!

360
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,666
[HARUHIRO] This is
Moguzo's new Fast Thrust.

361
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,250
It's a one-handed attack
with longer range.

362
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,875
He also learned Back Thrust,

363
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,250
an attack he can perform
while backing away.

364
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,791
Okay! Let's go for the elder!

365
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,666
[SHIHORU]
Marc, Em, Parc!

366
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,000
Quick, surround him!

367
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,166
Let's get through
this unscathed!

368
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,083
[yelling]

369
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,750
[MOGUZO]
It's pretty different, huh?

370
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,208
Now that we're past
the third level.

371
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,458
[SHIHORU] It looks like
this is... farmland.

372
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,958
Aww. Hey, look
at these little guys.

373
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,625
I almost wanna take
one home with me.

374
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,708
They're pretty cute,
aren't they?

375
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,291
[RANTA grumbles]

376
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,541
[SHIHORU]
Um... I guess so. A little bit.

377
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,500
[HARUHIRO]
Hey.

378
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,333
What? Don't give me that look.
I was just poking at it.

379
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,875
It's not like I was
actually gonna do anything.

380
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,458
That might be easier to believe
if I didn't know you so well.

381
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,250
You've got a real violent
streak, Ranta.

382
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,166
You can believe whatever you
want; I know what I intended.

383
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,625
[grumbles]

384
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,000
[sighs]

385
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,500
Okay, then.

386
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,541
Seriously, I was just teasing.
I wasn't gonna hurt it.

387
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,583
Fine. Let it go.

388
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,291
I will after you say
you believe me.

389
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,166
You weren't going to
hurt it. I believe you.

390
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,333
There, was that so hard?

391
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,375
[MARY]
Shh!

392
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,875
[RANTA] They don't know we're
here. We could ambush them.

393
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,541
[MARY] I don't think
that's a good idea.

394
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,291
From the fourth level down, it's
best to make an instant kill.

395
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,708
Otherwise, we risk
causing a commotion.

396
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,208
[clanging]

397
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,333
[gasps]

398
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,791
They know there are
ntruders now.

399
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,750
We should get down to
the fifth level quickly.

400
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:35,000
Kobolds have the advantage
in open fields like this.

401
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,083
[gasps]

402
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,458
Are you okay?

403
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,458
[HARUHIRO]
Mary!

404
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,750
What's up there?
What did you see?

405
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,291
A kobold with black
and white patches.

406
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,708
Looks like Death Spots is here.

407
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,125
[SHIHORU]
The Death Spots?

408
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:32,875
Are you sure?

409
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,083
[HARUHIRO]
Get down!
