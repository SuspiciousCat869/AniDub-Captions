1
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,166
[MANATO]
Sorry, could you wait a second?

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,708
[MANATO laughing]

3
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,208
[MANATO]
Come on. You try.

4
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,583
[SHIHORU]
No, that's all right.

5
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,291
I'll just watch from here.

6
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,416
It'll be okay, I promise.

7
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,708
They won't hurt you.

8
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,416
[MANATO]
You okay?

9
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,166
Yeah, thanks.

10
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,166
[SHIHORU]
Sorry.

11
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,458
I'm just so clumsy.

12
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,208
[MANATO]
No, I'm glad.

13
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,375
[SHIHORU]
Huh?

14
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,958
[MANATO] It gives us
more time together.

15
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,875
[ANIMAL meows]

16
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,583
[MANATO laughs]
You want some too, huh?

17
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,291
You really seem
to like animals.

18
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,500
Yeah.

19
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,416
We should go back.

20
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,958
[SHIHORU]
Oh, okay!

21
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,208
[MANATO]
And, fight!

22
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,500
[ALL]
Let's go!

23
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,208
[HARUHIRO] Does anybody
even know why we say that?

24
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,625
[SHIHORU]
I don't.

25
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,958
[MOGUZO]
It seems familiar, though.

26
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,375
Like I've heard it
somewhere before.

27
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,166
[YUME] Yeah, I feel like
I've heard it before, too.

28
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,750
Wonder what that's about.

29
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,625
[HARUHIRO]
Ranta!

30
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,750
There's one heading your way!

31
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,458
[RANTA]
I've got eyes, thanks!

32
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,333
C'mon, Anger!

33
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,500
[HARUHIRO]
That's Ranta's new skill.

34
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:48,666
Pretty feisty.

35
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,958
You're no ordinary goblin, huh?

36
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,833
[GOBLIN 4A chuckles]

37
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,375
Looks like a totally
ordinary goblin to me.

38
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,833
[HARUHIRO] Ranta isn't
the only one who learned

39
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,458
a new skill recently.

40
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,000
We earned enough
money for all of us

41
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:05,125
to go to our respective guilds
and improve our abilities.

42
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,791
Since they're still new skills,

43
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,958
the idea of using them in
a real fight is pretty scary.

44
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,583
But if we don't try them out,
we'll never perfect them,

45
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,166
so we don't really
have much of a choice.

46
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,166
[RANTA]
Whoa!

47
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,208
[YUME]
Ranta! What are you doing?

48
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
[YUME]
One!

49
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,916
[HARUHIRO]
That's Yume's new skill.

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,291
Diagonal Cross.

51
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,458
She chose to learn a skill
for a short-range weapon

52
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,791
rather than a bow.

53
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,125
[HARUHIRO]
Now!

54
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,583
[GOBLIN 4A yells]

55
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,666
[HARUHIRO]
Back Stab.

56
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,416
[HARUHIRO]
Wait, did I get the right spot?

57
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,875
--I think maybe I missed.
--[RANTA] All right!

58
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,500
You Dark Knights are
a bunch of savage beasts.

59
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,708
I'm surprised you're
not growing fur.

60
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't call me savage.
I prefer "monstrous."

61
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,208
It's cooler.

62
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,625
I am a monstrous Dark Knight

63
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,000
in service to the
Dark God, Skullhell.

64
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,958
I'm cold and ruthless and
know nothing of blood or tears!

65
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:03,500
Ohm. Rel. Ect. Well. Dash!

66
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,958
[HARUHIRO]
Shadow Beat Magic.

67
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,166
Mages can use the power
from magical beings

68
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,833
called "elementals."

69
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,125
When Shihoru
chose her new skill,

70
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,750
she decided to learn how
to use shadow elementals.

71
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,666
[HARUHIRO]
Smash.

72
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,500
Members of the Priest Guild
can't use weapons

73
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,416
that have a blade,
like swords and daggers.

74
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,375
In our party, Manato is
both healer and vanguard,

75
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,083
so this is an especially
critical skill for him to have.

76
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,833
Hatred, go!

77
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,833
[GOBLIN 4B yells]

78
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,125
[HARUHIRO]
Good, they've locked blades.

79
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,041
Moguzo has the advantage now.

80
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,875
[HARUHIRO] This is
Moguzo's new skill, Wind.

81
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,625
Go on! Get him!

82
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,916
[MOGUZO yells]
Thank you!

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,083
[HARUHIRO] Rage Blow,
or the Thanks Slash.

84
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,625
For some reason,
he always says "thank you"

85
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,666
when he does it.

86
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,166
That's where the
nickname comes from.

87
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,333
The strength of that blow

88
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:06,833
definitely should not
be underestimated.

89
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,791
[GOBLIN 4C]

90
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,875
[RANTA]
Woohoo! Yeah!

91
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:11,583
[GOBLIN 4C groans]

92
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,416
Got it! My third Vice!

93
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,958
This'll give my demon
some good power!

94
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,583
Now it'll whisper to enemies
and lower their defenses.

95
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,666
If it feels like it.
[chuckles]

96
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,041
Dark Knight demons
seem pretty useless to me.

97
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,791
I mean, do they
even do anything?

98
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,833
Hey.

99
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,416
You know I can't
let that slide, man.

100
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,416
Don't talk about my little
buddy Zodiaco like that.

101
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,750
Or I'll curse you.

102
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,125
[HARUHIRO] Ranta's kinda
sensitive when it comes

103
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,833
to his demon,

104
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,833
which he named Zodiaco
for some reason.

105
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,916
Actually, his real
name is Zodiac.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,541
Zodiaco is his nickname.

107
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,458
Not that it really matters.

108
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,666
I think Zodiaco's
actually kinda cute.

109
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,583
Which is a whole lot more
than I can say for his owner!

110
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,041
[HARUHIRO]
Seriously?

111
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,166
[RANTA]
I'm not his owner!

112
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,416
Don't be stupid!

113
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,583
You can't own
a demon like a pet.

114
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,125
That's not how it works.

115
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,583
It's more like Zodiaco
is possessing me.

116
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,375
[YUME] I really just
couldn't care less.

117
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,666
[HARUHIRO]
Neither could I.

118
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,291
[HARUHIRO]
Manato?

119
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,916
[YUME] Oh, I forgot.
I need to pray!

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,666
My Dear White God Elhit.

121
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,625
Thank you for everything.

122
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,583
Here's some of my food.
I hope you like it.

123
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,625
Please keep watching
over me, okay?

124
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,875
That was nice.

125
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,833
So is it a standard
Hunter Guild practice?

126
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,416
Yeah, it sure is.

127
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,791
Dear Elhit is our god.

128
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,250
The one who protects Hunters
while we hunt and stuff.

129
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,250
So it's good to pray and make
offerings once in a while.

130
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,250
Dear Elhit?

131
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,541
That's what you call your god?

132
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,708
[YUME]
Uh-huh!

133
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,875
I don't think I'll
get in trouble for it.

134
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,958
See, my Dear White God
Elhit is a huge wolf.

135
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,791
And wolves are noble
beasts, you know.

136
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,291
They're fierce and strong,

137
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,000
but they have big hearts and
care a lot about their pack.

138
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,666
Besides, Master
never scolded me for it.

139
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,750
[HARUHIRO]
Hmm.

140
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,291
[SHIHORU]
That's really nice, Yume.

141
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:01,083
I bet your god understands
how you feel and respects it.

142
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,041
And, you know, so do I.

143
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,375
Because, well, feelings,
they really matter.

144
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,708
[YUME]
Well, that's a good thing,

145
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,041
because I've got lots
and lots of feelings.

146
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,791
When I lay down at night,
I'm really tired, you know?

147
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,333
So I fall asleep quick,

148
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,375
and a bunch of the time
my dreams are of Dear Elhit.

149
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,708
I ask "Hey, can I
ride on your back?"

150
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:24,125
Then Dear Elhit leans down,
and lets me climb right on!

151
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,250
And we take off
running super-fast.

152
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,375
And I'm like,
"Whoa, this is so cool.

153
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,708
Let's keep going!" And we do.

154
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,000
We spend all night long
just running and running.

155
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,041
Hey, are we gonna get to
the point anytime soon, Yume?

156
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,458
I mean, there is a point
to this story, isn't there?

157
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,583
Because I've been listening
patiently for, like,

158
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,791
twenty minutes.

159
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,583
So if there isn't one,
I'm gonna be pissed.

160
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,541
A point? Not really.

161
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,791
[RANTA]
Gah!

162
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,166
Okay, that's it!

163
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,625
I'm never listening to
another one of your stories.

164
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,875
[MANATO laughing]

165
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,375
Oh, man.

166
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,041
Here I was thinking about
what a good party we've become.

167
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,958
We're consistently
defeating three goblins

168
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,416
at a time these days.

169
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,083
If we tweak our strategy,
we might be able to do four.

170
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,000
Moguzo is our reliable shield.

171
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,291
A stalwart defender.

172
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,791
He's big, strong, and steady.

173
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,000
Perfect for overpowering
our enemies.

174
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,458
His sword strikes
aren't flashy,

175
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,458
but they're
powerful and accurate.

176
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,500
And don't forget--

177
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,750
He's also very deft
with his hands.

178
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,833
Oh, you think so?

179
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,500
I don't know why, but...

180
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:31,375
I like doing detailed work,
like cooking and carving.

181
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,666
[RANTA]
It doesn't fit you.

182
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,583
You're amazing, too, Ranta.

183
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,750
I really admire your
willingness to attack.

184
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,083
The rest of us tend to be
a little more cautious.

185
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,625
If it weren't for you,

186
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,250
there were some times we might
never have advanced at all.

187
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,708
You, uh, really mean that?

188
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,666
See, now that
doesn't fit you.

189
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,916
That's enough outta you.

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,041
[YUME giggling]

191
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,583
[MANATO] And Yume,
you're never afraid.

192
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,125
Nothing fazes you.

193
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,083
I think you're probably the
bravest one out of all of us.

194
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,458
As the party's healer,
I always have to be careful,

195
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,208
so I'm glad I can
count on you to step in

196
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,458
and act when I'm not able to.

197
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,125
You think I'm brave?

198
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,708
Well, I guess there
aren't too many things

199
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,458
I'm afraid of, huh?

200
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,916
I'm just glad you've
all been patient

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,166
with a Hunter who's
no good with a bow.

202
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,625
Everybody's got things
they're not very good at.

203
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,583
You aren't alone there.

204
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,500
But we cover for each other.

205
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,833
'Cause we're a party.

206
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:21,958
[YUME]
Mm-hmm.

207
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,416
And Shihoru.

208
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,125
You're quiet, but you're
smart and observant.

209
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,500
And shadow magic--

210
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,583
It mostly employs spells
used to confuse

211
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,625
and bind enemies, right?

212
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,916
Those spells are usually
used to provide support

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,458
for other fighters.

214
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,416
That's why you
chose shadow magic.

215
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,458
So you could look out
for all of us.

216
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,291
[MANATO] I didn't realize
how long we'd been here.

217
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,958
It's getting late.

218
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,666
Heh. So it's time to
get back to work, huh?

219
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, let's go.

220
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,708
[RANTA]
All right!

221
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,791
[HARUHIRO]
Hey, wait.

222
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,666
What about me?

223
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,958
Oh, well. I'll ask him later.

224
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,416
There's plenty of time.

225
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,875
[HARUHIRO]
Or... there should've been.

226
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,208
[HARUHIRO gasps]

227
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,500
[MANATO]
Haruhiro!

228
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,166
[HARUHIRO screams]

229
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,166
[MANATO]
Haruhiro!

230
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,000
[YUME]
Haru!

231
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,208
[HARUHIRO]
It really hurts.

232
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,208
--Stay back!
--[HARUHIRO] I can't breathe.

233
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,250
[HARUHIRO screams]

234
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,666
Return to Lumiares'
divine protection. Cure.

235
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,875
[YUME, SHIHORU scream]

236
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,708
Damn you!

237
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,833
Shihoru, fall back!

238
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:16,625
Right!

239
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,333
[RANTA yells]

240
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,541
Guys!

241
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,791
There are too many of them!

242
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,375
We need to retreat!

243
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,750
Quick, this way!

244
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,125
How's the shoulder? You okay?

245
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,291
Mapping this area
was pretty smart.

246
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,916
[laughing]

247
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,250
Manato?

248
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,541
I'm okay...

249
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,500
[ALL panting]

250
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,125
[HARUHIRO]
Manato?

251
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,291
[HARUHIRO]
Manato? Manato!

252
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,708
Hurry up! Heal yourself!

253
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,625
[MANATO groaning]

254
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,708
It's not working!

255
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,875
[HARUHIRO]
No! What are you saying?

256
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:54,916
Make it work!

257
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,416
Uh, if he meditates
for a while--

258
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,166
There's no time
for that crap!

259
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,458
Listen.

260
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,416
You're our leader.
You've gotta tell us what to do.

261
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,458
Come on, Manato! Tell us!

262
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,958
[MANATO]
Haru...

263
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,333
I'm sorry.

264
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,125
What are you talking about?

265
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,791
Why are you apologizing?

266
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,000
You have to--

267
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,291
"Have to"? I don't
know what you're saying!

268
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,541
Manato!

269
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,208
You have to tell me or
I won't know what to do!

270
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,000
Tell me!

271
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,125
Manato!

272
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,958
Manato!

273
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,000
You can't do this! Manato!

274
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,750
Well! Come on, hurry!

275
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,916
Don't just stand there!

276
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,125
We have to stop the bleeding.

277
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,416
[RANTA]
Lay him down! Gently!

278
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,250
[HARUHIRO]
Pull the arrow out!

279
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,083
[RANTA]
Okay, I'll do it.

280
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:42,791
You ready?

281
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,500
[MOGUZO]
Be careful!

282
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,750
[RANTA]
And pull!

283
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,916
[squelching noise]

284
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,166
[footsteps]

285
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,166
[HARUHIRO]
You have to save him!

286
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,916
Please! Help us!

287
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,125
Manato's been shot.

288
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,250
He'll die if he
doesn't get help.

289
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,541
I'll do anything!

290
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,041
Save him!
I'm begging you! Please!

291
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,208
Please, you have to help us!

292
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,708
Help him!

293
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,625
[HARUHIRO]
Come on!

294
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,250
Do something!

295
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,041
There is nothing
I can do for him.

296
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,541
No one can bring
the dead back to life.

297
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,166
Manato, how could
you be so foolish?

298
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,000
You showed such promise.

299
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:41,041
Now your life has ended and that
promise will never be fulfilled.

300
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,083
Bastard!

301
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:42,958
You're messing with us,
aren't you?

302
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,250
Ranta, don't!

303
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,541
It's okay.

304
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,166
This is all just a mistake.

305
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,708
We learned our lesson.

306
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,333
We let down our guard, but we'll
be more careful from now on.

307
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,375
Okay?

308
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,708
It won't happen again.

309
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,250
Really. We'll do better.

310
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,083
Hey, uh, are you okay?

311
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,458
Yeah, we're all okay.

312
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,875
Manato said this world
was scary and dangerous,

313
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,291
but we'd all be okay
if we just stuck together.

314
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,750
That's what he said.

315
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,125
Overcome today's problems
and move forward.

316
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,750
There's always tomorrow.

317
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,666
Right?

318
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,958
Isn't there? Isn't there?!

319
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,166
[HONEN] You must be sure
to give him a proper funeral.

320
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,083
The borderlands are

Those who aren't laid to rest
properly become his servants.

322
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,541
I'm sure you agree
that Manato deserves

323
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,250
a better fate than that.

324
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,083
What are you saying?
What will happen to him?!

You have five days at most.

326
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,000
There have been
instances of corpses

reanimating as soon
as three days after death.

[MOGUZO gasps]

329
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,625
Reanimating?

330
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,875
As I said, that's not
a fate Manato deserves.

331
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,625
I'm certain you want
better for your comrade.

So when you say

333
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,500
that we need to lay
Manato to rest properly,

334
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:12,791
you mean he has to be
cremated instead of buried.

335
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,250
That is correct.

336
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,291
Cremation...

337
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,916
I assume that's not free?

338
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,083
If you do not
have adequate funds,

339
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:36,791
I will see to--

340
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,500
No! We'll do it!

341
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,166
But thank you.

342
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,916
Manato is our...

343
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He was our...

344
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,125
Manato...

345
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,000
...was our friend.
