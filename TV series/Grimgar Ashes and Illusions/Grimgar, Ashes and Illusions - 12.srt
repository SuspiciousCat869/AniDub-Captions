Ha. I promise
I don't taste good.

00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,208
Huh, didn't see that coming.

00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,458
They're ugly, but
they sure are friendly.

6
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,416
Maybe they like Dark Knights.

7
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,833
Ew, gross!

00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:32,250
O Darkness, Master of Vices.

Caterpillar,
caterpillar, caterpillar!

12
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,166
Why the hell are you
calling me "caterpillar"?

13
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,458
Hey, Zodiaco, come on. I really
need to get out of this mine.

14
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,791
Think you could
help me with that?

[ZODIAC]
No, no, no, no, no, no!

Die, die, die. Just die...

17
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,250
[RANTA]
Yeah, thanks.

18
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,750
I'm already halfway
there, I think.

19
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:02,958
[ZODIAC]
Don't you want to die

20
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,333
and feel Lord
Skullhell's embrace?

21
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,708
Doesn't that sound nice?

Caterpillar, caterpillar...

00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:13,083
[RANTA] All right! Fine!
I'm a caterpillar. Whatever.

25
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,708
[MARY] O light, return to
Lumiaris' divine protection.

26
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:18,916
Cure.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,125
All right, let's focus

28
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,500
and talk about what
we're going to do next.

29
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,875
We've made it this far.
Let's keep being smart, okay?

30
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,041
We will do all we can
to rescue Ranta.

31
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,250
But that doesn't mean we should
start getting reckless.

32
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,083
He wouldn't thank us for that.

33
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,666
Hey, guys.

34
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,541
I wanna say... Ranta isn't
my favorite person.

35
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,250
I think everybody
knows that by now.

36
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,375
He says mean things
about my appearance.

37
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,625
No matter how many times
I ask him to stop,

38
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,208
he keeps on doing it.

39
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,666
I don't think anyone can blame
me for not liking him very much.

40
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,708
Let's be honest, he's just kind
of a jerk, you know? But...

41
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,416
...jerks can still get scared.

42
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,000
I would be,
down there all alone.

43
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,250
I hate even thinking about

44
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,541
what he must be going
through right now.

45
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,916
Poor Ranta, facing
Death Spots by himself.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,625
We should be down there,
helping him. It's not fair!

47

[YUME crying]

48
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,833
I wouldn't worry too much.

49
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,583
If Ranta could be
killed that easily,

50
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,958
he'd have died a
hundred times by now.

51
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,166

Ranta's waiting for us.

It does sound like
his kind of trouble.

Look! There!

60
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,166
[HARUHIRO] Is it really him?
He managed to get away?

61
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,291
That's incredible! He was
basically surrounded by kobolds.

62
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:30,250
His will to live is greater than
anyone else's I've ever met.

63
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,083
The rest of us are strong, too,

64
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,916
but no one can
rival his tenacity.

are you doing here?

You can't just show up
out of nowhere like that.

I didn't need you, Haruhiro.

No, I'm not!

Your eyes are all red
and watery, though.

101
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,875
Yours would be too
if you were hurt.

102
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,166
Well, you better be careful.

103

If I didn't know better,

104
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,458
I might almost think that
you're glad to see us again.

Of course I'm glad to see you!

I don't care about
you morons that much!

When I thought I would never
see your ugly faces again,

110
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,625
my chest just got a little
tight, that's all.

111
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,458
Talking about your chest now?

112
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,875
That's a nice change of pace.

Come on, you know what I meant!

No, I don't.

115
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,208
I just felt a little,
well, you know--

116
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,541
[YUME]
Yes?

117
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,750
A little...

[YUME]
Hmm? Go on. I'm waiting.

Tell me all about it.

Enough!

00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,375
You need to be quiet
and stay still.

Or if you want, I can
just stop healing you.

Um... no ma'am.

Hey, everyone!

I think we're all clear.

What do you say, guys?

136
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,625
That sounds like a great idea.

137
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:35,166
Yeah, we've been down here
forever. I'm glad it's done.

138
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,458
[HARUHIRO]
It's not over quite yet.

139
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,041
Nobody let your
guard down, 'kay?

140
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,666
We still have to
make it back to Ortana.

141
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,125
[HARUHIRO]
Back there in the well,

142
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,750
Ranta said, "You're our
leader, aren't you?"

143
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,708
That felt strange to me.

144
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,375
Because as hard as I've tried,

145
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,458
it's always felt like Manato
was still our real leader.

146
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:01,333
And until I became like him,
I would only be pretending,

147
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,125
like a kid playing
dress-up or something.

148
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,291
But...

149
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,833
But the thing is,
I'll never be Manato.

150
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,875
Sorry, just thinking out loud.

151
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,875
[HARUHIRO]
Everyone's different.

152
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,000
We all have strengths
and weaknesses.

153
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,916
That's what Manato believed.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,916
Although, as much
as I've thought about it,

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,125
I still don't know what
his weaknesses were.

156
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,958
I can't say the same
about myself.

157
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,625
I know there are a ton of things
I still need to work on.

158
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,916
Fortunately though, my friends
are always there to help me.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,875
Their strengths balance out
my weaknesses, and vice versa.

160
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,541
I think that's why we
work so well as a party.

161
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:43,458
Except, if I was a real leader,
wouldn't I be stronger?

162
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,208
Able to manage on my own?

163
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,791
I dunno.

164
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,000
If things are running
smoothly enough,

165
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,750
I guess that's all that
really matters, isn't it?

166
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,375
Like with Ranta.

167
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,125
We may not always get along,
but if we fight well together,

168
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,500
who cares about that?

169
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,916
Surviving each day is what
matters most in the end.

170
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,791
[MARY]
Hiro.

171
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,208
I'm pretty drained. I won't be
able to use magic for a while.

172
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,583
I might be able
to manage one Cure.

173
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,500
I need to get
somewhere to meditate.

174
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,875
[HARUHIRO]
I don't know much about magic,

175
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,875
but I can tell Mary's
serious about this.

176
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,958
Shihoru looks drained, too.

177
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,833
All right. We should
get moving, then.

178
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,208
We'll try to make
it out of the mine

179
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,666
without bothering
the lesser kobolds.

180
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,750
[KOBOLD A growling]

181
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,083
You've gotta be kidding!
Will he ever quit?

182
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,208
Marque, Em, Parc!

183
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,458
Thank you!

184
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,875
You have to be careful!

185
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,541
The more damage he takes,
the stronger he gets!

186
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,625
You mean he can get
stronger than this?

187
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,166
[roaring]

188
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,500
[HARUHIRO]
What should we do? Run?

189
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,416
It's our only choice,
but can we outrun him?

190
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,750
I don't think that will work
now that he's found us.

191
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,916
Our best bet at this point
is to leave somebody behind

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,291
to slow him down.

193
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,250
[yelling]

194
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,958
[HARUHIRO] I didn't think
about it for long.

195
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,416
My body just started moving.

196
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,583
[HARUHIRO]
Spider!

197
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,333
I'm counting on you!

198
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,208
Got it, Ranta? Get going!

199
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,333
[gasps]

200
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,916
[MARY]
Hiro!

201
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,250
Are you crazy, Mary?! Come on!

202
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,291
Let go of me!

203
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,416
We're leaving now!

204
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,875
[MARY crying]

205
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:36,041
[HARUHIRO]
Mary, are you crying?

206
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,291
Please don't cry.

207
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:43,500
Go on... Get out of here...
Everyone...

208
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,541
[HARUHIRO]
Is he saying something?

209
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,541
Don't you dare give up!

210
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,750
[gasps]

211
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,541
And don't die either.
Or I'll be pissed!

212
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:02,250
Get out of the mine. Hurry. Ah!

213
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,541
Damn. It's broken.

214
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,583
[KOBOLD A growling]

215
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,666
[HARUHIRO]
That's what I'm up against,

216
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,791
and you're telling me
not to give up?

217
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,833
Pretty ruthless, Ranta.

218
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,083
[HARUHIRO]
Still...

219
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,458
You didn't give up
when it was your turn.

220
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,041
So I guess I can't either, huh?

221
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,000
[HARUHIRO]
Mary, will you come back for me?

222
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,333
And cast Dispel like
you did for the others?

223
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,500
At least that way I'd
get to see you again.

224
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,875
Maybe. Someday.

225
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,791
[HARUHIRO] This is it...
a battle of life and death.

226
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:01,375
[HARUHIRO] I can't give up.
I can't stop fighting now.

227
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,458
As long as there's
still breath in my body,

228
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,416
I'll keep the battle going.

229
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,375
I won't give up.
Not until I'm dead!

230
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,708
Come on!

231
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,333
[HARUHIRO]
Huh?

232
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,666
[HARUHIRO] That's strange.
He's standing still.

233
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:30,291
No, that's not it.
He is moving, just very slowly.

234
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,166
[HARUHIRO]
Don't think. Act.

235
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:33,625
[MARY humming]

236
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,833
[HARUHIRO]
Huh?

237
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:54,208
Mary... is this Heaven?

238
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:03,625
[MARY laughing]

239
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,458
Not Heaven. Home.

240
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,791
Haru! You're awake!
It's about time!

241
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,291
Sorry, I didn't mean
to keep you waiting.

242
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,791
I bet you're hungry. Here.

243
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,625
[HARUHIRO]
Great, thank you.

244
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,250
Is something the matter?

245
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,625
Oh. I was just wondering
what happened.

246
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,791
You really don't remember?

247
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,791
[chuckles]

248
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,250
Take a look.

249
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,916
[RANTA]
That's 30 gold.

250
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,291
It's the bounty on Death Spots.

251
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,458
That oughta jog your
memory a little bit.

252
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,250
We agreed that we wouldn't
make any decisions

253
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,208
about how to divide it
until after you woke up.

254
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,708
Ranta said to wait.

255
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,583
He wanted to hear what you
thought since you're the leader.

256
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,041
[HARUHIRO]
Ranta said that?

257
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,666
[RANTA] Yeah. You don't
have to look so surprised.

258
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,083
Anyway, when we went
back to get you,

259
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,541
we took a little
souvenir with us.

260
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,083
[HARUHIRO]
You came back for--?

261
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,166
Right. I guess that
explains how I got here.

262
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,458
Given the way he looked,

263
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,083
we didn't think that
Death Dots would miss it.

264
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,291
[HARUHIRO]
"Dots"?

265
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,416
Yume, I think you
mean Death Spots.

266
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,041
Oh, so you mean that's--?

267
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:22,791
[MOGUZO]
Yeah.

268
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,000
My sword was broken,

269
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,958
and his seemed like
a good quality piece,

270
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,333
so I thought I would
try it out, you know?

271
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,250
[HARUHIRO] Seriously?
You're amazing, Moguzo.

272
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,625
[MOGUZO]
Oh, not really.

273
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,541
I mean, I can't
use it like this.

274
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,083
I was thinking I might
take it to a swordsmith.

275
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,625
[HARUHIRO]
Ha.

276
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,916
I guess that's one of the ways
we'll use the bounty, then.

277
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,333
[MOGUZO]
Would you mind?

278
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,166
[YUME] When it's done,
we have to give it a name, okay?

279
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,916
And it should be something
that's really cute.

280
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,125
[MOGUZO]
A name? Like what?

281
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,208
[YUME]
I don't know.

282
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,875
Like Cleaver Number One
or something.

283
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,500
[SHIHORU] Yeah, that's kind
of cute. I guess...

284
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,708
[chuckles]

285
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,875
[BRITTANY]
Not too bad, little ones.

286
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,916
[MARY]
Hey. Here.

287
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,750
I fixed it for you.

288
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,958
[HARUHIRO]
The slight weight of the badge

289
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,958
settled against my chest,

290
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:35,666
and somewhere deep inside,
I felt myself grow calm.

291
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,750
And when that happened...
it suddenly became clear to me.

292
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,875
I really am home now.

293
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,041
[chuckles]

294
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,750
Took long enough.

295
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,916
[KIKKAWA] Hey! I heard all
about it, Haru-Haru!

296
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,958
You crazy kids killed Spots,
huh? That's amazing!

297
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:12,791
I'm super jelly jealous! Way to
go, man! Way to go, go, go!

298
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,500
Australia!

299
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,541
Yeah! To Australia!

300
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,500
[RANTA laughing]

301
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,125
Ha. I never know
what he's saying.

302
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,375
[SHINOHARA]
Hm.

303
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,458
They brought her back.
I'm so glad.

304
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,791
[MAN A]
Renji.

305
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,625
Renji, what's up?

306
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,416
[RENJI]
I wanted to say sorry.

307
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,625
For the way I acted
when Manato died.

308
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,791
[HARUHIRO]
Oh...

309
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,708
No. It's all right.
You don't need to apologize.

310
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,333
[RENJI]
I don't? Really?

311
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,916
I was in denial.

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,791
What you did helped me
to start facing the fact

313
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,250
that he was gone.

314
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,666
It woke me up.

315
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,583
So, I don't know, maybe
I should thank you.

316
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,208
All right, then.

317
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,500
[RANTA]
Ha!

318
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,791
Listen up! The drinks
are on us today!

319
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,416
So what d'ya say
to another round?

320
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
[MANATO]
What're you doing here again?

321
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,708
Why?

322
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,791
You don't want me coming?

323
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:53,041
No, that's not it.
You're welcome to.

324
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,000
[HARUHIRO]
Well anyway,

325
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,375
I came today because there's
something I wanted to ask you.

326
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,666
[MANATO]
What is it?

327
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,500
[HARUHIRO] I never thought
to ask while you were alive,

328
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,208
but was being a
leader tough for you?

329
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,958
[MANATO]
Has it been difficult for you?

330
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,750
I'm not sure.

331
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,250
You know, Haru,

332
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,291
you've really grown
since we first met.

333
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,708
Oh, really?

334
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,041
[HARUHIRO] Well, I am different
from the person I was yesterday.

335
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,666
I know that much.

336
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,375
And I guess I'll be a different
person again tomorrow.

337
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,250
That's how it is.

338
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,916
We change every day because
we learn something every day.

339
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,375
We live in the present,
but we work toward the future.

340
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,166
Goodbye for now. I'll be back.

341
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,375
[HARUHIRO] I arrived in this
world with no real memories.

342
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,291
Just echoes of
things I once knew.

343
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,000
And I'm discovering that
the longer I live here,

344
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,250
the fainter they become.

345
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:31,708
Like they're being
erased by time.

346
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,333
Wherever I came from,

347
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:38,875
I'm forgetting it more and more
completely every day I'm here.

348
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,291
I used to constantly feel

349
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,708
like I was forgetting
something important,

350
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,458
but not anymore.

351
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,666
Things are different.

352
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,791
There's the solid feeling
of stone beneath me,

353
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,958
and the soft rush
of air as I breathe.

354
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,708
Those things ground me.

355
00:22:56,791 --> 00:23:04,000
They help me stay present,
and I'm thankful for that.

356
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,250
I have new memories now.

357
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:09,000
And they're more
than just echoes.

358
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,750
Much more.

359
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:16,458
These are memories that
I won't allow time to erase.

360
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,375
They're for me to keep.

361
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,125
Well, you guys. Let's go.
