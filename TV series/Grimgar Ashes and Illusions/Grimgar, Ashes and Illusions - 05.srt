165
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,458
maybe Kikkawa has a point.

166
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,000
What would Manato want us to do?

167
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,333
--It'll be fine, you'll see.
--[RANTA] Try to stay positive?

168
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,833
Well, I'm positive
about one thing, anyway.

169
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,250
We've got no Priest.

170
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,750
All right,
so find another one.

171
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,916
--[RANTA] How--
--[KIKKAWA] Ah!

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,958
Wait, I bet I know
what you're thinkin'.

173
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,083
Lemme guess:

174
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,583
"What Priest would
want to join a party

175
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,291
of Trainee Volunteer Soldiers?

176
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,083
How do we find
someone like that?"

177
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,291
By the way, did I tell you
I'm not a trainee anymore?

178
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,166
Really. I got a badge.

179
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:50,708
Wanna see?

180
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,875
No thanks.

181
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,083
You're right. That's
exactly what I'm thinking.

182
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,666
Our party's weak,

183
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,333
and I don't know if any Priest
out there would want to join us.

184
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,125
Eh, that isn't
necessarily true.

185
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,000
Huh?

186
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,041
I can hook you up.

187
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,250
I know a lot of
people around here.

188
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,291
What d'ya say?

189
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,708
You know someone
who'd join us?

190
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,500
[KIKKAWA] Just one thing
before we go any further.

191
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,916
Think you could remind me
what your names were again?

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,750
I know! I'm sorry,
I'm sorry!

193
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,541
I really thought they were
going to come back to me

194
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,875
while we were talking,
but I've got nothing.

195
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,666
Come on, just tell me!

196
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,250
Aw, tell me, please? Crescendo!

197
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,041
[RANTA]
So, anyway, this is Mary.

198
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,166
She's a Priest.

199
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,916
Anybody?

200
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,583
Well, um, hello.

201
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,958
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

202
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,041
All right, what now?

203
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,125
Where are we going?
To Damuro?

204
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,375
Oh. Yeah, maybe. Sure.

205
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,208
[MARY]
Really? You don't sound sure.

206
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,208
[HARUHIRO]
Absolutely!

207
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,541
Damuro. Old city.
Goblin hunting.

208
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,500
What's wrong?

209
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,166
You aren't making any sense.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
[RANTA] You know,
you might wanna watch

211
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,500
your tone there, missy!

212
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,291
That attitude doesn't
seem very Priestly to me.

213
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,208
Actually, on second thought,
don't change a thing. Really.

214
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,500
You're perfect
just the way you are.

215
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,583
I don't know what
I was talking about.

216
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,958
Seriously, my bad.

217
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,166
Don't listen to me.

218
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,250
[HARUHIRO]
Good job, Ranta.

219
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,833
Way to stand firm.

220
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,750
[MARY]
Are we going or not?

221
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,333
If not, then I'm leaving.

222
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,375
Oh, we, uh...

223
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,458
[laughs nervously]

224
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,583
[RANTA] I can't stand
another day with that girl.

225
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,333
[HARUHIRO] Then maybe you should
say something to her about it.

226
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,625
I gotta say, Haruhiro,

227
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,458
it sounds suspiciously
like you're trying

228
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,125
to get someone else to do
what you're too scared to.

229
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,291
[HARUHIRO]
Leave me alone.

230
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,083
I don't have the
energy to fight you.

231
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,666
[RANTA] You're no fun,
you know that?

232
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,958
No fun at all.

233
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,125
[HARUHIRO]
Mary was pretty much exactly

234
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,666
as Kikkawa described her.

235
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,083
Basically, she
doesn't cooperate.

236
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,625
At all.

237
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,625
[MARY]
No.

238
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,916
That's a bad plan,

239
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,250
and I do not intend
to go along with it.

240
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,416
Um, you don't like the plan?

241
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,750
But why?

242
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,000
[MARY] For starters,
I can't fight at the front.

243
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,083
That should be obvious.

244
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,458
I'm a Priest.

245
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,875
Look here, buddy!

246
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,041
Excuse me?

247
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,416
You're kidding, right?

248
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,833
We're in the same party!

249
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,250
You can't expect me to
be polite all the time, Mary.

250
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,125
Miss.

251
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,458
Miss Mary.

252
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,416
[RANTA] Anyway, is that
staff just for show?

253
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,958
[MARY]
Yes. It is, actually.

254
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,583
[RANTA]
Ugh! You freakin'--

255
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,666
[MARY]
Pardon?

256
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,875
Miss Mary, you are so--

257
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,958
You're so--Ugh, I don't
even know how to say it!

258
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,458
Just leave me alone, okay?

259
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,791
Do whatever you want!

260
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,708
Thanks, but I
already intended to.

261
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,250
[RANTA laughs]
Of course you did!

262
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,333
[laughing]

263
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,625
I'm totally lost, here.

264
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,958
Damn this chick!

265
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,250
[MARY]
Can you clean up your speech?

266
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,291
It's rather crude.

267
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,625
It defiles my ears.

268
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,791
[RANTA]
Oh, no!

269
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,416
I'm terribly sorry
to have injured you so!

270
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,708
Perhaps you should consider
plugging your ears.

271
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,000
Then my speech might
be less offensive to you.

272
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,958
[MARY] I don't believe
I'll do anything of the sort.

273
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,583
It sounds annoying.

274
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,000
[MOGUZO groans]

275
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,666
It can't just be us.

276
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,083
What about you, Moguzo?

277
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,833
Doesn't she make
you angry at all?

278
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,333
She's not really the
nicest person, I guess.

279
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,208
[HARUHIRO]
The girls are mad at us.

280
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,291
They're probably
wondering what in the world

281
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,166
we were thinking when
we invited a new Priest

282
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,125
to the group so soon
after Manato died.

283
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,958
Especially when it's someone
with her sparkling personality.

284
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,250
[RANTA]
Don't just sit there!

285
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,541
What can I say, you know?

286
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,583
I totally agree.

287
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,000
[RANTA]
Good for you.

288
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,041
Glad you see it
my way, Haruhiro.

289
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,250
[HARUHIRO] We didn't even
ask Yume or Shihoru first.

290
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,375
I'm sure Manato wouldn't have
made an important decision

291
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,916
like this without
at least consulting

292
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,750
the rest of the party.

293
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,041
[RANTA yells]

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,208
Mary! Over here!

295
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,250
Ranta needs healing!

296
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,166
[MARY]
No.

297
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,666
What? Why not?

298
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,875
It doesn't need to be
healed immediately.

299
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,666
He can deal with it for now.

300
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,833
Easy for you to say!

301
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,208
[groaning]

302
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,541
You guys aren't
very good at this.

303
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,833
[HARUHIRO] If it were
Manato in charge and not me,

304
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,458
we would have beaten
those goblins easily.

305
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,333
He was so much to us.

306
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,708
A strong defender,
a good healer,

307
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:32,208
a smart strategist,
and a great leader.

308
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:36,208
Well, what are we supposed
to do now, Manato?

309
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,458
We need you!

310
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,291
[HARUHIRO]
Volunteer Soldiers, huh?

311
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,166
[RANTA]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

312
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,500
You can stop there.

313
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,791
I already know what you're
going to say, Haruhiro.

314
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,875
Our goal for now
is to earn enough money

315
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,375
that we can buy official badges

316
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,583
and become full-fledged
Volunteer Soldiers.

317
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,166
Except that somehow
it feels like that

318
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,166
doesn't really matter anymore.

319
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,625
That's what you're
thinking, right?

320
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,250
It's weird--
you being able to see

321
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,250
what's going on inside
my head like that.

322
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,916
I don't really know
if I like it.

323
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,708
[RANTA] That's not a
very nice thing to say.

324
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,208
I should punch you in the face.

325
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,916
You're right.
I'm very sorry.

326
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,458
[RANTA]
Don't apologize so quickly.

327
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,583
You take the fun out of it.

328
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,666
[HARUHIRO]
Man, this guy's impossible.

329
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,291
[MOGUZO]
But, you know...

330
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,958
It does feel like we've
lost sight of our goal.

331
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,666
Doesn't it?

332
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,708
[RANTA] It's crazy how
much things have changed

333
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,916
just because he's
not here anymore.

334
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,166
Don't make it sound
so insignificant.

335
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,000
[RANTA]
You're right.

336
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,333
Sorry.

337
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,041
You don't have to apologize
so quickly, though.

338
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,583
It kinda freaks me out
when you do that.

339
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,000
This guy's impossible.

340
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,083
[HARUHIRO sighs]

341
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,166
Lost sight of our goal, huh?

342
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,791
[TAVERN MAN 5A]
Renji!

343
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,708
[TAVERN MAN 5B]
Whoa! Look at him!

344
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,791
[TAVERN MAN 5C]
He's doin' well.

345
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:51,916
[HARUHIRO]
Renji?

346
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,125
Ha! He's flashy, huh?

347
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,375
Look at that outfit.

348
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,208
[MOGUZO]
Wow.

349
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,125
[RANTA] And he started as a
soldier about the same time

350
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,000
as us.

351
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,291
Oh, hey...

352
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,125
Hey, that looks like...

353
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,291
It's gold!

354
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,208
I heard the news
about Manato.

355
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,791
This is a gift.

356
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:33,875
For your loss.

357
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:34,625
Wait.

358
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,625
Hold on a sec, Renji.

359
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,666
What is it?

360
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,583
Thanks, but we
can't accept this.

361
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,416
[RENJI]
I see.

362
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,666
[MOGUZO sighs]

363
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,166
[RANTA] Stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid!

364
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,875
A gold is worth a hundred
silvers, you moron!

365
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,916
We could buy our official
badges with that!

366
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,041
But, Ranta,
I don't think Manato

367
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,666
would have wanted us
to buy our badges

368
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,958
with money we hadn't
earned ourselves.

369
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,708
[RANTA whining]

370
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,083
We're not working
well as a group.

371
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,166
It isn't just Mary.

372
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,000
We've barely been speaking
to Yume or Shihoru either.

373
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,000
It was different
than this before.

374
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,375
So we all need to
be one, big happy family.

375
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,250
Sounds great!

376
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,333
How do we pull that off?

377
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,250
I don't know, but...

378
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,458
...if Manato were here,
he'd at least try.

379
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,916
[HARUHIRO]
Yume.

380
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,500
Is that you, Haru?

381
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,875
Can we talk?

382
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,166
Are you mad?

383
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,666
[YUME]
I'm not mad.

384
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,833
[HARUHIRO]
Are you sure?

385
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,166
Why do you ask?

386
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,166
Have you done something
to make me angry with you?

387
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,708
Um, yeah, I think.

388
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,875
What did you do?

389
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,750
Well, I invited a new
member into our party

390
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,500
without asking you or Shihoru.

391
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,916
I was worried that
we couldn't go on

392
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,958
without having a Priest
in our party.

393
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,083
But I think I
kinda rushed things.

394
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,583
[YUME]
That's not it.

395
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,750
That's not it at all.

396
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,333
--[HARUHIRO] Yume?
--[YUME] That's not it!

397
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,583
[HARUHIRO]
What?

398
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,875
[YUME] 
That's not it at all!

399
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,083
--Haru, you idiot!
--Hey, wait!

400
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,875
Yume, slow down.
What's wrong?

401
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,500
What's wrong is you
don't understand anything!

402
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,916
That's why Shihoru
and I are so upset!

403
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,375
Because you just don't get it!

404
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,375
[HARUHIRO]
Yeah, you're right.

405
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,458
I don't get it.

406
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,416
How can I if you
won't talk to me?

407
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
It's not that easy.

408
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,291
I'm no good with words.
You know that.

409
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,958
And Shihoru barely talks at all!

410
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:46,791
Yeah?

411
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,541
Well, what about me?!

412
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,541
I mean, come on!

413
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,333
I'm not exactly the
world's best speaker.

414
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,958
And besides, I've been in shock.

415
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,333
We have all been
in shock over this!

416
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,875
So I guess it's
everybody's fault, then!

417
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,291
Because we're all
in this together, right?

418
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,458
At least, we're supposed to be.

419
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,625
Don't you see? A real
party doesn't fall apart

420
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,416
when one person's gone.
[crying]

421
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,208
They support each other
because they're all friends.

422
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,541
That's what I thought about us.

423
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,500
That we were all friends.

424
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,166
Or was I just
being stupid, Haru?

425
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,041
[crying]

426
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,333
[YUME] Have I been
wrong this whole time?

427
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,000
[HARUHIRO]
No, she wasn't.

428
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,583
Yume wasn't wrong at all.

429
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,708
I was the one who was wrong.

430
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,666
[HARUHIRO] It's true that
Manato was our leader

431
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,708
and that we depended
on him for a lot,

432
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:48,416
but he didn't do
everything by himself.

433
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,958
The six of us
together did things

434
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,291
that Manato could
never have done alone.

435
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:58,458
Somewhere along the line,
we became a real party.

436
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,666
I was thinking what a
good party we've become.

437
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,125
You have to--

438
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,291
Haruhiro...

439
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,500
I'm sorry.

440
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,875
Manato...

441
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,416
[YUME crying]

442
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:29,416
Manato!

[BOTH crying]

[YUME]
Haru?

445
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,708
[HARUHIRO]
Yume, he's gone.

446
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,208
[YUME]
I know.

447
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,083
I know, Haru.

448
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,708
[HARUHIRO sobbing]

449
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,541
[HARUHIRO]
Manato's gone!

450
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,083
I know.

451
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,958
I know.

452
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:59,333
[HARUHIRO sobbing]

453
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,291
[HARUHIRO] I really am
sorry, you know.

454
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,416
Ranta, Moguzo, and I

455
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,333
shouldn't have shut you
and Shihoru out like that.

456
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,083
You deserved better.

457
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,916
It must have been lonely.

458
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,000
I was really sad.

459
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,916
And I'm sure that
Shihoru was, too.

460
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,291
But it's getting better.

461
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,541
I feel warm now.

462
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,083
And not lonely at all.

463
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,833
[YUME]
Hey, Haru?

464
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,708
Can we stay like
this a little longer?

465
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,625
It just feels so nice
to be held tightly.

466
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,958
Like everything's gonna be okay.

467
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,291
[YUME]
And, as far as Mary goes...

468
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,125
I'll try to get along with her.

469
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,791
Thank you for that.

470
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,333
I'll try too.

471
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,583
[HARUHIRO]
Hm?

472
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,708
[SHIHORU gasps]

473
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,125
Oh. Hey, Shihoru.

474
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,583
What's wrong with you?

475
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,791
[HARUHIRO] She might have
misinterpreted the situation.

476
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,166
Yeah.

477
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,916
It would be pretty impossible
not to misinterpret.

I'm sorry! Really,
really, really sorry!
