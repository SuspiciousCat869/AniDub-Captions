00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,375
[MICHIKI]
There you are.

2
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,291
Taking a little catnap?

3
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,500
I guess I dozed off.

4
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:52,166
I'm sorry. I didn't
realize I was so tired.

5
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,250
Aww, our princess is weary.

6
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,166
Maybe she needs a nap.
What do you think?

7
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,500
Ow!

8
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,875
[MUTSUMI] Sometimes I don't know
why we put up with you, Og.

9
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:09,458
Don't talk to me like that.
I won't take it as well as Mary.

10
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,333
You're gonna need this.

11
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,791
Are we going to the
Cyrene Mine again?

12
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,458
[MICHIKI]
Yeah. No time to rest.

13
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,958
There are other parties working
their way through it, too.

14
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,500
I don't wanna fall behind.

15
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,458
Oh come on, Michiki.

16
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,666
You're so predictable.

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,708
Everything's always
a competition to you.

18
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,000
Got a problem with that?

19
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,791
Uh-uh. No, of course not.

20
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,833
You are our leader, after all.

21
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,833
Well then, all you have
to do is follow me.

22
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,166
Yes, oh wise one. Lead on.

23
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,041
There's no denying he can be
a little pushy and cocky,

24
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,458
but to be honest,
I still like him.

25
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,541
And whether you
wanna admit it or not,

26
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,666
I have a feeling you agree
with me about that.

27
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,750
He can be tiring,
but I guess he's okay.

28
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,291
[HAYASHI] So you admit it,
then. You are tired.

29
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,000
[MARY]
That's not what I meant!

30
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,083
[BOTH laughing]

31
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,833
Hey!

32
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:06,291
We're just making sure
you take care of yourself.

33
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,916
I'm really okay,
but thank you.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,208
[HARUHIRO]
Mary.

35
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,041
Is something wrong?

36
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,291
[HARUHIRO]
Mary!

37
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,500
Mary, wake up!

38
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,166
My mind was elsewhere.
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,208
You okay now?

40
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,166
[KOBALD A growling]

41
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,375
[gasps]

42
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,541
Let's go.

43
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,791
[HARUHIRO] The first thing we
noticed about the fifth level

44
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,583
was the temperature.

45
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,958
It was hot.

46
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,583
That was a big change
from the fourth level

47
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,541
where it was pleasantly cool.

48
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,791
Suddenly, we were sweltering.

49
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,500
The fifth level was
used to smelt metal.

50
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,583
It was basically a forge.

51
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,333
We don't need to stay
on this level for long.

52
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,833
I'll lead us to another well.

53
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,541
Then we can head
back up to the fourth.

54
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,000
That's a good plan.
But are you okay?

55
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:04,916
Yeah.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,375
[SHIHORU]
You look so pale.

57
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm all right.

58
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,416
[HARUHIRO]
Was she really, though?

59
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,041
No one could blame
her for being upset.

60
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,250
This was where her friends died.

61
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,791
[MARY]
It's no good.

62
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,416
We can't get down from
here without being seen.

63
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,625
This way.

64
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,791
[MOGUZO]
Maybe we should take a break.

65
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:26,125
We can rest for a little, but
we need to go somewhere else.

66
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,875
We don't want to linger
near the wells for long.

67
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,791
It's too dangerous.

68
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,708
There's a place near here
that my old party used

69
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,208
as a resting spot before.

70
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,666
It should work.

71
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:44,875
[HARUHIRO]
Careful.

72
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,291
[RANTA] Thanks...
We'd be lost without you.

73
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,666
[HARUHIRO] Is this it?
The spot you were talking about?

74
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,750
[MARY] Yes. It used to be
a temple of Lumiaris.

75
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,041
Kobolds don't worship Lumiaris,
so they aren't here often.

76
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,166
That's why we chose it before.

77
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,625
[MARY]
It's still here.

78
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,541
This was my staff.
I left it behind.

79
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,166
Do you guys hear that?

80
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,583
Some kind of rattling noise...

81
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,333
[ALL yelp]

82
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,875
Hey! Keep your
hands to yourself!

83
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,208
[RANTA] That's totally unfair!
You're the one who grabbed me!

84
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,916
Are those people?

85
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,208
[HARUHIRO] It's the curse
of the No Life King.

86
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,541
Those are corpses that
have been reanimated.

87
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,083
Dead bodies given false life.

88
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,083
[MARY]
Michiki... Og... Mutsumi.

89
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,958
I've missed you.
Do you recognize me?

90
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,416
[MARY] It took a while...
but I came back.

91
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,500
I didn't forget you!

92
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,708
Ready, everyone!

93
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,958
[HARUHIRO]
Ugh! Damn!

94
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,291
[MARY]
Hiro.

95
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,416
Cover me, okay?
I'm going to the front.

96
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,541
The front? Are you
sure you want to?

97
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,166
[HARUHIRO]
Before coming back here,

98
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,791
Mary learned the Light
Magic called Dispel.

99
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,333
It breaks the
undead king's curse

100
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,875
using Lumiaris'
divine protection.

101
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,541
I'm not sure,

102
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,458
but I think she learned it
knowing this day would come.

103
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,250
The spell has a short range.

104
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,458
She has to get very close
in order to use it.

105
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,166
We can't stop her
from doing this.

106
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,250
There would be no use in trying.

107
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,750
[MOGUZO]
What's our plan?

108
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,458
Moguzo, take the warrior.

109
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,833
Ranta, you get the thief.

110
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,958
[RANTA]
Hmph.

111
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,791
[HARUHIRO]
Shihoru's our backup.

112
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,125
Yume, come with me.

113
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:11,916
[yelling]

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,958
[HARUHIRO] The undead.
Such a terrible curse.

115
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,333
They look like people you
knew once, but they're not.

116
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,625
Those bodies can move,
but they can't remember.

117
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,416
They're just empty shells
wandering around

118
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,291
until someone stops them.

119
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,875
[HARUHIRO] So it's up
to us to give them peace.

120
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:30,791
[HARUHIRO]
More flames!

00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,791
[YUME]
I can't see them!

122
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,333
It's a firewall.

123
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,458
Ohm, Rel, Ect, Nemun, Dash!

124
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,541
Nicely done, Shihoru!

125
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,000
[HARUHIRO]
That was Swat.

126
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,458
Og was a thief, too,

127
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,208
so I recognize his
fighting techniques.

128
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,583
He would have a tough time

129
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,916
if he was up against Moguzo
and his heavy slashes,

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,625
but Ranta's a different story.

131
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,500
Even I could hold Ranta off
by fighting defensively.

132
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,833
I'm not sure that
Ranta can win this.

133
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,125
Are you okay?

134
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,500
[HARUHIRO] Shihoru casts these,
too. They're Magic Missiles.

135
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,916
I didn't know they could be
used like this, though.

136
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,333
I've never seen
that skill before.

137
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,791
It's like he's doing acrobatics.

138
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,958
Ohm, Rel, Ect. Wel, Dash!

139
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,875
Why isn't it working?

140
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,500
[RANTA] Hey! I could use
some more magic over here!

141
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,958
[HARUHIRO]
It looks like Moguzo and Ranta

142
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,208
are in over their heads.

143
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,916
I need to help them.

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,416
But what should I do?

145
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,333
Mary! Damn it!

146
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:52,208
O light... return to
Lumiaris' divine protection.

[MARY]
Goodbye... I'm so sorry.

Haru!

151
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,458
Quick, give Moguzo a hand.
I'll go and back up Ranta.

152
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,791
Right.

153
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,291
Agh! This guy doesn't know
when to quit, does he?

154
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,166
Hold on, Ranta!

155
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,875
[yells]

156
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,958
[HARUHIRO] Ranta can actually
be perceptive sometimes.

157
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,750
It's easy to forget that.

158
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,208
[yells]

159
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,333
[HARUHIRO]
That was close.

160
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,250
He's changed the angles of
his attacks. This guy is strong.

161
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,083
I'd lose against him
one-on-one for sure.

162
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,166
But...

163
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,750
[MARY] O light, return to
Lumiaris' divine protection.

164
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,625
Dispel.

165
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,875
Og... Please forgive me...
You can rest now.

166
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,208
I'm surprised you knew
what I was going to do.

167
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,916
I mean, it's not like we
planned it out or anything.

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,291
You really are an
idiot, you know.

169
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,625
What?

170
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,666
[RANTA] Things don't always
have to be planned.

171
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,458
Sometimes it's just
common sense.

172
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,583
And since when are you
an expert on common sense?

173
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,000
Unlike you, I don't over
complicate things all the time.

174
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,333
You think about
everything too much

175
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,666
and make life harder
than it needs to be.

176
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,375
Don't you get it?
You're not Manato, man.

177
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,416
Moguzo!

178
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,166
[SHIHORU]
Haruhiro!

179
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,750
[HARUHIRO]
Right, I need to focus.

180
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,583
[HARUHIRO] Aim carefully!
Try not to hit Ranta.

181
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:39,916
You're mine now,
bastard! Exhaust!

182
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,916
[yelling]

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,708
O light... return to
Lumiaris' protection!

184
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,250
Now Dispel.

185
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,666
[MARY]
Goodbye, Michiki. I'll miss you.

186
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,458
[HARUHIRO]
Ashes.

187
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:29,958
That's all there is left of
Michiki... of Og... of Mutsumi.

188
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,291
All that remains of their
bodies and their equipment.

189
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,833
Just ashes.

190
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,708
A strong breeze would
blow them away.

191
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,708
They were real people once.

192
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,583
People with feelings and
thoughts and lives of their own.

193
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,791
There were things
that made them happy,

194
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,833
things that made them sad.

195
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,666
Memories they wanted
to cherish forever,

196
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,291
and others they wished
they could forget.

197
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,458
But now they've died
and become ash...

198
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,375
Just like Manato did.

199
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,208
[HARUHIRO]
Just like we all will someday.

200
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,250
[MARY]
I finally did it.

201
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,208
I faced them and
laid them to rest.

202
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:20,250
They waited a long time,
but my friends are at peace.

203
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,041
Thank you all .

204
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,500
They were really strong.

205
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,791
Especially Michiki.
He was a good warrior.

206
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,791
I hope I can get that strong.
I'll have to work hard at it.

207
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,125
I understand.

208
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,791
I want to try to become
a better fighter, too,

209
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,791
to learn new spells and
improve the ones I know.

210
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,000
Or try to.

211
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,500
You guys know
what I wanna do?

212
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,500
I wanna come up with a
technique for finishing off

213
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,958
the enemy that's totally
original--100% mine.

214
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,958
[HARUHIRO] Oh, good.
That sounds incredibly useful.

215
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,250
I want a wolfdog.

216
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,041
They're so cute and fluffy
and sweet, you know?

217
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,583
I can get a puppy
for a gold coin

218
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,958
and that's not too much, really.

219
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,208
And then I would
have a guard dog.

220
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,458
Of course, I'd have
to wait awhile

221
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,208
for it to get big and strong.

222
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,333
What would you do with it

223
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,000
while you're waiting
for it to grow up?

224
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,875
Carry it around in my pocket.
That would be so adorable.

225
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,208
You have to keep
them super close

226
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,458
if you want them
to bond with you.

227
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,958
[HARUHIRO] Um. Would it
really fit in a pocket?

228
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,750
[YUME]
That's a good question.

229
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,625
Guess I might have to come up
with a different plan, huh?

230
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,875
[HARUHIRO] What about me?
What should I work on?

231
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,291
I like the idea of getting
stronger and faster,

232
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,541
but really I'd be happy
just to be a better leader.

233
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,333
I want to do what's
best for the party.

234
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,208
That's what matters most to me.

235
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,083
Today really took it out of me.

236
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,541
Mmm. Yeah, I'm
really tired too.

237
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,458
I can't wait until we get home
so I can take a nice, long bath.

238
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,500
[grunts]

239
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,791
[BOTH gasp]

240
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,125
[RANTA]
Hey, what's with those faces?

241
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,916
I'm just standing here.
I didn't say anything!

242
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,083
What's that?

243
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,000
--Death Spots! He found us!
--He's here!

244
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:31,750
[MOGUZO]
Oh, no!

245
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,083
Not again!

246
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:34,958
Run, everybody!

247
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,625
Look out he's coming!

248
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,958
[HARUHIRO]
Run!

249
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,666
[howling]

250
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,791
Moguzo, we need your War Cry!

251
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,833
[yelling]

252
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,666
[HARUHIRO]
Moguzo!

253
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,708
I can't do it again yet!

254
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,125
Shihoru!

255
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,666
Ranta... get them!

256
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,500
I'm way ahead of you!

257
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:42,458
[MARY] See that? Over to
the left. It's a shortcut!

258
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,250
[SHIHORU]
Oh. Thanks.

259
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,750
[HARUHIRO]
Hey!

260
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,416
Here! C'mon!

261
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,583
It's no use.
They just keep coming!

262
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,583
Don't worry about them.
Go join the others!

263
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,666
'Kay.

264
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,041
[HARUHIRO]
This guy's terrifying.

265
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,791
We have to get away from him.

266
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,375
No, Haru!

267
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,750
[screaming]

268
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,750
Hiro!

269
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,666
Go! Get outta here!

270
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:01,083
What're you doing?
Start climbing already!

271
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,083
Well come on, hurry up!
You can't die on us, too.

272
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,208
Come on, idiot. I can't
hold you all day, you know!

273
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,958
Look out, Ranta!

274
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,208
[screaming]

275
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,833
Ranta!

276
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,041
[HARUHIRO]
Ranta!

277
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,541
Get out of here! I mean it! Go!

278
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,958
I can't leave you here!

279
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,166
Go! We need you alive!
You're our leader, aren't you?

280
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,958
Ranta, you idiot!
You better not die!

281
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,291
[RANTA] You're the idiot.
Of course I won't die!

282
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,791
[HARUHIRO] Damn it. What's
he doing acting all noble?

283
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,750
This is Ranta we're
talking about. Damn it!

284
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,916
Hurry, Ranta!

285
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,333
[HARUHIRO]
There's no point in yelling.

286
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,666
Ranta's not coming up
through that well.

287
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,208
He's gonna stay below and fight.

288
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,083
The scaffolding
gave out. He fell.

289
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,625
Wait, so what're you saying?

290
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,208
[HARUHIRO] They're all
looking to me for answers

291
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,041
because I'm the leader.

292
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,875
I may not be any good at it,
but I am the leader.

293
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,500
[HARUHIRO] We could go back
now and try to save him.

294
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,625
If we did, I'd say there's a
good chance we would all die.

295
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,083
Ranta knows that.

296
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,958
He made his choice.
He's a good fighter, and lucky.

297
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,833
The last I saw, he was unharmed.

298
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,833
So let's all stay calm
and make a plan.

299
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,208
Mary.

300
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,458
Will you lead us
to a different well

301
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,708
that goes down to
the fifth level?

302
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,125
[MARY]
I can do that.

303
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,750
Why don't we go up to
the third level first?

304
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,125
We can catch our breath
and regroup,

305
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,875
then head down again from there.

306
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:04,041
Sounds good. Everyone agree?

307
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,875
Yeah, let's go!

308
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,833
Hey! Listen up, Death Spots!

309
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,708
I'm gonna tear you apart!

310
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:23,750
I'm gonna make you wish
you were never born!

311
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,000
Not bad. I totally sounded
like a Dark Knight.

312
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,000
I almost scared myself.

313
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,500
Arrows?!

314
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,916
You too afraid to
fight me one-on-one?

315
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,375
Come on, let's settle
this like gentlemen?

316
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,333
[HARUHIRO]
Damn you, Ranta.

317
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,958
You'd better not die!

318
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:43,333
The last thing I want is your
corpse rising up to haunt me.

[HARUHIRO]
Are the kobolds our enemies?

321
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,916
No. I think the real enemy
is our own weakness.

322
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,958
Come and get me!
