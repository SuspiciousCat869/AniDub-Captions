[MARY]
I'm sorry!

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,583
I can't do anything! I'm sorry!

4
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,833
[HAYASHI]
Heal Michiki.

5
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,541
Mary, please. Hurry!

6
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,875
I can't do it.

7
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,083
I'm sorry, Hayashi! I can't!

8
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,958
I don't have any more magic!

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,708
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry!

[HAYASHI]
Michiki!

14
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,750
[MICHIKI] You two go!
Get out of here!

15
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,750
No! I can't just abandon you!

16
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,458
--[MICHIKI] Hayashi, please.
--[MARY] We can't leave them!

17
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,083
[MARY]
Let's all go together!

18
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,541
[MICHIKI] I said
get out of here! Go on!

19
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,791
Stop it! Let go of me! No!

20
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,416
Michiki!

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,041
[MARY crying]

22
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,625
[MARY]
No!

23
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,666
You're mine now!

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,541
[MARY screaming]

25
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,291
[HAYASHI] I don't know how
we made it out of the mine

26
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,958
and back above ground.

27
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,500
It's all a blank.

28
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,250
Maybe my body remembered
the way on its own.

29
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,916
After that,
Shinohara took us in,

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,041
and we joined up with Orion.

31
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,875
But it wasn't long
before Mary left.

32
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:41,041
It was too painful
for her to be around me.

33
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,041
She never said anything,

34
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,000
but I could see it in her eyes.

35
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,041
Looking at me,
she saw that awful day

36
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,291
and a past that was lost to her.

37
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,750
She had to get away.

38
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,625
It was just too much to bear.

39
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,916
So...

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,791
After leaving Orion,
Mary kept moving around,

41
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,916
jumping from party to party.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,041
She never stayed with
any of them for very long.

43
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,375
She's changed.

44
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,791
From what other
people say about her,

45
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,875
she's nothing like the
person she used to be.

46
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,416
I was pretty sure
I had brought Mary

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,416
out of the Cyrene Mine
with me back then,

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,250
but now I wonder
if that's really true.

49
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,375
These days she mostly
just seems hollow.

50
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,208
like an empty shell.

51
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,291
Maybe the real Mary
is still down there,

52
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,166
trapped underground somewhere.

53
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,166
If you can find
a way to help her,

54
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,125
you'll have my thanks.

55
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,833
[HARUHIRO]
Oh, well, I dunno--

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,791
I understand losing a comrade.

57
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,916
I've been there before myself.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,833
Please don't run away from it.

59
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,041
I promise.

60
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,250
That pain is something
worth holding on to.

61
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,208
Move forward, but
remember that pain

62
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,000
and treasure the
companions you have now.

63
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,458
Because once they're gone,
they're gone for good.

64
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,958
The cruelty of death
is its finality.

65
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,375
It doesn't offer second chances.

66
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,875
Seems obvious, I know.

67
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,041
Most don't realize it

68
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,500
until it's too late
to make a difference.

69
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,250
[RANTA]
Ugh.

70
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,291
What a complete
waste of our time.

71
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,416
[HARUHIRO]
How can you say that?

72
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,791
We learned a lot.

73
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,916
[RANTA] So now we know
all about Miss Mary's past.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,125
So what?

75
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,125
I don't see what any
of it has to do with us.

76
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,291
[HARUHIRO] It's not like it
hurts to learn more about her.

77
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,958
[RANTA] And now that
we know all that, what?

78
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,041
We have to be nice to her

79
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,750
because she had it
rough in the past?

80
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,375
You've gotta be kidding me.

81
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,875
I didn't say that.
Calm down, okay?

82
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,625
You didn't have to say it.
It's what you meant.

83
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,250
But tell me this: how is
she any different from us?

84
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,458
Are you saying we haven't
had it rough so far?

85
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,916
I don't see us getting
special treatment.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,166
No, I guess not.

87
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,708
So why are we supposed
to bend over backwards

88
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,416
to be nice to someone
who has no interest

89
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,750
in being nice to us?
That's just dumb.

90
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,125
Hey, what is it?

91
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,541
Losing Manato was hard.

92
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,041
On all of us.

93
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,000
His death still hurts.

94
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:40,500
And it will, for a long time.

95
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,625
But...

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,833
I think we can
make it better

97
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,541
by doing what he
would want us to do.

98
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:52,375
[sniffs]
He'd want us to try.

99
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,916
If we keep trying with Mary,

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,833
then maybe she'll
keep trying too.

101
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,708
When you get
right down to it,

102
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,583
Mary's the same as us.

103
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,708
That's what you said,
isn't it, Ranta?

104
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,125
Why? What does it matter?

105
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,333
By that logic, things
will never be any different

106
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,250
than the way they are now.

107
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,000
If we don't make an effort
to get to know her,

108
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,375
she won't make an effort
to get to know us.

109
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,666
If we aren't friendly to her,

110
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,625
she won't be friendly
to us, either.

111
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,833
Is that what you want?

112
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,041
For us just to
continue on like this?

113
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,500
[RANTA] You know Haruhiro,
for all your talk,

114
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't see you making
an effort to get to know me.

115
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,250
[HARUHIRO]
Wh--?

116
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,083
[RANTA]
Admit it.

117
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,625
You guys never listen to me.

118
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,958
You ignore my opinions like
they don't mean anything to you.

119
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,500
[YUME]
Well sometimes, Ranta,

120
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,916
the stuff you say just
seems kind of unnecessary.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What do you mean by that?

122
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,291
[YUME]
Now that I think about it,

123
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,250
all the stuff you say
is unnecessary.

124
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,708
[RANTA]
Hey, that's just harsh!

125
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,166
Okay, well, you're
harsh all the time,

126
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,166
like when you talk
about my chest.

127
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,416
There's no reason to say
hurtful stuff like that.

128
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,291
I see!

129
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,166
[RANTA]
You see what?

130
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,916
[HARUHIRO]
That's how Ranta feels?

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,708
For how long, I wonder?

132
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,583
And I had no idea.

133
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,708
I guess Mary's not the only one
here I don't know very well.

134
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,500
I guess I've got a lot
of things to work on.

135
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,916
Sorry about that, Ranta.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,458
I'll work on it.

137
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,875
I'll start listening
to you more.

138
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:15,833
[RANTA]
Y-You will?

139
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,291
Yeah. You're my friend.

140
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,833
You deserve better from me.

141
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,375
[RANTA]
Your friend?

142
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,333
Well, then... Start
acting like it, you idiot!

143
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,333
You see? That was unnecessary.

144
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,416
Well, I don't see what's wrong

145
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,541
with calling an idiot
"idiot." Idiot!

146
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,458
[HARUHIRO]
Ranta?

147
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,666
[RANTA]
Leave me alone.

148
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,208
I need some time to think.

149
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:33,958
[HARUHIRO]
You?

150
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,041
Thinking something over?

151
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,333
[RANTA]
Why you--!

152
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,000
Ugh. Anyway, I
need to think about

153
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,500
how to face Mary
when we see her tomorrow.

154
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,583
And, uh, just so
you know, Shihoru...

155
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,166
I'm sorry about before.

156
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,166
I didn't mean to make you
talk about Manato.

157
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,041
I know it's hard on you.

158
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,541
He apologized?

159
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,541
Maybe it'll rain tomorrow.

160
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,833
Hah! You say useless stuff, too!

161
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,166
Yeah, you're right.

162
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,916
It's supposed to be
"snow," isn't it?

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,041
[MOGUZO] "Maybe it'll snow."
I think that's how it goes.

164
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,416
[RANTA]
Not the point!

165
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,291
[HARUHIRO]
Ranta's right about one thing.

166
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,750
I'm not sure how any of us
are going to face Mary tomorrow.

167
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,916
It won't be easy.

168
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,666
[rain pouring]

169
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,625
[HARUHIRO]
What do you know?

170
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,000
It really is raining.

171
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,458
[YUME]
What did you say, Haru?

172
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,916
[HARUHIRO] Oh, I just said
that it's actually raining.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,375
[YUME]
Not snowing, though.

174
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,541
Look at that.

175
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,291
You see his dagger?

176
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,083
[HARUHIRO] Yeah. I dropped it
the day Manato died.

177
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,083
[GOBLIN growls]

178
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,041
Sorry about that.

179
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,791
It was dumb.
I don't know what got into me.

180
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,458
I'm okay now, really.

181
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,125
We should follow him.

182
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,041
He might lead us
to their hideout.

183
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:28,458
We didn't see
any good targets.

184
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,666
Okay, then.

185
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,208
Let's get out of here.

186
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,583
Go someplace dry.

187
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,166
Before we go, Mary...

188
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,583
I'd like to talk to you.

189
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,666
You want to talk now?

190
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,125
All right,
let's make this quick.

191
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,000
There's no need to drag it out.

192
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,750
If you want me to leave
the party, go ahead and say it.

193
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,833
[HARUHIRO gasps]

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,958
I'm sorry.
That's not it at all.

195
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,375
[HARUHIRO]
Now that I think about it,

196
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,291
we have been acting
strange today.

197
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,458
After hearing her story,

198
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,416
we don't know how
to treat her anymore.

199
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,416
We see her in a different
light than before,

200
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,125
but we aren't sure how
to deal with that change.

201
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,083
Mary could tell
something was off.

202
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,708
How could she not?

203
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,750
She's probably
been preparing herself.

204
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,791
Getting ready to move on. Again.

205
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,416
If you'll listen,

206
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,541
there's something I've been
wanting to tell you about.

207
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,416
You know, we used to have a
Priest in our party before you.

208
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,791
Well, his name was Manato.

209
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,125
[HARUHIRO] You know, we used
to have a Priest in our party

210
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,458
before you.

211
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,291
Well, his name was Manato.

212
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,041
A little while ago,
Manato died.

213
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,375
Although it feels
closer to the truth

214
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,333
to say that we let him die.

215
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,250
He would heal us even
when we didn't need it.

216
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,541
He used his magic to
take care of every scratch.

217
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,208
On top of that,
he served with Moguzo

218
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,291
on the front lines
during battle.

219
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,458
And he was our party leader.

220
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,125
So basically, he was
doing three different jobs.

221
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,208
I thought he was pretty amazing.

222
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,791
I'm only now starting
to realize how much

223
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,333
we took for granted.

224
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,666
Doing all that work
couldn't have been easy,

225
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,916
but Manato didn't let
the strain of it show.

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,041
I never offered to help.

227
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,708
It didn't occur to me
that he might need it.

228
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,208
And now, of course,
it's too late to offer.

229
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,750
Manato's never coming back.

230
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,041
He's gone for good.

231
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,833
At first, after he died,

232
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,375
it was hard to imagine
how we were going to go on.

233
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,458
But we didn't really
have a choice.

234
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:56,291
If we wanted to stay alive,
we needed to keep working.

235
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,166
So that's why I
asked you to join us.

236
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,708
Because we can't do much of
anything without a Priest.

237
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,666
I don't know if
that's a good reason,

238
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,416
but it's the only one I've got.

239
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,166
The thing is,
we're the leftovers.

240
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,666
The people that
nobody else picked.

241
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,250
But Manato brought us together.

242
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,666
He made us into a party.

243
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,791
And we became friends.

244
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,208
True, we don't always
get along very well.

245
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,416
When you're in a party together,

246
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,791
there are times things
don't go smoothly.

247
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:28,791
You get angry.

248
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,333
You fight with each other.

249
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,375
But you're still friends.

250
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,666
That's something
that doesn't change.

251
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,166
Whatever came before,
whatever comes next,

252
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,166
you support each other,
because that's what friends do.

253
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,791
And I want you to know...

254
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,875
I consider you
a friend too, Mary.

255
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,041
Um, so do I.

256
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,958
You're one of us now. A friend.

257
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,625
Yeah, totally.

258
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,041
And you're also
really cute, by the way.

259
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,166
Um, it's nice
to have you here.

260
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,000
You're a good Priest. Thanks.

261
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,000
I guess you're not that bad.

262
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,416
From now on, if you
decide not to heal me,

263
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,083
I won't make a
big deal about it.

264
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,708
I'll trust your judgment
since we're friends and all.

265
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,166
[HARUHIRO]
Oh, wow. Ranta's playing nice.

266
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,791
It'll start snowing
any second now.

267
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,833
[RANTA] Come up with some
new material already!

268
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,791
[HARUHIRO]
Mary...

269
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,958
Uh, if you're not busy,

270
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,416
we're all going to pick out
a helmet for Moguzo.

271
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,083
You're welcome to come.

272
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,916
I don't think so.

273
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,791
[HARUHIRO]
All right.

274
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,333
Well... You've still got to eat.

275
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,125
Have dinner with us, at least.

276
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,541
Come on. It'll be fun.

277
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,416
I'm sorry. I don't
think I can. Not yet.

278
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,916
What do you mean, not yet?

279
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,458
[MARY]
Thanks for asking.

280
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,833
See you tomorrow.

281
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,083
[HARUHIRO]
See you tomorrow.

282
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,833
Yeah. Tomorrow is a new day.

283
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,708
As long as you're
still alive to see it.

284
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,500
[MOGUZO]
Thanks, everyone. Really.

285
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,833
[YUME]
Sure!

286
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,583
I'm just glad we were able
to find you a cute one.

287
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,125
[SHIHORU] I was kind of
worried we wouldn't be able

288
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,500
to afford it.

289
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,750
[HARUHIRO] Especially since
Ranta didn't pitch in

290
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,791
a single copper.

291
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,041
[RANTA]
The discount I scored us

292
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,000
counted as my
contribution, idiot!

293
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,875
[HARUHIRO]
Moguzo got his helmet.

294
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,708
At first it didn't
seem possible,

295
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,083
but Ranta's haggling
brought the price down.

296
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,708
From forty-two silvers
to eighteen!

297
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,958
[HARUHIRO]
Mary's still with our party.

298
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,041
And slowly, very slowly...

299
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,750
I feel like we're
actually starting to get

300
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,250
a little closer to her.

301
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,166
[HARUHIRO]
And then, there's this place.

302
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,833
We come here once
a day, every day.

303
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,458
[VOLUNTEER SOLDIER 7A]
Hey, goblin slayers!

304
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,875
The fearsome goblin slayers!

305
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:13,916
How's the hunting?

306
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,250
What are you
warriors up to today?

307
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,583
Headin' to Damuro, huh?

308
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,916
They keep this up,
there aren't going to be

309
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,041
any goblins left around here
before much longer.

310
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,250
[SOLDIERS laughing]

311
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,208
They better shut it
or I'm gonna get pissed.

312
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,666
Calm down. Let it go.

313
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,791
It's not like it isn't true.

314
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:25,958
[YUME]
This soup's delicious!

315
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,041
I could eat a whole bucket!

316
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,083
Yeah.

317
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,583
If you want,
I could try making it.

318
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,500
That would be great!

319
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,625
You could do that?

320
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,875
I can probably get close. Sure.

321
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,750
[HARUHIRO]
Day after day after day...

322
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,583
It's goblins, goblins,
goblins, goblins.

323
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,708
Rain or shine, hot or cold.

324
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:50,875
It's goblins, goblins, goblins,
goblins, goblins, goblins.

325
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,625
At first they all
looked the same:

326
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,541
A bunch of interchangeable,
ugly monsters.

327
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:59,333
But recently, I've started
being able to tell them apart.

328
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,416
There are a lot of males
and relatively few females.

329
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,750
According to Mary,

330
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,833
most of the females live
in Damuro's new city area.

331
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,791
They're kept well protected,
surrounded by high-level males.

332
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:15,083
[RANTA] Man, that is one harem
I wouldn't want any part of.

333
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,416
[HARUHIRO] Well, I doubt
the female goblins

334
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,250
would want any
part of you, either.

335
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,875
You know, if people
don't understand my charm,

336
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,416
there's nothing
I can do about it.

337
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,958
It takes somebody with
sophisticated taste.

338
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,416
What do you say, Mary?

339
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,583
Who would you choose?

340
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,416
Between the three of us, I mean.

341
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,750
[MARY]
Hm?

342
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,125
Come on, you
can answer honestly.

343
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,458
There's no need to be shy.

344
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,708
I don't get it. What is
there to be shy about?

345
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,500
[SHIHORU giggles]

346
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,000
That's a good question.

347
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,458
Hey, hey, hey!

348
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,958
[chuckles]

349
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,875
How're you kids
doin' these days?

350
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,250
[HARUHIRO] I really don't think
I've ever seen Mary smile.

351
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,958
I wonder if she remembers how.

352
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,458
[HARUHIRO] We eat plenty,
but nothing fancy.

353
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,916
And we're fine staying in the
Volunteer Soldier housing.

354
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,083
Any extra money we have

355
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,500
should be spent on
equipment, not lodging.

356
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,958
I especially want to
invest in Moguzo's armor.

357
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,458
Obviously, we can't
afford anything

358
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,041
that's custom made
from start to finish.

359
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,791
Instead, we used our money
to buy something used,

360
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,708
and had a blacksmith
fit it to his size.

361
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,125
Even though we were frugal,

362
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:36,291
the pieces all cost
a couple silvers or more.

363
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,958
Then there are skills.

364
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,791
We could all use more of those.

365
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:43,791
I learned Swat and Sneaking
to mute my footsteps.

366
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,791
Sleepy Shadow
uses Shihoru's magic

367
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,125
to put enemies to sleep.

368
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,500
Let's go! Exhaust!

369
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,208
[HARUHIRO] That skill
immediately creates distance

370
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,000
between you and the enemy.

371
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,458
And... Avoid!

372
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,541
[HARUHIRO] Ranta likes
shouting out his skill names.

373
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,625
It's annoying,
but that's Ranta for you.

374
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,875
Moguzo's War Cry
temporarily paralyzes the enemy.

375
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,541
[HARUHIRO]
Yume learned Swift,

376
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,125
which increases her
accuracy with a bow.

377
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,333
And with Mouse Hole,

378
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,541
she can dodge an enemy
attack very quickly.

379
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,583
[HARUHIRO] Mary's always
been levels above us,

380
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,041
so she has less to learn.

381
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,416
We're lucky to have her.

382
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,583
Sometimes I can see
right where I need to hit,

383
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,166
like there's a path lit up
for my dagger to travel.

384
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,958
My blade slides
cleanly along that path,

385
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,791
moving closer to its target.

386
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:34,791
When it touches,

387
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,833
I know I've struck
the right place.

388
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,541
And then suddenly,
it's all over.

389
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,916
[HARUHIRO] I'm not really
sure what's going on.

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,750
I have no idea what
that weird light is.

391
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,000
Teacher Barbara might know.

392
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,083
I'll ask her
next time I see her.

393
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,833
Okay, Haruhiro,
what do you say?

394
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,083
Is it time?

395
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,125
Yes! Finally!

396
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,750
[MANATO]
Trouble sleeping?

397
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,625
Yeah. Excited, I guess.

398
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,125
The anticipation you
feel the night before

399
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,041
a field trip. Like that?

400
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,750
Um, I don't really know.

401
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,125
[MANATO laughs]

402
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,916
[HARUHIRO chuckles]

403
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,416
It's funny...

404
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,583
...but I'm not really
worried or nervous.

405
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,791
The main thing I feel
right now is ready.

406
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,208
Ready. That's good.

407
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,208
[HARUHIRO]
Yeah.

408
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,291
[MANATO chuckles]

409
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,333
[HARUHIRO] We've been in
Grimgar for how many days now?

410
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,875
I'm not sure when,

411
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,041
but at some point I must
have stopped counting.

412
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,333
Well, I know one thing for sure.

413
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,166
Wherever we came from before...

414
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,916
We're all here now.

415
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,291
And we're friends.

416
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,250
Whatever happens,
we'll face it together.

417
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,375
[HARUHIRO]
Manato...

418
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,333
Our party's doing well.

419
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,333
I think you'd be really proud.

420
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,125
All right, then.

421
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,583
See you tomorrow.
