1
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,625
[snoring]

2
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,166
Where's Manato?

3
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,666
Oh, Haruhiro.

4
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,708
[HARUHIRO]
Huh?

5
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,291
I'm surprised
you're still awake.

6
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,250
Hey.

7
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,583
[inhales]

8
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,208
Whoa, have you been drinking?

9
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,708
Uh... Yeah, a little bit.

10
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,208
[HARUHIRO]
Well that's a surprise.

11
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,375
[MANATO] You know the square
on Hanazono Street?

12
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,708
Well, there's an alehouse near
there called Shelly's Tavern.

13
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,250
It's become popular
with Volunteer Soldiers.

14
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,083
I was there
gathering information.

15
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,208
[HARUHIRO]
Oh.

16
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:35,333
[HARUHIRO] You're spending your
own money to help us all out?

17
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:36,791
[HARUHIRO]
Drinks aren't cheap,

18
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,291
especially when you're
as poor as we are.

19
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,416
It's really good
of you to do that.

20
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,000
[MANATO]
You know...

21
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,083
Living like this isn't as
hard as I thought it would be.

22
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,166
I've gotten used to it.

23
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,291
[HARUHIRO]
Yeah.

24
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,250
Thank you.

25
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:01,916
No, thank you.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You do so much.

27
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,291
While we're here sleeping,
you're out working.

28
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,333
[MANATO] I was thinking
we might want to move

29
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,291
to a new camp tomorrow.

30
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,958
I heard of a place with monsters
even we have a shot at beating.

31
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,333
If you say so.

32
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,958
You know, I coulda gone
with you to the tavern.

33
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,416
Why? Do you enjoy drinking?

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,291
Mmm... I don't know.

35
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,208
I'm not sure I've
ever had a drink.

36
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,416
So maybe not.

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,166
[MANATO chuckles]
It's funny...

38
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,583
I don't remember drinking
before, but I liked it.

39
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,458
So maybe my decision
to go to the tavern

40
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,750
wasn't entirely altruistic.

41
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,500
Why don't we see if everyone
wants to go next time?

42
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,333
Sounds like fun.

43
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,333
Sure, once we can afford it.

44
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,416
[MANATO]
How was Thief Guild training?

45
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,458
[HARUHIRO]
Mmm...

46
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,666
I didn't expect it
to be so hard.

47
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,458
And my teacher was pretty scary.

48
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,833
I mean that... She was
both pretty and scary.

49
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,083
[MANATO laughing]

50
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,583
[MANATO]
Really?

51
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,041
Scary or not, I think I still
would've traded with you.

52
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,500
My master was a strict,
bearded man

53
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,416
with the loudest, angriest
voice you ever heard.

54
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,791
[HARUHIRO laughing]

55
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,583
[HARUHIRO] I take it
you got yelled at a lot.

56
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,791
[MANATO]
Yeah. More than a lot.

57
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,291
By the time my
training was over,

58
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,541
I was convinced I existed
for the sole purpose

59
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,791
of being yelled at by him.

60
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,625
My ears are still
ringing from it.

61
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,208
I didn't know embarrassing
stuff like that

62
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,541
happened to you.

63
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,166
Oh, it does.

64
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,500
Of course it does.

65
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,208
[HARUHIRO]
Manato?

66
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,083
Thanks a lot.

67
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,416
[MANATO chuckles]

68
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,208
[HARUHIRO]
The moon...

69
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,125
It's so red.

70
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,208
[MANATO]
Yeah.

71
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,000
[HARUHIRO] I don't know
where this world is.

72
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,750
I don't know how we
got here, why we came,

73
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,625
or if we'll ever leave.

74
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,458
But one thing I do know,

75
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:59,500
wherever we lived before this,
the moon wasn't red.

76
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:03,083
I mean, a red moon?
That's just weird.

77
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,083
[YUME]
Well, what do you see?

78
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,250
[HARUHIRO]
Shh!

79
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,750
[leaves rustling]

80
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,125
Goblin. I saw it.

81
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,083
Just one?

82
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,500
I think so.

83
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,500
What arms?

84
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,625
A sword.

85
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,875
[MANATO]
Okay, let's get him.

86
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,541
[HARUHIRO] We probably
should have decided on

87
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,791
some sort of signal.

88
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,875
[RANTA yells]

89
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,041
[HARUHIRO]
Hold on!

90
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,500
[HARUHIRO]
What an idiot!

91
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,916
It's not a surprise attack
if you go in screaming!

92
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,375
[GOBLIN growls]

93
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,500
Almost got him, Yume!

94
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,958
[RANTA yelling]

95
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,750
[HARUHIRO] Oh good, now he's
fighting an imaginary enemy.

96
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,875
[HARUHIRO yells]

97
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,541
[HARUHIRO yells]

98
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,416
[HARUHIRO]
What a mess!

99
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
How did I end up
as the first attacker?

100
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,750
That's not a Thief's job!

101
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,791
[HARUHIRO]
His reach is longer than mine.

102
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,666
What if I try a
slap to the wrist?

103
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:27,958
[HARUHIRO]
Too shallow!

104
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,583
Haruhiro! Watch your back!

105
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,291
[RANTA]
Hatred!

106
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,583
[RANTA] Ugh!
[coughing]

107
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,666
Gross!

108
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,333
[SHIHORU]
Marque... Em... Parc!

109
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,875
Moguzo, quick!

110
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,000
Stand in the goblin's path!

111
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,083
Right. On it!

112
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:56,916
[MANATO]
Come on, everyone!

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,875
Surround him!

114
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,125
Don't let him get away.

115
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,208
[MOGUZO yells]

116
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,208
[RANTA]
That's it!

117
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,541
Just keep swingin' at him!

118
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,541
Don't let up!

119
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,333
Don't give him a
chance to breathe!

120
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,916
Yeah! I got him!

121
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,541
I stabbed him. Hard.

122
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,125
I think I even hit bone.

123
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,125
That's kind of freaky.

124
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:30,583
[GOBLIN growls]

125
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,083
Listen to that scream.

126
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,000
He's desperate, like us.

127
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,750
And like us,
he'll fight for his life.

128
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,666
[HARUHIRO] That's what
his scream is saying.

129
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,625
"You can try, but I
won't let you kill me."

130
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,791
I don't speak goblin,
but I can tell that much.

131
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,041
Come on, guys!
We all need to keep it together!

132
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,208
It's kill or be killed
in this place!

133
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,875
I'm gonna end this monster.

134
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,250
I want my Vice!

135
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,208
Shut up! You're just
as scared as we are!

136
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,541
Me? No way!

137
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,583
Whoa, he really is tough!

138
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,291
Nothing we're doing
seems to be working!

139
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,333
Marque, Em, Parc!

140
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,875
Wow! I got him!

141
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,500
[HARUHIRO grunts, groans]

142
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,083
[GOBLIN growling]

143
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,333
[RANTA yells]

144
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,583
We did it! Yeah!

145
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,500
[YUME]
Haru!

146
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,500
[RANTA]
We crushed that thing!

147
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,166
Were you watching,
Lord Skullhell?

148
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,333
[HARUHIRO]
Be gentle, please.

149
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,916
[HARUHIRO gasps]

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,750
[MANATO] O light, return to
Lumiaris' divine protection.

151
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,833
Cure.

152
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,291
[RANTA]
Let's see our haul.

153
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,708
What's he got?

154
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,875
Looks like some animal's fang...

155
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,625
...and a silver coin.

156
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,083
All right, then.

157
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,833
According to what
they told me in training,

158
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,291
to accumulate a Vice,

159
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,500
a Dark Knight must kill the
monster with his own hand,

160
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,166
and then offer up a body part
on the guild's altar.

161
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,625
Those ears are kinda big.

162
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,625
Maybe one of his
claws would work?

163
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,291
[HARUHIRO] But didn't
Moguzo deal the death blow?

164
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,625
Agh! He's right!
You did, you jerk!

165
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,333
How could you do that
to me, you bastard?!

166
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,958
[MOGUZO]
Uh, sorry.

167
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:51,541
[GOBLIN growls]

168
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,208
[RANTA yells]

169
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,166
[GOBLIN growling]

170
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,416
[RANTA yells]

171
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,791
That gob really
doesn't want to die.

172
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:12,833
[RANTA yelling]

173
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:44,875
[RANTA sobbing]

174
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:52,958
[HARUHIRO]
Damnit...

175
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:57,458
[RANTA crying]

176
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,416
[MERCHANT]
This?

177
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,833
I'll give you
thirty coppers for it.

178
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,416
[MANATO]
I know it's a little dirty.

179
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,458
It doesn't look like much, but
it's still a piece of silver.

180
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,791
[MERCHANT]
If you don't like my offer,

181
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,083
you're welcome
to take it elsewhere.

182
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,041
You'll get about the same price
from any other merchant.

183
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,250
[MANATO]
Oh. I see.

184
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,750
[MERCHANT] But that's
not all you've got, is it?

185
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,208
What's the other item there?

186
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,500
If it's a black wolf fang,
I'll give you a silver.

187
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,083
[MANATO gasps]
This fang is worth that much?

188
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:29,791
[HARUHIRO]
Really?

189
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,125
[MERCHANT]
Yes.

190
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,291
They're used in charms
against evil and the like.

191
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,458
[MOGUZO sighs]
That's a relief.

192
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,875
[MANATO]
What should we do now?

193
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,541
There's still plenty
of daylight left.

194
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,291
[HARUHIRO] Why don't we
take the afternoon off?

195
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,333
Get some rest.

196
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,500
[YUME]
That sounds good to me.

197
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,666
We've been working hard.

198
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,750
I'm worn out.

199
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,833
[SHIHORU]
Yes, me too.

200
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:53,833
[MOGUZO]
Uh-huh.

201
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,500
[MANATO]
I guess everyone is, huh?

202
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,666
All right, the rest
of the day is yours.

203
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,833
Enjoy it.

204
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,250
I'll see everyone tomorrow.

205
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,375
[MOGUZO]
'Kay.

206
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,625
[YUME]
Sounds good.

207
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,291
[HARUHIRO]
Yeah, until then.

208
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,333
[HARUHIRO]
So how does it feel?

209
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,208
Bagging your first goblin
as a Dark Knight.

210
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,166
[RANTA]
Go away.

211
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,625
Mind your own business.

212
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,791
[HARUHIRO] What happened
to eating everything,

213
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,208
including the bones?

214
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,958
[RANTA] You really are
a nag; you know that?

215
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,166
Always getting on my case
about every little thing.

216
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,041
[HARUHIRO]
Oh, come on.

217
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,458
Not every little thing.

218
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,708
[RANTA]
There, you see what I mean?

219
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,000
You can't let anything go.

220
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,041
[HARUHIRO sighs]

221
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,416
[RANTA]
Oh, well.

222
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
We got our first monster.

223
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:51,291
And I got to accumulate
my first Vice, too.

224
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,000
What's the point of
accumulating Vices, anyway?

225
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,375
[RANTA]
I can summon a demon.

226
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,541
Okay.

227
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,208
And if you summon a demon,
what does it do?

228
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,583
[RANTA]
It whispers to me to let me know

229
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,208
if there's an enemy
anywhere nearby.

230
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,708
And sometimes,
it explodes a Demon Joke.

231
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,166
[HARUHIRO]
Oh. Is that all?

232
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,791
[RANTA]
What do you mean, "is that all?"

233
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,458
I think it sounds exactly
like the kinda partner I need.

234
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,875
[MANATO]
I agree.

235
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,375
That sounds right for Ranta.

236
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,083
[RANTA]
Doesn't it?

237
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,666
[HARUHIRO] I guess I don't
need to know what it does

238
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,750
to know it would be
a good fit for Ranta.

239
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,458
The word "demon" says it all.

240
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:25,833
[YUME]
Meow!

241
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:26,875
[RANTA gasps]

242
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,250
What the--?!

243
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,000
Were you that animal
I was feeding?

244
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,666
You've got a
transformation skill?

245
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,958
No, of course not.
Don't be silly!

246
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,375
I was admiring the sunset
when the poor little dear

247
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,833
plopped right down onto me.

248
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,041
Apologize!

249
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,666
Obviously I knew it wasn't you.

250
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,541
I was just messing
with you guys.

251
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,375
Is that why you shrieked
like a little girl?

252
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,875
Shut up, you!

253
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,791
[MANATO] It really is
beautiful, isn't it?

254
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,916
The sunset.

255
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,625
[MANATO] I pass by this spot
every day, but I never noticed.

256
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,416
I guess I was too busy.

257
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,791
[HARUHIRO]
Manato, you awake?

258
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,916
[MANATO]
Yeah.

259
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,583
Having trouble sleeping.

260
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,916
Why, what's up?

261
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,083
[HARUHIRO] My head was full
of questions and worries.

262
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,666
Things I wanted
to ask Manato about.

263
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,666
Like how we fought
so hard today,

264
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,041
and only made
eighteen coppers each.

265
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,750
and if we'll really
be able to survive here.

266
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,708
But when I started to ask,

267
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,666
I couldn't seem to get
the words out right.

268
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,333
Um...

269
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,791
No. Nothing, never mind.

270
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:04,875
Really?

271
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,166
Are you sure there
wasn't something?

272
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,291
[HARUHIRO]
Yeah.

273
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,333
[HARUHIRO] I guess today
wasn't all that bad,

274
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,583
when you think about it.

275
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,750
And nobody knows what the
future has in store for us.

276
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,833
Something amazing
could happen tomorrow.

277
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,708
So it's okay.

278
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,916
At least for now.

279
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,291
[RANTA grunts]

280
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,541
Don't mind me.
I'll be right back.

281
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,708
[HARUHIRO] I didn't know
you were still awake.

282
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,708
What's the hurry?
Where are you going?

283
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,625
The bath, of course, my friends.

284
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,750
You coming?

285
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,041
[HARUHIRO]
Why would we?

286
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,625
We've already washed up.

287
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,791
And besides, the girls
are in there now.

288
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,375
You really are stupid, huh?

289
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,208
Oh, well. Your loss, Chump.

290
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,750
That's what you're doing?!

291
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,708
Look, I'm glad that
you're feeling better,

292
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,708
but even you have to
have a line, right?

293
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,541
Huh?

294
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,333
I don't know what you mean.

295
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,791
I always feel great!

296
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,708
Just look how magnificent I am!

297
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,208
Just observe the
rosy glow of my skin.

298
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,291
See? That's the power
of my passion!

299
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,250
Nope, I'm pretty sure
you're just horny.

300
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,416
So that's what it was.

301
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,958
I thought you were
studying the bath walls

302
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,541
very carefully earlier.

303
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,916
Listen up, people!

304
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,333
At this very moment,
the girls are completely naked,

305
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,208
lathering their hair and
bodies all over with soap.

306
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,375
Can't you picture it? Huh?

307
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,458
In this situation, there's only
one thing a man can do.

308
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,125
You're utterly shameless.

309
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,791
[RANTA]
Call me Shameless the Great!

310
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,291
The noble king of
shameless men everywhere.

311
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,541
Now come on.

312
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,583
You boys can be my
subjects too if you want.

313
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,041
It's really not so bad.

314
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,041
I mean, we were all
born naked, weren't we?

315
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,375
I don't really think
the girls would agree

316
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,541
with your reasoning.

317
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,958
Neither do I, for that matter.

318
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,583
--Now please--
--[RANTA] See you boys later!

319
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,250
[HARUHIRO]
Hey, wait!

320
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,666
[RANTA giggling]

321
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,833
[HARUHIRO]
Ranta! Stop!

322
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,041
[MANATO]
Ranta!

323
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,208
[YUME, SHIHORU scream]

324
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,375
[YUME]
Ranta, you idiot!

325
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,833
Sicko! Lecher! Pervert!

326
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:48,916
[RANTA grunts]

327
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,083
[YUME]
Try something like that again

328
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,000
and you'll get it
a million times worse!

329
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,458
[HARUHIRO chuckles]

330
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,541
[HARUHIRO] All we did
was try to stop him,

331
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,375
but we wound up in trouble, too.

332
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,791
[HARUHIRO]
Ranta, you idiot!
