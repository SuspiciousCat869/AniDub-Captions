00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:39.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[snarling softly]

2
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The trick worked.

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:49.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Varney]
The stupid little trinkets

4
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you found on that human body?

5
00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:55.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think they steal things
from their own court,

6
00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:59.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
carrying them as talismans
or some primitive shit.

7
00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:03.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The underground court
we’ve never been able to find.

8
00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:08.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always wondered if they were
confusing our senses

9
00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:10.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with holy water.

10
00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:11.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then some idiot shows up

11
00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:13.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with a divining set
around his neck,

12
00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:19.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
probably thinking it would
make him resistant to swords.

13
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There.
That’s their underground court.

14
00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:43.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She took the tracking stone
right there.

15
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

16
00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:47.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My plan was magnificent.

17
00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:52.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It wasn’t your plan.

18
00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:55.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was my plan.

19
00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:56.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just agreed to it.

20
00:01:56.667 --> 00:02:00.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I gave my assent,
therefore it became my plan.

21
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Be happy I even remember
you’re here.

22
00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:04.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What did you just say to me?

23
00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You heard me.

24
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dracula sent me here.

25
00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:11.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was to make Targoviste
a gift to him.

26
00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:15.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I will return him to earth
and present it to him.

27
00:02:15.417 --> 00:02:18.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re just my little helper.

28
00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:20.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fuck you to hell, Varney.

29
00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:21.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am entirely fucking finished

30
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with propping up
your delusional bullshit

31
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just to get things done.

32
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

33
00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:28.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am a soldier.

34
00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I still do not know what
the fuck you are supposed to be.

35
00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:35.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I’m Varney of London,
you insolent Slavic pissflap.

36
00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:38.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re a joke!

37
00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re a shallow criminal

38
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
who somehow wormed your way
into Dracula’s circle

39
00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a hundred years ago.

40
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:48.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then he sent you all the way
out here,

41
00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:51.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to the city he’d already burned.

42
00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:54.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How useful did he really think
you are?

43
00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:56.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs]
That’s...

44
00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s not what happened.

45
00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:59.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Shut up.

46
00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:02.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, Ratko, my boy,
you’re a criminal too.

47
00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:06.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I know you.
-You don’t fucking know me.

48
00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:07.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know you.

49
00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:09.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I smell the death on you.

50
00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:12.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’ve committed crimes.

51
00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:13.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’ve practiced war.

52
00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:17.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
War is armies meeting each other
on the field of combat.

53
00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:20.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That’s not what you do.
-Right.

54
00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:24.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m a clever soldier.

55
00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:27.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m a committed soldier.

56
00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:29.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t go to pageants.

57
00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:31.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t play games.

58
00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:33.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs]
Are you justifying yourself?

59
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Eat shit. I fight wars.

60
00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:39.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have no idea, do you?

61
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
War is when you kill so many
of the other side

62
00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:45.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that they can’t fight you
anymore.

63
00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:49.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prancing around on a meadow
isn’t war.

64
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stealing into a tent

65
00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:54.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and cutting every throat
in sight is war.

66
00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:57.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Poisoning wells is war.

67
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Killing every baby in a town
and disappearing, that’s war.

68
00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:04.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
War is for winning.

69
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And tracking that lunatic down
into her secret rooms

70
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and surprising them to death,

71
00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that’s what I do.

72
00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:14.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That’s what I did.

73
00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:18.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you, standing there
flapping and posing.

74
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re everything I hate.

75
00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:23.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You vampires who think
it’s all about wit.

76
00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:25.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I use the word loosely,

77
00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you are a shithead
for the ages.

78
00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:31.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Being charming,
using clever words,

79
00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
desperate for people
to admire you

80
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because you’re special.

81
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too much of the damaged,
needy human on you.

82
00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:42.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re not a vampire.

83
00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:47.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I’m a fucking vampire.

84
00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I lie and I cheat,

85
00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because lying to pigs
is meaningless,

86
00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I’m hungry.

87
00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:56.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I take everything anybody has,

88
00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
every last fucking drop,

89
00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:01.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then I hunt for more.

90
00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:05.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am not a criminal.

91
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am fucking perfect.

92
00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, dear, young man.

93
00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Perfect?
-Perfect.

94
00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:16.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was given to the Earth

95
00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:21.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to feed off everything on it
as I choose.

96
00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, let me tell you, Ratko,

97
00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:26.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you do not know what I am.

98
00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:30.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I tolerate you precisely
because you’re good at death.

99
00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:33.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It nourishes me.

100
00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:37.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whatever.

101
00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:39.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You made me angry.

102
00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don’t like to be angry.

103
00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:44.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Whyever not?
Anger makes you kill, surely.

104
00:05:44.542 --> 00:05:46.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I bet you even kill
in your dreams.

105
00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:53.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In my dreams, I am calm.

106
00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:57.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am nothing but motion,
and fear, and hunger,

107
00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:51.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See? Sign of the cross.

219
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hm.

220
00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:56.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did the vampire hunter
die in India?

221
00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:59.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because Hindu vampires
wouldn’t have the faintest idea

222
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
why he was waving a cross
at them.

223
00:16:01.375 --> 00:16:03.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, no.

224
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Vampires are basically
an evolved predator species,

225
00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:08.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so their eyesight
is pretty different to ours.

226
00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:10.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Turns out that if you put
a big geometric shape

227
00:16:11.042 --> 00:16:12.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
right up close in their
field of vision,

228
00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:14.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it confuses the shit out
of their brains

229
00:16:14.292 --> 00:16:15.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and, you know, makes them panic.

230
00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:18.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh. How do you even know that?

231
00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:21.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I learned
all kinds of things

232
00:16:21.417 --> 00:16:24.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when I was going to be a heroic
monster hunter, remember?

233
00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:26.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then all the shit happened,

234
00:16:26.542 --> 00:16:28.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and bit by bit I suppose
I lost it all.

235
00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:32.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now I’m starting
to pick it all up again.

236
00:16:32.375 --> 00:16:33.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The question is,

237
00:16:34.042 --> 00:16:36.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if you’re keeping
stuff like this down here,

238
00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:38.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
then why aren’t you using it
up there?

239
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Because your betters wish it so.

240
00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Trevor]
Then it’s time I meet them.

241
00:16:44.042 --> 00:16:45.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are they through there?

242
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I didn’t say
you could meet them.

243
00:16:47.917 --> 00:16:49.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They’re resting.

244
00:16:49.292 --> 00:16:52.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, well, time to stop
sleeping through all this.

245
00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:56.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look into my eyes.

246
00:16:56.833 --> 00:16:59.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you really,
really want to make my life

247
00:16:59.833 --> 00:17:01.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
any more annoying right now, hm?

248
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[mouthing inaudibly]

249
00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:08.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wakey wakey,
you shower of assholes.

250
00:17:12.917 --> 00:17:14.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You cannot speak to them like that.

251
00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I see why

252
00:17:16.875 --> 00:17:19.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they’re so remarkably
unconcerned about everything.

253
00:17:19.833 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Zamfir]
Keep your voice down.

254
00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Trevor] Why?
They’re not going to wake up.

255
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The others here don’t understand
about the royal sleep.

256
00:17:32.167 --> 00:17:33.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

257
00:17:33.375 --> 00:17:35.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

258
00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:40.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Zamfir, these two need
to be laid to rest.

259
00:17:40.208 --> 00:17:41.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is just wrong.

260
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you have a priest?

261
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No priests.

262
00:17:48.625 --> 00:17:50.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Zamfir, listen to me.

263
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is over.

264
00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:54.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It will never be over.

265
00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:56.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The apocalypse
will never claim us.

266
00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:59.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The catastrophe of Targoviste
will never happen again.

267
00:17:59.375 --> 00:18:01.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We killed all the priests,
you see.

268
00:18:01.417 --> 00:18:03.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Really.

269
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We are taking back control
of our country.

270
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Targoviste isn’t a country.

271
00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:09.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

272
00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s the beating heart
of the country.

273
00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:14.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not even a city.

274
00:18:14.375 --> 00:18:16.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It’s the greatest city
in the world.

275
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We are its stewards.

276
00:18:18.125 --> 00:18:20.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-We’re taking back control.
-Control? Yes.

277
00:18:21.042 --> 00:18:22.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Letting your people starve

278
00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:23.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and swim around
in their own shit.

279
00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:25.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not helping them organize.

280
00:18:25.167 --> 00:18:26.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not helping them
defend themselves.

281
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I haven’t been wiping
their asses either.

282
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Should I nip back up there
with some rags?

283
00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:35.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could try giving them the aid

284
00:18:35.292 --> 00:18:36.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to live their damn lives.

285
00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:38.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Zamfir]
Look!

286
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We’ve taken so many people in
down here.

287
00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:43.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sypha] Yes, you’ve made
an interesting collection

288
00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of people who are clearly
dying of neglect.

289
00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Zamfir] We neglect no one
in the Underground Court.

290
00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These people have cracked lips,

291
00:18:50.917 --> 00:18:52.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and you have flowing water
back there.

292
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Zamfir]
We need that. For defense.

293
00:18:56.417 --> 00:18:58.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Holy water.

294
00:18:58.417 --> 00:19:01.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where did you get it
if you killed all the priests?

295
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We recovered it from intact
religious buildings.

296
00:19:03.708 --> 00:19:05.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know some of them used
to cask and bottle

297
00:19:06.042 --> 00:19:07.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
holy water to sell?

298
00:19:07.417 --> 00:19:10.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could have used it to give
people something to drink.

299
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The court must be defended.

300
00:19:12.375 --> 00:19:14.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What if we’d let people
drink it all,

301
00:19:14.417 --> 00:19:16.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then vampires
crossed empty channels

302
00:19:16.292 --> 00:19:18.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to enter the court
and kill everybody?

303
00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:20.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sure. You couldn’t risk
letting vampires in.

304
00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:22.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They might have tidied up.

305
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, that doesn’t even work.

306
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you’re defending
two dead bodies.

307
00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:28.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They will wake.

308
00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Their majesties will awaken
from their royal sleep

309
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and save us all.

310
00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:34.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You’re insane.

311
00:19:34.292 --> 00:19:36.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course I’m insane.

312
00:19:36.833 --> 00:19:38.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The fuck what now?

313
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I went insane the day Dracula
hit the city.

314
00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:44.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I saw his face in the sky.

315
00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:48.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was like the devil himself
punched the world.

316
00:19:48.292 --> 00:19:50.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How could you not
lose your mind,

317
00:19:50.083 --> 00:19:52.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
seeing hell touch your home?

318
00:19:52.667 --> 00:19:55.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I sleep for two hours a night
and wake up screaming

319
00:19:55.917 --> 00:19:58.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
ever since it happened.

320
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you’re not so crazy that you
don’t know you’re crazy?

321
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They will wake.

322
00:20:04.417 --> 00:20:05.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are magicians.

323
00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:07.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are royal blood.

324
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They journey
in the subtle realms

325
00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:11.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to recover their strength,

326
00:20:11.083 --> 00:20:13.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I have to defend them
until then.

327
00:20:14.167 --> 00:20:15.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I get it now.

328
00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:19.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have been suffering for so long.

329
00:20:19.417 --> 00:20:22.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Were you the last person
of noble birth left alive

330
00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:24.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when Dracula struck?

331
00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:26.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs] I am not suffering.

332
00:20:26.583 --> 00:20:28.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the great work.

333
00:20:28.708 --> 00:20:31.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is my glorious duty.

334
00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:33.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I will save everyone
by saving them.

335
00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:38.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh.

336
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, no wonder they broke it
into pieces.

337
00:20:41.917 --> 00:20:44.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Did you drag them out
of the ruins of their palace?

338
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was my job. I saved them.

339
00:20:48.167 --> 00:20:49.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They will wake.

340
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They will save us all.

341
00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And everything will be set right.

342
00:20:53.708 --> 00:20:56.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everything will be as it was.

343
00:20:56.542 --> 00:20:59.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are magicians, Sypha.

344
00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:00.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are they?

345
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The priest class
always suspected it.

346
00:21:02.417 --> 00:21:05.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They harried the royal family.
Can you believe it? But look.

347
00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:08.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at all the things
we recovered from their palace.

348
00:21:08.708 --> 00:21:10.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Behold their mystical treasures.

349
00:21:13.042 --> 00:21:16.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I saved them.
So they will save me.

350
00:21:19.917 --> 00:21:22.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you done farting around
over there?

351
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don’t know who taught you
all these words, but yeah.

352
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay. Good.

353
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am truly sorry for everything
that has happened to you.

354
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But all this has to stop now.

355
00:21:36.417 --> 00:21:38.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
W-What?

356
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Sypha] We need to get
these people help.

357
00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:42.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need to arm the healthy ones

358
00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:43.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

down here.

359
00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:46.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We need to abandon this space,
organize and--

360
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

361
00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:51.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Abandon the royal family?

362
00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:52.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is a mess.

363
00:21:52.792 --> 00:21:55.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You did the best you could,
but your rulers are dead

00:21:56.042 --> 00:21:58.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

365
00:21:58.542 --> 00:22:01.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
