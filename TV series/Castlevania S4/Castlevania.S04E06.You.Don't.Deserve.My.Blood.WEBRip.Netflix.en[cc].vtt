35
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was a very clever trick
that we don't have time for.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:56.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

37
00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:00.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

38
00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:08.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

41
00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

what did you just do?

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:43.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

54
00:05:43.417 --> 00:05:45.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
since I got him killed in the first place.

55
00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:48.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in here during the month,

56
00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:50.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

88
00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:09.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. Command and control flows

96
00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:26.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

97

99
00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:33.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to make this while nobody
was looking.

00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:49.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

107
00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:51.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

109
00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:55.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
