00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

50
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

54
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

55
00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:47.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

56
00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:49.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

57
00:05:49.708 --> 00:05:52.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
