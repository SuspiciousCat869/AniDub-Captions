[dramatic music]

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:21.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:10.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Greta] Surely it would have been safer
to do this during daylight.

4
00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:13.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Alucard] We would have been expected
to do this during daylight.

5
00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:16.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We may call them night creatures,

6
00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:19.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but they operate perfectly
when in sunshine.

7
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But surely the vampires who command them
are disadvantaged by daylight.

8
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Their night creatures
are clearly being instructed.

9
00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:29.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The attacks are too targeted.

10
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So we're moving before
they can be given fresh orders.

11
00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:37.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alucard] We live in hope, yes.

12
00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:39.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And our chances of making it
to your castle

13
00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:41.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
before we're spotted
and those fresh orders are given?

14
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, somewhere between slim and none,
I would imagine.

15
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I want to hear from you,
I'll throw a coin in your begging bowl.

16
00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:54.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All this and a magical tramp.

17
00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:56.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Magical"?

18
00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've lived out here my whole life.

19
00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We live next to the spirits
of wood and stream,

20
00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:08.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the things that come with the storm
and the smell of magic.

21
00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:11.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You smell of it. He reeks of it.

22
00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:13.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hm.

23
00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What does it smell like to you?

24
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On you, it's sweet like spices.

25
00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:20.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On him, it's rotten.

26
00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:24.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Saint Germain] Yes, it's--
it's rendered me quite deaf.

27
00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:27.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

28
00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:28.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am but a scholar, madam.

29
00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:33.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The scents you detect are entirely down
to Alucard having recently used soap

30
00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:37.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and my having to fight your chickens
for access to pond water.

31
00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:38.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And losing.

32
00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:42.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And indeed losing.
I am a man of books.

33
00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:45.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your earthy peasant ways
are quite beyond me.

34
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:47.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My skills lie in other directions.

35
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pity. I was hoping you were good
with a knife.

36
00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:53.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm going to circle around
and make sure I don't have stragglers.

37
00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:59.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just a scholar, then?

38
00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:03.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, and very good at inventing drinks.

39
00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:06.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I used to know someone
who would have liked that about you.

40
00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:11.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I used to know someone
who liked that about me.

41
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I hope to see her again soon.

42
00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:18.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hope you do.
That sounds comforting.

43
00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:22.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yes. Thank you.

44
00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:25.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

45
00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:28.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep walking.

46
00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:43.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[flies buzzing]

52
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

53
00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:25.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No calls for help from you.

55
00:04:48.292 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doesn't it look absolutely
bloody exhausting?

56
00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Move, man!

58
00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:14.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Could you seriously not have considered
taking the arrow out of his brain?

59
00:05:21.792 --> 00:05:23.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just pull the thing out.

60
00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:25.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't just pull arrows out.

61
00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:27.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The barbs on the back of the arrowhead
tear the flesh open

62
00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:29.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if you yank the thing free.

63
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You do know he's already dead?

64
00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you want to wake up
with an arrowhead filling your eye socket?

65
00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[grunts]

66
00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:39.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There. [sighs] Now...

67
00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:43.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
let's try thinking for a moment before
bringing the next one in, shall we?

68
00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:49.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

71
00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:14.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're back in the world.
Take a breath.

72
00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:15.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

73
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is your place now.

74
00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:20.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These two will mark you out
and take you where you need to be.

75
00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:22.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

76
00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:34.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Next.

77
00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:35.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lenore] Can I just say...

78
00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that I find this whole blasphemous
process disgusting?

79
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then why are you sitting there
watching it?

80
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I want
to hate it properly.

81
00:06:44.375 --> 00:06:45.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't you have anything
better to do?

83
00:06:49.417 --> 00:06:52.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lenore] No.
Wait outside until I call you.

84
00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong, Lenore?

85
00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:59.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nothing's wrong. What makes you
say something's wrong?

86
00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:02.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've got eyes and ears.
I know when something's wrong.

87
00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:07.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

88
00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:10.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When Carmilla's left on her own
for too long,

89
00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:13.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
she starts to scheme,

90
00:07:13.208 --> 00:07:15.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that works out really well for us.

91
00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:21.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Styria might be the oldest stable
vampire community in the world,

92
00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:24.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
certainly the only one run by women.

93
00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:25.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm overjoyed.

94
00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs] Shush.

95
00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:28.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Morana and Striga are away.

96
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been busy taking care
of some of Morana's work

97
00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:33.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and spending time with you,

98
00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:36.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and Carmilla's been on her own a lot.

99
00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:41.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, do you know how Styria
has lasted so long?

100
00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:43.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you're all very clever
vampire sisters?

101
00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:46.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles]
You've been paying attention.

102
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, but also because
we didn't overreach.

103
00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:53.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Vampires are thirsty, Lenore.

104
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's what defines you.

105
00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's always more blood to be drunk
somewhere across the next field.

106
00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:00.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we didn't do that, not really.

107
00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:01.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But now I'm...

108
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know, and it's...

109
00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's leaving me feeling a bit lost.

110
00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:11.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like my place in our system
has been erased.

111
00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:14.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you were the last problem
I had to solve.

112
00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. Thanks again for that.

113
00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:19.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, shush. You were having fun.

114
00:08:19.292 --> 00:08:21.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, right up until almost the end.

115
00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you're making another point.

116
00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:27.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is why I like you.

117
00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:30.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're capable
of actually listening to me.

118
00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:33.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe you'll reach your other point
before I die of old age.

119
00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:35.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The four of us support each other.

120
00:08:35.875 --> 00:08:38.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But soon I'll have nothing to do.

121
00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:40.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing to offer.

122
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no diplomacy involved in making
humans stand in line to be bled.

123
00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:48.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All the humans.

124
00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:51.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And not just in Europe.
-Oh?

125
00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She showed me her maps.

126
00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:56.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I made her angry, I think.

127
00:08:56.458 --> 00:08:58.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She showed me maps of the world.

128
00:08:59.042 --> 00:09:00.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know, I know.

129
00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:03.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A giant human pen from here to Braila.
I've had the lectures.

130
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not anymore.

131

132
00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:09.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's been scheming.

133
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And she showed me maps
of the world, Hector.

134
00:09:15.917 --> 00:09:17.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The world.

135
00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:22.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The pen was about securing our survival
and safety for centuries to come.

136
00:09:22.292 --> 00:09:26.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was an insane idea, but we
could stretch and make it work.

137
00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:30.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But now she sees weakness everywhere.

138
00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:33.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we were a strong and stable community

139
00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:37.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in a world that lost many
of its vampire leaders at Braila.

140
00:09:37.417 --> 00:09:42.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what you're saying is if it's there,
she's going to drink it.

141
00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:45.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She said she had one plan:

142
00:09:45.292 --> 00:09:47.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To annex land
from here to the sea.

143
00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:52.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She promised me that was her plan,

144
00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:53.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then she was left alone,

145
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then I made her angry
and she showed me her maps.

146
00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think she lied to me.

147
00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:06.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just the way Dracula lied to me.

150
00:10:25.042 --> 00:10:26.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at them die!

151
00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:29.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I know you're all tired and scared,

152
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but they're just bloody animals!

153
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kill the bastards!

154
00:10:35.792 --> 00:10:38.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My family came here generations ago.

155
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They escaped from the Romans,
so the story goes.

156
00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:45.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could probably trace your family
back to Carthage, perhaps further.

157
00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:47.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:51.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've been in Danesti since it was
just a wide spot in the road.

159
00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:53.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
People from all over
wash up here and stay.

160
00:10:54.917 --> 00:10:56.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We don't trace back to anywhere.

161
00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:58.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're all from here.

162
00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:00.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That must be nice,

163
00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:02.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to be from somewhere.

164
00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:03.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

165
00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:06.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we're not there anymore.

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:53.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then, I'm ashamed to say,

171
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I put them on stakes outside the castle
like I was my father.

172
00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:58.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

173
00:11:58.708 --> 00:12:00.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just saying,

174
00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:02.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am not at my best.

175
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has been...

176
00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:06.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
difficult.

177
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. I can see that.

178
00:12:09.167 --> 00:12:12.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, I had a boyfriend and a girlfriend
at the same time once,

179
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but they never tried to kill me.

180
00:12:15.042 --> 00:12:17.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, no. I tell a lie.

181
00:12:17.542 --> 00:12:20.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

182
00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:24.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew you'd be strange,

183
00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:29.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but I didn't think it would be something
like this that brought you back to life.

184
00:12:29.542 --> 00:12:32.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's always something like this.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:36.542 --> 00:12:39.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

188
00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:44.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:45.583 --> 00:12:46.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

190
00:12:48.542 --> 00:12:52.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I should probably grow all the way up
and accept it now.

191
00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:53.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:54.042 --> 00:12:57.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:14.042 --> 00:13:17.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:21.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to sleep through it.

00:13:21.917 --> 00:13:24.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:12.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:31.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:44.292 --> 00:17:46.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

258
00:17:54.333 --> 00:17:57.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I come from a people who have weaved
a community across the world,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I know you know
what that community does.

00:18:00.542 --> 00:18:02.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It fixes things,

00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:03.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:08.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

266
00:18:16.333 --> 00:18:17.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, don't look at me like that.

267
00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:21.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to where you sleep and cook.

268
00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:22.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'll all get sick.

269
00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:26.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This isn't hard.
Where are you storing your food?

270
00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:31.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

271
00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:33.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

274
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want these people to give up
what little food they can find

275
00:18:40.375 --> 00:18:42.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

276
00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:45.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not safe for them up here.

277
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's not safe for these people
to give up eating.

278
00:18:47.917 --> 00:18:49.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

279
00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:51.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I realize that we are on the same side,

280
00:18:52.042 --> 00:18:54.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

that I can kill you by looking at you.

281
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I also realize that these people
need to organize.

282
00:18:57.708 --> 00:18:58.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They need--

283
00:18:58.792 --> 00:19:00.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

until they help themselves.

284
00:19:01.042 --> 00:19:04.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Otherwise, your invisible king and queen
will rule over nothing but bones.

285
00:19:04.875 --> 00:19:06.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you think that's what they want?

286
00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:08.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:12.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:50.542 --> 00:19:53.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
