00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:24.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

better to do?

27
00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:09.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:20.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seems the time
when diplomacy

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:26.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

35
00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:30.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. You're worried.

36
00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:32.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

38
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're not...

39
00:04:37.417 --> 00:04:39.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not like that.

40
00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:42.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or, at least, they wouldn't
think of it like that.

41
00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:44.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our lives have entered
a new phase.

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:45.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Diplomacy, negotiations,

43
00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:47.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
these are things
of the past now.

44
00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hmm. Which makes you
a thing of the past,

45
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that is bothering you.

46
00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:54.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look...

47
00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:58.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Carmilla's plan
buys us security

48
00:04:58.708 --> 00:05:00.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for hundreds of years.

49
00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:05.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a child of war, Hector.

50
00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:08.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was born
in a castle like this.

51
00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:10.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My parents died
when English soldiers

52
00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
climbed up the toilet chutes
with knives in their teeth.

53
00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd seen enough war
before I was five years old,

54
00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:20.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and life didn't get better
after that.

55
00:05:21.917 --> 00:05:23.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I will never be comfortable

56
00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with the idea that the best way
to end war

57
00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:31.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is to kill most of the people
and cage the rest.

58
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:34.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you are a diplomat.

60
00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:37.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, none of this will matter

61
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if you don't make
that bloody hammer.

62
00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why can't you just wave
your fingers like a wizard

63
00:05:41.417 --> 00:05:43.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to raise the dead,
or whatever?

64
00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:46.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Hector] The forgemaster
works through an instrument.

65
00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:48.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That may be the worst
justification

66
00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:51.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for a man holding his penis
that I've ever heard.

67
00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:52.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, my God.

68
00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:54.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I am 200 years old.

69
00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Look...

70
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am a forgemaster.

71
00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't invent the name,
all right?

72
00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's just what they call us.

73
00:06:01.417 --> 00:06:03.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the magic has to be focused
through an instrument,

74
00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:06.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
like breath being pushed
through a flute.

75
00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:08.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This isn't getting any better.

76
00:06:08.917 --> 00:06:11.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need the bloody hammer.
Is that better?

77
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:12.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So use a bloody hammer.

78
00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There must be a thousand
bloody hammers around here.

79
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, it's got to be special.

80
00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

81
00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:20.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your special hammer.

82
00:06:20.583 --> 00:06:22.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughs]
Would you stop?

83
00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:23.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It has to be made from scratch,

84
00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:25.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in a very particular way,

85
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or else it won't work.

86
00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:29.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a flute with no holes.

87
00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:31.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

88
00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:33.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-For fingering.

89
00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:34.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you stop?

90
00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:37.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So when you blow it,
nothing comes out.

91
00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:38.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Good god, woman.

92
00:06:39.042 --> 00:06:40.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm bored, and it's fun
to horrify you.

93
00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:42.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Indulge me.

94
00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:45.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And think of something
to tell Carmilla.

95
00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:47.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's getting very cross.

96
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, dear. How sad.

97
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Never mind.

98
00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:53.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seriously.

99
00:06:54.042 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've supposedly been making
your magic hammer for weeks.

100
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Couldn't you make
something simpler?

101
00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:03.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A stick, or a coin,
or something?

102
00:07:03.708 --> 00:07:05.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We all use different things.

103
00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:07.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isaac used a knife.

104
00:07:07.917 --> 00:07:09.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A hammer works better for me.

105
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, make it work faster.

106
00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:15.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If Carmilla loses her temper,

107
00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:17.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I won't be able to stand
in front of you for long.

108
00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:19.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'd stand in front of me?

109
00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:21.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've been doing it for weeks.

110
00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:23.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh. Yes.

111
00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:26.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, I suppose you have.

112
00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:28.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, thank you.

113
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm working on it.

114
00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:33.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know what I'm going to say.

115
00:07:33.542 --> 00:07:34.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

116
00:07:34.792 --> 00:07:36.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Work faster.

117
00:07:36.375 --> 00:07:37.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

118
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:39.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, but it needs to be perfect,

119
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or nothing will come out
of the end.

120
00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:45.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ugh, you're disgusting.

121
00:07:57.167 --> 00:07:59.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Has Hector made
his fucking hammer yet?

122
00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:02.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's still working on it.

123
00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:04.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's stalling.

124
00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:06.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's too simple for that.

125
00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:09.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No.
-No?

126
00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

127
00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:14.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a deviousness in him.

128
00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:16.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you suspect a rag doll

129
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of planning to steal
your coin purse?

130
00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:24.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You mistake that puppy thing
for being placid and stupid.

131
00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:26.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He can kill.

132
00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:29.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He tried, once.

133
00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:31.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was half-hearted at best.

134
00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:34.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm. See?

135
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See what? You weren't there.

136
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He was confused and frightened,

137
00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:40.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and barely even knew
what he was doing.

138
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm warning you.

139
00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:44.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right?

140
00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:46.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm just warning you.

141
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please, would Dracula have kept
him around in his own castle

142
00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:52.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if he were that dangerous?

143
00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:53.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

144
00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:57.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I would have liked that castle.

145
00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:59.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dracula's castle?

146
00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:00.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

147
00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:03.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't see a lot of it,
in the end.

148
00:09:03.917 --> 00:09:05.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I'm sure it was full

149
00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:08.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of interesting
and wonderful things.

150
00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:12.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am compelled to point out that
you already have a nice castle.

151
00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:14.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would you want his?

152
00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:18.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I take things away
from stupid, evil old men.

153
00:09:18.917 --> 00:09:20.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's what I do.

154
00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:22.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've always done it.

155
00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:24.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They deserve to lose everything.

156
00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:27.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I deserve to have
all their stuff.

157
00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:30.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You could just make new things.

158
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would I waste my time,

159
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when I can just take
whatever I want

160
00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:38.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and then kill whoever had them?

161
00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:39.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

162
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at my map.

163
00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
From here to Braila.

164
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:48.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That land and those villages
and towns belong to old men.

165
00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:50.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All of them.

166
00:09:50.292 --> 00:09:52.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I'm going to take them.

167
00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:57.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This castle belonged
to a stupid, evil old man.

168
00:09:58.667 --> 00:09:59.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I took it.

169
00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The land from here to Braila,

170
00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:05.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
ruled by stupid old men.

171
00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:10.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Devastated by one single
stupid old man.

172
00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:12.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There for the taking.

173
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And will you be happy
when you have all that?

174
00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:20.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just look at this.

175
00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:23.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look.

176
00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:28.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know how many regional
vampire rulers died at Braila?

177
00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:30.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't know
I had to count them.

178
00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:32.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you should.

179
00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:34.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was a lot.

180
00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:36.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These are just the ones
I'm certain of.

181
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lenore]
These little flags?

182
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carmilla]
That's right.

183
00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:43.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All these regions
without direct vampire rule.

184
00:10:43.792 --> 00:10:47.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just waiting for someone
to take control.

185
00:10:47.542 --> 00:10:51.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Surely their underlings will
raise someone up into command.

186
00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:54.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Unless we were there first.

187
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would we do that?

188
00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:58.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is the world, Lenore.

189
00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:03.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We could take the entire world
for our own.

190
00:11:04.583 --> 00:11:06.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wouldn't you want that?

191
00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:11.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

192
00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:14.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The "sweet little girl" act
doesn't work on me, Lenore.

193
00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:16.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Try again.

194
00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really don't know.

195
00:11:18.208 --> 00:11:21.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I...I never thought
about anything that big before.

196
00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:23.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Start.

197
00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:25.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Answer my question first.

198
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Will you be happy

199
00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:30.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when you have all this?

200
00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:40.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The first part of my life
was men taking things from me.

201
00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:44.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then I took their lives.

202
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And their things.

203
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And their homes.

204
00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then we took Styria.

205
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After which
we formed our little enclave.

206
00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We tried not to do more harm.

207
00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:56.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We tried to make a home.

208
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And when the wolf people
came from the north,

209
00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and the armies
from the west,

210
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and every other bastard
came for us.

211
00:12:03.708 --> 00:12:05.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we asked for help.

212
00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:08.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What did the rest
of the vampire world say?

213
00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:11.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Bloody women," they said.

214
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
"Let them die," they said.

215
00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:18.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I'm going to take everything
from everybody.

216
00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:21.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was in Dracula's castle.

217
00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:23.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I went there to see
