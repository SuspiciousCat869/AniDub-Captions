Who's a pretty girl, then?

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's right.

4
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are you looking at?

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:46.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He told us to place possessions

if need be.

00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I needed to see
if it still worked.

11
00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:07.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm going to see Isaac.

13
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not taking it with me.

17
00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:10.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
May I ask you a question?

18
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course.

19
00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:16.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What are we doing here?

20
00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:19.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That is a very broad question.

21
00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:22.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be more specific.

22
00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:24.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sit.

23
00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:28.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do not need to tell you

24
00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:34.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
what night creatures are,
forgemaster.

25
00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:37.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can call me Isaac.

26
00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you like a berry?

27
00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Case in point.

28
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am a night creature.

29
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I eat blood and meat.

30
00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:54.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A berry would probably
not kill you.

31
00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:57.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Night creatures kill,

32
00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:02.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
destroy and despoil.

33
00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:05.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It is our pleasure.

34
00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:09.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Night creatures do the will
of their forgemasters.

35
00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:16.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then perhaps I simply
don't understand your will.

36
00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You have us burying people.

37
00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:26.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The city was littered with dead.

38
00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:27.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Too many of them
were too decayed

39
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to be converted by magic.

40
00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:31.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So?

41
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So they need to be buried.

42
00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:37.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are not a fool.

43
00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:39.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Insects and diseases
would breed.

44
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I would remind you
that everyone here was a victim.

45
00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They deserve a burial.

46
00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:49.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then why do we care

47
00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:54.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
about insects and diseases?

48
00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:56.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ask your question.

49
00:03:56.208 --> 00:04:02.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We kill, destroy and despoil.

50
00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:07.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have us burying
the rotten dead

51
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and rebuilding
and repairing this place.

52
00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:20.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why do you have us going against
our nature?

53
00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:23.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your nature is fluid.

54
00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You believe you are tools
of destruction

55
00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:29.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
only because this is how
your kind have always been used.

56
00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:32.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have a berry.

57
00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:48.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Memories.

58
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not blood or meat,

59
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but you don't appear
to have died from it.

60
00:04:56.208 --> 00:04:58.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll answer your question.

61
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This city was once home
to many hundreds of people,

62
00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:04.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
perhaps more.

63
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It could be resettled,

64
00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:09.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
once the bodies are buried,

65
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:13.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the debris is disposed of
and the structures are repaired.

66
00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:17.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We will be moving on soon.

67
00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:19.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
After we are gone,

68
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the city will be here
for people to find

69
00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:24.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and make homes in.

70
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you like another berry?

71
00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:31.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think so.

72
00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:32.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Isaac]
Take one.

73
00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:38.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You see, you can use a hammer
to build a house

74
00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:41.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or crack a skull.

75
00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:45.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are returned
to earth as tools,

76
00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:49.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I will use tools as I wish.

77
00:05:50.292 --> 00:05:54.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So many memories.

78
00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:57.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Isaac]
I can also choose, in the end,

79
00:05:57.292 --> 00:06:00.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to recognize that you are not
tools at all.

80
00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:04.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For no tool would taste a berry

81
00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:06.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and remember the time
in its first life

82
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
when it encountered them.

83
00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:14.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we are creatures of hell...

84
00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:17.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to be commanded to fight.

85
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Isaac]
One day, hell will be emptied

86
00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:24.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and its doors will rattle
in the wind.

87
00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:27.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Flyseyes]
What?

88
00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:28.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Isaac]
Through my hand,

89
00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:32.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
God lifts the damned from hell
in his mercy

90
00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:35.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to enact their penance
on the Earth as my soldiers.

91
00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:37.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yes.
-Should their penance on Earth

92
00:06:38.042 --> 00:06:39.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
be eternal too?

93
00:06:39.917 --> 00:06:41.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Flyseyes]
I...

94
00:06:41.292 --> 00:06:42.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
do not know.

95
00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:44.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Isaac]
Neither do I.

96
00:06:47.417 --> 00:06:49.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We should find out together.

97
00:06:50.083 --> 00:06:51.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In the meantime,

98
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we can both do a little more

99
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
than what we were
intended for.

100
00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:01.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
May I make an observation?

101
00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Isaac]
You may.

102
00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:06.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Flyseyes]
You are changing.

103
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There is still revenge in you,
I think.

104
00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:14.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But other things, too.

105
00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:19.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps.

106
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are we still fighting, Isaac?

107
00:07:23.708 --> 00:07:26.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're always fighting
for something.

108
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I take your meaning.

109
00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:32.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:54.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:05.542 --> 00:08:07.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

121
00:08:22.458 --> 00:08:24.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I killed you, old wizard.

122
00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:27.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You must have an opinion
on that.

123
00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:29.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

124
00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:34.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have killed many people,

00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:39.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

126
00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:43.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:57.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:57.208 --> 00:09:00.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have felt more like the hand

133
00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:04.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:09.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:11.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:14.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:09:15.042 --> 00:09:17.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I love you, but, really,

221
00:13:43.167 --> 00:13:45.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm ready to put you
on a wagon home.

222
00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:46.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

223
00:13:47.042 --> 00:13:48.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This.

224
00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:50.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We've been touring--

225
00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not even the entire territory
Camilla marked out,

226
00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:54.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
just a piece of it.

227
00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
--for weeks.

228
00:13:56.375 --> 00:13:59.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And this is all wrong.

229
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right.

230
00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:15.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Explain yourself, woman.

231
00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:17.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs]

232
00:14:17.583 --> 00:14:20.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have no particular love
for humans.

233
00:14:20.417 --> 00:14:22.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's a food chain,
and we're on top.

234
00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Humans are pigs with shoes,

235
00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and they don't cry
when they want bacon.

236
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am not sad when I turn
humans into food.

237
00:14:31.875 --> 00:14:33.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Understood?

238
00:14:33.542 --> 00:14:35.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Spit it out, Morana.

239
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

what you're thinking,

240
00:14:37.458 --> 00:14:39.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or you'll tie yourself up
in knots.

241
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs]
God.

242
00:14:41.208 --> 00:14:42.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have lived with you
for too long.

243
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay, is there a swift
and merciful way

244
00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:48.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for us to take control
of all the designated territory

245
00:14:48.542 --> 00:14:51.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
between the castle and the sea?

246
00:14:51.292 --> 00:14:54.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You mean, snap my fingers
and it's all done?

247
00:14:54.667 --> 00:14:57.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, of course not.

248
00:14:57.375 --> 00:14:58.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course not.

249
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It will be hard-fought,
mile by mile, right?

250
00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:05.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, let's not make it
sound desperate.

251
00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:07.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But it won't be simple.

252
00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:09.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

253
00:15:09.917 --> 00:15:12.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There will be suffering.

254
00:15:12.458 --> 00:15:14.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's war, Morana.
There's always suffering.

255
00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:16.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not war.

256
00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:18.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are no two sides to this.

257
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's a rolling invasion

258
00:15:20.542 --> 00:15:24.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and entrapment of hundreds
of thousands of humans.

259
00:15:24.292 --> 00:15:26.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[inhales deeply and sighs]

260
00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:29.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Humans who are, sadly,
cleverer than pigs

261
00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:32.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and will fight and suffer
and fear and run.

262
00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:35.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then I choose a different word.

263
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's "battle."

264
00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:38.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I came out here with you

265
00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:40.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because I wanted to see
for myself

266
00:15:40.917 --> 00:15:42.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
the logistical challenges
to the plan.

267
00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I told you,
you didn't have to.

268
00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:46.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd survey the theater
of combat

269
00:15:47.042 --> 00:15:48.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and let you know what I needed.

270
00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:49.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Also...

271
00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:52.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you're the one who asked me

272
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if I wanted to command
an empire.

273
00:15:54.583 --> 00:15:57.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. I know.

274
00:15:57.125 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It made a lot more sense
back home.

275
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:00.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Focus, Morana.

276
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't talk down to me
because I am not a soldier.

277
00:16:05.542 --> 00:16:07.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is going to be
a horrifying mess

278
00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:11.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that we will be dealing with
till the end of our days,

279
00:16:11.708 --> 00:16:15.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and it will cause more suffering
than history has yet seen!

280
00:16:15.917 --> 00:16:19.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't condescend to me
because I am a soldier.

281
00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:21.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I win wars.

282
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you suddenly doubting me
after all this time,

283
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because your legs are sore
from living my life?

284
00:16:26.625 --> 00:16:29.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you ready to fight
the same war over and over again

285
00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:31.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for the rest of your life?

286
00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:36.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You want to know what I think?

287
00:16:37.292 --> 00:16:38.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Always.

288
00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think that whatever
we achieve,

289
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
we achieve it together.

290
00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:43.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You and me.

291
00:16:43.667 --> 00:16:45.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Carmilla throws
a crazy plan at us,

292
00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:46.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and it's us who make it work.

293
00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or, put another way,

294
00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:51.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we make it work
despite Carmilla.

295
00:16:53.292 --> 00:16:54.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And Lenore's never
any bloody help.

296
00:16:55.042 --> 00:16:56.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's off with the fairies
most of the time.

297
00:16:56.792 --> 00:16:58.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's us.

298
00:16:58.208 --> 00:17:00.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the crazy plan
makes sense back home because,

299
00:17:00.542 --> 00:17:01.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know,

300
00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:04.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Carmilla has this magic
reality distortion spell,

301
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we pride ourselves
on making things work.

302
00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:09.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But we've been out here
for weeks,

303
00:17:09.542 --> 00:17:13.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
away from her and her madness,
and I'm telling you--

304

306
00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:19.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

307
00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:20.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

308
00:17:20.792 --> 00:17:22.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:24.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they're not stupid.

00:17:24.583 --> 00:17:26.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
