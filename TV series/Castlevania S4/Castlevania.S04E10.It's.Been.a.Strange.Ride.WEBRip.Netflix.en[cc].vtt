It's nearly your bedtime.

3
00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:55.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not finished yet.

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:59.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You might not be, but the wine
supply is definitely over.

5
00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:03.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, it's all over, Hector.

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:08.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's really not.

8
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Things just changed, that's all.

9
00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:16.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Vampires aren't big on change.

10
00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:20.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Someone should have told Carmilla that.

11
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You still misunderstand her.

12
00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, come on.

13
00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:28.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even you were horrified
by what she turned into.

14
00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:31.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The scale of it, maybe.

15
00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the chaos it would have
introduced into our lives.

16
00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:38.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I still say that at the root of it all

17
00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:40.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
was the vampire's virtue.

18
00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:44.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We want everything to remain the same.

19
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To remain stable.

21
00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:49.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The vampire's virtue. Bloody hell.

22
00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's an act of philosophical
acrobatics for the ages.

23
00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:54.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, shush with your trying to be clever.

24
00:01:55.042 --> 00:01:58.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You people spend 60 years
bumping into things

25
00:01:58.208 --> 00:01:59.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and call it a life.

26
00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have to take a longer view.

27
00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:04.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So we want stability.

28
00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you're saying you had that.

29
00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:09.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We did.

30
00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:13.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As a quartet, my sisters and I
had strength.

31
00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:17.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The strength to enforce
a stable environment.

32
00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:20.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Strength can fight a war, yes,

33
00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:22.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but it can also build a shelter.

34
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:25.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you following me?

35
00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:28.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just bumping into things along the way.

36
00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:32.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Small shapes are stronger
than big ones, Lenore.

37
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Carmilla wanted more
than a weatherproof shelter.

38
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In the end.

39
00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:39.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it all came from
that virtue, do you see?

40
00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:43.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Strength and power are different.

41
00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:46.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You wanted strength.

42
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Carmilla wanted power.

43
00:02:50.917 --> 00:02:53.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In the end, yes.

44
00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's what it turned into.

45
00:02:56.917 --> 00:02:59.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which is what ruined my life.

46
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Power.

47
00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:06.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Big, international,

48
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
non-diplomatic, projected power

49
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:12.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is something else.

50
00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:14.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It lends you more might,

51
00:03:14.708 --> 00:03:17.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it doesn't have
the utilities of strength.

52
00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:18.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It lays eggs in you.

53
00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It becomes a parasite you have to feed.

54
00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:23.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Power does nothing but eat.

55
00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:34.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a vampire.

56
00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:39.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like a vampire.

57
00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:47.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Therefore...

58
00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:49.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
having been shown what I am...

59
00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:53.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
having found that I have been
living a lie...

60
00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:58.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
here I sit in a cage,
like a dangerous animal.

61
00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
with King Isaac, the happy bastard,

62
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
keeping a very watchful eye on me.

63
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've never known him so fucking cheerful.

64
00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:08.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's bizarre.

65
00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he won't harm you.

66
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

67
00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:13.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's just going to keep me in a cage.

68
00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:16.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
And I'm not going to sit
in a cage, Hector.

69
00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:19.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Not even with you.

70
00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:23.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sorry for everything
you went through.

71
00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:27.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I'm sorry I can't be here
to help you through...

72
00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:29.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
whatever comes next.

73
00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:34.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I refuse to exist like this.

74
00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:40.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I want to see what's so special

75
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
about this sun you keep talking about.

76
00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:46.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lenore, don't.

77
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hector, it's fine.

78
00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:54.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's what I want to do.

79
00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:03.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Hector] Be free, Lenore.

80
00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:06.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What will you do?

81
00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:08.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I'm going to write a book.

82
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:11.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The future should know
the mistakes we made.

83
00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:15.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And recently, I've been caused
to know the value...

84
00:05:16.708 --> 00:05:17.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and the beauty...

85
00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:20.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of things that live longer than I do.

about my plan?

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Alucard] It was my plan.

94
00:08:23.792 --> 00:08:25.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Greta] You just think it was your plan.

95
00:08:25.417 --> 00:08:27.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

96
00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:29.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I let you think it was your plan.

97
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I told you my plan.

98
00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:32.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just think you did.

99
00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:34.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm very clever.

100
00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I told you my plan in a way
that would make you think

101
00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it was your idea.

102
00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:40.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was my bloody idea.

103
00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:42.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Admit it. You're outmatched.

104
00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:47.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am no such thing,
and also it was all my idea.

105
00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:50.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:08:52.042 --> 00:08:54.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

108
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

-Oh, my God.
-I'm a genius.

111
00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:00.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Just surrender.

112
00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ignoring for a moment

113
00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:05.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that you are considerably more insane

114
00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:07.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

115
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Are you sure it's a good idea?

116
00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, I'm not...

117
00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:14.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
used to people.

118
00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:15.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're used to you.

119
00:09:16.792 --> 00:09:18.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So just let them be used to you.

120
00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:20.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

121
00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:23.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I felt part of my brain die

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

123
00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:27.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's human. Just roll with it.

125
00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:33.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

126
00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:35.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

132
00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:48.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't want to disappoint them

You, Alucard, are a very odd person.

135
00:09:58.792 --> 00:10:00.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

She hasn't talked to anyone

141
00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:34.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you spare a horse?

142
00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:38.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Possibly. What for?

143
00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:44.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am going to do what Trevor

144
00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:46.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

145
00:10:47.542 --> 00:10:49.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know you are very welcome here.

146
00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:51.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

147
00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:55.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I am also very definitely pregnant.

148
00:10:55.417 --> 00:10:56.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh.

149
00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:58.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I should be with my people.

150
00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:00.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And my people are well practiced

151
00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:03.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in giving the support
a woman needs when it's time.

152
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I could just get a horse.

153
00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:11.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

154
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:15.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go on.

155
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say it like the way you said it to Trevor

156
00:11:18.458 --> 00:11:19.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

157
00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:22.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alucard] Should I not be congratulating?

158
00:11:22.542 --> 00:11:24.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

159
00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:29.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, I've heard worse impressions.

160
00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:31.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's fine.

161
00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:34.625 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

162
00:11:35.708 --> 00:11:37.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

163
00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:39.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Something new and wonderful
will have come from all this.

164
00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:42.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I should go.

165
00:11:50.708 --> 00:11:51.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You should stay.

166
00:11:54.292 --> 00:11:55.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:57.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I should be around more people.

168
00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:01.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't let you be the one
person I rely on for help,

00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:03.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and a child should have a community.

170
00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:07.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It will. If you stay.

171
00:12:07.542 --> 00:12:09.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't understand.

172
00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:14.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
These people aren't going
back to Danesti.

176
00:12:21.458 --> 00:12:23.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I could never give my people in Danesti.

177
00:12:23.792 --> 00:12:25.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

179
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:12:45.542 --> 00:12:47.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:48.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:12:48.292 --> 00:12:50.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:22:01.417 --> 00:22:02.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't feel bad

332
00:22:02.667 --> 00:22:05.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
about picking that headman's
pocket this afternoon.

333
00:22:05.167 --> 00:22:06.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, he was a pig.

334
00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:08.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we should do something

335
00:22:08.083 --> 00:22:10.875 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
for the people we took
these clothes from tomorrow.

336
00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:12.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And we will.

337
00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:17.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But after that?

338
00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:21.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Lisa] We can't return to the castle.

339
00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:25.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our poor boy deserves
some closure in his life.

340
00:22:27.292 --> 00:22:29.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Perhaps, one day in the future.

341
00:22:31.792 --> 00:22:32.750 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But not yet.

342
00:22:34.292 --> 00:22:35.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

343
00:22:37.292 --> 00:22:38.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have a thought.

344
00:22:40.333 --> 00:22:41.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a theory?

345
00:22:42.042 --> 00:22:43.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not a theory. Just a thought.

346
00:22:46.292 --> 00:22:47.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think we should travel.

347
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where to?

348
00:22:50.125 --> 00:22:51.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was thinking about England.

349
00:22:52.875 --> 00:22:54.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's a place on the northeast coast

350
00:22:54.417 --> 00:22:56.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
that is supposed to be beautiful.

351
00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:58.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they say the sun barely shines there.

352
00:22:59.792 --> 00:23:02.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
White-by, or Whitby, something like that.

353
00:23:03.125 --> 00:23:05.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remote and lonely, I presume?

354
00:23:06.333 --> 00:23:08.583 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
An abbey. Men and women.

355
00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:11.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And about 20 houses, I've read.

356
00:23:12.208 --> 00:23:14.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sea views. Fish.

357
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fish. How can I resist?

358
00:23:19.667 --> 00:23:21.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not going to get better without you.

359
00:23:23.125 --> 00:23:25.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I was never
going to be better without you.

360
00:23:27.625 --> 00:23:29.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We have a second chance.

361
00:23:31.167 --> 00:23:33.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And a brand-new future.
