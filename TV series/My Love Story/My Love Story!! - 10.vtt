What? You're done?

00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:21.916
We should probably
save some for later.

(Gasp)

00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:25.223
All right!
Let's get moving.

00:09:25.323 --> 00:09:26.759
Need to make some ground
before it gets dark.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.498
Uh. Yeah.
(Meek stumble)

00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:32.972
Huh?
[RINKO]

Hmm.... It's getting pretty hard
to see where we're going here...

00:09:50.306 --> 00:09:52.443
I think it's time that we
set up camp for the night.

00:09:52.544 --> 00:09:53.445
AHH!

00:09:53.546 --> 00:09:55.684

I'm gonna be right
here beside you.

Nope. Still nothing.

That's ridiculous.

Where did those two go?

Does anyone have his number?

No, I wish.
No...

thinking about you, girl?

to go out? I'm free
tomorrow if you want to-

No, no. Please, shut up.

you feeling today?

I take it our boy
still hasn't come back?

Not yet, but don't worry.
I'm sure he'll be
back home soon.

Alrighty.

I guess he'll just have to eat
his dinner for breakfast.
