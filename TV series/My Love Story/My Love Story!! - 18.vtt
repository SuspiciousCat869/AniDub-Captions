00:09:09.552 --> 00:09:11.523
Oh! Maybe so! Ah!

00:09:11.623 --> 00:09:15.264
[TAKEO]
<i>"Small luck" is</i>
<i>enough luck for me.</i>

00:09:15.364 --> 00:09:17.368
Ooh...

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.912
<i>I've never been very lucky</i>
<i>with these sorts of things.</i>

00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:26.987
<i>I hope that everyone will</i>
<i>have a wonderful, super year.</i>

00:09:27.087 --> 00:09:31.696
<i>I hope that my new little</i>
<i>brother or sister will be</i>
<i>healthy and happy.</i>

00:09:31.796 --> 00:09:33.065
<i>And I hope...</i>

00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:37.775
<i>I hope that Ms. Yamato and</i>
<i>I get another year together.</i>

00:09:40.514 --> 00:09:43.587
So, uh, Takeo, I baked
you a birthday cake.

00:09:43.687 --> 00:09:45.958
Is it okay if I
drop by your place?

00:09:46.058 --> 00:09:50.935
Yeah! I haven't really
cleaned up or anything.
You okay with that?

00:09:51.035 --> 00:09:52.170
(Exhale)

00:09:52.271 --> 00:09:53.974
[RINKO]
Yeah.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.115
(Door opens)

00:09:58.216 --> 00:09:59.485
I'm home!

00:09:59.586 --> 00:10:01.323
Wow. Well that was fast.

00:10:01.423 --> 00:10:03.293
Yeah. Ms. Yamato's here!

00:10:03.393 --> 00:10:07.067
Hello, young lady.
Happy new year.

00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:09.339
And a very happy new
year to you too.

00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:12.378
I wish you good luck
and good fortune.

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:14.349
Hm!

00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:16.686
<i>Ah, crap. It's even</i>
<i>worse than I thought.</i>

00:10:16.786 --> 00:10:20.059
Oh, here, let
me help you.

00:10:21.463 --> 00:10:22.965
[BOTH]
Uh!

00:10:28.543 --> 00:10:30.915
Take! Your dad and I
are going to the shrine.

00:10:31.015 --> 00:10:32.752
Then checking out
the New Year's sales.

00:10:32.852 --> 00:10:34.656
And then picking up some
things at the supermarket.

00:10:34.756 --> 00:10:36.560
We won't be back for
about five hours.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.962
Uh, that's a long time.

00:10:38.062 --> 00:10:40.233
You two don't get into
too much trouble!
(Giggle)

00:10:40.334 --> 00:10:41.937
Ahh!

00:10:42.037 --> 00:10:43.974
(Nervous groans)

00:10:44.842 --> 00:10:46.513
You, uh, want
something to drink?!

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:49.051
Huh?! No, it's okay!
I'm alright!

00:10:49.151 --> 00:10:50.554
Hm.

00:10:50.654 --> 00:10:52.223
Uh.

00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:54.562
(Doorbell rings)
(Both gasp)

00:10:54.662 --> 00:10:56.766
Happy New Year! Hey!
Happy New Year, Takeo!

00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:58.169
Here's your birthday present!

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.441
I just got it at the mall!
Cool!

00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:02.545
[YELLOW JACKET] Oh, your
girlfriend's here?
[RED SCARF] I've never met her.

00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:04.582
[BLUE JACKET]
Can we hang for a bit?
Sure!

00:11:04.682 --> 00:11:05.951
Nice to meet you!

00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:07.922
Sorry to just barge in!

00:11:08.022 --> 00:11:09.726
Good to meet you.
I'm Rinko Yamato.

00:11:09.826 --> 00:11:11.463
We all went to the same
elementary school.

00:11:11.563 --> 00:11:12.765
Oh, really?
(Doorbell rings)

00:11:12.865 --> 00:11:14.836
[SWEATERVEST]
Hey, Takeo, you here?!
Huh?

00:11:14.936 --> 00:11:16.306
[GREEN SWEATER]
What's up! Happy birthday, dude!

00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:17.642
[RED SWEATER]
You in your room?!
Yeah!

00:11:17.742 --> 00:11:19.312
Man, it just doesn't
feel like the new year

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:21.549
'til I see Takeo's face.
Totally!

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.689
The fact your birthday's on
New Year's cracks me up!

00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:25.991
Makes the party even bigger!

00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:27.060
(All laugh)

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.397
How did Takeo ask you out?

00:11:28.497 --> 00:11:29.866
They were on the train.

00:11:29.966 --> 00:11:32.103
Takeo saved her from
some creepy groper guy.

00:11:32.203 --> 00:11:34.642
And well, I was the
one who asked him out.

00:11:34.742 --> 00:11:36.078
It was love at first sight!

00:11:36.178 --> 00:11:37.548
(Boys laugh)

00:11:37.648 --> 00:11:39.485
[SWEATERVEST]
I must say, you have
pretty good taste!

00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:41.556
(All shouting happy birthday)

00:11:41.656 --> 00:11:43.927
[BOYS]
See ya, Takeo!
Later!
Bye!

00:11:44.027 --> 00:11:46.533
[TAKEO]
Sorry about that. Those
guys drop by every year.

00:11:46.633 --> 00:11:49.004
[RINKO]
No, it's no problem.

00:11:50.173 --> 00:11:53.079
Oh! Takeo...
Hm?

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:55.351
Here's your present.

00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:57.488
Oh, thanks!

00:11:57.588 --> 00:11:58.991
So, can I open it?

00:11:59.091 --> 00:12:00.661
Of course.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.971
This is the first time
I've ever gotten a stuffed
animal as a present.

00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:10.347
Oh, and if you poke it's tummy,
there's a little surprise.

00:12:10.447 --> 00:12:11.282
(SQUEAK)

00:12:11.383 --> 00:12:13.587
WHUUUUH?!

00:12:13.687 --> 00:12:14.989
(Squeaking)

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:17.093
So, why did Ms. Yamato

00:12:17.193 --> 00:12:19.164
give me a stuffed
teddy bear?

00:12:19.265 --> 00:12:20.934
It's really cute!

00:12:21.035 --> 00:12:21.970
(Giggle)

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.874
I couldn't decide on what
to get you...

00:12:23.974 --> 00:12:26.111
But this was just
so stinkin' cute!

00:12:26.211 --> 00:12:27.581
I couldn't take my eyes off it.

00:12:27.682 --> 00:12:32.023
<i>I see, so it was</i>
<i>because it WAS... cute.</i>

00:12:32.123 --> 00:12:35.063
<i>She gave me something</i>
<i>she really liked.</i>

00:12:35.163 --> 00:12:36.299
(SQUEAK)

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.970
And of course, I also
baked you a cake.

00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:40.974
OOHHH!

00:12:41.075 --> 00:12:44.649
I asked Suna for some
suggestions, and he said
to try making a cheesecake

00:12:44.749 --> 00:12:47.822
like the one I gave you
when we first met.

00:12:47.922 --> 00:12:50.828
I thought about taking it out
when everyone was still here...

00:12:50.928 --> 00:12:55.036
But I wanted to make
sure you got the chance
to really see it first.

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:59.479
Yeah. I am not sharing
this cake with anyone.

00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:01.014
Oh?

00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:06.058
Oh, I've got some candles
in here somewhere as well.

00:13:06.158 --> 00:13:09.097
I think there's a lighter in
the kitchen. I'll go get it.

00:13:09.197 --> 00:13:10.032
I'll be right back.

00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:11.001
Okay!

00:13:11.101 --> 00:13:12.338
(Footsteps receding)

00:13:12.438 --> 00:13:13.874
Ah?

00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:25.998
(Rustling in distance)
(Nervous breathing)

00:13:27.468 --> 00:13:29.204
(Rinko clapping)

00:13:29.305 --> 00:13:32.210
Takeo, happy birthday!

00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:36.453
[TAKEO]
Thanks.
(Rinko giggles)

00:13:36.553 --> 00:13:37.755
<i>She's so pretty...</i>

00:13:37.855 --> 00:13:41.796
(Singing)
Happy birthday to you!

00:13:41.896 --> 00:13:43.533
Happy...

00:13:43.633 --> 00:13:47.608
(Giggle)
Happy birthday to you!

00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:53.687
Happy birthday, dear Takeo!

00:13:54.589 --> 00:13:59.197
Happy birthday to you!

00:14:02.404 --> 00:14:04.909
[TAKEO]
<i>Thank you, Ms. Yamato.</i>

00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:07.948
Okay, Takeo, you have to close
your eyes and make a wish

00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:10.153
before you blow out the candles.

00:14:10.253 --> 00:14:11.623
Oh, alright.

00:14:11.723 --> 00:14:13.393
Take your time.

00:14:13.493 --> 00:14:16.198
Got it. A wish, huh...

00:14:17.768 --> 00:14:20.574
[TAKEO]
<i>I will remember</i>
<i>this night forever.</i>

00:14:20.674 --> 00:14:23.012
<i>The phone call</i>
<i>right at midnight...</i>

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:25.751
<i>The stuffed animal,</i>
<i>the cake...</i>

00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:29.191
<i>I'll never forget any of it.</i>

00:14:32.063 --> 00:14:33.800
<i>My wish...</i>

00:14:36.004 --> 00:14:41.048
<i>is for Ms. Yamato</i>
<i>to keep smiling this</i>
<i>whole year through.</i>

00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:53.707
Ms. Yamato.

00:14:53.807 --> 00:14:55.544
(Nervous shudder)

00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:57.180
Thanks for the cake!

00:14:57.281 --> 00:14:59.418
Hm? Uh?

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:01.121
Can I blow 'em out?

00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:02.958
Uh, sure!

00:15:03.627 --> 00:15:05.129
(Splat)
Uhh...

00:15:05.229 --> 00:15:06.432
All right.

00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:08.737
Oh, I forgot to get
a knife and plates.

00:15:08.837 --> 00:15:10.674
Hang on a sec.

00:15:10.774 --> 00:15:13.613
<i>Did he not even notice?!</i>

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:15.517
(Deflated sigh)

00:15:15.617 --> 00:15:17.220
[YURIKO]
We're back!

00:15:17.321 --> 00:15:18.823
Oh, hey, Mom. Welcome home.

00:15:18.924 --> 00:15:20.861
Uh. Are you planning
on attacking someone?

00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.831
I need to slice a birthday cake!

00:15:22.932 --> 00:15:25.470
[YURIKO]
There's a different
knife for that.

00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:26.906
(Door opens)
Uh!

00:15:27.006 --> 00:15:28.910
Okay, it's time to eat.

00:15:30.046 --> 00:15:33.887
I do not want to mess
this cake up...

00:15:33.987 --> 00:15:36.091
Happy Birthday to me!

00:15:37.361 --> 00:15:40.968
(Gleeful chewing)

00:15:41.068 --> 00:15:42.304
Yummy!

00:15:42.404 --> 00:15:46.279
(Giggle)

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:51.856
<i>I don't think I remember</i>
<i>her cakes ever tasting</i>
<i>this amazing.</i>

00:15:52.658 --> 00:15:54.762
Ms. Yamato, thank you.

00:15:54.862 --> 00:15:57.801
This has been a
very happy birthday.

00:15:57.902 --> 00:16:01.809
Oh. Glad to hear it!

00:16:10.527 --> 00:16:12.831
(Giggle)

00:16:14.034 --> 00:16:15.571
[TAKEO]
<i>I am so happy.</i>

00:16:15.671 --> 00:16:16.906
(Jingle)

00:16:17.006 --> 00:16:18.910
[RINKO]
Takeo, I'm glad I got to
celebrate

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.883
your birthday with you.
Happy birthday.

00:16:21.983 --> 00:16:24.922
And I forgot to say it earlier,
but Happy New Year,

00:16:25.022 --> 00:16:27.461
and my best wishes
for the coming year.

00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:31.201
Takeo, I love you!

00:16:31.302 --> 00:16:35.377
<i>For her, January 1st</i>
<i>isn't New Year's Day.</i>

00:16:35.477 --> 00:16:38.817
<i>It's my birthday.</i>

00:16:38.917 --> 00:16:42.992
<i>She actually almost forgot</i>
<i>that it was New Year's.</i>

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.374
Suna! Happy New Year,
my man!

00:16:50.474 --> 00:16:51.943
Yeah, Happy New Year.

00:16:52.043 --> 00:16:54.482
Here's your birthday
present, Takeo.

00:16:54.582 --> 00:16:56.586
Why thank you.

00:16:56.686 --> 00:16:58.356
Where's your girlfriend?

00:16:58.456 --> 00:17:01.963
I just walked her home.
She got me a stuffed animal!

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:06.706
Uhh... stuffed animal?
I suppose that sounds like her.

00:17:06.806 --> 00:17:08.943
[TAKEO]
Yeah. I think so too.

00:17:09.044 --> 00:17:11.549
She also baked me
a delicious cheesecake.

00:17:11.649 --> 00:17:13.620
It was all cute and perfect.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.024
It's been a great birthday.

00:17:16.124 --> 00:17:18.263
[SUNA]
Good. I'm happy for you.

00:17:18.363 --> 00:17:21.636
She asked me to close
my eyes and make a wish

00:17:21.736 --> 00:17:23.907
before blowing the candles out.

00:17:24.007 --> 00:17:27.080
But while my eyes were closed,
a bug landed on my mouth.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.385
And I was just about
to open my mouth too.

00:17:29.485 --> 00:17:31.622
Man, it was so close.
You don't even know.

00:17:31.723 --> 00:17:33.225
A bug?

00:17:33.326 --> 00:17:34.628
Yeah, it just came
out of nowhere.

Felt pretty big, too.

00:17:36.566 --> 00:17:38.636
It felt kinda soft.

00:17:38.737 --> 00:17:40.474
And it stayed there
for a while...

00:17:40.574 --> 00:17:42.644

saw it on me.

Uh, Takeo...

00:17:49.392 --> 00:17:51.228
she kissed you.

<i>She kissed me.</i>
<i>She kissed meeee.</i>

00:18:03.853 --> 00:18:05.891
It wasn't a bug!

00:18:06.726 --> 00:18:08.228
AAAGGGHHH!

Hey, Takeo, what's wrong?
Is everything alright?

Yeah, I'm here. I'm home

Ms. Yamato, did you...

did you kiss me?

Thank you! It really is
all because of you!

No, no, no.
I didn't do anything.

It was all due to your
incredible sacrifice!

You can pretty much do
it whenever you want.

Is that right?

But won't there be times when
she's not up for it or whatever?

Well, then I'd say
you don't do it.

need to get some practice!

figure it out!
