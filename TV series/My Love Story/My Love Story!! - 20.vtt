Hm?

00:15:23.969 --> 00:15:25.639
Uh, I'll walk you back home.

00:15:25.739 --> 00:15:28.211
Ah um... Well, I'm actually
in a bit of a hurry.

00:15:28.312 --> 00:15:31.016
So you can go on ahead
without me, okay?

00:15:31.116 --> 00:15:33.254
See you later!
It was fun today!

00:15:33.355 --> 00:15:35.091
Bye-bye! Bye, everyone!

00:15:35.191 --> 00:15:36.828
[KOJIMA]
What? Rinko,
you're going home?

00:15:36.928 --> 00:15:39.834
(Group saying goodbyes)

00:15:42.807 --> 00:15:46.046
See ya later, guys.
See ya next time!

00:15:47.015 --> 00:15:51.391
<i>But... but... chocolate?</i>

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.198
<i>I didn't get any chocolate.</i>

00:15:55.299 --> 00:15:57.536
Uh, Takeo, you just
walked into a pole.

00:15:57.637 --> 00:16:00.542
Hey! You need to
get down from there!

00:16:00.643 --> 00:16:02.713

[YURIKO]
Take, Granny Izumi
dropped by and left you your
Valentine's Day chocolate.

(Affirmative groan)

00:16:25.058 --> 00:16:27.162
[TAKEO]
Well that's it.

00:16:27.263 --> 00:16:32.105
Maki, your big brother
didn't get any love
chocolate again this year.

00:16:32.205 --> 00:16:35.946
I thought I was, but
it just didn't happen.

00:16:36.948 --> 00:16:38.685
I can't say I didn't want some.

00:16:38.785 --> 00:16:41.090
(Rinko giggles)
I wanted it more than anything.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.430
Some things just aren't
meant to be, little sister.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.135
[RINKO, FLASHBACK]
Is there, uh, something
wrong with my bag?

00:16:47.235 --> 00:16:51.076
Yes, that's right...
My bag is chocolate brown.

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:53.782
[TAKEO]
<i>I should've just told her.</i>

00:16:53.882 --> 00:16:59.527

00:17:00.763 --> 00:17:02.300
Here you go, Takeo!

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.270
Hmm?

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.208

00:17:10.416 --> 00:17:12.586
<i>It all happened</i>
<i>too fast and casual.</i>

00:17:12.687 --> 00:17:14.490
<i>I didn't realize</i>
<i>what was happening!</i>

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.628
<i>She probably just handed</i>
<i>it out like everybody else</i>

00:17:16.728 --> 00:17:20.201
<i>because she didn't want to</i>
<i>make anyone else feel awkward!</i>

00:17:20.302 --> 00:17:23.040
WAAAUUGGHHH!

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.980
I didn't savor it!
I just scarfed 'em down!

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.917
Take! Quit making so much noise!

00:17:28.017 --> 00:17:30.221
You're gonna wake
up the baby! Good Lord!

YUMMY!
(Crying)

00:17:43.415 --> 00:17:46.287
TAKE!

00:17:46.388 --> 00:17:48.291
<i>I didn't realize what</i>
<i>she was giving me,</i>

00:17:48.392 --> 00:17:50.663
<i>so I never got the chance</i>
<i>to thank her properly.</i>

00:17:50.763 --> 00:17:53.802
[RINKO, FLASHBACK]
I'm sure it uses really
high-grade cacao beans or
something.

00:17:53.902 --> 00:17:58.478
They're all so beautiful,
I always want to just get
them for myself.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:01.418
Oh! Hmm...

00:18:02.787 --> 00:18:06.661
Suna! I want to give Ms. Yamato
some limited edition chocolate!

00:18:06.761 --> 00:18:08.632
Come with me to
the department store!

00:18:08.732 --> 00:18:09.867
Oh, there you are.

00:18:09.967 --> 00:18:11.504
Don't go anywhere!
I'll be right down!

00:18:11.604 --> 00:18:14.644
Uh no! They're closed!
We'll have to go tomorrow-

00:18:14.744 --> 00:18:16.246
[YURIKO]
Take! I told you
to be quiet!

00:18:16.347 --> 00:18:19.019
Yeah. Don't think
he heard me.

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:21.991
<i>Thank you, Ms. Yamato.</i>

00:18:22.593 --> 00:18:24.229
Ah, oh?

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.866
<i>She's here?</i>

00:18:25.966 --> 00:18:28.305
Oh, Takeo! Thank
goodness you came out!

00:18:28.405 --> 00:18:31.945
I wasn't sure how I
was going to hit the
doorbell holding this!

00:18:32.045 --> 00:18:34.617
Here you go.
Your Valentine's chocolate.

00:18:34.717 --> 00:18:38.492
I sorta made it too big,
so I had to remake the
box so it could fit.

00:18:38.592 --> 00:18:42.867
But since it's Valentine's,
I totally wanted to make
something really extravagant.

00:18:42.967 --> 00:18:45.071
I was so excited, that
I kept screwing things up

00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:47.343
and started to panic,
and started over a few times.

00:18:47.443 --> 00:18:49.179
I even messed up
tempering the chocolate,

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.651
and I learned how to do
that back in grade school.

00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:53.455
And I just now finished
decorating it.

00:18:53.555 --> 00:18:56.561
I really didn't think
I'd be able get it done
before the day was over.

00:18:56.661 --> 00:18:58.030
I barely made it in time!

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.337
But you... already gave
me chocolate earlier.

00:19:01.438 --> 00:19:03.040
What? The cookies?

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.877
No, no that was for
everyone in the group.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:08.919
This one is special.
Just for you. (Echo)

00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:16.301
<i>Special chocolate...</i>
<i>Just for me and Ms. Yamato!</i>

Oh, hello there.
Good to see you.

00:19:18.839 --> 00:19:20.742

How's Maki?

00:19:20.843 --> 00:19:22.446

She is. She's taking a bath
with her dad right now.

00:19:25.486 --> 00:19:27.990
I'll drop by again
sometime so I can hold her!
