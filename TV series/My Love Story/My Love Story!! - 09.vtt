00:10:49.924 --> 00:10:52.095
is a treat that most
people don't have, y'know?

00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:54.968
He really cares
about you a lot.

00:10:55.068 --> 00:10:57.339
So, what's Suna doing
today, anyway?

00:10:57.439 --> 00:10:59.476
(Light sigh)

00:11:04.854 --> 00:11:06.523
Suna...

00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:08.829
Well, he's...

00:11:08.929 --> 00:11:12.135
[TAKEO, FLASHBACK]
So, uh, what time does
your dad's surgery start?

00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:16.243
[SUNA]
At 2 o'clock.
Well, good luck.

00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:18.414
(Exhale)

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.459
Uh, Takeo...?

00:11:26.698 --> 00:11:28.367
Huh?

00:11:40.458 --> 00:11:42.028
[TAKEO]
Ms. Yamato...

00:11:42.128 --> 00:11:45.501
Suna and I came up with
a lot of plans for today.

00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:47.539
Here are the tickets.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.779
If you want, you could maybe
invite a friend to go with you.

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:51.981
(Gasp)

00:11:52.082 --> 00:11:54.086
[TAKEO]
I need to go see Suna.

00:11:54.186 --> 00:11:59.563
It's his dad... He's...
having surgery today.

00:11:59.664 --> 00:12:00.531
Huh?!

00:12:00.632 --> 00:12:02.202
It starts at 2 o'clock.

00:12:02.302 --> 00:12:05.475
At the hospital.
He told me not to come, but...

00:12:05.575 --> 00:12:09.383
(Struggling)
But I really need go
and be there for him.

00:12:09.483 --> 00:12:12.790
[SUNA, FLASHBACK]
Alright then. It should be fun.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.629
[TAKEO]
<i>Suna, Please forgive me.</i>

00:12:15.729 --> 00:12:18.434
(Whimpering)

00:12:18.902 --> 00:12:20.338
(Grunt)

00:12:20.438 --> 00:12:22.977
Why did you keep something so
important like this from me?

00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:26.651
Okay, the hospital is on the way
to the train station, right?

00:12:26.751 --> 00:12:28.020
You should really
get going!

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.423
But your birthday...

00:12:29.523 --> 00:12:32.195
I'll take these tickets
and go to the planetarium.

00:12:32.295 --> 00:12:34.099
I'll finish the rest of the day
you guys planned for me

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:35.468
and have a great time.

00:12:35.568 --> 00:12:38.407
Now, hurry up and go be
with Suna! He needs you!

00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:39.777
(Gasp)

00:12:39.877 --> 00:12:42.515
If you're there for him, I'm
sure it'll make him feel better!

00:12:42.615 --> 00:12:44.052
Okay?

00:12:44.152 --> 00:12:45.455
<i>Ms. Yamato...</i>

00:12:45.555 --> 00:12:46.791
Now go! You need to hurry!

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.895
Now get moving, you hear me?!

00:12:50.031 --> 00:12:53.003
I-I got you something.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.606
Ah?

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:56.878
Happy Birthday.

00:13:01.553 --> 00:13:03.224
(Sigh)

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:05.696
Ms. Yamato,
thank you for this!

00:13:05.796 --> 00:13:09.603
(Wind whistles)

00:13:14.847 --> 00:13:19.356
[TAKEO]
<i>Thank you for being</i>
<i>born into this world.</i>

00:13:24.366 --> 00:13:29.944
<i>And thank you for being</i>
<i>a part of my life.</i>

00:13:30.044 --> 00:13:31.580
(Rinko cries)

00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:34.319
(Takeo running quickly)

00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:36.590
[NURSES] AH!
Where is the
operating room?!

00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:37.827
The delivery room's
on three!

00:13:37.927 --> 00:13:39.429
Operating room!
Aah, I'm sorry!

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:42.001
I thought you had
a wife in labor.
(Heaves and grunts)

00:13:46.577 --> 00:13:48.347
Hm?

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.563
Tch.
(Sigh)

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.615
Okay... I had a feeling
you'd probably show up anyway.

00:14:11.895 --> 00:14:14.734
You're a moron, y'know?

00:14:14.834 --> 00:14:16.370
It's your girlfriend's
birthday...

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.209
and you're spending
it with me.

00:14:19.309 --> 00:14:21.681
I thought your uncle was
supposed to be here.

00:14:21.781 --> 00:14:23.384
He had to go to work.

00:14:23.484 --> 00:14:25.254
Is that right?

00:14:25.354 --> 00:14:28.327
[TAKEO]
How long is the surgery
supposed to take?

00:14:29.931 --> 00:14:31.500
I dunno...

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.776
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>Suna really needs.</i>

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:38.581
<i>Or what he could possibly</i>
<i>be thinking right now.</i>

00:14:38.682 --> 00:14:43.692
<i>I'm not even sure if I'm even</i>
<i>helping anything by being here.</i>

00:14:43.792 --> 00:14:45.194
But you're my friend.

00:14:45.294 --> 00:14:47.666
And I WILL stay
by your side.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.603
My dad...

00:14:49.704 --> 00:14:51.473
was born with a weak heart.

00:14:51.573 --> 00:14:52.575
What about you?

00:14:52.676 --> 00:14:53.812
No, just Dad.

00:14:53.912 --> 00:14:55.181
Hmm.

00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:57.953
But back when both me
and my sister were born...

00:14:58.053 --> 00:15:01.059
it was something
he was worried about.

00:15:01.159 --> 00:15:02.997
And when he found out
we were healthy...

00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:06.738
he was so happy
that Mom said he cried.

00:15:06.838 --> 00:15:07.973
Uh, yeah...

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:10.812
So of course,
he spoiled us rotten.

00:15:10.913 --> 00:15:13.785
In his eyes,
we could do no wrong.

00:15:13.885 --> 00:15:15.989
I never saw him angry.

00:15:16.089 --> 00:15:18.193
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

00:15:18.294 --> 00:15:22.435
This is...
it's his second surgery.

00:15:22.535 --> 00:15:24.807
It's riskier than the first one.

00:15:24.907 --> 00:15:29.416
The day he collapsed,
my Mom and my sister were
already on their trip.

00:15:29.516 --> 00:15:32.055
It was just me and him
at the house.

00:15:32.155 --> 00:15:36.998
On the way back from school,
I stopped by the store
for some stuff.

00:15:37.098 --> 00:15:40.404
And when I got home,
I found him.

00:15:40.504 --> 00:15:43.444
He was on the floor.
Dad was all by himself.

00:15:43.544 --> 00:15:46.083
I don't know how long
he'd been there.

00:15:46.183 --> 00:15:48.354
If I had just gotten
home sooner...

00:15:48.454 --> 00:15:50.458
Or not even gone out
at all...

00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:53.597
Maybe... maybe none of this
would've happened to him.

00:15:53.698 --> 00:15:56.771
(Sniffling)

00:15:56.871 --> 00:15:58.440
It's my fault...

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.779
No, it's not.
Don't say that.

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:03.685
No one believes that.

00:16:03.785 --> 00:16:04.887
You think so?

00:16:04.987 --> 00:16:06.356
I know so.

00:16:06.456 --> 00:16:09.062
Your sister, mom, and your
dad don't believe that.

00:16:09.162 --> 00:16:11.634
And I don't either!

00:16:11.734 --> 00:16:13.470
(Whimpering)

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:19.282

<i>It's not that Suna didn't</i>
<i>want to tell me about this...</i>

00:16:32.977 --> 00:16:35.849
<i>He probably just couldn't.</i>

00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:40.993
[DOCTOR]
Okay, about your father.

00:16:41.093 --> 00:16:44.767
We performed a valvuloplasty
to repair an abnormality
in his heart.

00:16:44.867 --> 00:16:47.171
From here, we will be
administering an anticoagulant,

00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:48.842
and if we don't observe
any arrhythmia,

00:16:48.942 --> 00:16:50.111
then we'll be able
to move him t-

00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:51.914
[TAKEO]
Just tell us what happened!

00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:53.952
Did it work?!
Is he okay or what?!

00:16:54.052 --> 00:16:57.660
I-it... was... a success.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.462
(Sigh of relief)

00:16:59.562 --> 00:17:00.799
U-ugh...

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:01.734
BLAH!

00:17:01.834 --> 00:17:02.836
Ugh...

00:17:02.936 --> 00:17:05.041
(Suna laughs)
Huh?

00:17:05.141 --> 00:17:07.980
I think HE might
need surgery now.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.117
[AI] Dad! Dad! Where's
my dad? Is he okay?
[MOTHER] What room is he in?

00:17:10.217 --> 00:17:11.788
Son! Oh my God!
We got here as fast
as we could!

00:17:11.888 --> 00:17:14.694
I'm so sorry we made you
handle this all on your own!

00:17:14.794 --> 00:17:15.696
[SUNA]
It's all okay.

00:17:15.796 --> 00:17:17.031
I'm sorry, Suna!

00:17:17.131 --> 00:17:18.500
It must've been
so hard for you!

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.237
No, I'm fine.
(Sobbing)

00:17:20.338 --> 00:17:22.843
Try to calm down, alright?
Dad's in recovery now.

00:17:22.943 --> 00:17:27.085
Thank God... Oh, Takeo,
thank you so much for
being here with him!

00:17:27.185 --> 00:17:28.387
Sure.

00:17:28.487 --> 00:17:30.624
Mom and I will take care
of things from here.

00:17:30.726 --> 00:17:32.830
You must be exhausted.
You two can go home now.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.468
[MOTHER]
How's my husband?!
It was a success, right?!

00:17:35.568 --> 00:17:37.605

Where is he? What room
is my dad in? Tell me now!

00:17:37.706 --> 00:17:39.710

He's... he's on the...
the second floor...

C'mon, Mom, let's go!
U-uh... BLUH!

00:17:43.985 --> 00:17:45.822
You wanna go?
I do.

Attention, visitors, the waiting
area will be closing soon.

Please gather your belongings
and make transportation
arrangements.

Oh! Ms. Yamato?!

00:17:54.272 --> 00:17:56.410
Takeo. Is everything okay?

00:18:00.017 --> 00:18:02.221
Uh, here.
I didn't have time,

00:18:02.321 --> 00:18:04.492
so I didn't get to
finish the whole thing.

00:18:04.592 --> 00:18:07.900
Thanks. The surgery
seemed to go well.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.173
Really?
Thank goodness!

00:18:11.273 --> 00:18:13.845
That is great news, Suna!

00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:16.450
Uh...

00:18:17.653 --> 00:18:19.723
I went to the planetarium,
but I was too worried,

00:18:19.824 --> 00:18:22.261
so I ended up leaving
and coming here.

00:18:22.361 --> 00:18:24.900
Ms. Yamato, I'm really
sorry about today.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.771
Nuh-uh...

00:18:26.871 --> 00:18:29.409
When I look at this schedule
you guys made for me...

00:18:29.509 --> 00:18:31.948
I can see you put a lot
of time and effort into it.

00:18:32.048 --> 00:18:37.191
And I... and I can see
you changed your mind
a few times, too.

00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:39.496
It really made me
feel special.

00:18:39.596 --> 00:18:44.405
So... thank you so much.
It was so nice.

00:18:44.506 --> 00:18:49.683
And despite everything,
this has been the best
birthday of my entire life!

00:18:50.652 --> 00:18:53.758

(Whimpering)

00:18:58.968 --> 00:19:00.271
Don't worry, Takeo.

00:19:00.371 --> 00:19:03.076
I'm crying because
I'm happy, okay?

00:19:03.177 --> 00:19:04.780
I know.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.951
(Both laugh)

00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:08.387
How sweet.

00:19:08.487 --> 00:19:09.924
[BOTH]
Huh?!

00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:11.326
Uh, I, uh...

00:19:11.426 --> 00:19:13.397
Dude, you want a
girlfriend, don't you?
No.

00:19:13.497 --> 00:19:16.671
Suna, I'd be happy to
introduce you to some
girls from my school.

00:19:16.771 --> 00:19:19.476
No, please, God.
Do not do that.

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.513
You know, long-time friends
are a good way to show

00:19:21.613 --> 00:19:23.417
what kind of person
you're compatible with.

00:19:23.517 --> 00:19:25.287
That's very true.
Ugh...

00:19:25.387 --> 00:19:27.225
So, all we need to
do is go out there

00:19:27.325 --> 00:19:28.962
and find a lovely girl
who's just like Takeo!

00:19:29.062 --> 00:19:32.401
You're so right!
A lovely girl just like me!

00:19:32.502 --> 00:19:34.205

<i>That sounds terrifying.</i>

00:19:34.305 --> 00:19:37.880
It shouldn't be that
hard to find a nice
girl like you, should it?

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.149
And Suna's a nice guy!

00:19:39.249 --> 00:19:40.719
I'm sure that
anybody'll like him!

00:19:40.819 --> 00:19:43.056
Omigosh! Then all of us
can go out on double-dates!

00:19:43.157 --> 00:19:44.860
[TAKEO] (Laugh)
That sounds awesome!

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.697
You two really need
to stop this, okay?

00:19:46.797 --> 00:19:51.072
<i>To live every day with such</i>
<i>romance is a wonderful thing.</i>

00:19:51.173 --> 00:19:53.745
<i>Suna just doesn't know it yet.</i>

00:19:57.118 --> 00:19:59.355
See ya!

00:20:05.034 --> 00:20:07.171
All right. Should
we get going?

00:20:07.271 --> 00:20:08.106
Go where?

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.010
To the booty tree!

00:20:15.287 --> 00:20:16.590
Amazing.

00:20:16.691 --> 00:20:17.926
Sure is.

00:20:18.026 --> 00:20:20.564
You should've brought your
girlfriend out here to see this.

00:20:20.665 --> 00:20:24.773
Yeah, I will.
I'm sure I'll bring her
out here someday.

00:20:24.874 --> 00:20:27.779
Y'know, a while back,
before I moved here...

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.819
I never really
liked the sunset.

00:20:30.919 --> 00:20:32.656
Well, why not?

00:20:32.756 --> 00:20:35.361
[SUNA]
For some reason, it always
made me feel uneasy.

00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:38.768
[TAKEO]
Yeah? Well, it always
kinda reminded me

00:20:38.868 --> 00:20:42.743
it was just about
dinner time.

00:20:42.843 --> 00:20:44.780
Suna! Suna! Look!
Look! Check it out!

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.786
Hm?
It's kinda making
me hungry!

00:20:47.886 --> 00:20:49.188
(Laughs)

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:51.159
You can't eat the sky.

00:20:51.259 --> 00:20:52.930
Suna! Suna! Did you know?

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.967
When the sun sets
behind the mountains,

00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:57.605
it gets REALLY cold outside!

00:21:01.179 --> 00:21:03.083
(Shivering)
You're right...

00:21:03.183 --> 00:21:04.653
Crap, Suna, it's night-time!

00:21:04.753 --> 00:21:06.456
It's a school night,
so we need to be back home!

00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:07.826
And I mean pronto!

00:21:07.926 --> 00:21:09.964
How'd that happen so fast?!
I got dark so fast!

00:21:10.064 --> 00:21:11.266
Crap, Suna!
Crap! Crap!

00:21:11.366 --> 00:21:13.403
[SUNA]
It kinda snuck up on
us, didn't it?

00:21:13.503 --> 00:21:15.074
But, you know...

00:21:15.174 --> 00:21:18.513
Since I started coming here,
I haven't had that feeling.

00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:26.029
It really does get cold
when the sun sets.

00:21:26.129 --> 00:21:27.498
Yeah, it does.

00:21:27.598 --> 00:21:29.068
Let's get outta here.

00:21:29.168 --> 00:21:29.937
Mm.
