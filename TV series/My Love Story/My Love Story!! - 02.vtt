00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.235
<i>There.</i>

00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:21.872
(Phone vibrates)
Huh?!

00:09:21.972 --> 00:09:24.377
[RINKO]
Wonderful! I'm gonna
call you "Takeo."

00:09:24.477 --> 00:09:26.047
If that's okay with you.

00:09:26.147 --> 00:09:29.755

00:09:30.289 --> 00:09:31.491
Uhh...

00:09:31.592 --> 00:09:33.228
Mbrbrbrbrbr!

00:09:33.328 --> 00:09:36.434
<i>Sure. That. Would be.</i>

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:41.779
<i>Just. Fine. Um... Ms. Yamato.</i>

00:09:42.313 --> 00:09:43.248
<i>Send!</i>

00:09:43.348 --> 00:09:44.685
(Sigh)

(Phone vibrates)
(GASP)

00:09:46.722 --> 00:09:51.665
<i>She's a nice girl.</i>
<i>And Suna's a nice guy.</i>

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:54.771
<i>They'll make a good couple.</i>

00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:04.390
(Students chatting)

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.496
[TAKEO]
Right! Let's go!

00:10:07.597 --> 00:10:09.801
[SUNA]
What? I'm coming, too?

00:10:10.603 --> 00:10:12.506
Hey. Uh, hang on...

00:10:12.607 --> 00:10:14.510
This way.
We gotta hurry!

00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:16.214
Why am I going with you?

00:10:16.314 --> 00:10:17.550
Don't worry about it.

00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:20.155
You can just be yourself
and act natural.

00:10:20.255 --> 00:10:22.326
What are you up to?

00:10:23.395 --> 00:10:25.132
Trust me, buddy!

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.403
(Groan)

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.920
Oh!

00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:39.227
(Excited gasp)

00:10:41.632 --> 00:10:43.736
Hm.

00:10:45.172 --> 00:10:46.775
Oh, hello.

00:10:46.876 --> 00:10:48.245
Hey, how's it going?

00:10:48.345 --> 00:10:49.480
Mm.

00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:52.721
<i>This is going to</i>

00:10:55.525 --> 00:10:56.527
(Munching)

00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:57.631
OH!

00:10:57.731 --> 00:10:59.333
(Squealing)

00:10:59.433 --> 00:11:00.703
ASTONISHING!

00:11:00.803 --> 00:11:03.441
I do love some Sachertootoes!

00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:04.678
(Buzzer)

00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:06.147
Hm...

00:11:06.247 --> 00:11:07.651
(Ravenous chewing)

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.621
I've never had a chocolate
cake this delicious

00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:11.124
in my entire freakin' life!

00:11:11.224 --> 00:11:12.694
You might not want
to eat that much.

00:11:12.794 --> 00:11:13.963
You'll get fat.

00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:16.869
Don't worry, it's
all good, I work out.

00:11:16.969 --> 00:11:19.775
You wanna be a lineman?
Or a sumo wrestler?

00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:22.112
<i>Oh, really?</i>

00:11:22.212 --> 00:11:23.381
(Chuckle)

00:11:23.481 --> 00:11:25.553
Sumo, huh?
I'm flattered.

00:11:25.653 --> 00:11:27.657
(Giggles)
Wasn't a compliment.

00:11:27.757 --> 00:11:29.861
I think I'm gonna go
get something to drink.

00:11:29.962 --> 00:11:31.497
Uh... Oh, I'm sorry!

00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:32.834
I probably should've
thought of that.

00:11:32.934 --> 00:11:34.671
Nah you're fine.
Whaddya want?

00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:36.174
I'll get you something.

00:11:36.274 --> 00:11:37.376
I'll go with you...

00:11:37.476 --> 00:11:39.080
I got it.

00:11:40.349 --> 00:11:41.284
Hmm.

00:11:41.384 --> 00:11:43.756
<i>Not bad, Suna.</i>

00:11:43.856 --> 00:11:46.060
<i>Pretty smooth.</i>

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:50.970
Suna's a cool guy,
isn't he?

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.607
Hm?

00:11:52.707 --> 00:11:54.477
I mean, don't you think so?

00:11:54.578 --> 00:11:57.216
Huh? Mm-hmm...

00:11:57.951 --> 00:12:00.489
Yeah, of course you do.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.194
I met him when I was
three years old.

00:12:03.295 --> 00:12:06.200
So I've known him
for over 10 years now.

00:12:06.301 --> 00:12:09.540
And he's always been
a really great guy.

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:14.116
[TAKEO]
Back when we were
in kindergarten,

00:12:14.216 --> 00:12:16.622
I had the leading role
in our school play.

00:12:16.722 --> 00:12:19.293
It was called,
"The Red Ogre Who Cried."

00:12:19.393 --> 00:12:22.466
Goda should be the
big scary Red Ogre.

00:12:22.567 --> 00:12:23.836
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:12:23.936 --> 00:12:26.374
Okay you guys, I'll do it!
I'll do it!

00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:28.211
Rarrgh!

00:12:29.781 --> 00:12:32.687
[TAKEO]
Suna ended up playing
the blue ogre.

00:12:32.787 --> 00:12:34.090
He was a prodigy.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.628
And brought all the moms
in the audience to tears.

00:12:36.729 --> 00:12:37.731
(Sobbing)

00:12:37.831 --> 00:12:39.768
I just kinda acted
like a moron.

00:12:39.868 --> 00:12:42.741
Ooga booga booga...
That boy is big for his age!

00:12:42.841 --> 00:12:44.811
[TAKEO]
And then in the first grade,

00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:47.216
I didn't make it
to the bathroom one time.

00:12:47.316 --> 00:12:50.355
So, I might've
sorta peed my pants.

00:12:50.455 --> 00:12:51.859
(Chuckling)

00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:54.196
(Laughing)
Suna thought it was hilarious.

00:12:54.296 --> 00:12:58.706
But he grabbed a bucket
of water and dumped it
all over both of us.

00:12:58.806 --> 00:13:00.977
So nobody found out.

00:13:01.077 --> 00:13:04.250
And then, there was this field
trip where I got all excited

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.955
and dropped my lunch
on the floor.

00:13:07.056 --> 00:13:09.226
Suna thought that
was pretty funny, too.

00:13:09.326 --> 00:13:10.830
But without even
a second thought,

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.767
he gave me some of his lunch.

00:13:12.867 --> 00:13:14.403
More than half of it!

00:13:15.372 --> 00:13:17.042
Uh-huh.

00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:19.313
<i>Oh man...</i>

00:13:19.413 --> 00:13:22.353
<i>How come every one of</i>
<i>my stories about how great</i>
<i>Suna is...</i>

00:13:22.453 --> 00:13:26.929
<i>are also stories about me</i>
<i>looking like a complete idiot?!</i>

00:13:27.029 --> 00:13:30.268
(Chewing and grunting)

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.640
Um...
Huh?

00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:34.510
Is something wrong?

00:13:34.611 --> 00:13:37.182
Uh... No...

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.220
<i>Get it together!</i>

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.558
<i>You said you were going</i>
<i>to support them.</i>

00:13:41.658 --> 00:13:43.829
<i>So do it.</i>

00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:45.265
Ms. Yamato!

00:13:45.365 --> 00:13:46.167
Yeah?!

00:13:46.267 --> 00:13:48.471
(Grunt)

00:13:48.572 --> 00:13:51.177
Suna likes people who are
fit and health-conscious.

00:13:51.277 --> 00:13:53.816
And so, you know, he IS
interested in girls.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:55.953
Oh... Uh, okay
that's good!

00:13:56.054 --> 00:13:59.026
Yeah. And he doesn't
have a girlfriend!

00:14:00.028 --> 00:14:01.497
<i>Alright. So there's that.</i>

00:14:01.598 --> 00:14:04.571
<i>It's out there.</i>
<i>What else can I do to help?</i>

00:14:04.671 --> 00:14:06.074
(Chomp)

00:14:06.174 --> 00:14:08.144
Hm? I think I just
bit into something

00:14:08.244 --> 00:14:09.346
other than chocolate...

00:14:09.447 --> 00:14:12.252
[RINKO]
Oh, you got the prize!
Hm?

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.691
I put a special prize
inside one of the cakes!

00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:15.893
And you got it!

00:14:15.993 --> 00:14:17.529
(Cheerful laugh)

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.933
A prize?

00:14:19.033 --> 00:14:20.770
Uh... yeah.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.642
It's, uh...
it's a chestnut.

00:14:23.742 --> 00:14:24.611
Yeah?

00:14:24.711 --> 00:14:25.746
Uh-huh.

00:14:25.847 --> 00:14:27.416
I guess you just
get to eat it...

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:28.686
that's about it...

00:14:28.786 --> 00:14:29.755
(Awkward giggle)

00:14:29.855 --> 00:14:33.128
I see. I got the prize.

00:14:34.463 --> 00:14:35.666
I like it!

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.684
Would you... like me
to bake something else?

00:14:44.785 --> 00:14:46.254
Sure.

Oh, you need some money!

00:14:56.474 --> 00:14:59.915
No, no. I mean, you keep baking
things for us, you know?

00:15:00.015 --> 00:15:02.052
I insist! It just wouldn't
really feel right

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:03.823
if I let you pay for me.

00:15:03.923 --> 00:15:04.891
Here.

00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:06.628
Okay, then.

00:15:06.728 --> 00:15:08.298
If it makes you feel better.

Can I text you again sometime?

[RINKO]
Takeo...

00:17:13.114 --> 00:17:14.483
Hurry guys!

00:17:14.584 --> 00:17:17.790
(Sharp inhale)
Get outta here!

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.059
Thanks, man!

00:17:19.159 --> 00:17:20.161
(Rinko gasps)

00:17:20.262 --> 00:17:22.065
(Footsteps receding)

00:17:22.165 --> 00:17:23.869
<i>I see...</i>

00:17:23.969 --> 00:17:28.077
<i>I went for the beam,</i>
<i>and not to her.</i>

00:17:28.177 --> 00:17:30.181
<i>That's why I have no chance.</i>

00:17:30.282 --> 00:17:35.191
<i>That's why I'll</i>
<i>never be the hero.</i>

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.803
<i>Well, that's fine.</i>

00:17:41.805 --> 00:17:45.613
<i>Because at least she's safe.</i>

00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:50.522
<i>That's all...</i>

00:17:51.725 --> 00:17:53.762
<i>That's all that matters.</i>

00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:57.536
[SUNA]
You need to be more careful!

00:17:58.404 --> 00:17:59.440
HUH?!

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.712
Y'know, if this had
fallen on anyone else,

00:18:01.812 --> 00:18:02.847
they'd be dead.

00:18:02.947 --> 00:18:04.851
[WORKER]
Secure the cables! Hurry!

00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:06.655
Suna, you...

00:18:06.755 --> 00:18:07.857
(Straining)

00:18:07.957 --> 00:18:09.159
(GASP)

00:18:09.259 --> 00:18:11.530
I am... actually...

00:18:11.631 --> 00:18:15.372
stronger than...
you'd think I am.

00:18:15.472 --> 00:18:16.808
Uh!

00:18:16.908 --> 00:18:20.215
(Grunting)

00:18:20.315 --> 00:18:23.956
(Roaring)

00:18:24.056 --> 00:18:26.895
(Loud clang)

00:18:26.995 --> 00:18:31.972
(All panting)

00:18:32.072 --> 00:18:33.141
Oh!

00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:35.145
You're bleeding!
Are you okay?

00:18:35.245 --> 00:18:37.784
Hm? Oh, it's
nothing really.

00:18:37.884 --> 00:18:39.253
[RINKO]
Hold it!
Ah!

00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:42.526
Do I have a...
I think I do...

00:18:43.461 --> 00:18:45.833
Yes! There it is!

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.649
(Bubbly twinkle)

00:19:00.028 --> 00:19:01.430
Takeo...

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.639
You always seem to be coming
to my rescue, you know?

00:19:09.914 --> 00:19:12.419
So, thank you.

00:19:13.054 --> 00:19:14.223
Ohh...

00:19:14.323 --> 00:19:15.559
(Light gasp)

00:19:15.659 --> 00:19:17.663
(Giggle)

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:21.738
[Suna]
Takeo.

00:19:21.838 --> 00:19:23.007
Hey.

00:19:23.107 --> 00:19:25.245
Hey, man!

00:19:26.414 --> 00:19:28.451
You walked into
a telephone pole.

00:19:28.551 --> 00:19:29.353
(BONK)

00:19:29.453 --> 00:19:30.990
What are you doing?

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.562
You're uh... stuck.

00:19:33.662 --> 00:19:36.768
(Horn blares)
Whoa! You're gonna
get yourself killed!

00:19:36.868 --> 00:19:40.375
(Incoherent moaning)

00:19:40.876 --> 00:19:42.647
Hey there, Goda.

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:45.786
Mr. Pig-gorilla!

00:19:47.355 --> 00:19:49.561
Yo, stupid face!

00:19:53.201 --> 00:19:54.604
Rinko...

00:19:58.277 --> 00:20:00.048
Those cakes she made us...

00:20:00.148 --> 00:20:02.419
they were really
good, weren't they?

00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:04.557
So you liked 'em, huh?

00:20:04.657 --> 00:20:05.860
I did.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.764
Yeah, me too.

00:20:07.864 --> 00:20:09.500
(Exhale)

00:20:12.707 --> 00:20:14.543
<i>Me too...</i>

00:20:15.278 --> 00:20:23.261
(Phone rings)

00:20:23.361 --> 00:20:26.500
<i>No, I gotta stop.</i>
<i>I need to snap out of it.</i>

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:29.674
<i>I decided that</i>
<i>I would support THEM...</i>

00:20:29.774 --> 00:20:34.016
(Phone continues ringing)
<i>I will help them to be happy.</i>

00:20:34.116 --> 00:20:35.619
(Beep)

00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:37.757
Uh, hello?

00:20:37.857 --> 00:20:39.794
[RINKO]
Oh, Takeo?

00:20:39.894 --> 00:20:40.495
Yeah.

00:20:40.596 --> 00:20:43.067
How's your
cut? Okay?

00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:44.604
It's fine.

00:20:44.704 --> 00:20:46.073
Oh, I'm glad.

00:20:46.173 --> 00:20:48.377
Thank you so much
for helping me today.

00:20:48.478 --> 00:20:50.315
No. Thank you.

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:53.889
Those cakes were so great.
Bake some more any time!

00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:55.058
Sure!

00:20:55.893 --> 00:20:58.899
Oh, you know... um...

00:20:58.999 --> 00:21:00.603
I was thinking,

00:21:00.703 --> 00:21:04.009
maybe we could meet up
without Sunakawa next time?

00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:07.482
You know...
just the two of us?

00:21:07.583 --> 00:21:12.058
Huh? Uh... Okay.
If you want.

00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:13.896
Then... then how
about next weekend?

00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:16.200
We can just meet
in front of the
fountain at the park.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.872
<i>When I think about it,</i>
<i>I haven't asked her</i>
<i>how she feels yet...</i>

00:21:18.972 --> 00:21:23.214
(Inaudible)
[TAKEO]
<i>And now that she's</i>
<i>seen Suna a few times,</i>

00:21:23.314 --> 00:21:26.955
<i>she's bound to be</i>
<i>growing closer to him.</i>

00:21:30.028 --> 00:21:31.798
(Sigh)

00:21:31.898 --> 00:21:35.104
<i>I'm sure she has some</i>
<i>questions.</i>

00:21:36.273 --> 00:21:40.649
<i>I'll see what</i>
<i>I can do to help.</i>
