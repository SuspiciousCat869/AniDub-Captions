00:09:39.883 --> 00:09:42.120
<i>I'll wait until he's</i>
<i>ready to tell me.</i>

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:44.124
Please get
outta my face.

00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:47.398
Now, let's talk about this
schedule you put together
for Rinko's bir-

00:09:47.498 --> 00:09:49.636
[TAKEO]
Yeah, I know.
Awesome, right?

00:09:49.736 --> 00:09:54.111
It looks like the
itinerary for a day in
the life of the President.

00:09:54.212 --> 00:09:55.815
What? You think
it's too much?

00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:58.554
[SUNA]
First of all, six in the
morning's not gonna work.

00:09:58.654 --> 00:10:01.359
Plus, almost everything here
depends on a sunny day.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.995
What'll you do if it rains?

00:10:03.096 --> 00:10:04.532
[TAKEO]
Oh, yeah.

00:10:04.632 --> 00:10:07.739
Also, this doesn't include
any breaks or travel time.

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:11.580
It's wall to wall.
I mean, I'm exhausted just
looking at this list.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.688
Okay, I get it. Guess I
should start over, then.

00:10:15.788 --> 00:10:18.961
[TAKEO]
So, where can you go
even when it's raining?

00:10:19.061 --> 00:10:20.364
Here's a thought:

00:10:20.464 --> 00:10:21.533
What about the place where
we went awhile back

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:23.270
for that festival
after-party?

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.006
They had a bowling
alley and karaoke

00:10:25.106 --> 00:10:26.576
and some other stuff
in there, right?

00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:30.083
(Gasp)
Yeah! I like it!
I'm gonna go with that!

00:10:30.184 --> 00:10:32.155
(Stifled laugh)

00:10:32.255 --> 00:10:33.122
Huh?

00:10:33.223 --> 00:10:35.227
At the party, you...

00:10:35.327 --> 00:10:36.797
(Laughing)
What?

00:10:36.897 --> 00:10:39.034
Your fingers wouldn't fit
in the bowling balls...

00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:41.807
So, you just grabbed 'em and
threw 'em like softballs.

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.677
(Laughing)
I remember something
like that.

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:46.081
The balls just
bounced down the lane.

00:10:46.183 --> 00:10:48.187
Then people started
gathering around...

00:10:48.287 --> 00:10:52.195
And each time you threw
the ball, the whole
place would go nuts...

00:10:52.295 --> 00:10:53.630
You have a really
good memory.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.572
How could I forget
something like that?

00:10:57.672 --> 00:11:01.179
Nobody on Earth bowls
at six in the morning.
They open up at ten.

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:03.317
Right then,
ten o'clock, it is!

00:11:03.417 --> 00:11:05.354
[TAKEO]
Okay, what to do for lunch...

00:11:05.454 --> 00:11:07.425
Beef bowl? Ramen?

00:11:07.525 --> 00:11:10.231
You should probably try a
place with lots of desserts.

00:11:10.331 --> 00:11:12.468
I mean, you know how she is.

00:11:12.568 --> 00:11:15.039
She likes to bake,
so I bet she'd be into that.

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:17.010
Uh, yeah! It's her birthday.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.616
I want her to eat the
best thing she's ever
had in her life.

00:11:19.716 --> 00:11:22.755
How about this place?
They take reservations.

00:11:22.855 --> 00:11:24.993
And it looks like they
have a whole bunch of
stuff on their menu.

00:11:25.093 --> 00:11:28.300
(SNAP)
That's it, Suna!
I'll reserve us a table!

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.905
Can you think of anything
else for us to do?

00:11:31.005 --> 00:11:32.175
Let's see...

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.848
The aquarium, the
planetarium, a movie...

00:11:35.948 --> 00:11:39.121
I think that's about it.
Gives you lots of options.

00:11:39.222 --> 00:11:41.125
I love the planetarium.

00:11:41.226 --> 00:11:43.095
We went there
in elementary school.

00:11:43.197 --> 00:11:44.666
(Laughing)

00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:47.171
I remember... They were
fixing the floor.

00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:49.576
You fell in the hole
and got stuck.

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.546
And when you pulled
yourself out...

00:11:51.646 --> 00:11:54.986
it looked like you were some
creature crawling out of some
subterranean world...

00:11:55.086 --> 00:11:59.094
[TAKEO]
Yeah. You really do have a
memory on you. I'm so glad.

00:11:59.195 --> 00:12:01.933
Ah! Anyway!
The planetarium, it is!

00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:05.140
She absolutely loves the stars.
This is gonna be perfect!

00:12:05.241 --> 00:12:06.743
I can't freakin' wait!

00:12:06.843 --> 00:12:08.180
(Humming)

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.449
(Chuckle)

00:12:09.549 --> 00:12:11.018
You sound excited.

00:12:11.118 --> 00:12:14.592
Huh? Yeah!
It's gonna be great!

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:17.231
Celebrating the birthday
of someone I care about

00:12:17.331 --> 00:12:20.103
is even better than
my own birthday!

00:12:21.406 --> 00:12:23.477
Alright then.
Should be fun.

00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:25.514
Heck yeah! Thanks
for helping!

00:12:25.614 --> 00:12:29.722
Y'know, these are all
places I've been with you.

00:12:29.822 --> 00:12:32.895
Well, it's been like 10 years
since we did any of that.

00:12:32.995 --> 00:12:35.768
That's right. We've been
friends for a long time.

00:12:35.868 --> 00:12:38.005
Oh, by the way...

00:12:38.105 --> 00:12:39.776
What'd ya get her?

00:12:40.277 --> 00:12:41.513
WHAH!

00:12:41.613 --> 00:12:43.450
Holy crap!
I totally forgot!

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.254
It's her birthday!
She's gotta get a present!

00:12:45.354 --> 00:12:46.656
Usually how it works.
Got any money?

00:12:46.756 --> 00:12:48.160
Ugh!
You can borrow some...

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.266
If I use someone else's money,
then it's not from me!

00:12:51.366 --> 00:12:52.535
Then I guess you'll
need a job.

00:12:52.635 --> 00:12:55.507
Yes, that's it! I will
get myself a job!

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.278
(Confident laugh)
Let's see what's out there.

00:12:57.378 --> 00:12:59.916
(Snoring and grumbling)

00:13:00.016 --> 00:13:01.620
Time to get up!

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.359
Huh?

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:07.431
<i>Suna... He looked up</i>
<i>everything for me.</i>

00:13:10.103 --> 00:13:12.808
<i>I'm so lucky to</i>
<i>have you for a friend.</i>

00:13:12.908 --> 00:13:15.648
<i>And thanks to you,</i>
<i>and all your help,</i>

00:13:15.748 --> 00:13:21.459
<i>Ms. Yamato's going to have</i>
<i>the best birthday ever!</i>

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:23.597
(Schoolbell rings)
(Classroom chatter)

00:13:23.697 --> 00:13:25.134
I'm going to head out.

00:13:25.234 --> 00:13:26.670
I don't suppose
you'll say where.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.674
I just gotta make
a stop somewhere.

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:30.277
Then I'll go home
and crash.

00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:32.113
Uh... 'Kay,
I'll see ya!

00:13:32.214 --> 00:13:34.017
[TAKEO]
Thanks, man!

00:13:36.356 --> 00:13:37.658
Suna!

00:13:37.758 --> 00:13:38.694
Hm?

00:13:38.794 --> 00:13:41.933
[TAKEO]
Is everything... alright?

00:13:42.033 --> 00:13:43.537
What do you mean?

00:13:43.637 --> 00:13:45.207
I'm just wondering.

00:13:45.307 --> 00:13:47.411
I'm fine. I promise.

00:13:47.511 --> 00:13:49.515
O-okay.

00:13:50.217 --> 00:13:51.920
<i>He says nothing's wrong.</i>

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.127
<i>I have to take</i>
<i>his word for it.</i>

00:13:55.227 --> 00:13:56.596
[RINKO]
Well, that's good.

00:13:56.696 --> 00:13:59.535
I'm glad to hear that Suna
hasn't been feeling lonely.

00:13:59.636 --> 00:14:01.406
It'll be just the two
of us on your birthday.

00:14:01.506 --> 00:14:03.410
[RINKO]
Mm-hmm!
(Giggle)

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.779
It's just one week away!

00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:07.318
I cannot tell you how
exited I am about this.

00:14:07.418 --> 00:14:08.453
Yeah, me too.

00:14:08.553 --> 00:14:10.591
<i>I'm so happy right now.</i>

00:14:10.691 --> 00:14:13.530
Oh man! It's time for
my job interview.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.267
What? Job interview?

00:14:15.367 --> 00:14:17.471
Your birthday's
gonna be super great!

00:14:17.571 --> 00:14:19.742
What?! But I said I
don't want anything!

00:14:19.842 --> 00:14:23.550
I'm honestly happy with the
fact that you're going to be
spending all day with me!

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.621
I'm serious! That's
all I really want!

00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:27.023
I know you said that!

00:14:27.123 --> 00:14:30.397
But I want to do this!
And it is happening!

00:14:30.497 --> 00:14:32.268
(Shocked gasp)

00:14:32.368 --> 00:14:34.172
(Giggle)
'Kay.

00:14:34.272 --> 00:14:35.607
<i>Ms. Yamato...</i>

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:38.246
<i>I'm so glad I met you.</i>

00:14:38.347 --> 00:14:41.619
[TAKEO, YELLING]
And so, you know, this is a
short-term thing for me.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.690
[MANAGER]
Well, good people
are hard to come by,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.563
so if it works out,
I'd love to keep you on.

00:14:46.663 --> 00:14:48.667
Thanksomuch!
I'll do my best!

00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:50.337
That's what
I like to hear!

00:14:50.437 --> 00:14:52.475
Suna! Got a job today!

00:14:52.575 --> 00:14:54.545
Congratulations.
Doing what?

00:14:54.645 --> 00:14:55.681
[TAKEO]
Look!

00:14:55.781 --> 00:14:57.418
[SUNA]
You sure that's for you?

00:14:57.518 --> 00:14:59.355
Yeah! It's a
pretty small menu.

00:14:59.455 --> 00:15:00.958
I shouldn't have any
trouble memorizing it.

00:15:01.058 --> 00:15:02.828
No, that's not really
what I meant.

00:15:02.928 --> 00:15:04.599
You and Ms. Yamato
should come visit!

00:15:04.699 --> 00:15:08.240
Uh. So you told her
that you were getting a job?

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.575
(Grumble)

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:12.515
I thought you were going
to keep it a secret.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.051
Oh!

00:15:14.152 --> 00:15:15.421
(Vibrating)

00:15:15.521 --> 00:15:17.224
[TAKEO]
Hm?

00:15:20.364 --> 00:15:21.866
Hmmm?

00:15:21.966 --> 00:15:23.069
What's up?

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.505
Uh... Nothing...

00:15:24.605 --> 00:15:27.445
Uh, it's all good.
Okay.

00:15:27.545 --> 00:15:30.150
[TAKEO]
You think you could maybe
help me pick out a present?

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.053
Yeah, sure thing.

00:15:32.154 --> 00:15:33.890
[SUNA]
I'm thinking...

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.429
about some of the
gifts you've picked
out in the past.

00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:38.200
What have
I given you?

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.071
Bugs one year...
and some rocks.

00:15:41.172 --> 00:15:42.875
Hmm...

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:45.046
What do you think
about this one?
Huh?

00:15:45.147 --> 00:15:46.783
[TAKEO]
Uh... a bowl?

00:15:46.883 --> 00:15:50.657
[SUNA]
The other day, she mentioned
liking a café au lait
bowl just like this.

00:15:50.758 --> 00:15:52.661
[RINKO]
Aw, how cute! Look.

00:15:52.762 --> 00:15:56.436
It's Perfect for café au lait!
I so need one of these!

00:15:56.536 --> 00:16:00.844
Okay then...
So, this is what you call
a café au lait bowl...

00:16:00.944 --> 00:16:03.750
[SUNA]
When YOU hold it,
it looks more like a teacup.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.992
[TAKEO]
<i>Suna's so good at paying</i>
<i>attention to people.</i>

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:10.864
<i>and he's always keeping</i>
<i>an eye out for me.</i>

00:16:10.964 --> 00:16:13.770
Oh! Suna, what
about that?

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.841
I think it would
look great on her.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.882
Everything looks
great on her.

00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:24.659
I want to buy this
for Ms. Yamato.

00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:26.362
Looks good to me.

00:16:26.463 --> 00:16:29.902
I don't want anyone
to buy it before I get
my first paycheck.

00:16:30.002 --> 00:16:31.473
I'll see if they can
put it on layaway.

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:32.475
Hm?

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.077
She said it was okay.

00:16:34.178 --> 00:16:36.449
[SUNA]
Well, I'm gonna
get going now.

00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:38.920
[TAKEO]
Yeah! Thanks again, man!

00:16:40.157 --> 00:16:43.095
<i>Ms. Yamato, your birthday</i>
<i>is going to be awesome!</i>

00:16:43.196 --> 00:16:44.332
(Door opens)

00:16:44.432 --> 00:16:45.667
Welcome to Machos!

00:16:45.767 --> 00:16:47.103
Welcome to Machos!

00:16:47.204 --> 00:16:48.707
Welcome to Machos!

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:51.546
Well, look at the guns
on this hunk of meat.

00:16:51.646 --> 00:16:52.681
He must be new.

00:16:52.781 --> 00:16:53.850
Thank you, sir!

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.320
(Customers gawking)

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.723
Here's your protein tea! Enjoy!

00:16:56.823 --> 00:16:59.328
Hey there, sport,
what gym do you go to?

00:16:59.428 --> 00:17:00.564
Your delts are incredible!

00:17:00.664 --> 00:17:03.136
<i>This job's totally</i>

00:17:03.904 --> 00:17:05.307
[TAKEO]
I'm home!

00:17:05.407 --> 00:17:07.110
Mom, are you okay?!

00:17:07.211 --> 00:17:08.713
Take, I'm fine.

00:17:08.813 --> 00:17:11.152
I swear, you're just as
paranoid as your father.

00:17:11.252 --> 00:17:12.721
But, Mom, c'mon...

00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:14.225
[YURIKO]
Don't worry about me.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.364
Oh, I saw your friend Suna
at the hospital.
Hospital?

00:17:17.464 --> 00:17:19.869
[YURIKO]
His father's been
having some problems.

00:17:19.969 --> 00:17:21.539
What? You didn't know?
(Gasp)

00:17:21.639 --> 00:17:23.276
(Grunting)

00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:28.386
Yeah... He wouldn't talk
about that, would he?

00:17:30.457 --> 00:17:31.759
Uh?

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.171
Hey, Takeo. Come on in.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.076
So, where is everyone?

00:17:40.177 --> 00:17:43.483
Oh-uh... Mom and my sister
have been on a trip overseas,

00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:45.086
so they're out.

00:17:45.187 --> 00:17:46.589
And they're in
the mountains, too,

00:17:46.689 --> 00:17:48.260
so I'm having trouble
getting through.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.896
You're here all by yourself?

00:17:49.996 --> 00:17:51.566
[TAKEO]
How's your dad?

00:17:51.666 --> 00:17:52.902
(Grunt)

00:17:53.002 --> 00:17:55.274
Did your mom
tell you?

00:17:57.778 --> 00:18:00.817
He collapsed the other day...
Went to the hospital.

00:18:00.918 --> 00:18:03.055
<i>Oh, God. That's awful.</i>

00:18:03.156 --> 00:18:05.294
He's gonna need
to have surgery...

00:18:05.394 --> 00:18:08.667
So, I asked my uncle
to be there if he could.

00:18:08.767 --> 00:18:12.808
So, when is the surgery?

00:18:12.908 --> 00:18:14.612
[SUNA]
It's June 15th.

00:18:14.712 --> 00:18:15.480
Ah...

00:18:15.581 --> 00:18:17.952
Oh, uh, well...

00:18:18.052 --> 00:18:21.024
Well, my birthday
is June the 15th.

00:18:21.124 --> 00:18:24.298
<i>All kinds of people are born</i>
<i>into this world.</i>

00:18:24.398 --> 00:18:28.540
<i>And eventually...</i>
<i>they're all taken from it.</i>

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.210
[SUNA]
Quite a coincidence, huh.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.383
[TAKEO]
Suna, I'll be there
for the surgery.

00:18:33.483 --> 00:18:34.719
(Slight gasp)

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:36.956
C'mon. You've got birthday
to go to, remember?

00:18:37.056 --> 00:18:38.793
No, Suna! I'm here for you!

00:18:38.893 --> 00:18:40.297
I'll talk to Ms. Yamato!

00:18:40.397 --> 00:18:43.336
You know she'll understand!

00:18:44.405 --> 00:18:46.876
Please don't tell her
about my dad, okay?

00:18:46.976 --> 00:18:50.217
If you do that,
she'll just worry.

00:18:50.317 --> 00:18:52.955
She will understand!

00:18:53.055 --> 00:18:54.792
Listen to me... Okay?

00:18:54.892 --> 00:18:56.696
I'm not going mess up
the first birthday

00:18:56.796 --> 00:18:58.800
you get to spend with
your girlfriend.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.804
It's important.

00:19:00.904 --> 00:19:03.777
I know how much you've been
looking forward to it.

00:19:03.877 --> 00:19:05.414
You're not messing anything up!

00:19:05.514 --> 00:19:06.516
Just stop!

00:19:06.616 --> 00:19:08.052
Uh!

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.958
Don't you get it, man?

00:19:11.058 --> 00:19:13.863
[SUNA]
Look, even if you were to
cancel your plans with her

00:19:13.964 --> 00:19:16.903
and come to the surgery
to be there for me...

00:19:17.003 --> 00:19:20.042
It's not going to make
me feel any better.

00:19:20.143 --> 00:19:23.750
You gotta understand,
this has been coming...

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.358
My dad's been dealing
with this a long time.

00:19:28.226 --> 00:19:31.299
I'm prepared.
For the worst.

00:19:31.399 --> 00:19:36.976
[TAKEO]
<i>Suna's father... has always</i>
<i>been so nice to me.</i>

00:19:37.076 --> 00:19:39.215
[YURIKO]
They're not allowing
any visitors.

00:19:39.315 --> 00:19:42.388
He's always had
these heart problems.

00:19:42.488 --> 00:19:45.627
It must've started when you
were in elementary school...

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.965
Remember that time he fainted?

00:19:48.065 --> 00:19:51.038
I heard it was a pretty
close call back then.

00:19:51.939 --> 00:19:53.510
(Sigh)

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:58.219
<i>Mom, you knew about this, so</i>
<i>why didn't you ever tell me</i>

00:19:58.319 --> 00:20:01.292
<i>You don't have to</i>
<i>treat me like a kid.</i>

00:20:01.392 --> 00:20:04.999
<i>I've known Suna for</i>
<i>over ten years now.</i>

00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:09.275
<i>But there's still so much</i>
<i>I don't know about him...</i>

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.145
<i>I know his birthday.</i>

00:20:11.245 --> 00:20:13.783
<i>I know what kind of</i>
<i>underwear he wears.</i>

00:20:13.883 --> 00:20:17.358
<i>But this... I had no idea.</i>

00:20:17.458 --> 00:20:20.163
<i>I'm so sorry, Suna...</i>

00:20:20.263 --> 00:20:25.207
<i>I wish you weren't having</i>
<i>to go through this.</i>

00:20:35.727 --> 00:20:38.133
Suna! You on your way
to the hospital?

00:20:38.233 --> 00:20:40.102
Uh... Mm...

00:20:40.203 --> 00:20:44.311
Okay. I've decided to respect
your feelings about this.

00:20:44.412 --> 00:20:47.785
So, you don't need to worry!
I'm gonna do what you asked!

(Relieved sigh)

00:20:54.698 --> 00:20:58.440
Thank you. That does make
me feel a little better.

<i>Suna... don't worry.</i>
<i>It's going to be all right.</i>
