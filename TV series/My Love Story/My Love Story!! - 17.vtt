Being all like,
"I love you more."
"No, I love you more!"

00:15:24.096 --> 00:15:26.333
Things don't work out
like that for anybody else!

00:15:26.433 --> 00:15:27.936
That's a fantasy world!

[RINKO]
Takeo...

00:15:46.273 --> 00:15:48.344
I think I made a mistake.

00:15:48.444 --> 00:15:51.083
All I wanted to do was
help Nanako be happy.

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:55.091
Instead, I should have put
more thought into what would
be the best thing for her.

00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:58.497
Yeah, maybe we took things
a little bit too far.

00:16:11.757 --> 00:16:13.861
Guess we should probably
learn how to sit back

00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:16.400
and just let things
happen on their own.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.170
You're right. When
you think about it,

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.710
that's exactly what Suna did
for the two of us, didn't he?

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.381
We'll be like Suna.

00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:25.118

Well, for now,

(Sigh)

00:16:42.552 --> 00:16:45.658
I just freaked out...
I mean, there was no way
I would win in a fight

00:16:45.758 --> 00:16:47.662
against those guys
all by myself.

00:16:47.762 --> 00:16:50.902
I would've gotten pummelled,
and the girls would've still
been in the same trouble.

Rinko, I'm sorry about earlier-

[RINKO]
No, I'm the one who's sorry!

00:17:45.178 --> 00:17:46.680
But, there's something
you should know...

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.117
Kurihara, he's...

What in God's name
is he doing?!

00:17:59.806 --> 00:18:03.214
Well, Kurihara said
that he's going to get
the star off the tree for you!

00:18:03.314 --> 00:18:04.048
Huh?!

And I am going to tell
Nanako that I love her!

00:18:22.085 --> 00:18:25.424
(Gasp)
[KURIHARA]
When Yamato told us
about the star earlier,

00:18:25.525 --> 00:18:27.495
I could see it
in Nanako's eyes!

00:18:27.595 --> 00:18:29.466
I could see that she wanted it.

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:31.937
ARRGH! I tried to
pretend it was nothing.

00:18:32.037 --> 00:18:34.142
But, that's just because I was
afraid.

00:18:34.242 --> 00:18:36.580
Yeah! I may not be
as strong as Takeo,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.018
but I am going to
show the girl I love...

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:42.425
just how much she means to me!

the star! Woohoo!

Mm!

00:19:16.193 --> 00:19:19.031
Nanako, I may not be the
strongest guy in the world.

00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:21.236
Or the bravest.
Or the most handsome.

00:19:21.336 --> 00:19:24.075
But I think I
love you, Nanako.

go out with me?!

honest about my feelings,

and I don't bake any
cakes or anything,

and I'm generally a pretty
difficult person to deal with.

you a little something extra.

The first thing I noticed
about her was her smokin'
hot legs, of course.

00:20:30.608 --> 00:20:34.316
In fact, I totally blurted
it out that day we all
went ice skating...

00:20:34.416 --> 00:20:36.253
It really pissed her off!

00:20:36.353 --> 00:20:38.757
And when she looked at me like
I was the scum of the Earth...

00:20:38.857 --> 00:20:40.695
that's when I fell in love.

Okay...

00:20:41.997 --> 00:20:43.367
So on the train
ride back home,

I didn't want to screw
anything up, so I just rode

the whole way with
my hands in the air.

entire time!

devil, it's Nanako.

Hey, baby! I was just about
to call you, you sweet thing.

00:20:57.996 --> 00:20:59.599
So, you thinking
about me or what?

00:20:59.699 --> 00:21:02.739
Tee-hee, oh I dunno, maybe just
a little bit, like you know...

00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:05.211

00:21:05.311 --> 00:21:06.313
We've lost her.

Guess this is her now.

00:21:07.548 --> 00:21:08.784
It's so unsettling.

[RINKO]
Yeah...

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:12.992
Hey, guys, Osamu just called

00:21:13.093 --> 00:21:14.829
