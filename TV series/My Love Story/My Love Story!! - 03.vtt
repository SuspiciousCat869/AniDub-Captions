00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:49.757
She's nice.

00:09:49.857 --> 00:09:51.160
When she and I
were together,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.930
all she talked about was
how much she likes you.

00:09:53.031 --> 00:09:57.306
Not like all those
other horrible girls
you've been interested in.

00:09:57.406 --> 00:09:58.441
Uh!

00:09:58.541 --> 00:10:01.280
[SUNA]
All those crushes
of yours in the past

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.618
have talked about you
behind your back.

00:10:03.718 --> 00:10:06.023
[YUZUHA]
You know Goda?
I think he likes you!

00:10:06.123 --> 00:10:07.225
[MAO]
Gross!

00:10:07.326 --> 00:10:08.861
[MISAKI]
Look how huge
his head is.

00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:11.067
[KAYOMI]
He's like a big
hairy monster.

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:13.304
[SATO]
Does he have to be
so loud and obnoxious!

00:10:13.404 --> 00:10:15.308
[GIRL]
I always see him
looking at you, Sato!

00:10:15.408 --> 00:10:17.479
He's, like,
seriously creepy!

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:18.915
(All laughing)

00:10:19.016 --> 00:10:20.552
[SUNA]
I mean it.
Your taste in girls

00:10:20.652 --> 00:10:21.721
has been pretty awful.

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.925
OHH! You think so?!

00:10:24.026 --> 00:10:25.395
C'mon, Takeo.

00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:27.666
Nobody should date a girl
who talks crap about them

00:10:27.766 --> 00:10:28.701
to their friends.

00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:30.038
UH!

00:10:30.138 --> 00:10:32.409
So then, is that why...

00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:36.284
<i>He's been rejecting all</i>
<i>those girls this whole time.</i>

00:10:36.384 --> 00:10:37.853
Ngh!

00:10:37.953 --> 00:10:40.191
Suna, you're a real man!

00:10:40.292 --> 00:10:42.796
I'm so sorry I said that
you didn't have balls!

00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:44.099
You totally have balls!

00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:45.702
Yes, yes, I do.

00:10:45.802 --> 00:10:47.306
But still...

00:10:47.406 --> 00:10:50.645
I still can't believe that
she could ever have a crush

00:10:50.745 --> 00:10:52.316
on a guy like me.

00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:54.386
I guess that might be
hard for you to accept

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:56.290
until you could actually
hear it for yourself.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.728
(Knocking)
[SUNA'S MOM]
Excuse me, guys.

00:10:58.828 --> 00:11:00.231
[SUNA]
Yeah, Mom?

00:11:00.332 --> 00:11:02.969
Um, there's a girl named
Rinko here to see you.

00:11:03.071 --> 00:11:05.575
WHA! HRHRHRHRHR!

00:11:05.675 --> 00:11:06.644
You gotta hide!

00:11:06.744 --> 00:11:08.247
Where? Where?!

00:11:08.815 --> 00:11:09.750
Huh?

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.589
(Clambering and crashing)

00:11:15.228 --> 00:11:17.733
[SUNA]
Dude, really...?

00:11:20.605 --> 00:11:21.841
(Door opens)

00:11:21.941 --> 00:11:23.778
Just make yourself
at home.

00:11:23.878 --> 00:11:25.849
Yes, Ma'am.
Thank you so much.

00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:32.295
Hi, Sunakawa.

00:11:32.396 --> 00:11:33.798
Good to see ya.

00:11:33.898 --> 00:11:36.637
Sorry for just showing up
all of a sudden unannounced.

00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:37.639
Have a seat.

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.176
Oh, okay...

00:11:39.843 --> 00:11:42.149
(Bed squeaks)

00:11:43.518 --> 00:11:46.123
Sunakawa, I...
I need to...

00:11:46.223 --> 00:11:48.361
(Whimpering)

00:11:48.461 --> 00:11:50.799
I totally freaked out
in front of Takeo!

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:53.171
I started crying and now
everything's weird!

00:11:53.271 --> 00:11:57.012
Now he's all confused
and frustrated and I
don't know what to do!

00:11:57.112 --> 00:11:58.147
(Whimper)

00:11:58.247 --> 00:11:59.817
Why where you crying?

00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:02.923
For some reason, Takeo kept
making all these suggestions

00:12:03.024 --> 00:12:04.526
that I should be
interested in you.

00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:07.599
I mean, all he could
talk about was you.

00:12:07.699 --> 00:12:10.972
It felt like he was
trying to turn me down
in some roundabout way.

00:12:11.073 --> 00:12:12.509
And it... it hurt.

00:12:12.609 --> 00:12:15.448
So now what?
You giving up?

00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:16.917
Ah!

00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:20.759
No, no! I'm not giving up!
I gotta keep trying!

00:12:20.859 --> 00:12:24.700
I have to, right? I'll never
meet anyone else like Takeo!

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.806
[SUNA]
Yeah. I'd say you're
right about that.

00:12:27.906 --> 00:12:30.545
I don't know what to do,
I think I love him!

00:12:30.645 --> 00:12:32.048
I really do!

00:12:32.149 --> 00:12:33.885
Could you say
that again?

00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:35.255
Huh?

00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:37.159
Repeat what
you just said.

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:39.496
I said I think
I love him, okay?!

00:12:39.596 --> 00:12:40.498
Who again?

00:12:40.598 --> 00:12:43.404
I said I think
I'm in love with Takeo!

00:12:43.504 --> 00:12:46.243
One more time. I really
wanna understand this.

00:12:46.343 --> 00:12:49.583
I am in love with Takeo!

00:12:49.683 --> 00:12:52.389
And just to be clear,
let's hear it once more.

00:12:52.489 --> 00:12:55.829
I... am in love...
with Takeo!

00:12:55.929 --> 00:12:57.666
[SUNA]
Welp. You heard her.

00:12:57.766 --> 00:12:58.568
Huh?

00:12:58.668 --> 00:13:01.373
Come on. Now it's your turn.

00:13:01.941 --> 00:13:03.111
What's that?

00:13:03.211 --> 00:13:04.813
Dude, come out.

00:13:04.913 --> 00:13:07.919
(Ominous rumbling)

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.560
(SLAM)

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:15.969
Ah! Ahh!

00:13:16.904 --> 00:13:19.910
Huh?! What's
going on?!

00:13:20.011 --> 00:13:23.284
Sunakawa! I can't believe
you just did that!

00:13:23.384 --> 00:13:25.822
This big lug-head
wasn't getting it.

00:13:25.922 --> 00:13:27.759
He had to hear it from you.

00:13:28.294 --> 00:13:29.730
(THUMP)

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.435
(Light gasp)

00:13:33.404 --> 00:13:34.873
(Light grunt)

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:43.457
I... I've liked you
since the day we first met!

00:13:43.558 --> 00:13:46.030
And I've liked you
since we first met!

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.835
Ohh!
(Bubbly twinkling)

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.974
Hmm...
(TOOT)

00:14:05.235 --> 00:14:07.038
(Dog barking)

00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:10.545
(Chirping)

00:14:18.928 --> 00:14:20.131
(Comical honk)

00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:21.634
[SUNA]
Um...

00:14:21.734 --> 00:14:24.239
It's from Ms. Yamato
to say thank you.

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:27.546
I seriously cannot thank
you enough, Sunakawa!

00:14:27.646 --> 00:14:29.283
You're more than welcome.

00:14:29.383 --> 00:14:30.685
Oh, y'know what?

00:14:30.785 --> 00:14:33.291
I have this one friend
who's a really nice girl.

00:14:33.391 --> 00:14:34.994
I've got a
picture of her.

00:14:35.094 --> 00:14:38.167
Please do not make any attempts
to share the love with me.

00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:41.006
Suna! Don't say
such sad things!

00:14:41.106 --> 00:14:42.909
I'm not sad, Takeo.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.646
Suna...

00:14:44.746 --> 00:14:48.621
I enjoy seeing you two happy.
It kinda feels good.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.124
Oh...

00:14:52.963 --> 00:14:54.700
Uh!

00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:03.951
Suna... I can't believe that
you really are the blue ogre!

00:15:04.052 --> 00:15:05.388
Where'd that
come from?

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:07.459
That play we did
in kindergarten!

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:10.064
You were the Blue Ogre,
and I was the Red one!

00:15:10.164 --> 00:15:14.106
Your performance made
everyone in the audience
cry like little babies!

00:15:14.206 --> 00:15:15.508
I don't remember.

00:15:15.608 --> 00:15:17.245
Well, I remember!

00:15:17.345 --> 00:15:19.483
Oh yeah, you
mentioned that before.

00:15:19.583 --> 00:15:21.720
What was it about?

00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:24.426
Well...

00:15:24.526 --> 00:15:26.864
Once upon a time,
deep in the mountains,

00:15:26.964 --> 00:15:31.507
there was a kind-hearted red
ogre who lived there all alone.

00:15:31.607 --> 00:15:33.744
The ogre only had but one wish:

00:15:33.844 --> 00:15:35.983
To be friends with
the humans....

00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:39.122
However, the humans
were afraid of him,

00:15:39.222 --> 00:15:41.727
and chose to keep
their distance.

00:15:44.366 --> 00:15:48.574
One day, his friend, the blue
ogre, came to him with an idea.

00:15:48.674 --> 00:15:51.113
He said, "I am going
to attack that village.

00:15:51.213 --> 00:15:54.786
And when I do, you can take me
down and save the day.

00:15:54.886 --> 00:15:58.127
That way, the humans will
finally change how they see you.

00:15:58.227 --> 00:16:00.498
And then, you can be friends."

00:16:00.598 --> 00:16:02.936
And so, the blue ogre
went to the village

00:16:03.037 --> 00:16:06.543
and wreaked as much havoc
as he could without harming
the humans.

00:16:06.644 --> 00:16:09.650
The red ogre pretended to
stop him and beat him up.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:14.092
Then, the blue ogre
hopped up and scurried away.

00:16:16.964 --> 00:16:19.936
(TOOT TOOT)

00:16:20.038 --> 00:16:21.707
From that day forward,

00:16:21.807 --> 00:16:24.246
the villagers completely
trusted the red ogre

00:16:24.346 --> 00:16:26.216
and came to visit him often.

00:16:26.317 --> 00:16:29.323
And in turn, the red ogre,
who now had many friends,

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.995
led a very happy life.

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:38.708
After some time,

00:16:38.808 --> 00:16:41.780
the red ogre became concerned
about his blue companion,

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.653
whom he hadn't seen since
the day of their ruse.

00:16:44.753 --> 00:16:48.494
So, he decided to pay
his old friend a visit.

00:16:53.437 --> 00:16:57.746
Over the mountains
and through the valleys,

00:16:57.846 --> 00:17:01.954
the red ogre finally arrived
at the blue ogre's home...

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.102
But the blue ogre wasn't there.

00:17:09.202 --> 00:17:13.944
He left behind a letter.
He had embarked upon a journey.

00:17:14.046 --> 00:17:17.786
It read: "At last you've
made friends with the humans."

00:17:17.886 --> 00:17:19.923
"But sadly, if you are seen with
me,

00:17:20.024 --> 00:17:24.900
their trust will be broken
and they'll be your friends
no more."

00:17:25.001 --> 00:17:29.876
The blue ogre was gone.
Vanished without a trace.

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:37.425
Oh... So sad!

00:17:37.525 --> 00:17:38.961
Yeah! Isn't it touching?!

00:17:39.062 --> 00:17:40.865
He was so selfless
and wonderful!

00:17:40.965 --> 00:17:44.139
Mm-hmm! I can't believe he gave
up so much for his best friend!

00:17:44.239 --> 00:17:45.374
It breaks my heart!

00:17:45.475 --> 00:17:47.145
Yeah, right?!
The blue ogre is a saint!

00:17:47.245 --> 00:17:47.979
Uh-huh!

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.781
So much integrity!

00:17:48.881 --> 00:17:50.184
Yeah!
Just like Suna!

00:17:50.284 --> 00:17:51.687
Yes!
[Both]
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

00:17:51.787 --> 00:17:55.828
Calm down. That's what any
normal person would do.

00:17:55.928 --> 00:17:57.132
(Gasp)

00:17:57.232 --> 00:18:00.271
Um... I mean the two of
them were friends, right?

00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:01.840
They were best friends.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.277
Uh!

00:18:03.377 --> 00:18:08.354
And, well, everyone likes to see
their friends happy, don't they?

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:10.858
Isn't that what friends do?

00:18:11.493 --> 00:18:13.097
(Both gasp)

00:18:14.232 --> 00:18:16.637
It's not a big deal.

00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:20.244
Mph...

Like brothers, huh?
