00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.976
And then I'll share
them with friends!

00:08:53.077 --> 00:08:54.412
Then everybody
will want one!

00:08:54.512 --> 00:08:57.185
Um... Why would you do
something like that for me?

00:08:57.285 --> 00:09:00.057
Ichinose, this cake is
a wonderful creation,

00:09:00.157 --> 00:09:02.161
and I think the world
needs to see it.

(Echo)
[ICHINOSE]
<i>The world needs to see it....</i>

00:09:05.301 --> 00:09:07.538
Fine. Then we shall put
three on sale tomorrow.

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:10.111
All right! I'll really
put on the hard sell.

You're right. Never
seen that one before.

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:32.822
It's great! I totally
recommend it.

00:09:32.922 --> 00:09:35.728
Okay then.
I'll give it a try.
I'll take one too!

00:09:35.828 --> 00:09:38.100
Ahh! Thank you so much!
You're gonna love it.

So uh...

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:50.791
What was your name again?

00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:52.261
Huh? Rinko Yamato.

00:09:52.362 --> 00:09:53.564
Oh, I only need
your first name.

00:09:53.664 --> 00:09:55.234
Oh. Then just Rinko.

00:09:55.334 --> 00:09:58.774
[SUNA]
I think this may actually
be worse than the bushes.

00:09:58.874 --> 00:10:02.448
I don't want Ms. Yamato to
know that I'm spying on her.

00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:04.185
There she is!

Wha-?! UHH!

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.623
It doesn't have
to be so hard.

00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:59.162
You know that
makes me nervous!

00:10:59.262 --> 00:11:03.370
Imagine how happy she'd be,
if all the sudden you called
her by her first name?

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.205
Huh?

Yeah. The pastry
chef at the shop

threw a gelato
party for us.

A stylish car.
Anyway, he's like
a food genius.

I honestly can't
believe Ichinose

even suggested
something like that.

00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:14.666
[WORKER 2]
And when I see the
way he talks to Rinko,

00:13:14.766 --> 00:13:17.138
it makes me start to think
he's actually a nice person.

I swear that was the first time
I've ever seen him smile!

The ocean could take me.

It could pick me
up and wash me away.

To the sea, I am nothing.

I know exactly what you mean.
But then again, no, not really.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.194
[TAKEO]
I have no one to blame
but myself.

00:13:45.294 --> 00:13:47.899
It is because my own fear
and insecurity

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:50.638
that I can't overcome
something so simple

00:13:50.738 --> 00:13:54.279
as calling the one I love
by her first name.

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:55.481
I feel so small.

00:13:55.581 --> 00:13:57.318
[SUNA]
What your feeling
is normal.

00:13:57.418 --> 00:13:58.687
What you say?!

00:13:58.787 --> 00:14:01.226
It's normal for you to be
feeling like crap

when there's some other guy
hanging around your girlfriend.

00:14:04.499 --> 00:14:06.469
Pfft.
What?

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.440
Never thought I'd say it,

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.313

an ordinary guy after all.

C'mon, Takeo... You don't
need to let this get you down.

She's only known this
guy for like a week.
Huh?

It takes a lot longer than
that for people to fall in love.

Mm-hmm.
And of course anyone
in their right mind

00:14:52.561 --> 00:14:53.930
would love her too!
Mm-hmm.

Mm.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.540
I think what you
need to do now

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.876
is call her
by her first name.

Y'know that gelato yesterday
was a huge success.

00:15:12.601 --> 00:15:14.639
What inspired you to create it?

00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:16.943
I thought about what would make
someone happy.

00:15:17.043 --> 00:15:19.014
Huh?
What would someone
want to experience.

00:15:19.115 --> 00:15:20.884
Ah!
And make them
come back for more.

This is simply wonderful! Super!

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.164
You've had the technique
and the right sense of palette,

00:15:27.264 --> 00:15:29.602
but your approachability has
always been a bit brash.

00:15:29.702 --> 00:15:31.573
This is a splendid
improvement!

00:15:31.673 --> 00:15:33.810
Take a look at this!
I think you're ready to enter.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.716
You could have a good chance of
winning and get some exposure.

00:15:36.816 --> 00:15:39.288
And bring a little bit of extra
attention to the shop too.

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:42.662
Seriously, you've been on a roll
lately. So what do you think?

Huh?

00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:47.003
Pardon me, ma'am!

00:15:47.104 --> 00:15:48.774
(Giggle)
Oh, Takeo!

00:15:48.874 --> 00:15:50.611
You're so silly.
You crack me up.

00:15:50.711 --> 00:15:52.081
<i>She knows this guy?</i>

00:15:52.181 --> 00:15:54.318
Which of these fine
cakes would you recommend?

00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:56.256
What are you doing? Just
order.

00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:58.060
Sorry... I'm just
kinda nervous.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.564
[RINKO]
Well the shortcake
is our best seller.

00:16:00.664 --> 00:16:02.568
[TAKEO]
Well then, one
shortcake, please.

00:16:02.668 --> 00:16:04.572
[RINKO]
But personally,
I'd recommend this one.

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.476
[TAKEO]
All right!
And one of those, too.

00:16:06.576 --> 00:16:08.680
(Laugh)
How many are you
going to buy?

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.584
(Dinging)
Hm.

00:16:11.619 --> 00:16:13.757
Thanks a lot!
Please come again!

00:16:13.857 --> 00:16:16.229
Did you see her?
She was really good.

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:17.698
Yeah.

00:16:19.302 --> 00:16:22.341
[ICHINOSE]
Who were those guys?
Some friends of yours?

00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:24.445
Well, uh... Yeah...

00:16:24.545 --> 00:16:28.820
The bigger of the
two is my boyfriend.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.057
HM!

00:16:34.298 --> 00:16:36.770
Hey! Hey!

00:16:38.907 --> 00:16:40.711
You need to break
up with Rinko!

00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:43.116
She's a much better match with
me than she is with you!

00:16:43.216 --> 00:16:44.786
She's meant for me!

00:16:44.886 --> 00:16:46.189
(Growl)

00:16:46.289 --> 00:16:47.491
Uh... excuse me?

00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:48.994
Uh...

00:16:50.064 --> 00:16:52.668
I'm sorry about that.
That was abrupt.

00:16:52.768 --> 00:16:55.507
Are you an aspiring
pastry chef as well?

00:16:55.607 --> 00:16:58.680
Am I a pastry chef?
Uh, no, I'm not.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.319
Then perhaps you might
be a baking enthusiast?

00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:03.323
I have made a batch
of cookies before.

00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:04.959
Cookies?! What kind?

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.930
Drop, icebox, sable, biscotti,
there are endless varieties!

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.400
They were like rice crackers.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.504
Rice crackers aren't
cookies at all!

00:17:10.604 --> 00:17:12.541
Like I said, I'm a
better match for her!

00:17:12.641 --> 00:17:15.380
Why would Rinko even
date someone like you?!

00:17:15.481 --> 00:17:19.020
She was being groped
by a guy on the bus.
I stopped him and-

00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:19.956
Oh, I get it!

00:17:20.057 --> 00:17:21.226
You helped her
in a time of need

00:17:21.326 --> 00:17:22.394
and she fell for you!

00:17:22.495 --> 00:17:23.864
You made her feel safe
and protected!

00:17:23.964 --> 00:17:26.402
But that's not love!
No, no, no!
That's a mistake!

00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:28.640
She just doesn't know that
there are other guys out there

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.344
who are far better
suited for her!

00:17:30.444 --> 00:17:32.181
Huh!

00:17:34.852 --> 00:17:37.023
My name's Ichinose.

00:17:37.124 --> 00:17:38.493
21 years old.

00:17:38.593 --> 00:17:41.132
I work as a pastry
chef at Les Cerises.

00:17:41.232 --> 00:17:43.737
I'm Takeo Goda.
And I'm in high school.

00:17:43.837 --> 00:17:45.874
High school?!
Certainly there's
someone out there

00:17:45.974 --> 00:17:47.812
better suited for
you as well.

00:17:47.912 --> 00:17:50.751
Someone more on the wild
side, like a gorilla...

00:17:50.851 --> 00:17:53.089
Or a bear
or something.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.260
(Chuckle)
Look, I'm kidding,
of course.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.465
But surely you can find
someone with more in common.

00:17:57.565 --> 00:18:00.471
Someone you can at
least have a normal
conversation with.

00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:04.278
<i>More in common?</i>
<i>A normal conversation?</i>

00:18:04.378 --> 00:18:08.386
Me! I need to have Rinko!
You must break up with her!

00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:12.361
I can't do that.

00:18:14.232 --> 00:18:15.734
No, of course.

00:18:15.834 --> 00:18:18.038
I shouldn't just expect
you to understand.

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:19.642
Why would you?

00:18:19.742 --> 00:18:24.118
But if Rinko wanted to
break up with YOU, you'd
do that for her, yes?

00:18:24.218 --> 00:18:25.420
(Small grunt)

00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.057
[ICHINOSE]
Then I will make it
clear to the both of you

00:18:27.158 --> 00:18:30.230
that I am the
better fit for her.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.801
Rinko Yamato
shall be mine!

00:18:34.372 --> 00:18:38.180
[SUNA]
That might've gone better
if you had said something
back to the guy.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.356
[TAKEO]
Yeah, but... I have to admit,
he did bring up a good point.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.926
Uh!

00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:47.698
We don't really have that
much in common, do we?

00:18:47.798 --> 00:18:50.404
I can't talk to her about
any of that cooking stuff.

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:53.777
[TAKEO]
Maybe there is someone
better for her out there.

00:18:53.877 --> 00:18:55.080
Welcome home!

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.051
[SUNA]
Good to see you.
And you too!

00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:59.055
Oh, whatcha got
there? Cakes?!

00:18:59.155 --> 00:19:00.791
From Les Cerises?
What's the occasion?

00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:03.129
Takeo gave them to me.
What?

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.567
[SUNA]
His girlfriend got a
part-time job there.

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:07.304
Oh! Well that fits,
doesn't it?

00:19:07.404 --> 00:19:09.675
A cake shop is
perfect for her.
(Cheerful humming)

00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:13.350
You know, I think Takeo's
lack of confidence is
worse than I thought.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.921
What?! What do you mean?!
What happened to Takeo?!

00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:18.593
[AI]
It's hard to call it
a lack of confidence

00:19:18.693 --> 00:19:21.232
or an inferiority complex,
but it is worrisome.

00:19:21.332 --> 00:19:24.238
When it comes down
to him trying to
defend himself...

00:19:24.338 --> 00:19:27.611
Takeo does tend to
back off somewhat.

00:19:27.711 --> 00:19:32.388
[AI]
Do you remember when
he found that lost dog
and brought it home?

00:19:32.488 --> 00:19:34.792
He really loved that thing...

00:19:34.892 --> 00:19:37.998
He spent every moment
he had with it.

00:19:38.099 --> 00:19:41.773
But once he realized the dog had
someone who was missing it,

00:19:41.873 --> 00:19:44.679
he desperately started
searching for its owner.

00:19:44.779 --> 00:19:48.687
And when he found them,
Takeo held it all in.

00:19:48.787 --> 00:19:50.624
He didn't cry.

00:19:50.724 --> 00:19:53.129
He just smiled and
let the dog go.

00:19:53.229 --> 00:19:55.334
You remember that?

00:19:55.434 --> 00:19:57.171
[YURIKO]
Those weather men don't
know a damn thing!

00:19:57.271 --> 00:19:59.642
They said it was supposed
to be sunny today.

00:19:59.742 --> 00:20:03.316
(Maki coos)
Aw, and your father left this
morning without an umbrella.

00:20:03.416 --> 00:20:04.919
He'll get soaked.

00:20:05.019 --> 00:20:06.389
[YURIKO]
I guess nobody took an umbrella

00:20:06.489 --> 00:20:08.360
with them today, did they?

00:20:11.966 --> 00:20:14.605
Ugh, it was not
supposed to rain today.

Uh-huh. I'm gonna wait here
'til it calms down a little bit.

Oh thanks.
You're a lifesaver.
Where to?

00:20:24.158 --> 00:20:25.827
I'm fine with
the train station.
(Phone jingles?)

00:20:25.927 --> 00:20:28.133
Oh, my sister's
already on her way.

00:20:28.233 --> 00:20:30.570

be waiting here.

Rinko, I have a favor to ask.

00:20:41.893 --> 00:20:43.229
Yeah?

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.135
You see, I'll be
entering a competition.
Huh?

It's for baking cakes. I'll need

[RINKO]
How fun!

[ICHINOSE]
And, Rinko, I'd like
for you to help me.

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:56.356
Huh?

Please, Rinko!

00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:07.544
Okay! If you really
think I'm good enough!

Takeo puts everyone else
first... before himself...

It's like all he really
wants is to make those
that are around him happy.

That's always been
his greatest strength.
