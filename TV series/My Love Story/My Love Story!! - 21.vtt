at playing dodgeball as well!

the last one left.

And there's no way I can
confess my love to him.

But I've never been brave
enough to write my name...

This Valentine's Day,

make myself sign my name.

So I thought that maybe this
time I could try giving him
the letter personally.

00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:26.997
But, well, I ended up
carrying it around in my
bag for an entire month,

00:08:27.098 --> 00:08:30.037
and never got up the nerve
to actually hand it to him.

00:08:30.137 --> 00:08:32.742
He's always so
calm and handsome.

00:08:32.842 --> 00:08:35.982
And he never does

00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:50.544
He's so smart.

00:08:50.644 --> 00:08:53.717
And whenever he's with you,
I see him laughing a lot.

00:08:53.817 --> 00:08:55.220
It's so unfair...

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.360
I wish I lived next door to him.
I wish was his neighbor.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.697
Then we would've waited
for the bus together.

00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:02.168
And ridden on
the bus together.

00:09:02.268 --> 00:09:03.837
And we could've taken
our baths together.

00:09:03.938 --> 00:09:05.441
We don't
really do that. A-at all.

00:09:05.541 --> 00:09:07.711
(Creepily)
And take cute kid bathtub
pictures together.

00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:09.449
We never did that!

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:13.390
Takeo, I've been jealous
for a very long time.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.127
I see. I'm sorry.

00:09:15.227 --> 00:09:18.467
And well, ya know, without
Suna, I'd be pretty upset.

00:09:18.567 --> 00:09:19.735
Huh?

00:09:19.836 --> 00:09:21.706
He's a pretty cool guy,
isn't he?

00:09:21.806 --> 00:09:24.880
Yes, he is. He's perfect.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.716
He's the ideal man.

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.186
<i>Ideal...</i>

00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:31.326
Look, he may be cool and all,
but he's a normal guy.

00:09:31.426 --> 00:09:32.661
He makes mistakes.

00:09:32.762 --> 00:09:35.200
You might be
glamorizing him a bit.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.736
No, I'm not.

00:09:36.836 --> 00:09:40.377
It's not that the ideal
man is Sunakawa,

00:09:40.477 --> 00:09:44.887
but that Sunakawa has shown
me what the ideal man is.

00:09:44.987 --> 00:09:45.922
Hmm...

AHH!

00:09:47.558 --> 00:09:48.360
What's going on?

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.228
Um, well...

00:09:53.737 --> 00:09:54.839
You going home?

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.743
Oh yeah, of course!
Let's get going.

00:09:56.843 --> 00:09:59.415
You have some
big feet.

00:10:00.384 --> 00:10:02.188
[YURIKO]
Take! How old do you have to get

00:10:02.288 --> 00:10:05.294
before you stop coming home
with filthy clothes?

00:10:05.394 --> 00:10:09.235
[YUKIKA, FLASHBACK]
It's not that the
ideal man is Sunakawa,

00:10:09.335 --> 00:10:12.976
but that Sunakawa has shown
me what the ideal man is.

00:10:13.076 --> 00:10:15.080
COMING IN!
Is there something wrong?

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.351
No, nothing at all.

00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:22.361
<i>Oh my God.</i>
<i>She's always there.</i>

00:10:23.898 --> 00:10:26.102
Hey, Suna,
so I've been thinking...

00:10:26.202 --> 00:10:28.440
Everyone has like a
big fire inside of them

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.879
just burning deep down
in their hearts.

00:10:30.979 --> 00:10:34.218
But then they go each day not
ever showing it to anybody else.

00:10:34.318 --> 00:10:37.491
Walkin' around hiding it,
like it's not even there.

00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:42.134
Well, I don't know if I'd
say that about EVERYONE.

00:10:43.938 --> 00:10:46.209
Thanks. Good talk.

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:47.678
Hm?

00:10:47.778 --> 00:10:49.649
[YUKIKA]
Takeo!
Huh?

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:51.987
<i>She's out in the open</i>
<i>like a normal person.</i>

00:10:52.087 --> 00:10:53.958
I thought about
what you said...

00:10:54.058 --> 00:10:55.494
Even though I'm scared,

00:10:55.594 --> 00:10:58.533
I think I'm going to try talking
to Sunakawa after all...

00:10:58.633 --> 00:10:59.669
[TAKEO]
Alright!

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:00.737
And I'd like...

00:11:00.837 --> 00:11:02.741
for you to help me.
Sure!

00:11:02.841 --> 00:11:06.416
I've thought of a way where
I can enter into a totally
normal conversation with him

00:11:06.516 --> 00:11:09.455
in a totally normal,
not-awkward way.
Cool!

00:11:09.555 --> 00:11:11.961
So I'm thinking that
maybe you've gotten
yourself lost somewhere,

00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:14.967
and I can come along and point
you in the right direction.

00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:16.035
[TAKEO]
Okay...

00:11:16.135 --> 00:11:17.605
<i>Seems a little unnecessary.</i>

00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:20.277
I don't have the courage
to tell him how I feel.

00:11:20.377 --> 00:11:23.216
But it's at least a way
for me to be close to him,

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:25.754
and for him to
associate with me.

00:11:25.855 --> 00:11:29.195
You know, our worlds have
been so close for so long,

00:11:29.295 --> 00:11:32.334
but they've never
really crossed paths.

00:11:32.434 --> 00:11:36.009
They will now. Should we
try to do it this evening?

00:11:36.109 --> 00:11:37.411
(Affirmative grunt)

00:11:37.511 --> 00:11:39.181
[TAKEO]
Suna goes to the
convenience store

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.419
about once every three days.

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:43.223
Yes, I know.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.160
Suna!
Hm?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.866
I totally got lost back
at the train station.

00:11:47.966 --> 00:11:50.304
And this nice young lady
here assisted me.

00:11:50.404 --> 00:11:53.043
What a nice,
kind lady-person!

00:11:53.143 --> 00:11:55.982
That lady-person...
is Yukika Amami.

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.217
(Slow gasp)

00:11:57.318 --> 00:11:58.888
We've been in school
since kindergarten.

00:11:58.988 --> 00:12:00.824
O-oh, uh, yeah.

00:12:00.925 --> 00:12:01.826
I love you.

00:12:01.927 --> 00:12:03.096
Uh?
Hm?

00:12:03.196 --> 00:12:04.665
I love you, Sunakawa!

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:07.237
And the only thing I want
in this whole world

00:12:07.338 --> 00:12:09.742
is for you to love me back!

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:13.817
Ah...

00:12:14.853 --> 00:12:16.389
(Whimper)

00:12:16.489 --> 00:12:17.959
Hey! Wait!

00:12:18.059 --> 00:12:20.063
(Sigh)

00:12:22.468 --> 00:12:24.205
[SUNA]
Oh.

00:12:26.609 --> 00:12:28.780
(Heavy footsteps)
<i>That wasn't the plan!</i>

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:31.185

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.631
Look out! HAARGH!

00:12:37.731 --> 00:12:39.602
EEEK!

00:12:39.702 --> 00:12:43.243
Don't do that! I thought
you were gonna freakin' fall
off the freakin' bridge!

00:12:43.343 --> 00:12:46.316
I wish I had fallen...

00:12:46.416 --> 00:12:49.689
I wish I'd fallen and cracked
my head on the street below!

00:12:49.789 --> 00:12:51.125
This bridge is over a river!

00:12:51.225 --> 00:12:53.196
Oh my God, I didn't
mean to tell him that.

00:12:53.296 --> 00:12:54.900
Yeah, that was kind
of a surprise.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.406
I had no idea that Sunakawa was
going to remember who I was

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:03.951
But then when he said my name
and I couldn't control myself
and I just blurted it out.

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:05.554
It's gonna be okay...

00:13:05.654 --> 00:13:08.059
But what's done is
done, you understand?

00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:10.898
Maybe there's a way
to erase all of his
memories or something.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:13.737
I don't think so.
Or make him think it
was all just a dream.

00:13:13.837 --> 00:13:15.240
Not gonna happen!

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.979
Yukika, that can't be how
you wanted to tell him.

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:21.386
I mean, don't you want
to at least tell him
in the right way?

00:13:21.486 --> 00:13:23.423
[TAKEO]
Think about it.

00:13:23.523 --> 00:13:27.431
Did that really get across how
you've been feeling about Suna
for the past ten years?

Don't let that be it!

Yeah, but...

00:13:32.808 --> 00:13:35.247
I've been following
him around. It's creepy.

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:36.783
I'm a stalker for God's sake!

00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:39.655
He is never going to
say something like that.

00:13:39.755 --> 00:13:41.359
(Sniffle)

00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:44.699
I'll do it. I'll properly
tell him how I feel...

00:13:44.799 --> 00:13:49.943
I'll tell him properly, so he
can properly turn me down...

00:13:50.043 --> 00:13:52.481
and it'll be over.

00:13:54.752 --> 00:13:55.620

you had signed it,

you don't answer that question?
We'll table it for later.

Well, I just remembered how
you used to play dodgeball.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:06.782
How's that?

00:16:06.884 --> 00:16:08.386
Well, you... you always
went right after

00:16:08.486 --> 00:16:10.557
the strongest player,
and no one else.

00:16:10.657 --> 00:16:13.898
(Kids grunting)
You always ended up in a hurling
match between just two people.

00:16:13.998 --> 00:16:16.135
Even if the other guy targeted
some other player,

00:16:16.235 --> 00:16:18.173
you'd come flying
in from the side.

00:16:18.273 --> 00:16:20.177
(Kids chanting)
To be honest, I don't think you
were playing the same game

00:16:20.277 --> 00:16:21.345
as the rest of us.

00:16:21.445 --> 00:16:22.982
I used to do
stuff like that?

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:24.953
Yes you did, man,
all the time.

00:16:25.053 --> 00:16:26.656

She's here!
(Beeping)

00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:50.905
Takeo?
No, don't worry, Suna.
It's nothing.

(Beeping)

00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:56.816

say hello or what?
AH! (Whimper)

<i>All right, Yukika!</i>
<i>He's headed your way!</i>

00:17:09.108 --> 00:17:10.143
AHH!

(Beeping)

00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:16.055
Pardon me, Suna, but
wait here for a second.

00:17:16.155 --> 00:17:16.890
Sure...

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.128
<i>Yu-ki-ka!</i>

00:17:19.228 --> 00:17:21.198
There you are!
AHHHH!

00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:23.403
Stop doing this!
What are you doing?

00:17:23.503 --> 00:17:25.674
I thought you wanted Suna
to learn more about you!

00:17:25.774 --> 00:17:26.642
I'm sorry!

00:17:26.742 --> 00:17:29.014
Then do it! Go show
him who you are!

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:30.717
O-okay!

00:17:30.817 --> 00:17:31.887
Suna!

00:17:31.987 --> 00:17:34.425
Here's Yukika. You
need to walk her home!

00:17:34.525 --> 00:17:36.863
Oh, sure.

00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:43.176
So, Yukika, do you
live over this way?

00:17:43.276 --> 00:17:44.879
Uh, yes...

00:17:45.614 --> 00:17:47.618
<i>Best of luck.</i>

00:17:47.718 --> 00:17:49.990
<i>I hope you can tell him.</i>

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.559
Hm?

[TAKEO]
<i>You don't have to stay</i>

00:17:53.763 --> 00:17:56.769
Yukika, we still headed
in the right direction?

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:57.838
Uh, yeah...

00:17:57.939 --> 00:18:00.043
<i>Hm... He's walking</i>
<i>a lot slower</i>

00:18:00.143 --> 00:18:02.414
<i>than we normally do.</i>

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:06.289
I have to take the train
from here. How about you?

00:18:06.389 --> 00:18:08.092
No, I don't...

00:18:08.192 --> 00:18:09.795
Kay, then I'll see ya...

00:18:10.163 --> 00:18:11.666
See ya.

00:18:13.269 --> 00:18:15.273
Hey! I thought you were
gonna give him the chance

00:18:15.373 --> 00:18:18.479
to learn more about you.

00:18:18.579 --> 00:18:20.550
I-I'm sorry! ,/
Uh... I was having
a hard enough time

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.989
just breathing
next to him.

00:18:23.089 --> 00:18:24.491
Sunakawa was...

00:18:24.591 --> 00:18:28.833
THE Sunakawa was standing next
to me and talking to me!

00:18:28.934 --> 00:18:29.601
Sunakawa...

00:18:29.702 --> 00:18:30.938
What?! Snap out of it!

00:18:31.038 --> 00:18:32.240
(Phone rings)
Oh?

00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:33.609
[RINKO]
Takeo? It's me.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.013
Where are you right now?

00:18:35.113 --> 00:18:36.515
I'm out at Shuei Station.

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:38.786
Really? What are
you doing there?

00:18:38.887 --> 00:18:40.190
Well- AHH!

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.260
Hang on just a second.
Sure.

00:18:42.361 --> 00:18:45.333
Hey, uh, I need to explain
the situation to Ms. Yamato.

00:18:45.433 --> 00:18:48.439
I'm not good at lying or keeping
secrets and stuff like that.

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:50.143
And I'm not gonna start now.

00:18:50.243 --> 00:18:51.445
(Gasp)

00:18:51.545 --> 00:18:53.316
Yes, of course!
Please tell her!

00:18:53.416 --> 00:18:54.585
Alright! Thanks!

Here's the deal.

00:18:55.955 --> 00:18:57.859
Right now, I'm helping
a girl named Yukika

00:18:57.959 --> 00:18:59.762
who is secretly
in love with Suna.

00:18:59.863 --> 00:19:03.736
[RINKO]
Oh, okay. But, um, should
you be telling me this?

00:19:03.836 --> 00:19:06.308
If she would, I'd
really like her advice.

00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:09.748
(Inaudible)

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:12.554
Yukika, ten years is
a really long time!

00:19:12.654 --> 00:19:14.859
Yeah, but the way
things were going

00:19:14.959 --> 00:19:16.863
I thought now she'd be
able to talk to him.

00:19:16.963 --> 00:19:19.168
But it's not really
working out that way.

00:19:19.268 --> 00:19:20.603
It's just impossible.

00:19:20.704 --> 00:19:23.209
Every time I open my mouth,
I think I'm gonna puke.

00:19:23.309 --> 00:19:24.712
Oh, I know what you mean!

00:19:24.812 --> 00:19:26.582
When I first met Takeo,
I got so nervous

00:19:26.682 --> 00:19:29.288
I didn't even know
what to do with myself!

00:19:29.388 --> 00:19:31.893
I just stood outside his front
door for the longest time

00:19:31.993 --> 00:19:34.298
because I couldn't bring
myself to ring the doorbell.

00:19:34.398 --> 00:19:37.003
And when I called him
on the phone, my heart
was pounding so hard

00:19:37.104 --> 00:19:39.208
I had trouble hitting
the right buttons!

00:19:39.308 --> 00:19:40.510
(Laughing)

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.917
[TAKEO]
<i>Is that true? I had no idea.</i>

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:51.298
<i>I was a complete wreck, myself.</i>
<i>I can't believe how lucky I am.</i>

00:19:56.809 --> 00:20:00.350
When you're having trouble
talking about something,
try smiling or laughing!

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.156
I'm not what you'd
call a big laugher.

00:20:03.256 --> 00:20:05.627
Then what about writing
or maybe texting him?

00:20:05.727 --> 00:20:08.499
Yeah well, I've only
done that anonymously.

00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:10.236
Okay...

00:20:10.336 --> 00:20:12.841
Let's see.
What could you do?

00:20:12.942 --> 00:20:15.814
Maybe the two of them just need
to go out somewhere together.

00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:17.584
I mean, it's fun to
go see new things

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:18.954
with the people you like, right?

00:20:19.054 --> 00:20:21.292
That's it!
You nailed it, Takeo!

00:20:21.392 --> 00:20:23.663
Actually going out
with Sunakawa?!

00:20:23.763 --> 00:20:26.068
Coming in! Did you get
a text from anyone?

00:20:26.168 --> 00:20:28.539
Uh. Uh, no...
(Phone vibrates)

00:20:28.639 --> 00:20:30.243

Would you like to go
to the zoo sometime?

00:20:36.689 --> 00:20:39.128
We can go with Mr. Goda
and Ms. Yamato.

please let me know what

to go to the
zoo with us.

Oh yeah? Yeah, sure thing!

00:20:54.057 --> 00:20:54.959
You knew, huh?

Hmm?!

Well, whatever.

all go together.

If you don't want
to do any of this...
