[YUKIKA]
I am here in town to buy some
clothes, but I'm having some
difficulty deciding.

00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:11.976
If you happen to have some time,
I would greatly appreciate
your help.

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:13.078
Sorry for
making you wait!

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:14.849
No, no. Thank
you for coming!

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.284
You're going
out on a date!

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:18.055
Of course you want
to look your best.

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:20.694
I do! But I have no idea
where to even begin.

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:23.065
You want him to think
you're super cute, right?

00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:25.302
I want him to fall
madly in love with me!

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:27.875
But I don't know what sort
of clothes will make Sunakawa

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:29.945
lose his mind and
love me forever!

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:31.883
This really isn't
my strong suit.

Let's try asking his
best friend then!

Ah!
(Phone jingles)

00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:37.394
Suna, I got a question for ya.

00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:39.732
What kind of clothes do
you like seeing on girls?

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:41.402
What kind of
question is that?

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:43.338
[SUNA]
Well, I don't know.
Anything's fine.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.412
Something normal.
As long as it fits the
person who's wearing it.

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:50.319
[TAKEO]
Hmm. Normal clothes...
So traditional Japanese robes!

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.491
[SUNA]
That's not what I said.
But that would probably be fine.

00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:56.899
[TAKEO]
Okay. Anything that
looks good on anyone.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.703
I'll wear my
school uniform!

00:00:58.803 --> 00:01:02.310
I'm pretty sure it means
that you can wear

[SUNA]
Uh, sure.

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:06.626
[YUKIKA]
There's a reason why
I wanted to go the zoo.

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:10.667
It's because a long time
ago we had a field trip
in grade school...

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:12.804
And while we were on the tour,
Sunakawa asked

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:16.712
why in Japanese we call
a giraffe "kirin" instead
of just giraffe.

00:03:16.812 --> 00:03:21.656
But nobody knew the answer,
so the conversation just sorta
died right there.

00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:24.595
Well I knew the answer. And
I wanted to tell everybody

00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:27.734
that it originates from a
mythical creature in China.

00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:31.943
But you know...
Of course I couldn't find
the courage to speak up.

00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:35.015
That's why we're here.
I want to make some new
better memories at the zoo.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.186
[GIRLS] So can we, like,
take a picture with you?
[SUNA] Why not?

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:39.892
You need to tell that
to Suna, not me!

00:03:39.992 --> 00:03:41.294
Right! I know!

00:03:41.395 --> 00:03:44.267
[YUKIKA]
When I... When I
really think about it...

00:03:44.368 --> 00:03:46.939
The time when Sunakawa protected
me from the dodgeball

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.710
was the "prime time"
of my life.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.014
I'm not sure I've ever
heard of "price time."

No, PRIME time. The peak
of my existence.

[SUNA]
Yeah. I hadn't been
there in a long time.

00:08:47.974 --> 00:08:50.413
Well, see you at school.

00:08:54.922 --> 00:08:57.494
You got to talk to him.
I'm so happy for you!

00:08:57.594 --> 00:08:59.865
It was like a dream...

00:08:59.965 --> 00:09:01.936
Well, it wasn't a dream.
It was real life!

00:09:02.036 --> 00:09:05.342
[TAKEO]
<i>And it all happened because</i>
<i>you got up the courage.</i>

00:09:05.443 --> 00:09:07.614
Oh my gosh.
Today was by far

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.319
the happiest day
of my entire life.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.989
You have a new
"slime time"!

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:13.759
"Prime time," Takeo.
Uh!

00:09:13.859 --> 00:09:17.634
[YUKIKA]
Today, I got to hang out
and talk with Sunakawa.

00:09:17.734 --> 00:09:20.205
We didn't even talk
about anything important.

00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:21.675
Just small stuff.

00:09:21.775 --> 00:09:23.546
We just talked.
Back and forth.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.015
He smiled and laughed.

00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:28.456
It was nothing, but
EVERYTHING at the same time.

00:09:28.556 --> 00:09:30.125
(Content sigh)

00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:31.695
And that's all...

00:09:31.795 --> 00:09:35.135
That's all I've ever wanted
to do this whole time.

00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:40.613
<i>She did it.</i>
<i>She really did it.</i>

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:42.884
<i>It doesn't always take much.</i>

00:09:42.984 --> 00:09:45.823
<i>Just talking to someone,</i>
<i>and being with them.</i>

00:09:45.923 --> 00:09:48.328
<i>Sometimes that's all</i>
<i>a person needs.</i>

00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:51.000
<i>Because when you're</i>
<i>with the right person,</i>

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.775
<i>those can be some of</i>
<i>the best times of all.</i>

00:09:55.943 --> 00:10:00.987
<i>Whoa! They're talking</i>
<i>to each other! AT SCHOOL!</i>

00:10:03.492 --> 00:10:04.895
(Sigh)

00:10:04.995 --> 00:10:06.498
Huh?

00:10:10.038 --> 00:10:10.907
(Yukika crying)

00:10:11.007 --> 00:10:13.178
Yukika! What's wrong?
What happened?

00:10:13.278 --> 00:10:14.548
Everything alright?

00:10:14.648 --> 00:10:16.084
Hey, what's the matter, guys?
Why is she crying?

00:10:16.184 --> 00:10:18.389
[KAKITANI] Are you okay?
Give the girl some space!

00:10:18.489 --> 00:10:20.225
[SUNA]
What happened?
What did Suna say to you?

00:10:20.325 --> 00:10:24.133
No. Nothing. Sunakawa has
been nothing but kind to me.

00:10:24.233 --> 00:10:26.772
He is a very kind
person, you know?

00:10:26.872 --> 00:10:27.841
Oh?

00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:30.613
He's kind, so he
went to the zoo.

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:32.282
He's kind, so he
laughed with me.

00:10:32.384 --> 00:10:34.755
He's kind, so he entered
the contest...

00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:40.600
He's so kind and caring
that it's not like he doesn't
like me or anything...

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.069
(Sniffle)
But that...

00:10:42.169 --> 00:10:44.006
But that doesn't mean
that he likes me.

00:10:44.106 --> 00:10:47.414
He's just nice to me...
because he's kind.

00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:49.918
[SUNA, FLASHBACK]
No. Yukika, I don't hate you.

00:10:50.018 --> 00:10:51.588
If I didn't want to,
I wouldn't go.

00:10:51.689 --> 00:10:53.091
[TAKEO]
<i>When I think back,</i>

00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:55.897
<i>Suna kinda chose his words</i>
<i>carefully, didn't he?</i>

00:10:55.997 --> 00:10:58.502
<i>It's not that he doesn't like</i>
<i>her or anything,</i>

00:10:58.602 --> 00:11:01.007
<i>but he doesn't</i>
<i>like-like her either.</i>

00:11:01.107 --> 00:11:06.284
Every night, I lay back
in bed and wonder what
Sunakawa might be doing.

00:11:06.385 --> 00:11:08.789
And I,
from time to time,

00:11:08.889 --> 00:11:11.662
I get these urges where I just
want to see his face.

00:11:11.762 --> 00:11:14.333
I want to bump
into him. Anywhere.

00:11:14.434 --> 00:11:15.937
But...

00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:20.546
But Sunakawa doesn't think
of me in that way at all.

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:24.721
You can just sense stuff
like that, you know?

00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:27.360
I'm sorry.
I couldn't tell.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.865
Yeah, well, you're
not in my shoes.

00:11:29.965 --> 00:11:32.002
The difference between
how I feel about him

00:11:32.102 --> 00:11:35.342
and how he feels about me
is heartbreaking.

00:11:35.443 --> 00:11:36.645
I'm ready to give up.

00:11:36.745 --> 00:11:38.682
Hmm...
(Sob)

00:11:38.783 --> 00:11:40.653
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

00:11:40.753 --> 00:11:42.991
And please tell
Sunakawa the same.

00:11:43.091 --> 00:11:45.897
I wish I had never
told him how I felt.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.132
(Gasp)

00:11:47.232 --> 00:11:48.469
[TAKEO]
Hey!

00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:50.205
<i>She's right.</i>

00:11:50.305 --> 00:11:53.712
<i>Liking someone</i>
<i>and "not disliking" someone</i>

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:55.282
<i>are not the same thing.</i>

00:11:55.383 --> 00:11:58.288
Oh, hey there, Takeo.
You ready to go or, uh...?

00:11:58.389 --> 00:12:00.560
(Intense growl)

00:12:02.062 --> 00:12:06.204
<i>I don't... sense</i>
<i>Yukika's presence.</i>

00:12:06.304 --> 00:12:08.943
[RINKO]
Ah! Hey, Takeo!

00:12:09.043 --> 00:12:10.646
Hey! Ms. Yamato!

00:12:10.746 --> 00:12:12.684
(Heavy breathing)

00:12:12.784 --> 00:12:16.290
I got a really weird text
from Yukika just now!

00:12:17.527 --> 00:12:18.996
[TAKEO]
Whoa!

00:12:19.096 --> 00:12:20.566
Crazy, right?
Did something happen?

00:12:20.666 --> 00:12:22.437
I texted her back
several times,

00:12:22.537 --> 00:12:23.739
but she isn't
getting back to me.

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:26.010
I hope she's alright.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.580
[TAKEO]
She, uh...

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.751
She doesn't really
like where...

00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:31.855
where things are
going with Suna.

00:12:31.955 --> 00:12:35.061
She can tell that they
don't feel the same way
about each other.

00:12:35.162 --> 00:12:37.734
And that it hurts too
much to keep going.

00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:40.138
She said it's time
for her to give up.

00:12:40.238 --> 00:12:43.746
And, Suna, She wanted
me to thank you for
everything you've done.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:48.823
Oh, okay. I understand.

00:12:50.993 --> 00:12:53.866
I think I'm gonna make
a stop at the bookstore.

00:12:56.304 --> 00:13:00.646
<i>So I guess that's it.</i>
<i>This is how it ends.</i>

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:03.752
I don't like how
that just happened.

00:13:03.853 --> 00:13:06.625
It's sad to see something
just fizzle like that...

00:13:06.725 --> 00:13:08.629
To just disappear.

00:13:08.729 --> 00:13:14.574
Yukika told me that she
regrets the fact that she ever
told him how she really felt.

00:13:14.674 --> 00:13:15.977
You think it was
a bad idea?

00:13:16.077 --> 00:13:17.780
No, I don't!
Of course not!

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:19.350
If she'd take a minute
to think about it,

00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:22.557
then she'd remember all the good
stuff that happened, too!

00:13:22.657 --> 00:13:24.193
You're absolutely right.

00:13:24.895 --> 00:13:27.099
<i>She had to tell him.</i>

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:35.883
[YUKIKA]
Uh, hey, Sunakawa...

00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:39.190
The zoo was
fun yesterday.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.630
[TAKEO]
<i>It's foolish to think that</i>
<i>confessing your true feelings</i>

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.601
<i>to someone is a bad thing...</i>

00:13:44.701 --> 00:13:46.204
(Sniffling)

00:13:46.304 --> 00:13:47.373
[TAKEO]
<i>She's here!</i>

00:13:47.473 --> 00:13:49.811
(DING)
HM!

00:13:49.911 --> 00:13:51.915
Suna, you go on
ahead without me.

00:13:52.015 --> 00:13:52.617
Really?

00:13:52.717 --> 00:13:54.153
Something's come up!

00:13:54.253 --> 00:13:55.523
Oh, okay.

00:13:55.623 --> 00:13:57.025
There you are!

00:13:57.125 --> 00:13:58.127
AHHH!

00:13:58.228 --> 00:13:59.129
AH! It's me!

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.967
I found Yukika!
She's on the run!

00:14:01.067 --> 00:14:03.037
We're headed to the park!

00:14:03.906 --> 00:14:05.342
Why are you running away?!

00:14:05.443 --> 00:14:08.348
You can't just take off and
act none of this happened!

00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:09.885
Hey!

00:14:09.985 --> 00:14:12.357
Argh. That's a dirty trick!

00:14:12.457 --> 00:14:15.696
[YUKIKA]
It doesn't matter anymore.
Please just leave me alone!

00:14:15.796 --> 00:14:19.571
Suna may be nice, but
that's what you liked about
him in the first place!

00:14:19.671 --> 00:14:21.007
You gotta start somewhere!

00:14:21.107 --> 00:14:23.211
I can't think
about it that way!
Ah!

00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:25.650
How can I possibly keep
spending time with him

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.321
when I know he doesn't feel
anything for me?

00:14:28.422 --> 00:14:32.430
I'm not like tough you!
I'm too sensitive for that!

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.333
But, Yukika, I...

00:14:34.434 --> 00:14:37.005
I saw the letter you attached to
the chocolate that you gave Suna

00:14:37.105 --> 00:14:39.377
way back in kindergarten.

00:14:39.477 --> 00:14:40.813
You saw that?!

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:42.951
I did! And I was impressed!

00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:44.721
In fact, I was moved!

00:14:44.821 --> 00:14:47.794
It opened my eyes to
what love really is.

00:14:47.894 --> 00:14:52.135
And to this day, I
still think about
how great it was.

00:14:52.235 --> 00:14:56.310
[TAKEO]
Think about it. There's a reason
Suna still remembers it, too.

00:14:56.411 --> 00:15:00.753
Sure, Suna's nice,
but he doesn't act like
that to just anyone.

00:15:00.853 --> 00:15:02.523
You don't want it
to end like this.

00:15:02.624 --> 00:15:03.892
You CAN'T let it end like this!

00:15:03.993 --> 00:15:05.796
[RINKO]
Where is she?

00:15:05.896 --> 00:15:07.500
The, uh, ladies room.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.069
Yukika!

00:15:11.274 --> 00:15:12.844
Yukika...

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:14.814
(Sniffling)

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.284
[GUARD]
Hey, you there!

00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:17.854
What do you think you're
doing hanging out

00:15:17.954 --> 00:15:19.491
in front of the
women's restroom?

00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:20.526
[GUARD]
You some kinda sicko?

00:15:20.626 --> 00:15:21.795
(Squeal)

00:15:21.895 --> 00:15:23.899
We were having an
important conversation!

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:26.605
And he is a crucial component!

00:15:26.705 --> 00:15:30.613
[GUARD]
'Kay... Just try not to
look like some creeper
who's up to something.

00:15:30.713 --> 00:15:32.215
Yes sir.

00:15:34.454 --> 00:15:35.890
You really thought...

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.696
You really thought that
my letter was moving?

00:15:38.796 --> 00:15:39.698
Yeah.

00:15:39.798 --> 00:15:41.535
(Gasp and whimper)

00:15:43.304 --> 00:15:46.678
Actually, if I were to end up
not talking to Sunakawa anymore,

00:15:46.778 --> 00:15:48.281
I would be really sad.

00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:49.884
[TAKEO]
I know.

00:15:49.985 --> 00:15:53.459
(Phone vibrating)

00:15:54.226 --> 00:15:55.328
AAHHH!

00:15:55.429 --> 00:15:57.467
It's him! It's Sunakawa!
What do I do?!

00:15:57.567 --> 00:15:59.303
Answer!
Answer it!

00:16:02.443 --> 00:16:03.479
Hello?

00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:06.150
[SUNA]
Hey, it's me, Sunakawa.

00:16:06.985 --> 00:16:07.920
Are you there?

00:16:08.021 --> 00:16:09.691
Yes, I'm here.

00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:12.964
Yes. Yes, okay.

00:16:13.499 --> 00:16:16.070
Uh-huh. Yeah.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.475
Yeah, I'll see you there.

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:23.886
He said he wanted to see me,
so I'm gonna go.

00:16:23.986 --> 00:16:25.923
I'll see you guys later!

00:16:26.023 --> 00:16:28.462
[RINKO]
Yukika! We'll be here
if you need us!

00:16:28.562 --> 00:16:31.200
[YUKIKA]
Okay, thanks a lot.
I'm going now!

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.337
[RINKO]
What do you think he wants?

00:16:33.439 --> 00:16:35.175
[TAKEO]
I don't know.

00:16:35.275 --> 00:16:40.920
[TAKEO]
I don't know, but...
Suna is very kind...

00:16:41.722 --> 00:16:43.359
Ah!

00:16:48.067 --> 00:16:49.604
I talked to Takeo.

00:16:49.704 --> 00:16:51.675
Sorry to ask you
to come all this way.

00:16:51.775 --> 00:16:53.445
It's no problem.

00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:56.418
Here you go.

00:16:56.518 --> 00:16:59.991
It's for all the
chocolates over the years.

00:17:00.091 --> 00:17:03.264
I've been wanting to
thank you for a long time.

00:17:04.534 --> 00:17:06.438
And so...
Huh?

00:17:06.538 --> 00:17:07.940
So, thank you.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.078
And I'm sorry.

00:17:16.925 --> 00:17:18.429
Nuh-uh.

00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:20.599
(Disagreeing)

00:17:23.337 --> 00:17:27.145
Thank you for being
so kind to me all
this time, Sunakawa.

00:17:27.245 --> 00:17:29.384
I really do like you.

00:17:29.484 --> 00:17:32.857
You've been nothing
but nice to me through
this whole ordeal.

00:17:32.957 --> 00:17:37.967
Whenever you see me again
at school, will you still
talk to me in the halls?

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.973
(Light chuckle)

00:17:41.475 --> 00:17:42.577
Mm-hmm.

00:17:42.677 --> 00:17:44.380
(Light sob)

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.791
[RINKO]
Yukika.

00:17:49.891 --> 00:17:52.930
[YUKIKA]
Look. Sunakawa gave me this.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.801
Aw, how cute is that?

00:17:54.901 --> 00:18:00.044
He's really got good
taste. This is exactly
the kind of stuff I like.

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:02.950
He said he's wanted to
give me this for ten years.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.556
And he said he was sorry.

00:18:05.656 --> 00:18:07.960
(Takeo stammers)

00:18:10.098 --> 00:18:13.070
I've had a lot of fun
through all of this.

00:18:15.543 --> 00:18:20.218
Coming to you guys for advice
all the time, sometimes
until late into the night.

00:18:20.318 --> 00:18:22.590
Picking out clothes
together at the mall.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:27.199
Walking home with Sunakawa,
even if I didn't really
talk to him.

00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:29.370
And going to the zoo
with Sunakawa,

00:18:29.471 --> 00:18:31.575
even though I didn't
talk to him there either.

00:18:31.675 --> 00:18:36.418
Even still, I came out of it
with a lot of wonderful new
memories.

00:18:36.518 --> 00:18:40.793
Sunakawa's world and
my world... they connected.

00:18:40.893 --> 00:18:42.262
In the end...

00:18:42.363 --> 00:18:45.301
I'm glad I told him how I felt.

00:18:47.072 --> 00:18:48.876
Huh? AH!
HM!

00:18:48.976 --> 00:18:50.813
(Gagging)
OH!

00:18:50.913 --> 00:18:51.781
I'm sorry!

00:18:51.882 --> 00:18:53.217
Take it easy there, Takeo!

00:18:53.317 --> 00:18:56.691
I'm not as big as you!
You may have broken something.

00:18:56.791 --> 00:18:58.695
I'm sorry...

00:18:58.795 --> 00:19:01.868
All this time, I wish I could
have been more like you, Takeo.

00:19:01.968 --> 00:19:03.237
Hm?

00:19:03.337 --> 00:19:06.678
Sunakawa really loves you.
You know that, right?

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:07.813
Oh!

00:19:07.914 --> 00:19:09.316
[YUKIKA]
When he's with you,

00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:11.621
Sunakawa is always
busting out laughing.

00:19:11.721 --> 00:19:14.394
And when he's with you,
he seems to smile in a way

00:19:14.494 --> 00:19:17.265
that's a little different than
he does with anybody else.

00:19:17.366 --> 00:19:19.236
Then again, I'm
not really the type

00:19:19.336 --> 00:19:21.273
who's going to just
jump in the river, am I?

00:19:21.374 --> 00:19:24.380
Yeah, well, I can't write
letters like you can.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.287
I like you too, Takeo,
to be perfectly honest.

00:19:28.388 --> 00:19:31.561
It's just in a
completely different way
than I like Sunakawa.

00:19:31.661 --> 00:19:35.703
So were you finally able to tell
him everything you wanted to?

00:19:35.803 --> 00:19:37.640
Yeah.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.416
I've told him everything
I've been feeling for
these past 10 years.

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:45.389
Including all that I
ever wanted was for
him to like me back.

00:19:45.489 --> 00:19:50.499
But now, I don't want
anything in return.

00:19:50.599 --> 00:19:53.906
In the end, that was
the most difficult part
of the whole thing.

00:19:54.006 --> 00:20:00.619
[TAKEO]
<i>In reality, when someone</i>
<i>likes you back, you really</i>
<i>don't need anything else.</i>

00:20:00.719 --> 00:20:03.492
Someday, Sunakawa is going
to find someone out there

00:20:03.592 --> 00:20:05.963
who's really, really nice,
and really, really smart,

00:20:06.063 --> 00:20:09.837
and super cute, and
that loves him more
than I could ever dream.

00:20:09.938 --> 00:20:11.408
I want him to find her.

00:20:11.508 --> 00:20:14.681
And I want them to fall in love
and live happily ever after.

00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:17.118
Me too.

00:20:17.218 --> 00:20:20.392
You want me to walk with you
on your way home, Yukika?

00:20:20.492 --> 00:20:21.394
Ah?

00:20:21.494 --> 00:20:23.164
(Giggle)

00:20:41.568 --> 00:20:44.006
[TAKEO] (Sniffing)
Your mom made curry today.

00:20:44.106 --> 00:20:45.008
Very astute.

00:20:45.108 --> 00:20:46.945
Yeah, we had curry, too.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:48.014
Oh yeah?

00:20:48.114 --> 00:20:49.851
(Twitch twitch)

00:20:51.721 --> 00:20:53.825
Y'know, Takeo...

00:20:56.698 --> 00:20:59.370
[SUNA]
When she apologized
to you at the zoo...

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.108
I could see what a
good person she is.

00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:05.148
<i>Is that so?</i>

00:21:05.248 --> 00:21:07.820
I'm not even sure what
she was apologizing for.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.891
(Laugh)

00:21:09.991 --> 00:21:11.962
Uh, hey. So, Suna...

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:14.266
Do you, like, by
any chance love me?

00:21:14.367 --> 00:21:15.502
Uh, where did that come from?

00:21:15.602 --> 00:21:18.307
Yukika told me
that you did.

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:24.520
Is there anyone out there
that hates you, Takeo?

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.558
[TAKEO]
Suna, I really hope
you find someone

00:21:26.658 --> 00:21:28.462
out there to fall
in love with!

00:21:28.562 --> 00:21:32.202
[SUNA]
Well. I'm having a pretty
good time as it is.
