00:16:54.908 --> 00:16:57.914
How pure-hearted she is.

00:16:58.349 --> 00:17:00.720
(Light gasp)

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:03.792
Hmm...

00:17:07.934 --> 00:17:09.838
I'm gonna walk her home.

00:17:09.938 --> 00:17:11.275
It was nice to meet you.

00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:13.177
Yes, likewise!

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.318
[SUNA]
See? Don't they
look happy?

00:17:16.418 --> 00:17:20.091
She's hiding something.
She has a secret.

00:17:20.191 --> 00:17:21.461
Um... Uh...

00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:23.097
I think you're
overthinking this.

00:17:23.197 --> 00:17:25.937
Oh, don't tell me
you didn't notice it.

00:17:26.037 --> 00:17:29.277
There is something that
she's not telling Takeo.

00:17:29.377 --> 00:17:32.049
She's not being completely
honest with him.

00:17:32.149 --> 00:17:34.487
You can see it in her eyes.

00:17:34.587 --> 00:17:37.894
[AI]
I don't know if she's fooling
around on him or what.

00:17:37.994 --> 00:17:42.135
But... she has a secret.
I know it.

00:17:42.704 --> 00:17:44.139
[TAKEO]
Oh, wow...

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.476
Huh?

00:17:45.576 --> 00:17:46.979
[TAKEO]
Take a look at the sky.

00:17:47.079 --> 00:17:49.784
The stars are really
beautiful again tonight.

00:17:51.254 --> 00:17:53.392
[RINKO]
Yes. They are.

00:17:54.995 --> 00:17:57.400
They're smiling on us.

00:18:08.288 --> 00:18:09.457
[RINKO]
Takeo...

00:18:09.557 --> 00:18:10.993
Hm?

00:18:11.093 --> 00:18:14.434
You know, I... Uh...

00:18:14.801 --> 00:18:16.170
Huh?

00:18:16.271 --> 00:18:19.043
I need to tell
you the truth...

00:18:22.417 --> 00:18:25.856
<i>I don't get girls.</i>
<i>I must be pretty dense.</i>

00:18:25.956 --> 00:18:28.595
Uh, nevermind, it's nothing!
Have a good night!

00:18:28.696 --> 00:18:30.266
Huh?

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:34.006
[TAKEO]
Good night.

00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:37.914
Hm...

00:18:43.325 --> 00:18:45.529
<i>Nothing, huh?</i>

00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:48.535
<i>Maybe...</i>

00:18:50.906 --> 00:18:51.875
<i>Wait a second!</i>

00:18:51.975 --> 00:18:53.979
(Heavy breathing)

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:55.716
AH!
(Dog barks)

00:18:55.816 --> 00:18:58.789
(Grunting)

00:18:58.889 --> 00:19:02.430
<i>Rinko! What've I done?!</i>

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.377
Y'know, you should've
realized something was up

00:19:09.477 --> 00:19:11.948
when she just fell
for him at first sight.

00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:16.391
A girl would have to have
a really good reason to
fall for a guy like that.

00:19:16.491 --> 00:19:20.699
I don't know what it is
exactly, but I know she has
something to hide alright.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.572
Hey, hello?! Are you
even listening to me?

00:19:23.672 --> 00:19:24.908
Yeah, I'm trying
to study here.

00:19:25.008 --> 00:19:26.344
(Knock on door)

00:19:26.445 --> 00:19:27.580
Oh, there you are.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.884
Could you do me a favor and
go to the store for me?

00:19:29.984 --> 00:19:31.621
Ugh! You haven't seen
your daughter in ages

00:19:31.722 --> 00:19:34.761
and you're already starting
to abuse my company? Jeez.

00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:37.500
[MOM]
Mm-hmm. You got that right.

00:19:38.802 --> 00:19:42.944
(Humming)

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.991
(Sigh)

00:19:51.928 --> 00:19:53.899
(Shutter sound)
Hurry! He's gonna see you.

00:19:53.999 --> 00:19:56.036
Oh my God!
That is so creepy!

00:19:56.137 --> 00:19:59.244
And hilarious!
(Both laugh)

00:19:59.778 --> 00:20:01.147
Hm?

00:20:01.915 --> 00:20:03.252
Takeo...?

00:20:03.352 --> 00:20:05.054
(Jingle plays)

00:20:05.155 --> 00:20:06.792
[AI]
What are you doing?

00:20:06.892 --> 00:20:07.860
Hm?

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.230
Oh, hey, Sis.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.802
I'm trying to figure
out how girls think.

00:20:11.902 --> 00:20:13.070
Hm?!

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:15.743
Girls make me feel...
kinda dense.

00:20:15.843 --> 00:20:21.288
For the longest time,
I thought that Ms. Yamato
had a thing for Suna.

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:23.659
I can't pick up
on these things.

00:20:23.759 --> 00:20:28.067
I can tell something's
going on, but I don't
know what it is.

00:20:28.167 --> 00:20:30.973
If she would just tell
me, I could help her.

00:20:32.777 --> 00:20:35.114
[AI]
It might be something
she can't talk about.

00:20:35.216 --> 00:20:37.152
It might be something
she can't tell you.

00:20:37.253 --> 00:20:39.324
Something she can't
tell her boyfriend.

00:20:39.424 --> 00:20:42.463
Like maybe she's
messing around on you...

00:20:42.563 --> 00:20:46.003
Or maybe that she
found somebody else.

00:20:47.273 --> 00:20:49.777
[TAKEO]
Even if that were
the case, I don't care.

00:20:49.878 --> 00:20:51.113
Uh!

00:20:51.213 --> 00:20:52.817
The only problem
I have is seeing

00:20:52.917 --> 00:20:54.554
that she might
be hurting inside.

00:20:54.654 --> 00:20:56.725
(Light gasp)

00:20:58.562 --> 00:20:59.697
(Sigh)

00:20:59.797 --> 00:21:01.701
Okay, fine. I'll
ask her for you.

00:21:01.801 --> 00:21:02.770
Huh?

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.541
It'd probably be
easier for her

00:21:04.641 --> 00:21:05.776
to talk to a girl anyway.

00:21:05.876 --> 00:21:06.978
You would do
that for me?!

00:21:07.078 --> 00:21:08.916
Now please stop
reading that trash!

00:21:09.016 --> 00:21:10.653
It's just making you
look like a weirdo!

00:21:10.753 --> 00:21:14.092
Can't thank you enough!
You are the coolest person ever!

00:21:14.193 --> 00:21:17.333
Uh! C'mon, let's go.

[TAKEO]
I was a little worried
what people would think,

00:21:20.004 --> 00:21:21.775
seeing me reading
that stuff.

00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:23.177
But you did it anyway?

00:21:23.278 --> 00:21:25.850
I was desperate
and had to know.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.453
So, did you
learn anything?

00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:30.593
Well one thing. A new way
to creep people out.

00:21:30.693 --> 00:21:32.663
(Laughs)

00:21:34.334 --> 00:21:35.669
