[RINKO]
Hello!

00:08:27.864 --> 00:08:30.703
My name's Rinko.
I'm Takeo's girlfriend.

00:08:30.803 --> 00:08:34.444
And these lovely ladies are a
few of my friends from class.

00:08:34.544 --> 00:08:36.180
[ALL]
Hey, you guys!

00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:37.249
[TOGETHER]
Nice to meet you!

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.752
Holy crap,
you're all babes!

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.458
So, which one of you guys
is Rinko's lucky boyfriend?

00:08:41.558 --> 00:08:43.262
She brags about him
all the time.

00:08:43.362 --> 00:08:45.131
Ooh... No I don't!

00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:46.735
Well what do you
think you call it

00:08:46.835 --> 00:08:48.505
when you won't stop
talking about him?

00:08:48.605 --> 00:08:50.342
So, which one
is he anyway?

00:08:50.442 --> 00:08:51.978
Um, well, I uh...

00:08:53.982 --> 00:08:55.753
My boyfriend, Takeo Goda!

00:08:55.853 --> 00:08:57.122
NICE TO MEET YOU!

00:08:57.222 --> 00:08:59.092
Uhh...

00:08:59.193 --> 00:09:00.963
[MANA]
He's like a bear....

00:09:01.063 --> 00:09:03.735
[NANAKO]
Rinko said you were
tall, but, uh....

00:09:03.836 --> 00:09:05.573
[KOJIMA]
I thought he WAS a bear...

00:09:05.673 --> 00:09:08.244
[YUKO]
And she said your hands were
really big and everything,

00:09:08.345 --> 00:09:09.514
but, uh...

00:09:09.614 --> 00:09:12.018
[AYU]
We thought you were a bear...

00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:16.728
(Elevator dings)

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:18.999
We're here, you guys!

00:09:19.099 --> 00:09:20.603
Cool!
Woohoo!

00:09:21.771 --> 00:09:23.742
[RINKO]
The restaurant's just
back over here!

00:09:23.842 --> 00:09:24.811
Ahh!

00:09:24.911 --> 00:09:26.113
HM!

00:09:26.213 --> 00:09:27.583
(Crowd gasps)
I gotcha.

00:09:27.683 --> 00:09:29.487
You okay?
That was kinda scary.

00:09:29.587 --> 00:09:31.157
I'm alright.
Thanks a lot.

00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:33.094
[AYU AND NANAKO]
<i>He's so burly.</i>

00:09:33.194 --> 00:09:34.631
(DING)

00:09:34.731 --> 00:09:36.233
[RINKO]
It's kinda dangerous
for them to leave

00:09:36.334 --> 00:09:38.004
all this stuff out here.

00:09:38.104 --> 00:09:41.076
[TAKEO]
I'll move it out of the way
so we can get through.

00:09:42.547 --> 00:09:44.817
[ALL GIRLS]
Like, whoa...

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.590
And it looks like the
emergency exit is locked, too.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.427
Maybe we should tell
the restaurant staff?

00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:51.431
Makes more sense to tell
building management...

00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:53.368
The restaurant staff probably
won't do anything.

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.439
(Fawning)

00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:56.541
[GIRLS]
He's so dreamy!

00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:57.710
[TAKEO]
Suna, you're so smart.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.079
[AYU] What? He's the
bear's friend?

00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:00.649
[SUNA] Not really?
Really?

00:10:00.749 --> 00:10:03.054
[KURIHARA]
Okay, let's order some
drinks, shall we?!

00:10:03.154 --> 00:10:04.557
Who wants a little Oh-Jay?

00:10:04.657 --> 00:10:06.160
[KAKITANI] Oh, I do!
[MOMOTA] I want soda!

00:10:06.261 --> 00:10:08.265
[NANAKO]
I swear the more I look at
him, the hotter he gets.

00:10:08.365 --> 00:10:10.970
[YUKO]
He doesn't say much,
does he? Why don't you
go over and talk to him?

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.107
[KOJIMA] YOU go talk to him!
[YUKO] No freakin' way...

00:10:13.207 --> 00:10:14.611
(Takeo and Rinko chit-chat)

00:10:14.711 --> 00:10:15.980
[AYU]
I totally thought
he was Rinko's boyfriend.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.217
[AYU]
What does she see
in that big brute?

00:10:18.318 --> 00:10:19.988
[NANAKO]
I have no idea.

00:10:20.088 --> 00:10:22.960
Goda, your girlfriend
is seriously super sweet
and nice and awesome!

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.330
I'm so happy for you, Goda.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.966
Well, it couldn't have
happened to a better guy.

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:28.170
[NANAKO]
I don't get why everybody
seems to like him so much.

00:10:28.272 --> 00:10:30.141
We're gonna throw you in the
air again tomorrow, and this
time we won't drop you!

00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:31.511
Yeah!

00:10:31.611 --> 00:10:33.214
[KURIHARA]
Now that everyone
has their drinks,

00:10:33.315 --> 00:10:34.617
why don't we start with a toast?

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:36.922
Wait, we don't have a bottle
opener. Uh, excuse me!

00:10:37.022 --> 00:10:37.823
Excuse me!

00:10:37.924 --> 00:10:39.059
(POP)
(FIZZ)

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:40.596
[TAKEO]
Got it.
Uhh...

00:10:40.696 --> 00:10:42.132
Whoa, you just did that
with your bare hands!

00:10:42.232 --> 00:10:43.167
[MOMOTA]
Goda, you're awesome!

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:44.370
[FUDO]
King Kong over here!

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.306
[MOMOTA]
Here. Do mine, too!

00:10:45.406 --> 00:10:46.441
He's... a beast.

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:47.743
(Shivering)

00:10:47.843 --> 00:10:49.681
(POP)
(Guys gasp)

00:10:49.781 --> 00:10:52.420
(Laughing)
You know, you don't have
to open it like that.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.891
(Squeals)

00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:57.897
So, uh... You ladies are from
an all girls' school, right?

00:10:57.997 --> 00:10:59.968
You don't have any
guys or anything?

00:11:00.068 --> 00:11:02.540
Uh... yeah,
that's right...

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.209
No guys at all.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.817
(CRACK)
Don't ask Ms. Yamato's friends
any more rude questions.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:08.919
Sorry, my bad.

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:11.358
Everybody here knows
what you're getting at.

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:13.328
[RINKO]
Takeo.
Hm?

00:11:13.428 --> 00:11:15.432
It's fine, okay?

00:11:15.532 --> 00:11:17.270
(Placated humming)

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.409
[KAKITANI]
So, seriously... None of
you girls have a boyfriend?

00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:22.245
Nuh-uh.
No!
It sucks

00:11:22.346 --> 00:11:23.649
We don't meet
many guys.

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:25.218
We don't get
much of a chance.

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:28.190
Well, our school is co-ed,
but we still don't meet anyone.

00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:31.898
That's right. The girls
just go for the popular guys.

00:11:31.998 --> 00:11:35.104
And, like, we only meet
people whenever there's
a school festival.

00:11:35.204 --> 00:11:37.977
[KURIHARA]
Oh, is that right?
Can we maybe go to that?

00:11:38.077 --> 00:11:39.747
[YUKO]
Yeah, of course! You should
totally come next time!

00:11:39.847 --> 00:11:41.318
[KAKITANI]
Oh, I will!

00:11:41.418 --> 00:11:43.087
[KOJIMA]
Last year, we ran
a little cafe.

00:11:43.187 --> 00:11:45.592
[MOMOTA] A cafe?
[KURIHARA] What kind
of outfits did you wear?

00:11:45.693 --> 00:11:47.596
[AYU]
Uh, that's sort of
a creepy question!

00:11:47.697 --> 00:11:49.400
[KURIHARA] (Laughs)
Hey, you mind if
I sit over there?

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.604
So, did you work
at the cafe, too?

00:11:51.705 --> 00:11:53.040
I did, I was the baker.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.379
I baked a bunch of different
kinds of pound cake!

00:11:55.479 --> 00:11:57.015
There were tons of 'em!

00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:59.887
Oh yeah? I wish I could've been
there, I would've tried 'em all.

00:11:59.988 --> 00:12:02.092
Well, I could try
baking one tomorrow!

00:12:02.192 --> 00:12:04.129
Oh, I can't wait.

00:12:04.229 --> 00:12:07.670
You could probably
eat an entire cake by
yourself, couldn't you?

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.576
Uh! Oh, crap... my
contact's all messed up.

00:12:10.676 --> 00:12:13.749
Sorry, I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go to the restroom!

00:12:13.849 --> 00:12:14.617
'Kay!

00:12:14.717 --> 00:12:16.688
[AYU]
Oh. I'll come with you.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:24.470
(Chatter)

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.075
[RINKO]
Sure is taking Nanako
and Ayu a long time.

00:12:27.175 --> 00:12:28.177
Huh?

00:12:28.278 --> 00:12:30.214
I'm gonna go
check on them.

00:12:30.315 --> 00:12:32.486
I'll come
with you.

00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:35.091
Where IS the restroom?

00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:36.528
Over here!

00:12:36.628 --> 00:12:38.732
[NANAKO]
I don't care what she
says. He's a freak!

00:12:38.832 --> 00:12:40.803
[AYU]
I know, right?
(Rinko gasps)

00:12:40.903 --> 00:12:42.573
[AYU]
I cannot believe
he's the boyfriend.

00:12:42.673 --> 00:12:44.544
[NANAKO]
He's barely even human.

00:12:44.644 --> 00:12:48.050
(Both laugh)
[NANAKO]
She kept talking about him
like he was some sort of prize.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.121
I was expecting some
major hottie, you know?

00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:54.697
[AYU]
Totally! I was completely
shocked when I saw that big,
hairy gorilla!

00:12:54.797 --> 00:12:57.235
[NANAKO]
I don't know if I could even
be seen with that thing!

00:12:57.336 --> 00:12:58.605
(Ayu laughs)

00:12:58.705 --> 00:13:00.007
Listen to me, alright?

00:13:00.108 --> 00:13:02.380
Nice girls don't always
have nice friends.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.749
Hmm...

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:06.153
[NANAKO]
She thinks he so cool
and everything?

00:13:06.254 --> 00:13:07.890
What is wrong with her?

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.796
(Laughing)
Uh!

00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:13.535
Uh, Rinko.

00:13:13.635 --> 00:13:15.773
(Sniffling)

00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:23.755
Takeo... He's...

00:13:23.855 --> 00:13:25.292
Uh!

00:13:26.528 --> 00:13:29.367
He's my boyfriend!
And he is a major hottie!

00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:31.236
(Whimpering)

00:13:31.337 --> 00:13:32.373
(Gasps)

00:13:32.473 --> 00:13:34.510
(Crying)

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.548
(Both stammering)
[TAKEO]
Wait!

00:13:36.648 --> 00:13:40.054
(Rinko sobbing)

00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.162
[TAKEO]
Ms. Yamato!

00:13:44.263 --> 00:13:46.133
Slow down!

00:13:46.668 --> 00:13:48.605
Ms. Yamato!

00:13:50.074 --> 00:13:51.210
Ah!

00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:55.151
I'm sorry, Takeo!
I'm so sorry...

00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:56.354
About what?

00:13:56.454 --> 00:13:57.757
My friends...

00:13:57.857 --> 00:14:00.829
They... they said such
awful things. And I'm sorry!

00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:03.935
I know that must hurt.
I'm so sorry.

00:14:04.035 --> 00:14:04.871
(Sobbing)

00:14:04.971 --> 00:14:07.376
They can't say
anything to hurt me.

00:14:07.476 --> 00:14:08.945
Takeo...

00:14:09.045 --> 00:14:11.150
(Sobbing)

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.655
<i>Please don't cry.</i>

00:14:13.755 --> 00:14:16.026
There's all kinds
of people.

00:14:16.427 --> 00:14:17.930
Huh?

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.335
And they can say
all kinds of things.

00:14:20.435 --> 00:14:22.973
And sometimes,
those words can hurt.

00:14:23.073 --> 00:14:25.979
But how can I
possibly feel sad...

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:28.618
when I'm standing
here next to you?

00:14:28.718 --> 00:14:30.722
It's impossible.

00:14:32.827 --> 00:14:36.200
<i>I can't stand to see you cry.</i>

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:39.172
You sure
you're okay?

00:14:39.273 --> 00:14:40.676
Mm-hmm.

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:42.045
You promise?

00:14:42.145 --> 00:14:43.682
Absolutely.

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:45.819
'Cause what I heard...

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:48.157
was that you've been talking
to your friends about me.

00:14:48.258 --> 00:14:50.662
And you've said a lot
of really nice things.

00:14:50.762 --> 00:14:52.131
Thank you
for that.

00:14:52.232 --> 00:14:53.368
(Gasp)
