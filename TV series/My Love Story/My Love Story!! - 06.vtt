I know you're good
at keeping secrets.

00:20:49.778 --> 00:20:52.550
You're the only
person I know I
can trust with this!

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.255
Stop it, man, you're
grossing me out. Ah!

00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:58.027
You'll be fine. I
brought some protection.

00:20:58.127 --> 00:20:59.631
You need to get
away from me.

00:20:59.731 --> 00:21:02.403
With this between us,
there won't be a problem!

00:21:02.503 --> 00:21:04.039
There's gonna be
a huge problem if-

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:05.275
Mphh!

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:07.413
I've already made up
my mind about this!

00:21:07.513 --> 00:21:09.684
Now be a man
and kiss me!

00:21:09.784 --> 00:21:13.291
Takeo, I'm having a little
trouble breathing here!
