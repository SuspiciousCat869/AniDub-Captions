00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:32.837
Right. It picks up
a girl's earring
and chases after her.

00:00:32.937 --> 00:00:34.974
When I heard that song
the first time,

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:38.282
I couldn't help but wonder
what it was the bear was
really looking for.

00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:41.455
I mean, people normally
run if a bear's
coming at them.

00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:45.262
A bear can also chase
down someone if it found
something of theirs.

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:49.938
And the girl did end up finding
out that the bear was actually
a really good person, right?

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.443
Well, a good BEAR.
Not a person.

00:00:52.543 --> 00:00:55.583
And I'm sure they became friends
and nothing more than that.

Hm?
It's just that...

00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:07.673

helps the girl, it doesn't mean

00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:10.780

anything like that, does it?!

Ahh... UH!
(Coughing)

00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:23.812

Were you faking?

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.427
No! I wasn't faking it! God, no!

00:08:31.528 --> 00:08:33.532
I'm just feeling
a little better.

00:08:33.632 --> 00:08:34.600
Oh yeah?

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.640

understand, alright?

I was walking.

You... walk... fast...

00:08:59.884 --> 00:09:02.022
I'm kinda hungry,
so maybe that's why.

00:09:02.122 --> 00:09:03.525
I'm sorry.

About what?

00:09:08.935 --> 00:09:10.939
I'm sorry that I'm so slow.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.810
You're not that slow.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.247
Huh?

00:09:14.347 --> 00:09:15.148
HUH?!

00:09:15.249 --> 00:09:16.784
I'd say you're
about average.

I am not!
I'm painfully slow!

00:09:18.555 --> 00:09:20.759
Well, you don't need
to be sorry for that.

00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:24.066
Whatever. I'm messing
it up for everyone else on
the team and you know it.

No, you're not.

Listen, you are not
messing anything up.

Everyone moves at their own
pace. We are all different.

Huh?

00:09:33.385 --> 00:09:35.222
You see, there's no way
you can possibly get it

00:09:35.322 --> 00:09:36.891
because you've always been fast.

00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:38.428
Uh!

00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:41.868
I think it would be so cool
to win "first place," ya know?

00:09:41.968 --> 00:09:43.471
Do you want to
win first place?

00:09:43.571 --> 00:09:46.878
Uh... Well, yeah...
Of course I do, but....

If you want to practice,
I'll practice with you.

better next time, I promise!

run fast!

Huh?

Maybe I should
chase you.

[TAKEO]
Yep!

What?! No, no, no!
I wasn't saying that.

It's just interesting,
that's all!

00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:07.639
I just never thought about boys
and girls being on the team.

[TAKEO]
<i>Okay.</i>

running in the race?

Ahh...

I've always thought
that if some other girl were
to fall in love with Takeo

and try to take him
away from me,

that I would totally
stand up and fight for him.

learn how to fight of course.

to worry.

that he's yours.

you're phone will fit
in your bag anymore.

Well, I guess Saijo
came to see you...

00:15:10.558 --> 00:15:12.896
Did you want to talk to
Takeo about something?

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:16.437
Oh, I just had something
I wanted to give him. Here.

00:15:16.537 --> 00:15:17.572
Something for me?

00:15:17.673 --> 00:15:19.276
Uh... You helped
me out so much

00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:21.180
during the relay,
so, uh...

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.950
[TAKEO]
It's a towel!

00:15:23.051 --> 00:15:25.455
Yeah. To thank you.

00:15:25.555 --> 00:15:28.428
Takeo's always been a big
believer in hand towels.

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:30.365
[MARIYA]
Huh? You don't use
regular towels?

00:15:30.465 --> 00:15:32.135
Oh, no, it's not
anything like that.

00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:36.377
It's just my Mom's always
said they're useful.

00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:38.815
I finally have a
full-sized towel!

00:15:38.915 --> 00:15:41.053

Alright. You're so silly.

00:15:41.153 --> 00:15:43.491
It's so fluffy!
Fluffy-wuffy!

00:15:43.591 --> 00:15:46.330

Well, I'm glad you like it!

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.301
Uh! Oh...

00:15:48.401 --> 00:15:50.538
Okay, I should
get going now.

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:52.809
[TAKEO]
Sorry I didn't
get you anything.

was running with you
in the relay race?

Your boyfriend got a towel
from some other girl?

[ALL]
Hm?

Look, Rinko, your boyfriend
runs really fast.

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:37.899
It's extremely possible that's
what this girl fell for.

00:16:37.999 --> 00:16:39.436
Was the girl even
good-looking?

00:16:39.536 --> 00:16:40.872
Um... Yeah.

00:16:40.972 --> 00:16:43.511
I mean she was pretty cute
and nice enough, I guess.

00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:46.183
And, well, she does kinda
have some pretty big boobs.

00:16:46.283 --> 00:16:48.087
(All exclaiming)

00:16:48.187 --> 00:16:52.362
Yeah, but well, Takeo
totally introduced me
to her as his girlfriend.

00:16:52.462 --> 00:16:53.664
You are so naive.

00:16:53.765 --> 00:16:55.135
Some girls out there
are only attracted

00:16:55.235 --> 00:16:56.370
to guys who are taken.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.341
Well, I am going
to fight for him!

00:16:58.441 --> 00:16:59.643

If she really does like Takeo,

00:17:06.657 --> 00:17:09.596
then the two of us
might not be all that
different from each other.

Huh?

If I had met her under
different circumstances,

then we might've
been friends.

00:17:14.573 --> 00:17:15.775
It's too late for that.

00:17:15.875 --> 00:17:17.813
Liking the same guy
is, like, not a solid

00:17:17.913 --> 00:17:19.216
foundation for friendship.

00:17:19.316 --> 00:17:21.887
Rinko! Go wait for him
in front of the school gate!

00:17:21.987 --> 00:17:23.558

he's your man!

Oh yeah, Ms. Yamato
gave it to me yesterday.

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:36.383

00:17:39.656 --> 00:17:41.293
and your wallpaper is a
picture of the two of you?

That's a little over the top.
I mean, c'mon, right?

about? I like it.
