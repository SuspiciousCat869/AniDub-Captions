00:08:36.278 --> 00:08:37.481
Hm?

00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:39.785
[RINKO]
Takeo, please
don't get hurt.

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:42.356
I'm gonna send you some
good juju right now!

00:08:42.457 --> 00:08:44.895
You won't get hurt!
You won't get hurt!

00:08:44.995 --> 00:08:47.534
[TAKEO]
Got it! Thanks for
the good vibes!

00:08:47.634 --> 00:08:49.838
Go for it,
go for it, Takeo!

00:08:49.939 --> 00:08:53.780
I'm cheering for
you 24 hours a day!
You can do it!

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.884
YEAH!

00:08:58.255 --> 00:08:59.825
(Doorbell)

00:08:59.925 --> 00:09:01.495
Hm?

00:09:02.798 --> 00:09:03.800
Hm?

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.737
[SUUNA]
What's all that?
Whatcha got there?

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.774
(Fidgeting)
I made some scones...

00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:10.346
When I think about Takeo,
I start baking.

00:09:10.447 --> 00:09:12.384
And well, I think
about him a lot.

00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:15.255
So have some scones, Sunakawa.
Have a bunch!

00:09:15.356 --> 00:09:18.496
(Gasp)
I'm sorry if it seems like I'm
dumping my leftovers on you...

00:09:18.596 --> 00:09:20.099
but well... I am.

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:23.138
So, how come you didn't
just give them to Takeo ?

00:09:23.238 --> 00:09:26.277
I'm sure he wouldn't have a
problem scarfing them down.

00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:29.585
(Whimper)
Uh, I... I don't...

00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:32.189
I don't know if he
still likes me anymore!

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.660
Don't be ridiculous.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.530
When I went to see
him the other day...

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.966
I thought that I'd surprise
him with some food,

00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:38.536
but he told me
not to come by anymore!

00:09:38.636 --> 00:09:40.573
I think I must've crossed
a line somewhere!

00:09:40.674 --> 00:09:42.811
Uh, no. I'm pretty sure
it's just a misunderstanding

00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:44.615
or that you're
overreacting.

00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:46.986
But I know for a fact he
wouldn't be upset with you

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:48.322
bringing him food.

00:09:48.423 --> 00:09:49.992
Huh?

00:09:50.092 --> 00:09:51.328
Okay...

00:09:51.429 --> 00:09:53.332
You're totally right.

00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:55.369
That's just not
who Takeo is.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.010
Now that I've calmed
down, I think I can
see more clearly now.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.480
Thank you, Sunakawa!

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.218
You know, you really
don't have to worry
about things like that.

00:10:03.318 --> 00:10:05.457
(Sigh)

00:10:06.392 --> 00:10:07.627
Suna...

00:10:07.728 --> 00:10:10.433
This is the first time
I've ever been in love.

00:10:10.533 --> 00:10:12.437
It wasn't until I met Takeo...

00:10:12.537 --> 00:10:14.641
that I've had such strong
feelings just well up

00:10:14.742 --> 00:10:17.346
and wash all
over me like this.

00:10:17.447 --> 00:10:19.852
No one can tell you
what love is like.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.491
You just have to
experience it.

00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:25.329
Every day, my heart has been
beating out of control.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.203
And when I see him,
my body starts to tingle
and I can't stop smiling.

00:10:29.303 --> 00:10:33.746
You know, just so happens
Takeo was my very first friend.

00:10:33.846 --> 00:10:37.888
Ah!
It's pretty funny that he's
the first guy for both of us.

00:10:37.988 --> 00:10:40.125
Oh, God! I love
Takeo so much

00:10:40.225 --> 00:10:42.263
that sometimes it really
starts to freak me out!

00:10:42.363 --> 00:10:44.935
But it scares me to think
of it ever fading away.

00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:47.474
Well, I've been with him
for over 10 years now...

00:10:47.574 --> 00:10:49.645
and I still haven't
gotten bored yet.

00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:51.482
Oh! Good grief!

00:10:51.582 --> 00:10:54.287
What do I do? I can't be such
a mess the rest of my life!

00:10:54.388 --> 00:10:59.698
I'm pretty sure that
he'll be freaking out
right alongside you.

00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:03.305
I really want
to see him.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.910
Why don't you
wait here?

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.685
Uh-uh... If I see him once,
I'll want to see him again...

00:11:09.785 --> 00:11:12.356
I must be strong!
I don't want to distract him!

00:11:12.457 --> 00:11:17.032
[SUNA]
I don't think he'd think
of you as a distraction.

00:11:17.133 --> 00:11:21.241
I saw him training...
and he was really dreamy.

00:11:21.341 --> 00:11:23.913
Just wait 'til you seem him
in the actual competition.

00:11:24.013 --> 00:11:25.817
What?! He gets
even dreamier?!

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:28.355
He's like a fireball
of pure concentration.

00:11:28.456 --> 00:11:30.927
(Squeal)
What am I going to do?

00:11:31.027 --> 00:11:33.031
I don't know if I'll be
able to control myself!

00:11:33.131 --> 00:11:35.937
Ah! Those stars
totally look like Takeo!

00:11:36.037 --> 00:11:36.872
Huh?

00:11:36.972 --> 00:11:37.841
See? Look.

00:11:37.941 --> 00:11:39.745
If I connect that
star and that one,

00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:42.684
it looks just like Takeo
after he's eaten some cake!

00:11:42.784 --> 00:11:45.255
Ah. So, the
constellation Goda.

00:11:45.355 --> 00:11:46.625
Yeah, I like it!

00:11:46.725 --> 00:11:48.729
[RINKO]
Oh, those stars there
look like Takeo

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.669
is body slamming
somebody to the floor!

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:53.773
Huh. That's
constellation Goda 2.

00:11:53.873 --> 00:11:56.712
Over there is when he saved
me from the guy on the train.

00:11:56.812 --> 00:12:00.052
Constellation Goda 3.

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:03.626
I guess constellations show
you whatever you want to see.

00:12:03.726 --> 00:12:05.997
Yes, they do.

00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:08.836
[RINKO]
Oh! And look at that!

00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:11.442
I can see when he escaped
from that burning building!

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:15.650
[SUNA]
You know, I think I'm starting
to see him up there too.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.562
(SLAM)

00:12:21.662 --> 00:12:22.497
[ITO]
Next!

00:12:22.597 --> 00:12:23.566
(SLAM)
[JUDOKA]
AH!

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:24.601
[ITO]
Next!

00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:25.804
Goda, sir!

00:12:25.904 --> 00:12:27.239
Will you please spar
with me next?!

00:12:27.339 --> 00:12:28.442
And me after him, please!

00:12:28.543 --> 00:12:29.978
And I'm after that!

00:12:30.078 --> 00:12:33.386
Oh, Goda... thanks so
much for doing this...

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:36.191
We must all work
as hard as Goda!

00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:37.661
[ALL]
Yes, sir!

00:12:37.761 --> 00:12:39.363
(Birds cawing)

00:12:39.464 --> 00:12:42.771
(Exhausted sighs and groans)

00:12:42.871 --> 00:12:46.812
<i>Men have bowed before me...</i>
<i>and asked me for help.</i>

00:12:46.912 --> 00:12:50.052
<i>I will do so with</i>
<i>honor and effort.</i>

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.024
<i>But it is because</i>
<i>of her...</i>

00:12:53.124 --> 00:12:56.699
<i>that I will do this</i>
<i>to my fullest abilities.</i>

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:58.669
<i>Oh, Ms. Yamato...</i>

00:12:58.769 --> 00:13:01.140
<i>I haven't heard your</i>
<i>voice in a long time.</i>

00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:06.317
<i>Since we met, this is</i>
<i>the longest I've spent</i>
<i>without hearing you.</i>

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:10.225
(Beeping)

00:13:11.962 --> 00:13:13.566
(Phone rings)
AH!

00:13:13.666 --> 00:13:16.070
[RINKO]
Takeo? You there?
It's me.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.206
Yeah.

00:13:17.306 --> 00:13:18.576
Is something wrong?

00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:20.847
Not at all. I just wanted
to hear your voice.

00:13:20.947 --> 00:13:22.717
What? My voice?

00:13:22.817 --> 00:13:24.353
Uh... okay...

00:13:24.454 --> 00:13:27.427
Then, I guess I should
say something, huh?

00:13:27.527 --> 00:13:30.533
Hi, uh, it's me,
Rinko Yamato..

00:13:30.633 --> 00:13:32.804
Mmm...
How are you doing, Takeo?

00:13:32.904 --> 00:13:34.608
I'm doing fine!

00:13:34.708 --> 00:13:35.944
[TAKEO]
<i>Ah... I love it...</i>

00:13:36.044 --> 00:13:37.514
[RINKO]
And, well... uh...

00:13:37.614 --> 00:13:38.916
I... uh...
(Giggle)

00:13:39.016 --> 00:13:41.455
I'm sorry. I don't
know what to say!

00:13:41.555 --> 00:13:43.426
I'm not very good
at making stuff up.

00:13:43.526 --> 00:13:44.861
[TAKEO]
<i>She's so great...</i>

00:13:44.962 --> 00:13:47.634
[RINKO]
Oh! The tournament
is tomorrow, right?

00:13:47.734 --> 00:13:49.036
[TAKEO]
Bring Suna with you.

00:13:49.136 --> 00:13:52.209
You got it! Good
luck tomorrow, okay?

00:13:52.309 --> 00:13:53.378
Yeah. Thanks.

00:13:53.479 --> 00:13:56.485
(Footsteps)

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:58.088
[SUNA]
Guess you're done
with practice?

00:13:58.188 --> 00:14:00.960
Huh? Yeah. Oh, the tournament
is tomorrow at six o'clock

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.764
in the training building.

00:14:02.864 --> 00:14:04.468
Okay. This is for you.

00:14:04.568 --> 00:14:05.870
Hm?

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.974
Ms. Yamato made these,
didn't she?!

00:14:08.074 --> 00:14:10.178
You're very perceptive.

00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:13.552
She said she was thinking
about you and accidentally
made too many.

00:14:13.653 --> 00:14:16.892
Well, why didn't she just bring
them over to my place herself?

00:14:16.992 --> 00:14:18.996
She said she didn't
wanna bother you.

00:14:19.096 --> 00:14:21.502
SHE COULD NEVER BOTHER ME!

00:14:21.602 --> 00:14:23.004
Yes, I know.

00:14:23.104 --> 00:14:24.942
She's been getting so
exited about your match

00:14:25.042 --> 00:14:27.379
that she looked like
she was about to die.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.716
Huh.
(Door opens)

00:14:28.816 --> 00:14:30.553
You better show
her a good fight.

00:14:30.653 --> 00:14:32.424
[SUNA]
Well, good night!

00:14:32.524 --> 00:14:33.926
(Door closes)

00:14:34.026 --> 00:14:37.767
<i>But... She didn't</i>
<i>tell me any of that...</i>

00:14:37.867 --> 00:14:40.673
<i>She just wished</i>
<i>me good luck.</i>

00:14:40.773 --> 00:14:42.577
(Giggle)

00:14:42.677 --> 00:14:45.015
[TAKEO]
<i>She's so wonderful...</i>

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.258
(Chatter)

00:14:50.359 --> 00:14:52.464
(Grunting)

00:14:54.668 --> 00:14:55.536
Hm?

00:14:55.637 --> 00:14:57.907
(Gasp)
(Giggle)

00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:03.619
Oh?

00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:04.755
Huh?

00:15:04.855 --> 00:15:06.392
Alright.

00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:08.763
Come with me.

00:15:11.435 --> 00:15:12.837
Oh!

00:15:12.937 --> 00:15:16.277
[TAKEO]
I want you to have the
best seat in the house.

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:18.849
Takeo, I...

00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:22.022
[TSUYOSHI]
Hey, Goda! Long time no see!

00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:25.430
[TAKEO]
Oh, hey, Tsuyoshi!
Good to see you!

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.232
Good luck out
there today.

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:29.070
This is Tsuyoshi,
an old friend of mine.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.644
Huh?
We went to the same dojo
back in elementary school.

00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:35.650
I'm Rinko Yamato.
His girlfriend.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.387
(Stunned gasp)

00:15:37.487 --> 00:15:38.723
HIS GIRLFRIEND?!

00:15:38.823 --> 00:15:40.727
(Choking)

00:15:40.827 --> 00:15:42.262
Brbrbrbr...

00:15:42.363 --> 00:15:44.835
(Evil laugh)

00:15:44.935 --> 00:15:47.640
This match is mine, Goda!
(Laughs)

00:15:47.741 --> 00:15:50.178
You were stronger than me
back in the day,

00:15:50.278 --> 00:15:52.917
but ever since high school, I've
gone to nationals every year!

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:55.523
I'm not gonna lose to some
dude with a girly "girlfriend"

00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:57.359
