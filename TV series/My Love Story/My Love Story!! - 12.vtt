Right. Understood.

Let's start with some
English first then, 'kay?

00:08:08.518 --> 00:08:11.925

No matter your major, you'll
need English either way.

I'm happy to help.

00:08:15.966 --> 00:08:18.105
Now then, how about
some basic vocabulary?

00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:19.741
Yeah, bring it on!

00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:21.010
Define the word "obtain."

Takeo. Even if Murasakifuji
isn't an option,

Matcha University are nearby.

a mock benchmark exam soon.

00:08:53.275 --> 00:08:56.781
It might be a bit early,
but if you want to take it,
then I'll take it too.

Uh, what are my chances
with Aobeni and Matcha?

00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:04.664
Well they won't be easy,
but more realistic than
Murasakifuji.

00:09:04.764 --> 00:09:07.002
You'd have a much better
chance with those two.

00:09:07.103 --> 00:09:09.641

Hey, kids, you have a minute?

00:14:22.066 --> 00:14:25.472
I just realized I hadn't
introduced myself.

00:14:25.572 --> 00:14:26.741
I'm your boyfriend's father.

00:14:26.841 --> 00:14:29.513
Oh, yes! I'm Rinko!
It's nice to meet you.

00:14:29.614 --> 00:14:31.651
Heard you've been taking
real good care of my boy.

00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:34.323
Yes! Oh, no, we take
care of each other!

00:14:34.423 --> 00:14:36.194
Just keep doin'
what you're doin'.

00:14:36.294 --> 00:14:37.396
Sure!

00:14:37.496 --> 00:14:39.066
Alrighty.

00:14:40.168 --> 00:14:42.005
(Sigh)

00:14:42.106 --> 00:14:43.174
Oh my God!

00:14:43.275 --> 00:14:44.710
I thought you looked
like your mom,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.149
but you and your dad are
like, clones or something!

00:14:47.249 --> 00:14:48.385
Oh yeah?

00:14:48.485 --> 00:14:50.255
Okay, our 30 minutes
starts now.

00:14:50.355 --> 00:14:51.257
Go!

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:52.626
You two kids hungry?
Ah!

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.297
Sweetie, are you a fan
of rice crackers?

00:14:54.397 --> 00:14:57.236
Uh yeah... And I brought along
some sweet stuff of my own,

00:14:57.336 --> 00:14:58.605
so that'll be great!

00:14:58.705 --> 00:14:59.974
Now we can have
salty AND sweet.

00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:03.448
[YURIKO]
Oh, my! Did you
make those yourself?

00:15:03.548 --> 00:15:05.352
They are delightful!

00:15:05.452 --> 00:15:07.489
Oh, they're so moist .

00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:09.694
So how long have you
been dating my boy? Huh?

00:15:09.794 --> 00:15:12.833
[TAKEO]
Mom! We are trying
to study here! Jeez!

00:15:14.904 --> 00:15:16.341
(Both sigh)

00:15:16.441 --> 00:15:18.244
You a fan of golf
by any chance?

00:15:18.345 --> 00:15:19.714
Oh, well I, uh...

00:15:19.814 --> 00:15:21.718
My father watches it
at home a little bit.

00:15:21.818 --> 00:15:24.690
So, your old man's a golfer, eh?
Sounds like we'd get along.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.461
Hang on for just a second.

00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:28.264
Oh, Rinko, would you
like some more tea?

00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:29.767
Um, yes, thank you.
(Yuriko giggles)

00:15:29.867 --> 00:15:32.239
Have you seen the latest
issue of Enjoy Golf magazine?

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:34.977
(Angry growl)
Your dad is going to love the
story on hybrid drivers...

00:15:35.078 --> 00:15:36.547
[SUNA]
Yeah, sure.

00:15:36.648 --> 00:15:38.852
My parents are out today,
so you can study here.

00:15:38.952 --> 00:15:41.357
I was just doing
some homework myself.

00:15:41.457 --> 00:15:42.860
[RINKO]
You ready?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.065
I'll give you a problem.
Shoot!

00:15:45.165 --> 00:15:48.204
In what year did World
War II officially begin?

00:15:48.304 --> 00:15:50.075
It began in 1939.

00:15:50.175 --> 00:15:51.678
That's right! Well done!

00:15:51.778 --> 00:15:54.583
Yeah, okay. You might wanna make
the questions a little harder.

00:15:54.684 --> 00:15:56.554
Alright, let's see...

00:15:57.322 --> 00:15:58.758
I don't understand.

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:00.662
What is this
guy's problem?

00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:02.933
Why would he be wandering back
and forth between two women?

00:16:03.033 --> 00:16:05.739
That doesn't make any
sense to me! Hmm...

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:09.413
Takeo, the test is not asking
your opinion of the situation.

00:16:09.513 --> 00:16:11.884
I get your point.
I think so, too.

00:16:11.984 --> 00:16:14.857
You can't split your
feelings between two
people at the same time.

00:16:14.957 --> 00:16:15.959
Nuh-uh!

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.496
Not you, too...

00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:19.433
Takeo, if there
were two Yamatos,

00:16:19.533 --> 00:16:21.002
you'd have a hard
time deciding.

00:16:21.104 --> 00:16:22.673
And Yamato, if there
were two Takeos,

00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:23.975
you'd have a
dilemma too.

00:16:24.076 --> 00:16:25.245
[BOTH]
UH!

00:16:25.345 --> 00:16:26.481
Ms. Yamato!
Ms. Yamato!

00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:28.585
Takeo! AH!
Takeo! AH!

00:16:28.685 --> 00:16:29.854
Which one is the real you?

00:16:29.954 --> 00:16:31.357
I'm the real me!
No, I am!

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:32.426
Which one of you's you?

00:16:32.526 --> 00:16:33.661
It's me!
I'm the real Takeo!

00:16:33.762 --> 00:16:35.599
Dear God! Quit messing
with my mind!

00:16:35.699 --> 00:16:37.503
(Groaning)
I don't even
want to know!

00:16:37.603 --> 00:16:39.240
Let's move on,
shall we?

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.581
(Takeo moaning)

00:16:43.681 --> 00:16:45.318
(SLAM)
Takeo?!

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:47.122
(Snoring)

00:16:47.222 --> 00:16:48.958
Oh, he's asleep.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.764
He's never studied this
long in his entire life.

00:16:51.864 --> 00:16:53.501
He's completely
shut down.

00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:56.174
There's no telling
how long he'll be out.

00:16:57.209 --> 00:16:58.778
Takeo...

00:16:58.878 --> 00:17:01.350
[SUNA]
We should probably
let him sleep.

00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:03.588
I'll go make some tea.

00:17:13.608 --> 00:17:16.748
Sure it would be a lot
of fun for us to go to
the same school and all,

00:17:16.848 --> 00:17:18.752
but it's not like
we really need it.

00:17:18.852 --> 00:17:21.124
We can still be there
for each other in the end,

00:17:21.224 --> 00:17:22.993
together forever.

00:17:26.934 --> 00:17:29.673
So would you prefer
coffee or green tea?
EEK!

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.679
NOOO!

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.183
Suna, please, it's not
what it looks like!

00:17:34.283 --> 00:17:36.587
No, do your thing.
I didn't see any of it.

00:17:36.687 --> 00:17:38.591
Oh God! Please don't
tell him! Please!

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.697
I don't want him to think
I do all sorts of weird
things to him in his sleep!

00:17:41.798 --> 00:17:42.866
He's gonna think I'm creepy!

00:17:42.966 --> 00:17:44.436
Huh?
I'm not gonna tell him.

00:17:44.537 --> 00:17:46.174
Uhh! I think
I fell asleep.

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:47.976
AHHH!
Well, look who's up.

00:17:50.582 --> 00:17:52.286
[RINKO]
Okay. Keep at it!

00:17:52.386 --> 00:17:55.192
The sun's still out,
so I can walk home by myself.

00:17:55.292 --> 00:17:56.894
[TAKEO]
Yeah, see you later!

00:17:56.994 --> 00:17:59.099
(SLAM)

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.339
Suna, you plan on going
to college, too, right?

00:18:02.439 --> 00:18:03.942
Yeah, I guess.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:05.212
You know, I...

00:18:05.312 --> 00:18:07.316
I never really thought a
whole lot about my future

00:18:07.416 --> 00:18:08.985
or anything like that.

00:18:09.086 --> 00:18:11.924
Do you think you'd want to go
to the same college as us?

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:13.228
Why would I?

00:18:13.328 --> 00:18:16.968
Well, wouldn't it be fun if
we were all there together?

00:18:17.069 --> 00:18:18.638
Takeo...

00:18:18.738 --> 00:18:21.511
I won't be compromising
for your sake.

00:18:21.611 --> 00:18:23.648
So you're gonna have
to keep on studying.

00:18:23.748 --> 00:18:25.418
Uh, yeah...

00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:27.356
The purpose of studying...

00:18:27.456 --> 00:18:29.994
is to gain the wisdom to avoid
making mistakes in life...

00:18:30.095 --> 00:18:32.332
so perhaps you don't
even really need it.

00:18:32.432 --> 00:18:33.668
What's that mean?

00:18:33.768 --> 00:18:35.472
You don't even need
to understand that.

00:18:35.572 --> 00:18:37.075
Huh?

00:18:37.176 --> 00:18:39.313
I'm starting to think you
might actually get accepted

00:18:39.413 --> 00:18:40.715
into Murasakifuji.

00:18:40.815 --> 00:18:43.488
Wait, are you kidding?!
Yeeaaaah! Hoohoohoo!

00:18:43.588 --> 00:18:46.494
<i>I may not understand all</i>
<i>this intellectual stuff.</i>

00:18:46.594 --> 00:18:48.498
<i>And I really hate studying.</i>

00:18:48.598 --> 00:18:52.306
<i>But if that's what it takes</i>
<i>to spend more time with the</i>
<i>ones I like most...</i>

00:18:52.406 --> 00:18:55.946
<i>Then I will take</i>
<i>this challenge head-on.</i>

00:18:56.047 --> 00:18:57.282
Takeo?

00:18:57.382 --> 00:18:58.852
No, don't talk to me!

00:18:58.952 --> 00:19:00.889
I feel like everything I learned
is leaking out of my brain!

00:19:00.989 --> 00:19:02.659
[SUNA] Heads up.
(GONG) AGH!

00:19:02.759 --> 00:19:04.830
Oh man! You see that?
I just lost like,
ten things right there!

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.069
What am I gonna do?!
[RINKO] Takeo?

00:19:07.169 --> 00:19:07.970
Ms. Yamato!

00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:09.640
Now, just calm down.
Huh?!

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.077
Do you have a pencil?!
Yes!

00:19:11.177 --> 00:19:12.713
What about an eraser?!
Yes!

00:19:12.813 --> 00:19:15.051
Mm-hmm! Then you can do it!
Be strong!

00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:16.254
Okay! Thank you!

00:19:16.354 --> 00:19:20.027
[PROCTOR]
You may open your
booklets and begin!

00:19:20.462 --> 00:19:22.199
HWAAAH!

00:19:22.299 --> 00:19:25.238
(PEW)
<i>Oh, I remember this one...</i>

00:19:25.338 --> 00:19:26.607
This'll be on there.

00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:28.711
<i>Ms. Yamato helped me</i>
<i>with this one...</i>

00:19:28.811 --> 00:19:30.282
I made some
flashcards for you!

00:19:30.382 --> 00:19:33.655
<i>All right, not so bad.</i>
<i>I think I got this section!</i>

00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:36.260
<i>Eat that, World History!</i>

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.462
<i>Yeah! Come on!</i>

00:19:37.563 --> 00:19:39.266
(GASP)

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.040
NOOO!

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:46.414
<i>All my answers are off by one!</i>

00:19:48.217 --> 00:19:50.855
[RINKO]
...and that made all of the rest
of my answers off by one spot.

00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:53.061
<i>Where?! Where did I screw up?!</i>

00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:55.665
<i>Where did everything</i>
<i>start getting shifted?!</i>

00:19:55.765 --> 00:19:57.469
<i>I won't let this defeat me!</i>
<i>I'll fix it!</i>

00:19:57.569 --> 00:20:01.177
<i>I'll keep working</i>
<i>until the very last second!</i>

00:20:01.277 --> 00:20:02.579
(Heartbeat)

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:05.752
(Heaving breaths)

00:20:05.852 --> 00:20:08.291
[RINKO]
Oh God, Takeo!
What's wrong with you?

00:20:08.391 --> 00:20:10.962
His answers were all
off by one question.
HUH?!

00:20:11.063 --> 00:20:14.303
I tried to go back
and fix it, but I didn't
get back to the end.

00:20:14.403 --> 00:20:17.109
<i>After all the work they put</i>
<i>into helping me study...</i>

00:20:17.209 --> 00:20:19.780
<i>After all the encouragement</i>
<i>they gave me...</i>

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.317
I'm really sorry...
sorry, you guys!

00:20:21.417 --> 00:20:23.454
[SUNA]
It's a good thing this
wasn't the actual test.

00:20:23.554 --> 00:20:26.460
[RINKO]
That's right. This is only
the first round, okay?

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.763
First round...

00:20:27.863 --> 00:20:30.068
[TAKEO]
I'm gonna get another chance!

00:20:30.168 --> 00:20:32.105
Right! You can't
beat me that easy!

00:20:32.205 --> 00:20:34.743
I can take whatever you
throw at me, understand?!

00:20:34.843 --> 00:20:36.714
There ya go.
Yeah, that's the spirit!

00:20:36.814 --> 00:20:40.255
(Boys roughhousing)

00:20:40.355 --> 00:20:42.659
So does this mean my
grade here was an X?

00:20:42.759 --> 00:20:45.131
I think it's just
marking "intermediate."

00:20:45.231 --> 00:20:47.302
It means you're gonna have
to do better next time.

00:20:47.402 --> 00:20:48.538
HMM?!

00:20:48.638 --> 00:20:50.141
Impossible...

00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:54.550
I guess I should
tell Ms. Yamato.

00:20:55.585 --> 00:20:57.255
[RINKO]
That's okay...

00:20:57.356 --> 00:21:00.795
I mean Murasakifuji wasn't
really a possibility anyway,
right?

00:21:00.895 --> 00:21:02.199
Mm-hmm...

00:21:02.299 --> 00:21:05.505
And well, it looks pretty
impossible for me, too.

00:21:05.605 --> 00:21:06.941
You know, Hakuto
looks pretty good.

00:21:07.041 --> 00:21:08.678
And if we work really hard,

00:21:08.778 --> 00:21:10.148
I bet we can both
get accepted there.

00:21:10.248 --> 00:21:12.986
Think about it. It can
get us what we both want.

00:21:13.087 --> 00:21:14.923
We just have to do
the best we can.

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:16.794
You'd give up
on Murasakifuji?

00:21:16.894 --> 00:21:18.698
Huh? Oh, yeah,
I'm fine with that.

00:21:18.798 --> 00:21:22.038
And I'm not so sure it would be
the right place for me anyway.

00:21:22.139 --> 00:21:23.875
I've had enough of
an all-girls school.

00:21:23.975 --> 00:21:27.582
Uhh...
(Echoing)
An all girl's school...
An all girl's school...

00:21:27.683 --> 00:21:30.288
Yeah, I think they might notice
if you tried to fake it.

00:21:30.388 --> 00:21:32.192
You might stand out
a little bit.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.596
(Suna chuckling)
Oh, huh?

00:21:34.697 --> 00:21:37.769
[TAKEO]
Suna?! You are so dead! How
could you do this to me?!

00:21:37.869 --> 00:21:39.606
Huh?! Takeo!

00:21:39.707 --> 00:21:43.514
(Suna laughs)
(Takeo screams)
