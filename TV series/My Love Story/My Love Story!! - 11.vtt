00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:07.327

00:00:07.427 --> 00:00:09.465
<i>And summer break is the best.</i>

[SUNA]
That's impressive...
in its own way.

HMPH!

Huh?

Ah! Hey, Takeo?

00:00:38.624 --> 00:00:39.693
Beach, huh?

00:00:39.793 --> 00:00:40.661
Mm-hmm!

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:41.830
You remember the other day

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.266
we were talking about
how we wanted

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.470
to take a trip to the beach
with all our friends?

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:47.942
Tell him to invite Suna!
For the love of God!

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:49.579
Oh and uh, bring
Suna along, too.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.554

Are you kidding? A beach trip
with Goda's girlfriend and all
of her yummy friends?

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:30.981
Heck yeah! I am in!

Me, too!
You know it!

[TAKEO]
Suna, guess what;
you're coming, too.
Huh?

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:44.943
I cannot wait to see all
the girls in their bikinis.

You're out.

Huh?
You've been uninvited!

00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:49.519
What? How come?

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:53.292
Swimsuits are for swimming
and swimming alone!

00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:54.996
Huh? Are you crazy?

00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:58.069
We're talking about the beach!
It's all about the bodies!
Heck yeah!

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.275
Aren't you at least curious
to see what your girlfriend
looks like in a swimsuit?

00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:03.446
Guh! My girlfriend will
be wearing her swimsuit

00:03:03.547 --> 00:03:05.283
with the sole
intention of swimming!

00:03:05.383 --> 00:03:07.822
And I am not going to
disgrace myself or her

00:03:07.922 --> 00:03:09.258
by ogling her body!

Uhh...

So which one are you thinking?

00:03:17.107 --> 00:03:19.144

You can pick whatever.
You've got the boobs for it.

00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:22.317
[KOJIMA]
Says the one with long legs and
a perfectly flat little tummy.

00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:24.556
Oh, look! This one's cute!
I love it!

00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:26.760
[RINKO]
Um. What do you guys
think about this?

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.496

Huh?

00:03:29.264 --> 00:03:30.768
[ALL]
Uhh...

00:03:30.868 --> 00:03:31.837
You serious?

00:03:31.937 --> 00:03:34.241
Oh! Okay so, not
this one, huh?

00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:36.913
Then how about...
this one?!

00:03:37.013 --> 00:03:37.949
[ALL]
Uhh...

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.519
Or maybe... this one?!

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.422
Rinko, are you
feeling alright?

00:03:41.523 --> 00:03:45.296
Yeah... It's just, you know
how hot and dreamy Takeo is.

00:03:45.396 --> 00:03:47.902
[ALL] Uh?!
[NANAKO] Uh, yeah, sure.

00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:50.106
And well, compared to him,
I look like a little bitty kid!

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:52.845
I just want to live up to
all his manliness, y'know!

00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:55.150
[AYU]
<i>I'm not sure I'd call</i>
<i>him "hot and dreamy."</i>

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.421
[YUKO]
<i>He doesn't look like</i>
<i>a high school student.</i>
<i>He looks like a grown man.</i>

00:03:57.522 --> 00:03:59.291
[MANA]
<i>He's covered in hair</i>
<i>and giant muscles.</i>

00:03:59.391 --> 00:04:00.961
[KOJIMA]
<i>He looks like an</i>
<i>Olympic weightlifter</i>

00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:02.464
<i>or a professional wrestler.</i>

00:04:02.565 --> 00:04:04.201
[NANAKO]
I AM curious as to
what kind of swimsuit

00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:05.538
he's going to wear.

00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:07.507
Probably wear his suit
from school!

00:04:07.608 --> 00:04:09.244
I could totally see that!
(All laugh)

00:04:09.344 --> 00:04:11.081
What if he shows up in tiny
little speedos?!

00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:12.150
Oh my God!

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.787
And wear goggles and swim laps!

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:15.089
So hot and dreamy!

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.160
(Concerned groans)

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.864
[RINKO]
Here's the deal!

00:04:18.964 --> 00:04:22.103
Takeo is ALWAYS making my
heart race out of control.

00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:26.512
So I want to wear
something that's going to
make his heart race, too!

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.015
[ALL]
Oh...

00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:30.019
Oh yeah!
I hear you, girl!

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.290
You want him to lose his mind
the second he sees you!

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.994
You wanna be so cute
he freaks out!

00:04:34.094 --> 00:04:37.300
'Kay, ladies!
Let's help Rinko pick out
the perfect jaw-dropper!

The frilly skirt'll
totally blow up.

[SUNA]
You running away from home?

00:05:06.492 --> 00:05:08.630
I just want to be
ready for tomorrow.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.268
And I wanted to cover YOU
in case you forgot anything.

00:05:11.368 --> 00:05:15.076
And I've got enough tents and
canteens for everybody else.

00:05:15.176 --> 00:05:16.713
Uh. We're just going
to the beach.

00:05:16.813 --> 00:05:19.786
There's always a chance that we
could get stranded out there.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:22.123
It's not gonna hurt us
to be prepared, y'know.

00:05:22.224 --> 00:05:23.259
Whatever. You're crazy.

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:25.063
(Cell phone rings)
Huh?

00:05:25.163 --> 00:05:27.000
Oh. It's Ms. Yamato.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.135
Hello there.

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:29.438
[RINKO]
Hey, Takeo.

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.342
Um, there's news of
a typhoon approaching.

00:05:31.442 --> 00:05:33.714
You sure we're gonna
be all right tomorrow?

00:05:33.814 --> 00:05:34.849
A typhoon?

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.887
The sun always seems
to shine wherever you go.

00:05:36.987 --> 00:05:41.028
Suna says the sun follows me
wherever I go. We'll be okay.

00:05:41.128 --> 00:05:43.132
(Rinko laughs)
Is that so?

00:05:43.232 --> 00:05:44.669
I'm at Suna's place right now.

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:47.207
We're getting our things
ready for tomorrow.

00:05:47.307 --> 00:05:49.077
I'm getting ready
right now, myself.

00:05:49.177 --> 00:05:51.148
I'm really looking
forward to this.

00:05:51.248 --> 00:05:52.752
Hmm! I can't wait!

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.421
Okay, see you
tomorrow then!

00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:56.158
Alright I'll see you later!

00:05:56.258 --> 00:05:57.995

[SUNA]
Uh, hey.
Huh?

00:05:59.866 --> 00:06:01.035
What is that?

00:06:01.135 --> 00:06:03.640
Watermelons. We're playing
split-the-watermelon, right?

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.312
Well yeah, I'm sure we are.
But do we need that many of 'em?

00:06:06.412 --> 00:06:10.453
And you might want to wait
until you're actually at
the beach to blow those up.

00:06:10.554 --> 00:06:11.890
Easier to pack that way.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.459
Oh, that's a good idea.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.931
Takeo? Are you
sure you're okay?

00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:18.035
Of course.
What do you mean?

00:06:18.135 --> 00:06:19.539
Well, um... it's just...

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.208
You mean the weather?

00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:23.179
[SUNA]
<i>Oh, forget it.</i>

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.882

<i>Man, I love the beach.</i>

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:29.491
<i>When I was a kid, I saw</i>

<i>and the sun melted</i>

Hm!

00:06:35.203 --> 00:06:37.073

There we go!

Takeo! I can't believe
how sunny it is!

00:06:58.517 --> 00:07:00.955
Uh-huh!
Hey, ladies, it's been a while!

00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:02.023
Good to see you, girls!

You boys doing well?

[KAKITANI]
So uh, how are we getting there?

00:07:04.762 --> 00:07:06.800
[AYU]
A train and a bus!

00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:09.037
So how'd you do
on your finals?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.878
Seriously dude?
Finals?
(All laugh)

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:14.983
Something wrong?
Is it too hot in here?

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:17.688
Huh? Nuh-uh...

This looks like a good spot
for an umbrella.

You sure you're
doing that right?

00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:50.921
Just stick it
in there.

Holy crap!

You just blew that
thing up in one breath!

Where are
the girls?

<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:44.467
<i>The perfect place...</i>
<i>for catching crabs!</i>

00:15:45.436 --> 00:15:47.106
<i>Leave it to me,</i>
<i>Ms. Yamato.</i>

00:15:47.206 --> 00:15:49.979
<i>Nobody catches</i>
<i>crabs like me.</i>

00:15:55.857 --> 00:15:57.059
Ahhh!

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.301
(Heart throbbing)

00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:03.438
<i>Just do it!</i>

00:16:06.478 --> 00:16:07.446
Takeo...!

00:16:07.548 --> 00:16:08.616
Whoa... look out.

00:16:08.716 --> 00:16:09.852
Ah, huh?

00:16:09.952 --> 00:16:12.023
That was pretty
close.

00:16:12.691 --> 00:16:14.427
Ohh...

00:16:15.296 --> 00:16:16.398
Huh?

00:16:16.498 --> 00:16:18.068
Ah!

00:16:18.502 --> 00:16:19.270
Hm?

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.208
Ah! Oh gosh!
What's my problem?

00:16:21.308 --> 00:16:22.811
I don't know
what I'm doing.

00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:24.514
I am so, so sorry!

00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:26.619
I... I'm sorry!

00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:29.792
Ms. Yamato...?

00:16:29.892 --> 00:16:30.827
Ah!

00:16:30.927 --> 00:16:33.298
Ahh...
Oh, crap...

00:16:40.412 --> 00:16:43.318
[TAKEO]
There you go. Like this.

00:16:43.418 --> 00:16:45.122
Hm?

00:16:46.358 --> 00:16:47.928
[SUNA]
<i>What's this all about?</i>

00:16:48.028 --> 00:16:50.132
(Girls growling)
Huh?

00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:53.438
Huh? Suna!

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.679
(Swooning)
I'll take care of this.
You go find her.

00:16:56.779 --> 00:16:58.181
Thanks, I really
appreciate it.

00:16:58.282 --> 00:16:59.518
Yeah, yeah...

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:01.656
(Grunting)

00:17:09.203 --> 00:17:13.078
(Footsteps)

00:17:13.178 --> 00:17:15.082
Ms. Yamato.
Ah!

00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:18.322
Hey, Takeo...

00:17:19.257 --> 00:17:21.328
Is there like,
something bothering you?

00:17:21.428 --> 00:17:22.731
Um...

00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:25.202
Mm...

00:17:26.371 --> 00:17:28.543
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

00:17:28.643 --> 00:17:31.549
It's like I'm
walking around in a daze.

00:17:31.649 --> 00:17:36.157
I've got my head in the clouds,
stumbling my way around.

00:17:36.892 --> 00:17:38.763
It's like I'm all in my head.

00:17:38.863 --> 00:17:40.132
(Sigh)

00:17:40.232 --> 00:17:42.671
I'm only thinking of myself.

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:45.276
I feel clumsy... and selfish.

00:17:45.376 --> 00:17:48.215
I can feel the exact
same way sometimes.

00:17:49.952 --> 00:17:51.856
Can I sit with you?

00:17:51.956 --> 00:17:53.292
Huh?

00:17:53.392 --> 00:17:54.027
Mm-hmm.

00:17:54.127 --> 00:17:59.738
(Waves crashing)

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.848
[TAKEO]
Now THAT is stunning.

00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:07.486
Yeah. It really is.

00:18:11.294 --> 00:18:15.336
<i>Hm. Well, here we are.</i>

00:18:15.436 --> 00:18:17.908
<i>I almost forgot that this</i>
<i>is what I wanted to do</i>

00:18:18.008 --> 00:18:20.446
<i>with Ms. Yamato all along.</i>

00:18:20.547 --> 00:18:24.287
<i>Sometimes things just work out.</i>

00:18:24.387 --> 00:18:29.197
<i>I couldn't be happier</i>
<i>than I am right now.</i>

00:18:29.765 --> 00:18:31.535
It's overwhelming...

00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:39.918
[RINKO]
Ya know, the ocean is
just so wide and open

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:42.724
and full of
endless possibilities.

00:18:42.824 --> 00:18:44.394
And it...

00:18:44.494 --> 00:18:47.299
It makes me want
to explore them all.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.838
And do it with you.

00:18:49.938 --> 00:18:51.542
(Laugh)

00:18:52.143 --> 00:18:53.780
<i>Ms. Yamato.</i>

00:18:56.484 --> 00:18:58.488
<i>You're everything to me.</i>

00:18:58.589 --> 00:18:59.925
[RINKO]
Ah!

00:19:00.025 --> 00:19:01.696
HM!

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.202
Not on my watch.

00:19:05.302 --> 00:19:08.609
Ohh? Ha, nice save!

00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:17.527
[TAKEO]
<i>Is it the sunset?</i>

00:19:20.199 --> 00:19:22.470
<i>I'm feeling so hot right now...</i>

00:19:22.571 --> 00:19:26.779
<i>And my heart</i>
<i>is really pounding.</i>

00:19:30.954 --> 00:19:32.557
Oh?

00:19:34.327 --> 00:19:37.701
Ms. Yamato... I love you.

00:19:40.607 --> 00:19:42.410
(Gasp)

00:19:45.315 --> 00:19:48.523
Oh, Takeo, I love you, too.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.937
<i>Ms. Yamato...</i>

00:19:58.075 --> 00:19:59.711
<i>I...</i>

00:20:01.882 --> 00:20:03.051
<i>I, uh...</i>

00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:05.957
(Heart throbbing)

00:20:06.525 --> 00:20:07.894
(CRASH)

00:20:07.994 --> 00:20:10.800
Oh, there you two are!
What the heck are you doing?

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.338
C'mon, it's time to
spark up some fireworks.

00:20:13.438 --> 00:20:15.008
Time to blow stuff up! Woo!

00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:16.979
[KURIHARA]
Let's go, lovebirds!

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:21.421
(Sizzling)

00:20:21.522 --> 00:20:22.991
[NANAKO]
It's okay...

00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:26.498
So you didn't make his heart
skip a beat, maybe next time.

00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:27.934
Mm-hmm.

00:20:28.034 --> 00:20:30.239
Well you two still
had fun, right?

00:20:31.341 --> 00:20:35.550
We did. We had a
truly wonderful time.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.721
We're totally gonna
have to do this again.

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:40.259
We should all get together
and go to a fireworks show.

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:41.662
And we can all dress up.

00:20:41.762 --> 00:20:42.396
And wear yukatas!

00:20:42.496 --> 00:20:43.733
[RINKO]
Yukata?!

00:20:43.833 --> 00:20:44.735
[ALL]
Hm?

00:20:44.835 --> 00:20:46.004
That'll be great!

00:20:46.104 --> 00:20:48.643
I can totally drive him
crazy in something like that!

00:20:48.743 --> 00:20:50.312
[GIRLS]
Huh?!

00:20:50.947 --> 00:20:52.349
[TAKEO]
Suna.
Hm?

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.621
I had quite an experience today.

00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:57.928
When we were watching the sunset
something happened to me.

00:20:58.028 --> 00:21:00.199
Oh yeah? Well
that's great, man.

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:02.002
Hm! Yes, it was.

00:21:06.779 --> 00:21:07.981
(Boys snoring)

00:21:08.081 --> 00:21:09.150
(Shutter sound)

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.486
Um, Takeo?

00:21:10.587 --> 00:21:12.724
You think we could go
to a fireworks show soon?

00:21:12.824 --> 00:21:13.726
With the gang?

00:21:13.826 --> 00:21:16.231
Huh? Well, yeah!
That would be awesome.

00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:19.303
[RINKO]
<i>And this time, I'm going</i>

[TAKEO]
<i>Perfect. I can't wait to</i>
<i>feel what I felt on the beach</i>
<i>all over again.</i>

00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:26.151
You like fireworks,
don't you, Takeo?

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:27.687
Yeah, they're a blast.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.490
(Both giggling)

00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:31.294

00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:35.637
<i>Oh, well...</i>

00:21:35.737 --> 00:21:38.809
<i>Maybe they don't have to.</i>

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.951
