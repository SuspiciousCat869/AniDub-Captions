00:09:08.204 --> 00:09:09.574
Let go of me!

Huh?

00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:18.124
Um, uh, thank... you...

(Struggling)

00:09:43.608 --> 00:09:46.280
(Groper cries out)
So where should we take
a loser like this?

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.152
Maybe hand him over to a
station attendant or something?

00:09:49.252 --> 00:09:50.388
(Struggling continues)

00:09:50.488 --> 00:09:51.691
We can handle
things from here.

C'mon, man, I can't breathe!
So you can g-

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.997
No, I'm coming with you!

[OFFICER]
What?

00:09:57.435 --> 00:09:59.974
You say you caught this guy
groping on the train?

00:10:00.074 --> 00:10:01.310
Yeah!

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.180
Alright, you can let him go.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.483
Let's hear what he has to say.

00:10:04.584 --> 00:10:06.053
Yes, Sir!
Ahh!

00:10:06.153 --> 00:10:07.723
(Coughing)

00:10:07.823 --> 00:10:09.426
He's crazy! I didn't
do nothin' okay!

00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:10.662
[SUNA]
We saw you.

00:10:10.762 --> 00:10:12.065
I don't know what you're
talking about!

00:10:12.165 --> 00:10:15.004
Officer, this guy
physically assaulted me!

00:10:15.104 --> 00:10:16.808
I was minding
my own business,

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.045
and he just grabs my
arm outta nowhere!

00:10:19.146 --> 00:10:21.584
Then he starts to choke me!
He's the criminal here...

00:10:21.684 --> 00:10:23.020
He was touching me!

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.822
HUH?!

00:10:23.922 --> 00:10:25.358
[RINKO]
It's true! He was!

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.262
And this guy helped me!

00:10:27.362 --> 00:10:31.604
Oh yeah? Well what were
you wearing a skirt
that short for then, huh?

00:10:31.704 --> 00:10:34.610
You... You were asking
for it and you know it!

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.415
(Rinko whimpers)
(Groper laughs)

00:10:37.516 --> 00:10:38.852
HYAH!

00:10:38.952 --> 00:10:40.087
GAH! AH!

00:10:40.188 --> 00:10:41.089
[OFFICER]
Easy...

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.392
(Gasp)
Ugh!

00:10:42.492 --> 00:10:43.829
You shut your filthy hole!

00:10:43.929 --> 00:10:45.532
She was doing no such thing!

00:10:45.632 --> 00:10:47.268

[SUNA]
Here's the notes from class.

00:11:07.175 --> 00:11:09.312
Not that you're going
to study or anything.

00:11:09.412 --> 00:11:11.149
[TAKEO]
Hm.

00:11:11.684 --> 00:11:13.120
(Chuckle)

(Stifled laughter)

00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:24.409
It's not funny, Suna!

00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:25.478
(Doorbell)

00:11:25.579 --> 00:11:26.948
[TAKEO'S MOM]
Coming!

00:11:27.048 --> 00:11:28.952
[SUNA]
I can't believe you went
after him like that.

00:11:29.052 --> 00:11:30.789
(Footsteps)
Well, yeah I can.

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:32.125
[TAKEO]
Oh, shut up.

00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:34.229
But I totally didn't
expect you to punch him

00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:35.532
in front of a cop.

00:11:35.632 --> 00:11:36.768
He pissed me off.

00:11:36.868 --> 00:11:38.103
[MOM]
Oh, yes. Please.

00:11:38.203 --> 00:11:39.674
Just a second.
I guess so.

00:11:39.774 --> 00:11:42.680
Take! There's a young girl
here to see you!

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.284
She says her name is Rinko!
Should I let her in?

00:11:45.384 --> 00:11:46.754
[TAKEO]
Yeah.

00:11:47.556 --> 00:11:49.192
"Rinko"? Who's that?

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:50.461
I'm not sure.

00:11:50.562 --> 00:11:52.298
I don't remember
a Rinko at school.

00:11:52.398 --> 00:11:53.167
Hm?

00:11:53.267 --> 00:11:54.502
Okay. So, Takeo...

00:11:54.604 --> 00:11:57.108
You're gonna let a
girl in THIS ROOM?

00:11:57.208 --> 00:11:58.143
AHH!

00:11:58.244 --> 00:12:01.751
(Intense grunting)

00:12:01.851 --> 00:12:03.922
MOM! Ask her to
wait a minute!

00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:06.293
I got dirty undies
all over the place!

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.163
Um... Hello.

00:12:08.264 --> 00:12:09.734
Ah!

00:12:12.171 --> 00:12:13.775
Oh...

00:12:14.677 --> 00:12:18.450
I wanted to, uh,
thank for yesterday.

00:12:23.494 --> 00:12:25.431
<i>I like her!</i>

I better get going.

00:12:30.074 --> 00:12:32.579
Oh! Wait, so
you're leaving?!

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:39.259
<i>Oh. I see.</i>
<i>So it's this again.</i>

00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:42.465
Oh! Um, here.

00:12:42.566 --> 00:12:44.169
I brought this to thank you...

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:46.306
And well, there's enough
for all of us.

00:12:46.406 --> 00:12:48.077
If you want some...

00:12:48.177 --> 00:12:50.381
Ohh...?
[RINKO] Unless, of course,

00:12:50.481 --> 00:12:52.018
you don't like sweet stuff.

00:12:52.118 --> 00:12:55.157
Oh! I'm sorry! It's weird for me
to just show up all of a sudden.

00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:57.663
I got your address from the
security guy at the station.

00:12:57.763 --> 00:12:59.399
No, it's wonderful!

00:12:59.499 --> 00:13:01.003
Oh?

00:13:01.671 --> 00:13:04.910
(Giggle)
I'm so glad.

00:13:08.685 --> 00:13:10.622
(GULP)
WHOA!

00:13:10.722 --> 00:13:12.793
What is this?!
It's incredible!

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:14.496
Some sort of
cake magic?!

00:13:14.597 --> 00:13:15.866
[SUNA]
It's just cheesecake.

00:13:15.966 --> 00:13:17.502
You mean you've never had
cheesecake before?

00:13:17.603 --> 00:13:20.909
Never! But yeah, totally
tastes like cheese! Mpf!

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.846
What are you talking about?

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:25.919
(Takeo sighs)
[SUNA] Thanks.
It was delicious.

00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:29.225
'Kay. I'm gonna head home
for real this time.

00:13:29.326 --> 00:13:32.298
Ah! I, uh, should
probably get going, too.

00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:33.267
Yeah.

00:13:33.367 --> 00:13:35.939
(Light grunt)

<i>I was able...</i>

00:13:40.314 --> 00:13:42.886
Well thanks again for
everything you did yesterday.

00:13:42.986 --> 00:13:46.661
<i>But I guess... I guess</i>
<i>that's where it ends.</i>

00:13:46.761 --> 00:13:47.963
[RINKO]
See ya.

00:13:48.063 --> 00:13:51.571
<i>Well, I did get some cake.</i>

00:13:53.073 --> 00:13:58.283
<i>And I liked it.</i>
<i>So, that's good.</i>

00:13:58.384 --> 00:14:00.856
<i>I was given the chance</i>
<i>to help a nice girl.</i>

<i>And that's something</i>
<i>to be proud of.</i>

00:14:04.897 --> 00:14:08.037
<i>So, that's... that.</i>

00:14:12.713 --> 00:14:14.349
Hm...

00:14:15.184 --> 00:14:18.558
(Cellphone rings)
Huh?

00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:24.402
<i>What's this doing here?</i>

00:14:25.939 --> 00:14:28.110
<i>It's not Suna's.</i>

00:14:49.954 --> 00:14:51.591
<i>Huh? Sure.</i>

00:14:51.691 --> 00:14:53.160
Yeah. We can meet.
Uh!

00:15:07.923 --> 00:15:10.762
You get a new phone?
Pink's an odd choice.

00:15:10.862 --> 00:15:13.000
That girl from
yesterday left it.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.906
I'm on my way to
give it back to her.

I'm so sorry for
all the trouble!
Thank you so much!

00:15:51.376 --> 00:15:53.380
Oh, no, there's
no need for that.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.919
It's not that big
of a deal really.

00:15:56.019 --> 00:15:57.823
You a freshmen, too?

Yes, I am.
Um, thank you.

00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:02.031

Oh, here!
Hm?

00:16:04.102 --> 00:16:06.339
I wanted to thank you
for helping me again!

00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:08.143
I mean you did come
all the way out here

00:16:08.243 --> 00:16:09.914
just to give me
back my phone.

00:16:10.014 --> 00:16:14.122
If you want to, we could sit
down somewhere and have some.

00:16:14.222 --> 00:16:15.625
Hmm.

00:16:16.627 --> 00:16:18.030
Ahhmm.

This is awesome!

Macarons!

Oh well good!

00:16:30.287 --> 00:16:32.091
I actually made these
AND the cheesecake.

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:33.561
I'm glad you like 'em!

00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:34.530
Guh!

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:35.999
These are hand-baked?!

00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:37.536
You mean, "handmade."

00:16:37.636 --> 00:16:38.738
Waagh!

I heard you have to be
pretty strong to be a baker.

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:07.194
<i>Is it love?</i>

00:17:07.295 --> 00:17:10.134
<i>Does she already</i>

00:17:10.234 --> 00:17:11.469
You're totally staring.

And invading
her personal space.

OH!

<i>I don't... understand.</i>

00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:44.202
<i>There's no point</i>

00:17:44.302 --> 00:17:47.041

Oh jeez!
You're soaking wet!

00:17:53.922 --> 00:17:56.827
Hold on, I'll get a towel!
You just wait right there.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.446
You could wipe
yourself off, y'know?

<i>I can't...</i>

00:18:09.052 --> 00:18:13.528

I, uh...

00:18:21.844 --> 00:18:25.417
I'd like to eat cake
with you again, if I can.

00:18:25.518 --> 00:18:28.457
Would you bake another
one sometime? Please?

Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:18:32.231 --> 00:18:33.635
Well the next specialty
cake I'm going to make

00:18:33.735 --> 00:18:35.839
is probably going
to be a Sachertorte.

00:18:35.939 --> 00:18:37.676
What do you think?
That sound good?

00:18:37.776 --> 00:18:41.149
Oh yeah! I'm a huge fan
of Sachertootos.

00:18:41.249 --> 00:18:44.255
Really? You have no idea
what that is, do you?

00:18:44.355 --> 00:18:47.863
[RINKO]
Perfect! Then next time,
I'll bring a Sachertorte!

00:18:47.963 --> 00:18:49.198

So when she
bakes her cakes,

00:19:04.763 --> 00:19:07.335
she doesn't even
use a hand mixer.

00:19:07.435 --> 00:19:08.236
Huh.

00:19:08.337 --> 00:19:09.873
She likes putting
in the effort,

00:19:09.973 --> 00:19:11.911
and making it all
happen herself.

00:19:12.011 --> 00:19:15.451
Is that so? That's
kinda different.

00:19:17.355 --> 00:19:21.196
She seems like
a real nice girl.
