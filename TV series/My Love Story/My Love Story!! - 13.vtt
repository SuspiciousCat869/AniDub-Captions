00:08:35.162 --> 00:08:38.035
and find out exactly what
kind of guy he really is.

00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:42.243
I need to know what it takes
for you to fall in love with
someone. Especially me.

00:08:42.343 --> 00:08:43.279
Oda, no!

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:45.016
You at least owe
me that much.

00:08:45.116 --> 00:08:48.055
I mean, he is the whole
reason you won't go
out with me, isn't he?

00:08:48.155 --> 00:08:49.558
Please don't do this!

00:08:49.658 --> 00:08:51.895
If you get involved, it'll
just get really complicated!

00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:53.499
Mind your own business!

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:57.040
Those two are perfectly happy.
She is a really nice girl, okay?

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.876
And I'm totally fine with it!

00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:00.646
I have already
come to terms with this.

00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:04.254
Can't you leave this whole thing
alone? And leave me alone!

00:09:04.354 --> 00:09:06.592
You have to go.
You have to go home.

00:09:06.692 --> 00:09:09.164
Hmph...
I'll walk you to
the train station!

00:09:09.898 --> 00:09:12.237
Let's go!
Get a move-on!

00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:14.774
Hmph... Coming, my love.

00:09:14.874 --> 00:09:16.712
I have a question
for you, my dear.

00:09:16.812 --> 00:09:19.884
How did you know that
I'd be at THAT cafe?
Did you follow me?

00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:24.194
[AI]
Ugh. You sent me a text
that said, "I'm going to
see Takeo right now"!

00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:27.500
[RINKO]
It was nice to see
Suna's sister again.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.905
[TAKEO]
Haven't seen her since
their dad's surgery.

00:09:30.006 --> 00:09:34.347
I know, right?
She gave me a lot of sisterly
advice last time she was here.

00:09:34.447 --> 00:09:35.583
With what?

00:09:35.683 --> 00:09:37.053
Oh, well, uh...

00:09:37.153 --> 00:09:39.257
She helped me a whole
bunch with stuff about you.

00:09:39.357 --> 00:09:41.528
So I'd like to
thank her if I could.

00:09:41.628 --> 00:09:44.334
I wonder if she'd like it
if I baked her something.

00:09:44.434 --> 00:09:47.340
Yeah! I'm sure
she'd love that!

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.175
Good!

00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:49.544
(Content sigh)

00:09:49.644 --> 00:09:51.648
But I wonder what the deal
was with that guy...

00:09:51.748 --> 00:09:53.285
That was weird.
I know!

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:55.856
Seemed like they must have
some history or somethin'.

00:09:55.957 --> 00:09:57.827
[AI]
I'm home!

00:09:57.927 --> 00:09:59.064
[SUNA]
Hey there.

00:09:59.164 --> 00:10:01.368
[AI]
Oh, can I have
some coffee, too?

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:03.072
[SUNA]
How long are you
staying this time?

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:05.543
Oomph. I'll be heading
out Sunday night.

00:10:05.643 --> 00:10:06.645
(Sigh)

00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:09.084
[SUNA]
So did that friend
of yours go back?

00:10:09.184 --> 00:10:10.953
Yeah, I was just walking
him to the station.

00:10:11.054 --> 00:10:13.892
(Gasp)
Did Takeo say anything
about today?

00:10:13.993 --> 00:10:16.932
No, not really.
He didn't...

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.371
(Dejected sigh)

00:10:20.973 --> 00:10:25.116
By the way, when did he start
working at Macho's, anyway?

00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:26.551
This past summer.

00:10:26.652 --> 00:10:28.856
His girlfriend doesn't
say anything about it?

00:10:28.956 --> 00:10:30.292
I think she kinda likes it.

00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:32.397
Yeah... I guess he did
look pretty hot

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:34.401
in that little uniform,
didn't he?

00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:35.403
(Giggle)

00:10:35.503 --> 00:10:36.905
Hm...

00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:38.809
(Chewing and snarling)

00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:43.352
<i>Wonder where Ms. Yamato and I</i>
<i>go with my latest paycheck.</i>

00:10:43.686 --> 00:10:44.688
OOH!

00:10:44.788 --> 00:10:47.493
[RINKO, ON PHONE]
MM Land? That sounds fun.

00:10:47.593 --> 00:10:50.433
I love that place!
But it can be kinda pricey.

00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:51.435
<i>Bingo!</i>

00:10:51.535 --> 00:10:53.205
Would you like to
go there sometime?

00:10:53.305 --> 00:10:55.076
What?! Oh!

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:57.213
Uuh...

00:10:57.313 --> 00:10:59.117
I think I'll pass.

00:10:59.217 --> 00:11:01.655
Oh, okay...

00:11:01.755 --> 00:11:04.594
[TAKEO]
She said, "What?! Oh! Oh..."

00:11:04.694 --> 00:11:08.435
What do you think
that means?! Help me!

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:12.510
[TAKEO]
<i>Oops, that's right.</i>
<i>His sister is here visiting.</i>

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:13.579
Hello there, Ai.

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:15.649
[TAKEO]
<i>Once when I was just a kid,</i>

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.290
<i>I accidentally barged in on her</i>
<i>when she was in her pajamas.</i>

00:11:19.391 --> 00:11:22.363
<i>I was pretty embarrassed.</i>
<i>She didn't seem to mind.</i>

00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:25.836
<i>But I still probably shouldn't</i>
<i>just walk in whenever I want.</i>

00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:27.840
Takeo, I'm sorry
about earlier.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.842
Huh?

00:11:28.942 --> 00:11:30.112
At the cafe, I mean.

00:11:30.212 --> 00:11:32.250
Was that guy a
friend of yours?

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.320
Uh... more like we
attended the same seminar.

00:11:34.421 --> 00:11:35.956
So, not a friend?

00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:37.493
I'm sorry if he was rude.

00:11:37.593 --> 00:11:39.230
No, I was the
one rude one.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.706
I thought he was messing
with Suna, so I was a
little harsh. Sorry.

00:11:43.806 --> 00:11:44.641
(Chuckle)

00:11:44.741 --> 00:11:47.547
[AI]
So, what's wrong, Takeo?
Huh?

00:11:47.647 --> 00:11:49.517
There's something you wanted
to ask my brother about.

00:11:49.617 --> 00:11:53.592
Oh... Well, I invited Ms. Yamato
to go with me to MM Land ...

00:11:53.692 --> 00:11:56.364
but she didn't really seem
all that excited about it...

00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:57.633
But it's MM Land.

00:11:57.734 --> 00:12:00.706
It was like she wanted
to go... but didn't.

00:12:00.806 --> 00:12:01.575
(Sigh)

00:12:01.675 --> 00:12:03.579
Not sure what's going on.

00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:04.814
(Ai laughs)

00:12:04.914 --> 00:12:06.118
I can ask her for you, okay?

00:12:06.218 --> 00:12:07.820
Oooooohhh!
We can all have
tea tomorrow!

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.326
And I'll just casually throw it
out there while we're talking.

00:12:10.426 --> 00:12:11.461
You're the best ever!

00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:13.065
[AI]
Just leave it to me!

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:14.300
Thanks, Sis!

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.371
Well, see you tomorrow!

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.277
Hm...

00:12:19.377 --> 00:12:21.982
You really can't leave
him to his own devices.

00:12:22.083 --> 00:12:24.187
Uh! What?!

00:12:24.287 --> 00:12:26.358
Hey, c'mon don't
look at me like that!

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:29.130
Don't worry, it's
not the same anymore.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.802
(Sigh)
I really want to
support them.

00:12:31.902 --> 00:12:34.541
Besides, they were
meant for each other.

00:12:34.641 --> 00:12:39.851
Hm... I honestly do want
the two of them to live
happily ever after.

00:12:44.127 --> 00:12:45.329
[RINKO]
Takeo!

00:12:45.429 --> 00:12:46.965
(Giggling)

00:12:47.567 --> 00:12:49.137
It's been a while!

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:51.541
[RINKO]
Hey there, Sis!
Good to see you!

00:12:53.278 --> 00:12:56.051
So do you prefer to drink
black tea over coffee?

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:58.355
Oh I drink coffee,
too. I like both.

00:12:58.455 --> 00:13:00.126
What about you?
What do you like?

00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:01.294
I think I prefer black tea.

00:13:01.394 --> 00:13:03.365
Yeah, I guess
you would.

00:13:03.465 --> 00:13:06.371
I like to drink water.
Oh, and juice, too.

00:13:06.471 --> 00:13:08.575
[AI]
Takeo, you're such a kid!

00:13:08.675 --> 00:13:10.546
So, uh, hey...
Huh?

00:13:10.646 --> 00:13:12.316
Have you ever been to MM Land?

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:14.220
<i>Ack. She didn't</i>
<i>waste any time.</i>

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.489
Oh, yeah.

00:13:15.589 --> 00:13:18.395
That place is so much
fun. I just love it.

00:13:18.495 --> 00:13:19.898
<i>Probably for the best.</i>

00:13:19.998 --> 00:13:22.470
<i>Avoiding the issue would</i>
<i>just make things awkward.</i>

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.808
[RINKO]
Yeah, totally! Me too!

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:26.344
<i>What? She loves it?</i>

00:13:26.444 --> 00:13:28.949
[AI]
Then, why don't you
want to go with Takeo?

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.286
Huh?

00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:31.888
(Confident chuckle)
[SUNA]
<i>Way to go, Sis.</i>

00:13:31.988 --> 00:13:33.125
Very tactful.

00:13:33.225 --> 00:13:36.031
Oh, um. It's just,
I can't go with Takeo.

00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:39.437
How come? Is it because you
said it was so expensive?

00:13:39.537 --> 00:13:42.076
No, that's not it.

00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:44.647
You're the one person I
DON'T want to go there with.

00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:45.649
<i>ACK!</i>

00:13:45.749 --> 00:13:48.455
Oh, I'm a huge fan
of MM Land myself!

00:13:48.555 --> 00:13:50.659
(BEEP BEEP BEEP)

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:53.098
Oda! What are you doing?
I though you went back!

00:13:53.198 --> 00:13:54.534
Since I'm in town...

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:56.404
Couldn't pass up the
chance to visit Skytree.

00:13:56.505 --> 00:13:58.809
I am sorry about how
I acted yesterday.

00:13:58.909 --> 00:14:02.183
I had no idea you were an
acquaintance of Suna's sister.

00:14:02.283 --> 00:14:04.020
Uhh... Hehe...

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.556
[ODA]
Really?

00:14:05.656 --> 00:14:08.729
Does that mean she referred to
me as a mere acquaintance?

00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:09.931
That's so cold!

00:14:10.032 --> 00:14:13.338
I wouldn't confess my unending
love to just anyone.

00:14:13.438 --> 00:14:14.874
UUGGHHH!

00:14:14.974 --> 00:14:17.380
Aw, are you saying that you
came all the way out here

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.615
to pursue her?

00:14:18.715 --> 00:14:20.719
Yes. But alas,
she has rejected me.
Huh?

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:24.727
<i>Oh wow. So this guy</i>
<i>was in love with her.</i>

00:14:24.827 --> 00:14:27.166
<i>He doesn't seem</i>
<i>so bad anymore.</i>

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:30.906
Get this... she told me she
was in love with someone else.

00:14:31.007 --> 00:14:31.808
HEY!

00:14:31.908 --> 00:14:33.478
<i>Oh, she has a crush!</i>

00:14:33.579 --> 00:14:36.084
But sadly, her love
is unrequited, as well.

00:14:36.184 --> 00:14:37.620
[TAKEO]
What?! Unrequited?!

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.628
Who would do that to Sis?
They deserve a good pounding!

00:14:41.728 --> 00:14:42.897
Uhh...

00:14:42.997 --> 00:14:44.634
Afraid it can't be helped.

00:14:44.734 --> 00:14:46.705
This fella already has
a girlfriend.

00:14:46.805 --> 00:14:52.016
Okay. I guess that sort of
thing can happen sometimes.

00:14:52.116 --> 00:14:55.356
If you keep on talking, you're
going to be in a world of pain.

00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:57.293
That's... really
close to my eyeball.

00:14:57.393 --> 00:15:00.933
So, is the reason you
don't want to go to MM Land
because of the jinx?

00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:04.007
The one where if
you go as a couple,
then you'll break up?

00:15:04.107 --> 00:15:06.878
Uh... Yeah. Actually...

00:15:06.978 --> 00:15:08.849
Yes, that IS the reason.

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:10.486
What? You serious?

00:15:10.586 --> 00:15:13.392
I've heard about this one
myself. It's kinda strange.

00:15:13.492 --> 00:15:14.961
<i>There's a jinx!</i>

00:15:15.062 --> 00:15:17.667
<i>I guess I don't pay much</i>
<i>attention to stuff like that.</i>

00:15:17.767 --> 00:15:21.374
<i>But I have known some</i>
<i>people who are pretty</i>
<i>superstitious.</i>

00:15:21.474 --> 00:15:23.478
When I hear about
things like that...

00:15:23.578 --> 00:15:25.382

I don't want anything bad
to happen to Takeo and me.

00:15:34.634 --> 00:15:37.506
Why don't you
all go together?!
Huh?

00:15:37.607 --> 00:15:39.310
Then it won't be
just the two of you.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.247
It wouldn't be a date.
The jinx wouldn't apply!

OHH!
And I'll come too. M'kay?

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.821
I cannot believe
you just did that!
Yeah?!

00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:46.291
You are the freakin' worst!
What do you say, you guys?

00:15:46.391 --> 00:15:47.393

Ooohh!

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.835
Thank you so much, Oda!

You know, Takeo,

00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:56.344
they have this thing
called The Sparkle Parade!

00:15:56.444 --> 00:15:57.413
What?! Is it sparkly?!

00:15:57.513 --> 00:15:59.117
It's totally sparkly!

00:15:59.217 --> 00:16:00.619
I love sparkles!

I'll just need
everyone's e-mail!

00:16:22.763 --> 00:16:24.934
You are really
pushing it, mister!

I can't wait for tomorrow!
I have no idea what to wear!

Oh, they have this ride.

00:16:30.646 --> 00:16:32.450
It is crazy fast. You
are going to love it...

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.458
Takeo's girlfriend
really is a sweetheart.
Wouldn't you say so?

00:16:36.558 --> 00:16:40.132
Yeah she's real cute.
And she totally loves Takeo.

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:41.368
She's a real nice,
lovely girl.

00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:44.073
Yeah she IS a lovely
girl. Although...

Ugghh... GAH!

00:16:50.219 --> 00:16:52.056
Okey-dokey!
I'll text everyone

00:16:57.933 --> 00:17:00.806
Why did you tell him how
you felt about Takeo?

00:17:00.906 --> 00:17:03.612
I didn't. Well,
maybe I kinda did.

00:17:03.712 --> 00:17:05.516
But it certainly
wasn't on purpose.

Uh, what?

[AI]
We were all hanging out
after the seminar,

00:17:08.955 --> 00:17:11.261
and someone there said
they could do hypnosis.

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:15.269
Well, I ended up saying
some stuff. So apparently...
it works.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:19.477
So you might avoid
being hypnotized.
If you know what I mean.

00:17:19.577 --> 00:17:20.879
Guess so.

I'm going to stay tonight.

Do you invite people
over a lot?

Your parents were really
cool about me being here.

Nah, I don't have people
over that much.

Takeo...
Huuuh?

Whenever you first met her,
did Ai Sunakawa scare you?

Wouldn't say scared.
Ahaha!

Yeah, yeah. Probably not...

I guess YOU wouldn't be
scared of much, huh?

Well, she terrified me.
I'm nowhere near as
intense as she is.

Which really came back to
bite me in the butt one day.

paperwork for a seminar.

my way out of it.

good in the long run.

found everything I'd lost.
