they're headed
our way right now.

Okay. Thank you so
much for all of this.

Oh?

00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:37.894
It's because of you, Oda,

00:08:37.994 --> 00:08:40.365
I've been able to come
to MM Land with Takeo.

00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:42.269
And it's been a
really good time.

Any sign of them over there?

I'm sorry, Takeo.
Hm?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.724
Oda can be difficult...

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:55.195
like, he crashed at your

00:08:55.295 --> 00:08:58.301

Not at all! I wouldn't
call this trouble.

Oh, well, he's not really
a bad guy I suppose.

Lemme try giving
Ms. Yamato a call!

Oh, by the way,

00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:16.337
I unplugged Takeo's phone
from the wall last night

before I went to sleep!

00:09:17.774 --> 00:09:20.345
He's an evil, horrible,
awful, bad guy!

Were you able to get
ahold of them yet?

00:10:04.768 --> 00:10:08.843
Uh, it looks like they wound up
in the Resort Zone by mistake.

00:10:08.943 --> 00:10:11.982
Huh?
The Resort Zone is on the
other side of the park.

00:10:12.082 --> 00:10:16.458
I'm sorry. This is all
because I said I wanted
to get some stupid popcorn.

Oh, no no! It's fine.

now?! What'd I say?

The Sparkle Parade will
begin in 30 minutes!

00:15:52.195 --> 00:15:54.366
For the best viewing
areas along the parade route,

00:15:54.467 --> 00:15:56.671
please follow the park
attendants' instructions.

00:15:56.772 --> 00:15:58.509
Enjoy the show!

UUHHH!

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.917
It's almost time for
the parade to start!
OHH!

00:16:03.017 --> 00:16:04.754
You're supposed to
watch it with Rinko!

00:16:04.854 --> 00:16:06.491
Yeah! Oh, but my phone-

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.629
You're just gonna
have to look for her!

Oh! Yeah, you're right!

00:16:10.365 --> 00:16:13.906
Thanks a lot, Sis!
I'll go find her!

You better be good to her!

00:16:34.948 --> 00:16:36.451
Right!

00:16:40.893 --> 00:16:42.997
[ODA]
Yeah, I found 'em. Yeah.

00:16:43.097 --> 00:16:45.201
Right in front of the castle.
You can't miss it.

00:16:45.301 --> 00:16:49.109
Yeah. We'll stay right
here then. See ya.

00:16:51.815 --> 00:16:54.754
"You better be good to her"?
What's that supposed to mean?

00:16:54.854 --> 00:16:57.460
Maybe this was all a bad idea.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.868
Oda, I am never going
to tell Takeo how I
really feel about him.

00:17:01.968 --> 00:17:03.605
Huh?
(Ai chuckles)

00:17:03.705 --> 00:17:05.843
I guess I kinda love it
when he calls me "Sis."

00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:10.018
And the fact that he
can be such a carefree,
bumbling idiot around me.

00:17:12.255 --> 00:17:16.565
Hey guys! Over here!
Heeey! Where's Takeo?

00:17:16.665 --> 00:17:19.103
What? He just went
looking for you, Rinko!

00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:21.240
Huh?
He ran off in
that direction.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.844
It hasn't been long, so
you can still catch him.

00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:24.113
Okay!

00:17:24.213 --> 00:17:25.816
But if we watch the
parade alone together,

00:17:25.916 --> 00:17:27.352
we'll get jinxed,
and then we can't-

00:17:27.453 --> 00:17:29.858
Look, that stupid jinx
is a bunch of nonsense!

00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.695
Don't believe it!

00:17:31.795 --> 00:17:34.400
Believe in Takeo!

00:17:34.501 --> 00:17:37.005
Yeah, I guess so.
You're right, Sis.

00:17:37.105 --> 00:17:40.245
I just have to believe in
Takeo and it'll be fine.

00:17:40.345 --> 00:17:45.956
This is the second time
when I've been acting crazy and
you've had to set me straight...

00:17:46.056 --> 00:17:48.127
Agh! I am just worthless!

00:17:48.227 --> 00:17:50.198
It's fine! Now just get
your butt outta here!

00:17:50.298 --> 00:17:52.703
What now?
What's wrong now?

00:17:52.804 --> 00:17:54.273
Here! This is for you.

00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:56.812
[RINKO]
I want to thank you
for helping me so much.

00:17:56.912 --> 00:17:58.247
It's a coffee chiffon.

00:17:58.347 --> 00:18:00.986
Okay... I'm gonna go
find Takeo now!

00:18:01.086 --> 00:18:03.124
That girl is something else.

00:18:03.224 --> 00:18:05.128
I didn't know she
bakes stuff, too.

00:18:05.228 --> 00:18:06.865
That's right.
She bakes, too.

00:18:06.965 --> 00:18:08.769

You hungry?

00:18:12.275 --> 00:18:13.879
Mmm, now that's good.

00:18:13.979 --> 00:18:16.083
You can tell she made
it with you in mind.

00:18:16.183 --> 00:18:18.555
It's coffee,
so it's slightly bitter.

00:18:18.655 --> 00:18:22.997
But with a light
hint of sweetness.
It's perfect.

00:18:23.097 --> 00:18:26.170
[AI]
Somebody baked something for me.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:30.446
And for the second
time in my life, I got
compared to a flower.

00:18:31.448 --> 00:18:33.919
I gotta say,
it was a good day.

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:35.523
(Chuckle)

00:18:35.623 --> 00:18:38.428
I wonder if those two
will find each other...

00:18:38.529 --> 00:18:41.968
Takeo's never been very
good at finding things.

00:18:42.068 --> 00:18:45.041
(Ai laughs)
I'm sure
it'll work out.

00:18:45.141 --> 00:18:46.745

00:18:46.845 --> 00:18:50.686
When you want something bad
enough and you keep after it...

00:18:50.786 --> 00:18:52.322
you're gonna find it.

00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:55.396

one looking, is he?

When I was looking
for you...

I thought about
the parade...

want to see it...

it's like a miracle.

those things to hold onto.
