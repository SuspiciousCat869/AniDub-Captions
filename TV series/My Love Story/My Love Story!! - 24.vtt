Takeo puts everyone else first
before himself...

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.084
It's like all he really
wants is to make those
that are around him happy.

00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:24.531
AHHHH!

00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:28.206
That may be the first time I've
ever screamed in my entire life.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.084
You okay?

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:35.653
I'm fine...

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:37.824
I'm home.

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:39.962

00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:58.633

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.541
[RINKO]
Takeo?
Yeah?

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.346
Thanks for coming
by the shop today!
Uh-huh.

00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:08.486
[RINKO]
Oh yeah, were you out in
downtown later in the evening?

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:10.490
I could've sworn I saw you.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.892
It must've been
your imagination.

00:01:11.992 --> 00:01:13.796
Okay. Yeah,
I guess so...

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:16.702
Maybe it's because I've been
wanting to see you so much.

00:01:16.802 --> 00:01:19.040
So, what are you doing
the day after tomorrow?

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.314
I don't have to work
that day, so I was thinking
that we could go out.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:25.286
We haven't been able to see
enough of each other lately.

00:01:25.386 --> 00:01:26.455
I know, right?

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.593
(Giggle)
I want to see you so bad

00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:30.230
I'm going coocoo.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.334
<i>Ms. Yamato...</i>

00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:34.338
I want to see you, too.

00:01:35.907 --> 00:01:37.544
<i>I love her.</i>

00:01:37.644 --> 00:01:39.314
Thanks for coming!
See you soon!

00:01:39.414 --> 00:01:42.420
Well, I'm glad to see
that you seem to really
like working here.

00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:43.823
Uh-huh, I really do!

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:46.829
I just love being surrounded
by cakes all day long.

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.067
And well, I've been
learning a lot too.

00:01:49.168 --> 00:01:54.010
I've learned how difficult it
can be, and how hard you have to
work at it to get it right.

00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:57.517
[ICHINOSE]
Rinko, I need to talk to you
about the competition.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.819
Yes?!

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.623
Since we're off tomorrow
I was thinking

00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:02.460
we could get together
to brainstorm some ideas.

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:03.796
I could really use your help.

00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:05.800
Um, well, uh...
Tomorrow, huh...

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.308
Please! My entire career
might be riding on this!

00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:11.245
(Sigh)

00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:14.685
To the sea or the mountains.
Where should I take her?

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:16.789
(Phone rings)
Huh?

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.659
Hey, Ms. Yamato!
Tomorrow is gonna be-

[RINKO]
Takeo, I'm so sorry!

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:21.899
I can't go out tomorrow.

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.404
I know I was the one that
brought it up and everything.

00:02:24.504 --> 00:02:26.007
What happened?

00:02:26.108 --> 00:02:29.681
Ichinose, the guy from work,
is entering a big competition.

00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:32.087
He said his whole career
is riding on it.

00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:35.793
And well, he asked me
to help him out.

00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:37.831
Yeah, then you
should support him.

00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:40.770
I know that you'll
do a fantastic job.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.041
[RINKO]
Okay. Thanks for
understanding.

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:44.945
<i>There's not much of a choice.</i>

00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:47.016
<i>It's the right thing</i>
<i>for her to do.</i>

00:02:47.117 --> 00:02:50.323
<i>I mean, it means a lot</i>
<i>to him, and he asked her.</i>

00:02:50.423 --> 00:02:52.294
(Jingle)
Huh?

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.219
<i>It's just another reason</i>
<i>why I love her so much.</i>

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.956
[ICHINOSE, FLASHBACK]
She was meant for me!

00:03:07.057 --> 00:03:08.826
She just doesn't know that
there are other guys out there

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:10.897
who are far better
suited for her!

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:12.734

What the-?! Some yay-hoos
coming onto my woman!

00:03:16.642 --> 00:03:20.316

need some backup over here,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.254
[KURIHARA]
Hey!
Huh?

00:03:22.354 --> 00:03:24.958
You want something
from my girlfriend?

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.660
Uhhh...

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.795
Are you okay?

00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:28.799
Oh! Goodness, my big man!

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.069
Thanks, babe.

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.173
Oooh, you're such
a tough guy.

00:03:32.274 --> 00:03:35.747
So, like...
not having your lady around
kinda feels pretty weird, huh?

00:03:35.847 --> 00:03:37.117
[NANAKO]
Totally.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.452
Ms. Yamato...

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:41.091
I don't know if
I'm right for her.

00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:43.329
Maybe someone else makes
more sense...

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.602
And maybe she just
hasn't realized it yet.

00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:48.939
[NANAKO]
Of course you're right for her!
And she knows it.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.643
Huh?
She knows who you are.

00:03:50.743 --> 00:03:52.847
Rinko is not an idiot, you know!

00:03:52.947 --> 00:03:55.420
She chose you, okay? You.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.392
She never would have if
she wasn't sure about it.

00:03:58.492 --> 00:04:02.067
<i>Me. She chose me.</i>

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:04.671
<i>Even though he may have</i>
<i>more in common.</i>

00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:08.346
<i>And he may be better at some</i>
<i>things that I could never do.</i>

00:04:08.446 --> 00:04:13.089
I don't... want to
lose her to anyone.

00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:18.232
(Cheers and compliments)

00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:22.073
<i>So maybe I can only make</i>
<i>cookies so dry they taste</i>
<i>like rice crackers.</i>

00:04:22.173 --> 00:04:24.043
Do it, Takeo!
You got it!
She's all yours!

00:04:24.144 --> 00:04:27.217
<i>And maybe I can't talk with her</i>
<i>about the things she loves.</i>

00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:29.354
<i>And I don't have some</i>
<i>fancy car. And I can't...</i>

00:04:29.454 --> 00:04:32.994
<i>And I can't look her in the eye</i>
<i>and call her by her first name.</i>

00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:34.865
(Rinko giggling)
<i>And maybe someday...</i>

00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:38.205
<i>Maybe she'll look at me</i>
<i>and decide that she</i>
<i>needs someone else.</i>

00:04:38.305 --> 00:04:40.843
<i>It's her life. She</i>
<i>can think for herself.</i>

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:42.947
<i>But for now, she's with me.</i>

00:04:43.048 --> 00:04:46.555
<i>And I'll relish every moment</i>
<i>she smiles by my side.</i>

00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:49.528
Hm?

00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:52.667
I will not let you have her.

00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:55.506
Did you come all the way
here just to tell me that?

00:04:55.606 --> 00:04:56.875
That's right.

00:04:56.975 --> 00:04:59.046
And you think just by
telling me that I'll stop?

00:04:59.147 --> 00:05:02.187
I guess not. But you
can't have her.

00:05:05.226 --> 00:05:07.464
You don't stand a
chance challenging me!

00:05:07.564 --> 00:05:08.966
<i>It's not over yet, buddy!</i>

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:11.505
[SUNA]
Wait, he's the one who's
challenging you here.

00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:12.974
It's not the
other way around.

00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:15.446
Yeah, you're right.
But whatever!

00:05:15.546 --> 00:05:18.819
Bottom line is that we
both love Ms. Yamato.

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.923
Neither one of us
has the upper hand.

00:05:21.023 --> 00:05:23.696
Well you can be a lot
more assertive, okay?

00:05:23.796 --> 00:05:25.366
Well, how does Rinko
feel about this?

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:27.470
Does she even realize how
this guy feels about her.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.207
Don't think she does.

00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:31.378
And he's not your
typical guy, is he?

00:05:31.478 --> 00:05:32.547
What do you mean?

00:05:32.647 --> 00:05:34.651
Is it all right for her to
be all alone with him?

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:35.953
I mean really?

00:05:36.055 --> 00:05:37.424
I don't know.

00:05:37.524 --> 00:05:39.294
(Jingle)

00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:42.233
[ICHINOSE]
I'm in agony. Nothing has
screamed "it's the one!"

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:44.638
But they're all
wonderful, Ichinose.

00:05:44.738 --> 00:05:46.275
Yes, yes, of course.

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:49.548
But none of them feel worthy of
representing my artistic vision.

00:05:49.648 --> 00:05:51.685
I'm not sure I'm
feeling it yet.

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:54.424
Well, you've gotta try!
I'll do whatever I can to help!

00:05:54.524 --> 00:05:58.031
And I totally understand
what you mean by "feeling
it when it's right."

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:01.371
Hm.

00:06:01.472 --> 00:06:04.911
Uh, well, great.
Then you can start with piping
out some merengue for me.

00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:06.315
Thank you!
Huh?

00:06:06.415 --> 00:06:09.054
Thanks for coming
along with me.

00:06:09.154 --> 00:06:10.656
Don't worry
about it.

00:06:10.757 --> 00:06:12.025
What are you doing here?
AHHHH!

00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:13.529
Are you here to interfere
with me and Rinko?

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:15.533
No! I'm here to make sure
that when you two are alone

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:17.170
you don't try and
pull something.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.006
I have never been so insulted!

00:06:19.107 --> 00:06:21.979
I would never make such
advances before she has
professed her love to me!

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.486
Now go home! I have an
important competition and
I need to concentrate!

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:27.991
You mean that
snack-making contest?

00:06:28.092 --> 00:06:30.663
The C'est Nouveau
Patissier Concours!

00:06:30.763 --> 00:06:32.834
So you won't lay
a hand on her.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.905
Of course not.
I'll follow decorum.

00:06:35.005 --> 00:06:37.510
Okay then. I'll take
you at your word.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.249
I am winning this
competition.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.289
I'll win the gold and
confess my love to Rinko.

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.397
Ever since Rinko came here,
things have taken a turn for me.

00:06:47.497 --> 00:06:50.703
My entire world has
changed due to her.

00:06:50.803 --> 00:06:52.440
You may not realize it,

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.013
but Rinko Yamato is
destined to be my Muse.

00:06:56.114 --> 00:06:58.619
And in the future, when I
open up my very own shop,

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:00.590
she will be by my side.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.231
Taking the gold in
this competition is
but the first step!

00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:06.668
[ICHINOSE]
I will never let you have her!

00:07:07.604 --> 00:07:10.676
I hope that you do
well at the contest.

00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:15.286
[SUNA]
Dude. What did you just say?

00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:18.592
I know, but this guy works
really hard at what he does.

00:07:18.692 --> 00:07:21.231
It means everything to him.
It's his whole life.

00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:26.975
And it's not wrong of
me to support someone
who's following his dream.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.814
I have my own
goals to reach.

00:07:29.915 --> 00:07:32.320
Oh yeah? You want
a gold medal too?

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.889
Hmm...

00:07:33.989 --> 00:07:35.993
I just want to say
her first name.

00:07:36.094 --> 00:07:38.165
(Laughing)
What's so funny?!

00:07:38.265 --> 00:07:40.136
"I hope you do well."

00:07:40.236 --> 00:07:43.309
[TAKEO]
So, what's a "muse" anyway?

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:45.246
Looks like
you're having fun.

00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:47.684
Let me see that
for a second.

00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:52.126
(Impressed gasp)

00:07:52.227 --> 00:07:53.929
That is remarkable!

00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:55.933
I can't believe
it's a meringue!

00:07:56.033 --> 00:07:57.337
Rinko.

00:07:57.437 --> 00:08:00.008
Uh, before I met you...
I was alone.

00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:02.680
And it hurt that no
one understood me.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.987
I had become fixated on the
one time I didn't succeed.

00:08:06.088 --> 00:08:08.092
I was bull-headed and stubborn.

00:08:08.192 --> 00:08:12.367
I had forgotten my passion
for beautiful cakes
and making them my own.

00:08:12.467 --> 00:08:14.671
And the joy it brought me
when someone bought one.

00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:19.046
But now I see it.
Now I remember what it is
I love about what I do.

00:08:19.147 --> 00:08:21.251
And it's because of you.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.724
(Echoing)
You are my muse!

00:08:25.793 --> 00:08:26.929
Uh-?! What?!

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:28.232
Tch...

00:08:28.332 --> 00:08:29.501
Well, that's nice...

00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:31.438
But well, Takeo...
y'know, my boyfriend...

00:08:31.538 --> 00:08:34.344
he says your cookies
were like plastic!
(Aggravated grunt)

00:08:34.444 --> 00:08:36.949
And he makes some pretty
unique cookies himself.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.122
They were just like him:
bold and kinda loud.

00:08:40.222 --> 00:08:42.860
(Gasp)
Rinko, that is it!

00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:45.967
Personality! But of course
with a flavor that makes
someone come back for more.

00:08:46.068 --> 00:08:48.672
It's gotta have impact...
I think I've got something!
I can do this!

00:08:48.772 --> 00:08:51.278
[ICHINOSE]
Okay, it's getting late. Rinko,
you can go ahead and take off.

00:08:51.378 --> 00:08:53.949
I'll stay here and try to make
this masterpiece happen.

00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:55.786
Thank you. I'll see
you later then.

00:08:55.886 --> 00:08:57.390
Rinko.
Huh?

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.761
After the competition,
we need to talk.

00:08:59.861 --> 00:09:01.565
Oh?

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.573
Sure. Good luck tonight.

00:09:06.842 --> 00:09:09.046
(Door squeaks)

00:09:09.147 --> 00:09:11.285
[RINKO]
So you finished it!
I did!

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:13.489
They're gorgeous!
They are truly magnificent!

00:09:13.589 --> 00:09:14.591
(Excited squeal)

00:09:14.691 --> 00:09:17.864
I can take the gold with
this. I know I can.

00:09:17.964 --> 00:09:20.035
I think you can
win it, too.

00:09:20.136 --> 00:09:22.907
I can do it as long as I
have my muse by my side.

00:09:23.007 --> 00:09:27.150
[ICHINOSE]
On the actual day of
the competition, I can't
ask for any assistance.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.087
But will you be
there for me?

00:09:29.187 --> 00:09:31.058
Of course I'll go
and support you!

00:09:31.158 --> 00:09:33.128
[YUTAKA]
Oboobahdoobahdoo, Maki.

00:09:33.228 --> 00:09:35.833
Alrighty, who's a
lovely lady?!

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:37.270
(Laughs)

(Doorbell)

00:09:47.156 --> 00:09:49.627
Take, can you get that?

00:09:49.728 --> 00:09:52.734
Oh, morning, Takeo!
Sorry I'm here so super early.

00:09:52.834 --> 00:09:56.875
No, don't worry about it.
We're early risers around here.

00:09:56.975 --> 00:09:59.581
I sent you a text or two,
but I never got anything back.

00:09:59.681 --> 00:10:03.322
Oh, sorry! I think I might've
left my cell phone somewhere.

00:10:03.422 --> 00:10:04.624
(Sigh)

00:10:04.724 --> 00:10:06.161
What's wrong?

00:10:06.261 --> 00:10:08.766
You know Ichinose...
his contest is today.

00:10:08.866 --> 00:10:11.705
And he said once it's over
there's something he
wants to tell me.

00:10:11.805 --> 00:10:15.279
I think he might be inviting
me to become a full-time
employee at the cake shop!

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:17.850
(Giggling)
<i>I may be a little dense,</i>

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.721
<i>but she's got me on this one.</i>

00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:21.658
I mean, he told me
I've helped him remember

00:10:21.758 --> 00:10:24.064
what it is he likes
about being a pastry chef!

00:10:24.164 --> 00:10:25.499
You mean his muse?

00:10:25.599 --> 00:10:28.172
(Gasp)
Yes, that's right!
How did you know that?

00:10:28.272 --> 00:10:30.209
Uh, well, I dunno.

00:10:30.309 --> 00:10:32.880
But I'm no muse.
I can't be! That's not me.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.250
Too much pressure?

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.457
Yes! Totally!
I have no idea what to do!

00:10:37.557 --> 00:10:40.830
Maybe he just feels
more confident when
you're around.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.734
It's probably as
simple as that.

00:10:42.834 --> 00:10:46.742
Maybe so. If that's it,
somehow it's not so stressful.

00:10:46.842 --> 00:10:48.010
Nothing to worry about.

00:10:48.112 --> 00:10:49.781
You always have a way
of calming me down

00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:51.585
and making things better.

00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:54.758
Well I should get going.
Thanks, Takeo!

00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:56.328

Um, hey, Takeo?

00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:13.362
Good luck!
Win the blue ribbon!

00:11:13.462 --> 00:11:16.234
(Giggle)
It's actually a
gold medal, Takeo.

00:11:16.334 --> 00:11:18.405
Oh...

00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:22.447
That time you didn't
really calm me down.

00:11:22.547 --> 00:11:24.751
My heart is pounding.

Wanna hit the beach?

00:11:38.912 --> 00:11:40.149
Hm...

00:11:40.249 --> 00:11:42.220
You just gonna eat that?
Mm-hmm.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.691
That's gotta hurt.
Yeah...

(Laughing)

00:11:46.094 --> 00:11:47.530
What? What are you laughing at?!

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.234
I'm sorry, it's just
so fun to see you

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:50.536
acting like a normal person.

00:11:50.636 --> 00:11:52.173
I've always been
a normal person!

00:11:52.273 --> 00:11:54.110
Yeah, maybe sorta.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.314
But now, your
confidence is shot.

00:11:56.414 --> 00:11:58.418
You're worried and
obsessing over something.

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:00.923
Being jealous and
over-protective.

00:12:01.023 --> 00:12:04.898
I'm actually glad I'm getting
to see this side of you.

00:12:04.998 --> 00:12:07.570
But I'm sure you'll be fine.
I mean, come on...

Rinko Yamato loves
you to death.

Yeah, thanks, man.

find a girlfriend,

are having trouble,

in your face, too!

Whoa, there are TV crews here?

00:12:25.105 --> 00:12:29.380
Hmph. I'll be fine. I have
my Muse here to inspire me.

00:12:29.481 --> 00:12:31.485
You're going to win
the championship!

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:33.956
Oh no, wait, I'm sorry!
I mean win the gold!

00:12:34.057 --> 00:12:37.396
I shall win that golden award.
And I'll do it for you.

00:12:37.497 --> 00:12:39.534
Huh? No, no, please
don't do it for me.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.638
You need to win this
thing for yourself.

00:12:41.738 --> 00:12:42.840
Hm?

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.344
Yes, whatever you say.

00:12:44.444 --> 00:12:47.283
[RINKO]
So when it starts, I can't do
anything to help you, right?

00:12:47.383 --> 00:12:51.892
Right.
Well is there something
I can do for you right
now before it gets going?

00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:55.166
Let's see here. I'm
feeling pretty good, I'm
ready for the competition-

00:12:55.266 --> 00:12:56.601
(Shocked gasp)

00:12:56.701 --> 00:12:58.472
I think I forgot all my
tools back at the shop.

00:12:58.572 --> 00:13:01.545
Huh?!
I was too focused on the
ingredients that I...

00:13:01.645 --> 00:13:03.982
There's still some
time, but if I go,
I won't make it back..

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.721
And I can't tell the owner
just to drop everything
and bring it here!

00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:08.525
I can't believe this.
It's over!

00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:10.729
Pull yourself together!
There's gotta be a way!

00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:13.068
You've been working so hard,
You can't give up now!

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:16.942
I have someone I can call who
always seems to come through
with things like this!

Um, well, I'm at the
competition site right now,

00:13:23.422 --> 00:13:25.426
and Ichinose forgot
all his equipment.

00:13:25.526 --> 00:13:27.163
When's it start?!
10 o'clock.

00:13:27.263 --> 00:13:28.765
Okay, that's in on hour!
Where are you?

00:13:28.866 --> 00:13:30.936

What should he be looking for?

black case and it has my
name on the outside...

I'll get there as fast as
I can! Don't you worry!

Okay!

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.589
Alright! I'm on my way!

00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:42.393
Right. I'll text you the
address of the competition.

00:13:42.493 --> 00:13:43.862
Cool!

00:13:43.962 --> 00:13:45.666
[ICHINOSE]
There's no way he's going to
show up.

00:13:45.766 --> 00:13:47.436
[RINKO]
What?! Of course he will!

00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:50.442
It's Takeo. You have
nothing to worry about.

00:13:50.542 --> 00:13:51.578
(Scared gasps)

00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:53.982
(Heavy breathing)
Uhhh...

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.486
I need the tools...

00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:58.892
Ichinose... he left his
snack-making tools.

(All gasp)

00:14:00.095 --> 00:14:02.466
Hang on a second! Here you go.

00:14:02.567 --> 00:14:04.737
If he'd just called me,
I could have sent it to him.

00:14:04.837 --> 00:14:08.044
He was probably too
worried about pulling
me away from the shop.

00:14:08.145 --> 00:14:11.952
Oh. Here, lemme give
you money for a... taxi...

00:14:12.053 --> 00:14:14.190
He said he was going to
help, but there's no way.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.728
Hey, Suna! How are things going?
He's not going to help me
take Rinko away from him.

00:14:16.828 --> 00:14:19.534
[SUNA]
Takeo's got all the stuff
and is headed your way.

00:14:19.634 --> 00:14:21.338
So, he should be there soon.

00:14:21.438 --> 00:14:23.108
Great! He's on the way!

00:14:23.208 --> 00:14:24.410
Hm?!

RAAARGH!

Huh?!

00:14:29.087 --> 00:14:30.356
We're over here!

stay here as well?
