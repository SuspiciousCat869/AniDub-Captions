00:08:56.362 --> 00:08:58.533
I'm sorry, whenever
I'm with you,

00:08:58.634 --> 00:09:01.506
I feel like I just ramble on
about anything and everything.

00:09:01.606 --> 00:09:03.443
It's okay.

00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:10.056
You're still so much
taller than I am, Takeo.

00:09:10.156 --> 00:09:12.695
<i>Ms. Yamato... and the rock.</i>

00:09:12.795 --> 00:09:15.934
<i>Ms. Yamato... and the stars.</i>

00:09:16.035 --> 00:09:19.542
(Panting)

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.782
Bye-bye now!
I'll see you later, Takeo!

00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:23.817
Hm.

00:09:23.917 --> 00:09:26.723
[TAKEO]
<i>It doesn't matter where we are</i>

00:09:26.823 --> 00:09:28.894
<i>or what we're talking about...</i>

00:09:28.994 --> 00:09:32.902
<i>It all reminds me</i>
<i>of how much I love her.</i>

00:09:33.002 --> 00:09:38.847
<i>I wonder... where such</i>
<i>a feeling comes from...</i>

00:09:43.523 --> 00:09:45.159
[SUNA]
Hey...

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:49.368
What did you mean when you said
you like Takeo as a person?

00:09:49.469 --> 00:09:51.338
Huh?

00:09:51.439 --> 00:09:53.777
Well, you know,
I guess, I...

00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:56.348
I mean you're his
friend, right, Suna?

00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:57.885
So you know what a
good person he is.

00:09:57.985 --> 00:10:00.791
Yeah, but I don't think
of him as a master.

00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:02.828
The other day...
Even though the
track meet was over,

00:10:02.928 --> 00:10:04.932
I didn't want to stop
talking with him.

00:10:05.033 --> 00:10:08.105
[MARIYA]
Like you, right? You like
being around him, don't you?

00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:09.341
[SUNA]
Well, yeah.

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:10.711
And you don't feel
like you want to

00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:12.247
hold hands with him
or anything?

00:10:12.347 --> 00:10:13.717
Uh, no.

00:10:13.817 --> 00:10:15.353
So it's like I like him.

00:10:15.454 --> 00:10:17.290
I just don't "like him"
like him, ya know?

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.529
I just like him...
as a person!

00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:21.633
Okay. I guess I
can buy that...

00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:26.275
But I think your feelings
for him are still a bit
different from mine.

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:27.645
(Sigh)

00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:29.916
<i>The girls are not</i>
<i>interested in me,</i>

00:10:30.016 --> 00:10:32.353
<i>but Ms. Yamato still</i>
<i>worries about it.</i>

00:10:32.455 --> 00:10:38.032
<i>I mean, there's nobody else</i>
<i>out there who could possibly</i>
<i>fall for me.</i>

00:10:38.132 --> 00:10:41.071
Um... Yeah, well,
so what if they're
different?!

00:10:41.171 --> 00:10:43.309
But you can never
ever tell him, okay?

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:45.413
Or else I'll...
Or else what?

00:10:45.514 --> 00:10:48.987
Ugh! If you do, I swear
I will make sure you
regret it, you hear me?!

00:10:49.087 --> 00:10:51.626
[TEACHER]
And once you get
the chance to visit...

00:10:51.726 --> 00:10:54.766
Not even middle school kids
make bulletin boards anymore.

00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:57.270
What? Well we did
at my middle school.
Well, you're a dork.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.909
[TAKEO]
You know what I think?
I think it needs a comic strip.

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:02.013
[SUNA]
If there's space left.

00:11:02.113 --> 00:11:03.483
Ahh...

00:11:03.583 --> 00:11:04.986
Oh! Hmm...

00:11:05.086 --> 00:11:07.056
[STUDENT]
Anyone have an extra ruler?

00:11:07.157 --> 00:11:08.560
Yeah.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.031
Ahhhhh...

00:11:12.635 --> 00:11:14.104
Thank you!
(Mariya grunts)

00:11:14.204 --> 00:11:16.108
[KURIHARA]
We're kinda short
on pens and stuff.

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:17.511
Wanna go buy some today?

00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:19.449
Oh, sorry, I have
a club meeting.

00:11:19.549 --> 00:11:20.784
Oh, I'll go!

00:11:20.884 --> 00:11:22.855
Uh-huh. Don't forget
your "master."
(Gasp)

00:11:22.955 --> 00:11:24.926
Yeah, sure thing.
(Happy gasp)

00:11:25.026 --> 00:11:26.896
Suna, you should
come with us.

00:11:26.996 --> 00:11:28.967
(Deflated groan)
Alright.

00:11:29.067 --> 00:11:31.639
There's a stationery store
in the shopping center,
isn't there?

00:11:31.739 --> 00:11:34.679
[MARIYA]
Oh, but I guess bookstores
would sell stationery, too, huh?

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:35.848
Where should we go?

00:11:35.948 --> 00:11:37.283
[TAKEO]
Either one's fine.

00:11:37.383 --> 00:11:39.421
You sure seem like you're
in a good mood, Saijo.

00:11:39.522 --> 00:11:42.528
Oh yeah?
I'm just being me!

00:11:42.628 --> 00:11:44.197
(Phone jingles)

00:11:44.297 --> 00:11:46.068
Oh, it's Ms. Yamato.

00:11:46.168 --> 00:11:48.072
[RINKO]
<i>Do you have any</i>
<i>plans for today?</i>

00:11:48.172 --> 00:11:50.343
<i>If not, I'd really</i>
<i>like to see you.</i>

00:11:50.444 --> 00:11:51.446
Today?

00:11:51.546 --> 00:11:53.015
What's up?
She wanna meet?

00:11:53.115 --> 00:11:55.052
Yeah.

00:11:55.153 --> 00:11:58.760
[TAKEO]
"Sorry, I'm doing something
for school with Saijo today."

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.868
Master! The ink disappears
when you put water on it!

00:12:02.968 --> 00:12:04.404
It what?! It disappears?!

00:12:04.505 --> 00:12:06.609
That's not something
we're gonna need.

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:09.114
[MARIYA]
Sorry about today.

00:12:09.214 --> 00:12:12.086
You ended up with me instead
of going out on a date.

00:12:12.187 --> 00:12:15.359
It's okay... I'll still get
to see her later on anyway.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.763
Uhh...

00:12:16.863 --> 00:12:19.769
Uh-huh... That's good then.

00:12:20.504 --> 00:12:21.706
Hey, Takeo!

00:12:21.806 --> 00:12:23.844
Ms. Yamato! Sorry to
keep you waiting!

00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:26.415
It's okay.
You're here all by yourself?

00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:28.118
I thought you were coming with
Saijo.

00:12:28.219 --> 00:12:31.225
Or at least with
Suna, y'know? Hm?

00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:33.663
You're soaking wet.

00:12:33.763 --> 00:12:35.701
(Giggle)

00:12:36.569 --> 00:12:38.573
<i>I so love her.</i>

00:12:38.673 --> 00:12:43.550
[RINKO]
I had a lot of fun chatting
with Saijo the other day.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.886
Glad to hear it!

00:12:44.986 --> 00:12:47.357
Oh, and I was talking
with all of my friends.

00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:50.597
And they said that they
like you as a person, too!

00:12:50.697 --> 00:12:53.068
Oh yeah? Well I'm not
popular with girls,

00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:55.106
so there's nothing
to worry about.

00:12:55.206 --> 00:12:56.241
Takeo!

00:12:56.341 --> 00:12:58.547
It's not like I worry
about that all the time!

00:12:58.647 --> 00:13:00.216
Just sometimes...

00:13:00.316 --> 00:13:02.454
<i>Sometimes, huh...?</i>

00:13:02.555 --> 00:13:05.226
<i>You have nothing</i>
<i>to worry about.</i>

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:09.367
<i>What can I say to make</i>
<i>her understand that?</i>

00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:12.708
[TAKEO]
It's from Ms. Yamato.
Huh?

00:13:12.808 --> 00:13:15.079
She said she had a great
time with you the other day.

00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:17.383
And she'd like to do
it again sometime.

00:13:17.484 --> 00:13:19.020
Oh... 'kay.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.593
Cool. I'll see ya then...

00:13:21.693 --> 00:13:23.830
Uh...

00:13:24.397 --> 00:13:26.001
Oh! Ah!

00:13:28.239 --> 00:13:30.209
Yes, yes! I know
I'm being selfish!

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.748
He has absolutely no idea
about how I really feel.

00:13:32.848 --> 00:13:35.286
And she's just too freakin'
nice to know any better.

00:13:35.386 --> 00:13:37.625
I know. I'm taking
advantage of them.

00:13:37.725 --> 00:13:40.062
But you don't have to
get all over me about it!

00:13:40.162 --> 00:13:43.335
I just... I just can't
tell them the truth!

00:13:44.472 --> 00:13:45.907
[SUNA]
I didn't say anything.

00:13:46.008 --> 00:13:47.945
You're the one
getting hurt here.

00:13:48.045 --> 00:13:49.147
(Gasp)

00:13:49.247 --> 00:13:50.517
Think about it.

00:13:50.617 --> 00:13:51.953
As long as you don't
say anything,

00:13:52.053 --> 00:13:54.224
those two won't ever have
any reason to doubt you.

00:13:54.324 --> 00:13:57.998
But the longer you keep
this up, the harder
it's gonna be on you.

00:13:58.098 --> 00:14:01.238
I was just wondering how
you were holding up.

00:14:05.514 --> 00:14:07.685
[KURIHARA]
Yo, Goda. You going
home or what?

00:14:07.785 --> 00:14:09.321
I'm gonna wait for Suna.

00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:11.258
Alright then! Toodle-oo!

00:14:11.358 --> 00:14:12.895
See ya.

00:14:14.097 --> 00:14:16.803
<i>You have nothing to</i>
<i>worry about Ms. Yamato.</i>

00:14:16.903 --> 00:14:20.142
<i>Not even "sometimes."</i>

00:14:23.583 --> 00:14:27.190
Hey, Saijo.
How's it going?

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.094
(Gasp)
(Sigh)

00:14:29.194 --> 00:14:31.365
Well, there it is again.
What?

00:14:31.466 --> 00:14:34.572
Oh come on, you know what
that thing is, don't you?

00:14:34.672 --> 00:14:38.245
It's just her way to
make sure everyone knows
you're her boyfriend.

00:14:38.345 --> 00:14:40.851
Since she goes to a
different school and all.

00:14:40.951 --> 00:14:42.521
Y'think so?

00:14:42.621 --> 00:14:44.290
[TAKEO]
<i>Hm... Maybe.</i>

00:14:44.391 --> 00:14:47.296
Well, she doesn't have
anything to worry about.

00:14:47.397 --> 00:14:48.298
Hm.

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:51.539
[TAKEO]
<i>Even though she still does.</i>

00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:53.242
I'm not popular with girls.

00:14:53.342 --> 00:14:56.616
So I want to do whatever
I can to make her see that.

00:14:56.716 --> 00:14:58.887
Ah...

00:14:58.987 --> 00:15:00.557
(Sharp inhale)

00:15:00.657 --> 00:15:05.333
Master... I... I like you.

00:15:12.213 --> 00:15:13.415
Yeah!

00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:15.687
<i>As a person. A mentor.</i>

00:15:15.787 --> 00:15:19.595
And not like I said...
It's different.

00:15:19.695 --> 00:15:21.733
I like you much
more than that!

00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:24.170
I wish I could be
your girlfriend!

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.611
(Echoing) <i>I like you</i>
<i>more than that!</i>

00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:30.584
<i>I wish I could be</i>
<i>your girlfriend!</i>

00:15:41.338 --> 00:15:44.044
(Rinko giggling)

00:15:46.314 --> 00:15:47.985
(Gasp)

00:15:48.586 --> 00:15:49.955
I'm sorry, Saijo.

00:15:50.056 --> 00:15:53.162
No... I already
know how things are.

00:15:53.262 --> 00:15:55.434
I mean, you already
have a girlfriend...

00:15:55.534 --> 00:15:56.803
It's not that.
Ah?

00:15:56.903 --> 00:16:00.342
I love Ms. Yamato.

00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:03.148
(Sigh)
Hm...

00:16:03.248 --> 00:16:04.952
I'm the one who
should be sorry.

00:16:05.052 --> 00:16:07.791
I'm sorry for lying to you.
And being so selfish.

00:16:07.891 --> 00:16:09.194
You're not
being selfish!

00:16:09.294 --> 00:16:11.198
And don't need
to apologize.

00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:14.438
(Gasp and whimper)

00:16:15.005 --> 00:16:16.642
Mm...

00:16:16.743 --> 00:16:18.613
[MARIYA]
I wasn't lying, y'know...

00:16:18.713 --> 00:16:22.086
When I said I like
you as a person.

00:16:22.186 --> 00:16:25.126
[TAKEO]
Oh, yeah? Well I'm not
popular with girls,

00:16:25.226 --> 00:16:27.330
so there's nothing
to worry about.

00:16:27.431 --> 00:16:28.466
Takeo!

00:16:28.566 --> 00:16:29.735
Huh?!

00:16:29.835 --> 00:16:30.904
AHH!

00:16:31.004 --> 00:16:34.545
(Mariya crying)

00:16:34.645 --> 00:16:37.150
(Approaching footsteps)

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.091
You look like you
could use a few more.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.266
Thank you.

00:16:45.366 --> 00:16:51.044
Sunakawa, you're too smooth...
it's incredibly aggravating.
