1
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:04,000
[LELEI] After the Self Defense
Force established a base

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,533
at Alnus Hill in the Special
Region...

3
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:08,600
Itami took Lelei, Rory and Tuka
to Japan

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,400
as representatives to
testify before the Diet.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,133
[LELEI] And, just as they were
about to return home,

6
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:20,333
[LELEI] A huge crowd had
gathered to give them an
incredibly positive reception.

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,766
[LELEI] Now,

8
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:25,300
it has been almost 5 months

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,266
since the Empire first made
their attempt to attack Japan.

10
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,566
[LELEI] But since the Battle of
Italica,

11
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,200
A peaceful environment has
spread around the military
base at Alnus.

12
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:43,700
[LELEI] As ideas and goods
have been more regularly shared,

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,366
natives of the region have begun
staying around the camp at Alnus
Hill.

14
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:53,266
What was initially a refugee
camp has turned into a
flourishing township.

15
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,733
[LELEI] Meanwhile, Princess Pina
Co Lada,

16
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:01,133
who witnessed the strength of
Japan with her own eyes,

17
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:02,500
returned to the Imperial Capital

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,000
with a resolution to hold peace
talks.

19
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,233
[LELEI] Japan's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs sent

20
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,100
Koji Sugawara to join her in the
dialogue.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,800
[LELEI] Both sides are now
preparing

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,666
to hold classified negotiations.

23
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,366
[HAMILTON] Today, you have a
luncheon with Lord Cicero.

24
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:23,000
And later, a dinner party at
Marquis Ducie's.

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,233
[HAMILTON] And between those,
you'll be having a meeting with
Shandy.

26
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,833
[HAMILTON] Were you up all night
again, ma'am?

27
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:31,500
You know you'll only end up
getting sick

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,466
if you keep doing
this to yourself.

29
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:35,466
[PINA] I know.

30
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:43,033
[PINA] However... the fate of
the Empire is too closely
dependent on the peace talks.

31
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll get all the rest I need
once this is over.

32
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,400
[PINA] What's this?

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,866
[HAMILTON] The list of captives
we want released.

34
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,633
[PINA] Why are there fourteen?

35
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,733
I thought they were allowing us
to ask for the release of 15.

36
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,633
[HAMILTON] Don't you remember?
You told me to keep the list
trimmed down to 14, milady...

37
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,000
to leave room for Lord Cicero.

38
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,700
[PINA] Oh, yes... of course I
did.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,400
[HAMILTON] Ma'am, are you sure
that you're okay?

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,366
[PINA] Let's assume for a moment
that I'm not ... could you step
in?

41
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,966
[HAMILTON] Oh no. Sounds awful.

42
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,700
[PINA] All right then... I'll
keep going.

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,533
Let's go. Sugawara is waiting.

44
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:36,133
[YAO] So this... is Alnus...

45
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,100
(laughing, talking, eating,
joking)

46
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,000
(exhales)

47
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,433
[SUGAWARA] Hmm... I think I
might fill up rather quickly.

48
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,266
[PINA] It's like I told you
already.

49
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,433
You don't have enough stomachs
for this.

50
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:28,833
[SUGAWARA] I guess not...
good thing the PX has plenty of
antacids for sale.

51
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,600
[PINA] Well that sounds helpful.

52
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:34,000
Cicero Lah Maltus.

53
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,400
His family is very important to
us... They're among the Empire's
founders...

54
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,833
Of course they have a strong
influence in the Senate.

55
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:45,300
[PINA] He has... a strong voice
among those pushing for war.

56
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,033
Since the devastating loss in
Alnus,

57
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:51,966
the Imperial Army is still
trying to recover.

58
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:56,200
[PINA] Meanwhile, the Senate is
still divided on how to use it
once we do recover.

59
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,900
Of course.. there's the group
that wants to use force...
they'd prefer to fight.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,066
They will be standing behind the
Emperor's call to battle no
matter what.

61
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,633
[SUGAWARA] And the anti‐war
group...

62
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,066
I understand they're the
majority in the Senate, correct?

63
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,700
[PINA] That's right.
They want to restrict the power
of the Emperor,

64
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,400
who started this
reckless war...

65
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,100
They're moving to take command
of the Army away from the
Emperor

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
and form a militia controlled by
the Senate.

67
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,100
[PINA] And once that happens...

68
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,100
They hope to bring an end to
this, with Japan going back
through the Gate.

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,466
[SUGAWARA] So then they want us
to leave...

70
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:28,466
[PINA] They do.

71
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:30,833
And they'll jump at any
opportunity...

72
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,966
To do this without any more
violence.

73
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,833
[PINA] And so we... need to
convince one of the hawks to
change his mind.

74
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,733
[PINA] ...someone with
influence.

75
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:44,566
[PINA] Lord Cicero.
This is... Japan's diplomatic
envoy... Mister Sugawara

76
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:49,100
[SUGAWARA] Hello Lord Cicero...
I'm Koji Sugawara, it is a
pleasure to meet you, sir.

77
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,400
[CICERO] Well, now... Japan
huh...

78
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,933
[CICERO] You'll have to forgive
me, but I've never heard that
name before.

79
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,166
What kind of country is it?

80
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:58,133
[SUGAWARA] Well where
should I begin...?

81
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,366
The weather's nice... the water
and forests are beautiful.

82
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,800
[CICERO] Well...
isn't that lovely.

83
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,333
[CICERO] Must be a real nice
place to... visit.
[CICERO'S WIFE] Honey stop it.

84
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:11,600
[SUGAWARA] Allow me to present
you with some gifts from my
homeland.
[CICERO'S WIFE] Oh?

85
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:17,333
[SUGAWARA] We would be honored
if you accepted them.

86
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:31,100
These items were all created
by some of our finest craftsmen.

87
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:35,600
[CICERO] I must apologize for
being rude.

88
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,800
Your country seems to possess
excellent technology and
craftsmanship.

89
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,133
[CICERO] However... I still
don't know quite enough about it
just yet.

90
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:45,500
[CICERO] Where exactly is Japan
located, Mister Sugawara?

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,866
[SUGAWARA] Japan is the country
on the other side of the Gate,
sir.

92
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:50,266
But there's a little issue...

93
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:53,033
we're currently at war with the
Empire.

94
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:55,100
[CICERO] Oh is that so?!

95
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,700
All of you need to get out right
now!

96
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,600
[CICERO] The rest of this should
be discussed in private.

97
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,433
What were you thinking?!

98
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,500
You held negotiations in
secret...

99
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,533
...and then you even invite one
of their emissaries here?!

100
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,366
[CICERO] There are consequences
to this!

101
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,933
What do you think the Emperor
will do when he finds out?!

102
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,100
[CICERO] That goes for you too!
Don't think you'll get off...!

103
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,533
We're now in this together!

104
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,166
[SUGAWARA] Indeed.

105
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:24,166
[CICERO] You telling me my
nephew's still alive?!

106
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:26,766
[SUGAWARA] He is a prisoner of
war in our custody.

107
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:27,766
(gasp)

108
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:29,366
[CICERO] A prisoner of war?

109
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:32,566
[SUGAWARA] Yes.
The Princess has been
handling negotiations

110
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,900
on behalf of your
Empire.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,166
Thanks to her he should be
released shortly.

112
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:39,533
[CICERO] In exchange, I suppose
you want me to represent

113
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,400
your interests in some formal
capacity.

114
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,433
[SUGAWARA] Not at all, sir the
Princess has already
volunteered.

115
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,666
(breath catch)

116
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,533
[CICERO] I see then.

117
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,866
You don't want me getting in the
way of your talks.

118
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:51,733
[PINA] I'd love for you to join
me...

119
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,000
I need to give the same
good news to the Ducie family.

120
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,666
I'm sure they would enjoy your
company, Senator.

121
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:59,500
[CICERO] To see Lord Ducie...

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,866
Yes well... I do seem to
remember their family's forces
joining the battle.

123
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:08,533
[CICERO] I would be most
delighted to go along with you,
Princess.

124
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:13,500
All I'm asking, is that you take
care of my nephew.

125
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,366
(street/shopping buzz)

126
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,166
[YOJI] Wow. Look at this place,

127
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,000
it's really gotten busy, hasn't
it, Old School?

128
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,500
[KUWABARA] It used to just be
the PX here...

129
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,400
And now they've gone and built a
little town around it.

130
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,033
[YOJI] Yeah, well I'm sure it
has something to do with the PX

131
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:36,533
being chock full of a bunch of
Japanese products that these
people have never seen before.

132
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:39,700
[KUWABARA] Yeah, I know... It's
kinda like a side market.

133
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,166
People are making a killing
selling all this stuff to the
nobility back home.

134
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:47,000
[YOJI] Is that what's going on?
Well that's kinda cool.

135
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,000
[YOJI] A lot of this makes for
some pretty sweet souvenirs,
don'tcha think?

136
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,000
[YOJI] Besides a little free
trade is a good thing for
everyone.

137
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,800
[KUWABARA] I wouldn't say
everyone, sir.

138
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,866
[YOJI] Huh?

139
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,066
[KUWABARA] We keep building

140
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,400
more and more streets and
buildings...

141
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,400
and that means we need more
people out here.

142
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,333
[KUWABARA] It's barely working
as it is...

143
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:06,500
we're lucky Princess Myui
decided to loan out her maids

144
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,766
to help run all this.

145
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:10,066
[KUWABARA] it does have its
negative effects as well.

146
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,300
[YOJI] What do you mean?

147
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,466
[KUWABARA] I'm not a
prohibitionist

148
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:14,266
but look at this...

149
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:15,800
way too much free time, sir.

150
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,333
[KUWABARA] It can lead to bad
habits...

151
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:20,000
and a lot of our young guys have
a taste for bad habits.

152
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,566
[YOJI] A soldier needs to unwind
after a hard day.

153
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,066
[YOJI] But, if things get too
out of hand I'm sure you know

154
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,766
how to straighten the goofballs
out.

155
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,966
[KUWABARA] Yeah.

156
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,600
[DELILAH] Hands off the tail,
asshole!

157
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,066
HYAHH!
(hit) (impact/roll)

158
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,700
[DELILAH] Who the hell do you
think you are?!

159
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,133
[DELILAH] This ass is for show
not for trash like you to try
and grab and smack

160
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:41,833
you got it you little pint sized
twerp!

161
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,066
[DWARF] Watch your mouth
bitch...

162
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,100
You're messing with the wrong
dwarf.

163
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,466
[RORY] Well hello there little
fella,

164
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:49,166
would you mind if I messed with
you?

165
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:53,033
I'm sure that you're aware
who I am aren't you...

166
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,466
[DWARF] Uh... Emroy's girl...

167
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,766
[RORY] Look at that you got it
on the very first try!

168
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:59,033
Guess I'll give you a chance to
get out of this alive!

169
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:03,066
But if you're still interested
in getting messed with then I
will happily oblige!

170
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,033
[DWARF] I'm good! I'm good! I'm
gone!

171
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,933
[RORY] Heh. Typical.

172
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,333
[YOJI] Out on patrol, Rory?

173
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12,333
[RORY] There've been
a lot more people

174
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:14,266
coming in and out of town
lately...

175
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,566
many are idiots like Stumpy

176
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,966
who can't keep their hands
to themselves.

177
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,300
[YOJI] You're doing great.

178
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,166
[RORY] Are you going in to eat?

179
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:23,600
[YOJI] I was actually about to
meet someone for a drink.

180
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,766
[DORA] Here you go!

181
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,900
[YOJI] Huh.. Tuka?

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,433
[RORY] Uh... oh...? Tuka!

183
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,366
<react>

184
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,333
[RORY] Looking for someone,
dear?

185
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,933
[TUKA] Yeah... kind of...
something like that.

186
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,966
[RORY] Aw do you have a
boyfriend now?

187
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:41,200
[TUKA] Oh don't be silly, Rory!

188
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:45,066
[YOJI] Is she really doing this
every day now?

189
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,433
[MARI] Yes.

190
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,366
[MARI] Every day about this
time,

191
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:52,633
she starts wandering around
looking for her dead father.

192
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:55,466
[MARI] How long are we going to
let her keep doing this.

193
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:56,233
(grunt)

194
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,466
[YOJI] We can't stop her.

195
00:10:58,566 --> 00:10:59,566
(exhale)

196
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,133
[RORY] Do you really think
she needs someone

197
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:02,933
to force her into dealing with
this situation?

198
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,833
[MARI] Well yes of course she
does...

199
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,400
you can't... deal with the
future

200
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,266
if you're always dwelling on the
past.

201
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:11,133
[MARI] And well if she keeps
this up...

202
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:14,200
she'll end up losing her grip on
reality right now.

203
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,433
[MARI] No one... should live
like that.

204
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:20,033
[RORY] Suppose I see where
you're coming from...

205
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:21,000
(nasal exhale)

206
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,300
[YOJI] Look, Kurokawa...

207
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
If we all told her the truth...

208
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,900
that her father is dead and
she's searching in vain.

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,566
What good do you think that
would do for her?

210
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,666
(react)

211
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:31,900
It could very well send her

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,633
to a place much darker than
this.

213
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:37,266
And as her doctor...
you're the one who'd
have to be there for her.

214
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,066
And you just don't
have the time...

215
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,233
won't be long before we're
called back through the Gate.

216
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:47,233
[YOJI] All of us will be gone..
and Tuka will be left here to
deal with it all by herself.

217
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,533
[MARI] OK, so you favor doing
nothing?

218
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:53,666
[YOJI] I do... if we
can't care for that girl
until the very end...

219
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:55,033
then let her be.

220
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,866
[MARI] Very well, sir.

221
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:00,700
I need to get ready for
tomorrow. G'night.

222
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,333
[KUWABARA] I'll walk her back to
the barracks.

223
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,500
(nasal exhale)

224
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,000
[RORY] Less sulking, more
drinking... okay, sweetie?

225
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:19,500
[RORY] Aah... Nine hundred and
sixty years of this...
[YOJI] Huh?

226
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:25,066
[RORY] It's been a long time,
but it's gone by so quickly.

227
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,233
I've met so many people along
the way.

228
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,866
So many joyful greetings,

229
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:31,600
and so many bittersweet
farewells.

230
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,966
[RORY] Eventually I guess I've
grown less attached.

231
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:36,333
[YOJI] Well yeah, sure.

232
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,766
It's certainly made you a lot
tougher than most.

233
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:42,833
[RORY] Yes it has... so maybe
you shouldn't be so cold
hearted.

234
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:45,500
[YOJI] My heart's been asked to
handle more than I'm used to.

235
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,766
It's not big enough to be kind
to everyone.

236
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,833
[RORY] You know nothing.

237
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:50,966
<react>

238
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:52,433
[RORY] That is your problem...

239
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:56,000
your heart should only be opened
to one single person.

240
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,466
[RORY] You'll fare better with
the girls if you do.

241
00:12:58,566 --> 00:12:59,633
[YOJI] You don't, say?

242
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:03,233
[RORY] Look I've been a girl
for 960 years okay?

243
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,666
And every girl wants to be the
only one.

244
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:09,266
[YOJI] Heh...
You may be tough but you
can be quite the softie.

245
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:11,233
[YOJI] That's gotta be the
nicest thing I've ever heard

246
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,766
from someone called "The
Reaper."

247
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:17,766
[RORY] Ruling over death
is the same as ruling over life.

248
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:20,300
Death, after all,
is the end of life.

249
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,500
And in order for you
to die with grace,

250
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,100
Your life must have been lived
with respect and honor.

251
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,933
[YOJI] So respect for life is
the key to death... Huh.

252
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:32,566
[RORY] Right.

253
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,533
[RORY] Dora! Another one,
please!

254
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:37,466
[DORA] Coming up!

255
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,333
[YOJI] You might wanna
slow down...

256
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:40,833
you're gonna wind up drunk.

257
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:44,066
[RORY] Too late for thaat!
Will you take care of me baby?

258
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,300
[YOJI] Take it easy... people
are looking at us!

259
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,500
[RORY] Oh come on Itami, you
think I care about them?

260
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
(exhales nervously)

261
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,700
[YAO] What kind of place is
this?!

262
00:13:57,766 --> 00:13:59,100
(surprised)

263
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:05,366
[YAO] What do you think you're
doing, serving alcohol to a
child!

264
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,817
(snoozy sounds)

265
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,784
[YOJI] Hey, wake up, Rory.
They need to close up.

266
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:26,417
[RORY] Mm... I can't drink any
more.

267
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:28,917
[YOJI] Yeah. Well you shouldn't
anyway.

268
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,351
(grunt/lift)

269
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:32,751
(happy)

270
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:38,751
[RORY] Ah! Could you be gentler
with me, please?

271
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:39,884
[YOJI] Goodnight, Rory...

272
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:42,451
[RORY] Wait.
[YOJI] Whut...wahhhh!

273
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,684
(grunt/exhale)

274
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:52,217
[RORY] I need you to stay with
me. Please, Itami?

275
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:53,817
[YOJI] I guess for a bit.

276
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,251
(annoyed)

277
00:14:56,951 --> 00:15:00,217
[RORY] Okay... Who are you...!

278
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,351
You think you can
just waltz in here

279
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:05,384
and ruin the spectacular plans
I had for this evening, huh!

280
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,351
[YOJI] Uh what plans're you
talking about, Rory?

281
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:08,517
OW!

282
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,651
[YOJI] Whahhhhh!!! Wh‐What was
that for?!

283
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:13,417
[RORY] You stay out of this.

284
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:15,451
[YAO] My name is Yao Haa Dushi.

285
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:18,417
[RORY] Hmph! Yes, and you're a
dark elf...

286
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,217
And I'm betting you're around
three hundred years old, yes?

287
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:25,184
[WOLFBOY] Oh dear god a dark elf
and Emroy's apostle are gonna go
nose‐to‐nose.

288
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:26,684
[SCARFACE] It's gonna be a
bloodbath.

289
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:27,817
[RORY] Alrighty then...

290
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:29,417
what exactly did you come here
for?

291
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:31,551
[YAO] Well child... I'm a
daughter of Dehan

292
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:34,351
in the Dushi Clan living in the
Schwartz Woods.

293
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:37,017
I have been told that the
"green ones" come to this inn...

294
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:39,251
and I would like to speak with
them if I could.

295
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:41,017
[RORY] The green ones?

296
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:42,184
[YAO] Yes.

297
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:43,517
But first things first...

298
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:45,884
Why are you giving this little
girl alcohol?!

299
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:47,251
Taking advantage of a child

300
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:49,617
will have severe consequences.

301
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:50,917
<sneaky chuckle>

302
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,317
[RORY] Please save me from this
debauchery!

303
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:56,751
[RORY] That dirty heathen has
been forcing me to drink with
him!

304
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:57,984
[YOJI] Huhhhhhh?!

305
00:15:58,084 --> 00:15:59,217
[RORY] He's coercing me!

306
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:01,217
Telling me to drink
or he'll hurt me!!!

307
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:03,484
[YAO] You miserable son of a
bitch.

308
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:06,417
[YAO] I will make sure this
hurts!

309
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:08,184
(fakey cry)

310
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,317
[YOJI] You're messed up Rory!

311
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:16,484
[YAO] Now don't you worry,
little one. This filthy pig is
going to pay the price.

312
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,784
[YAO] Uh?
[YOJI] Gotta go!

313
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:23,984
[DELILAH] Hey buddy!
I'm putting this on your tab!

314
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,784
[YAO] Good.
You're safe now child.

315
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,584
The evil's gone... Hmm?

316
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:31,184
[DELILAH] Your "innocent victim"
took off through the window.

317
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:33,117
[YAO] Uh...? Whatever for?

318
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:35,317
Huh... And after I tried
to help her out, too...

319
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,617
Well that was rather rude.

320
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:38,417
[DELILAH] Yeah, yeah...
you're gonna drink?

321
00:16:38,517 --> 00:16:40,684
[YAO] No, I'm here to find
someone...

322
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:43,884
[DELILAH] Yeah, well, the green
guys aren't here right now.

323
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:45,451
[DELILAH] I'm trying to run a
business...

324
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:48,151
If you're not going to drink,
then you gotta go.

325
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:49,984
[YAO] All right... I'll have an
ale.

326
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:53,117
[DWARF] Hey, kid... you said
you were lookin' for the green
people, right?

327
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:55,684
[YAO] Yes.
[MEIA] Mmwhy is it you're
lookin' for them?

328
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:57,884
[YAO] There's something I need
them to do for me.

329
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:01,284
[CUSTOMER] So why do you think
Rory the Reaper was putting on
the little kid act?

330
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:02,984
[CUSTOMER] Don't know but the
elf had no idea

331
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:05,117
she had one of people she was
looking for right in front of
her.

332
00:17:05,217 --> 00:17:06,484
[DWARF] Maybe the green people

333
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:08,651
won't be able to do what you
want 'em to.

334
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:09,951
[MEIA] He does have a point.

335
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:11,551
[YAO] Why is that...

336
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:14,517
I heard that the green ones are
a band of honorable warriors.

337
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,784
[YAO] If that's true, they
wouldn't abandon people

338
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:18,451
in their time of need would
they?

339
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:21,184
[YAO] I'm also prepared to pay
for their help.

340
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:23,817
[CUSTOMER] God! Lookit the size
of that thing!

341
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,117
[CUSTOMER] You could buy
yourself a kingdom
with a diamond like that!

342
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:29,017
[CUSTOMER] I could work over a
thousand years and never earn
that much!

343
00:17:29,117 --> 00:17:30,484
[CUSTOMER] I'll do whatever you
want miss!

344
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,151
[CUSTOMER] Back off, buddy! This
bounty is mine!

345
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,584
[CUSTOMER] No. I'm doing it!

346
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:36,217
[CUSTOMER] Forget it, man!
What do you need, my lady!

347
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:38,051
[YAO] Hmph. Yeah well, I'm
sorry, boys...

348
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:40,451
but I don't think any of you
have what it takes.

349
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:41,184
[CUSTOMER] What?

350
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:42,617
Oh I got what it takes!

351
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:44,217
[CUSTOMER] How do you know?!

352
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:46,784
You haven't even told us the
task!

353
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:53,717
[YAO] I need someone to kill a
flame dragon.

354
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:56,217
[CUSTOMER] A
...flame...dragon...

355
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:57,917
[YAO] That's right. It's already
injured.

356
00:17:58,017 --> 00:17:59,251
Who here is willing?

357
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:01,251
[YAO] If you find this reward
insufficient...

358
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:04,217
[YAO] I shall include myself as
part of the payment.

359
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,651
[ALL] There's no way I'm getting
involved in that.

360
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,251
Are you gonna try it?

361
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:09,451
[CUSTOMER] A flame dragon...?
Hell. No...

362
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,184
[ALL] Yeah, best of luck to ya,
little lady!

363
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:18,184
Heh...No kidding. I'm not
getting myself killed.

364
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:20,951
[CUSTOMER] Hope you find those
green fellas,

365
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:24,084
they're the only ones nuts
enough for that!

366
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:32,351
[YAO] I must've missed them.

367
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:34,084
[DELILAH] Call it a night, okay.

368
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:36,084
[YAO] Guess I will.

369
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:37,684
[DELILAH] You got a place to
stay for the night?

370
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,384
[YAO] Won't be a problem...

371
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:49,451
[YAO] The spirits of the wind
sing their songs out here.

372
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:53,084
[YAO] And the water and the air
are especially calm and pure...

373
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,584
as is the land healthy, green
and lush.

374
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:03,784
[YAO] This is a good place.

375
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:08,351
[YAO] Just a little longer...

376
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,517
[YAO] Everyone... please hold on
a little longer.

377
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:24,617
(growls)

378
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:31,284
(fearful, screams)

379
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:38,117
(roars)

380
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:42,484
(jet engine roar)

381
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,217
[KAMIKODA] How about this?!

382
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,151
You think you can catch me,
Nishimoto?!

383
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:59,151
[KURIHAMA] He got behind us!
Break to the right!

384
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:00,751
[KAMIKODA] Shit!

385
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:11,451
[KAMIKODA] There! I got your ass
now!

386
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:14,117
[NISHIMOTO] I don't think so,
rookie!

387
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,284
[YAO] Yes, there they are...
I've found the green ones!

388
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:25,851
[YAO] At long last...

389
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:28,484
we will finally receive the help
we need.

390
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:32,984
[YOJI] Textiles... dishes and
pots and pans

391
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:34,517
and all sorts of kitchen stuff.

392
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:36,984
[YOJI] Oh wow. You even got sake
in here.

393
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,451
[YANAGIDA] I'm pretty sure no
one will mind

394
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:39,751
if you went ahead and took one.

395
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:41,451
[TODO] Um I think I'll mind.

396
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:43,217
All the stuff in these
containers are like

397
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:45,184
ammunition and weapons for us
diplomats, okay?

398
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:46,717
[YANAGIDA] Oh are you trying to
tell me

399
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:49,017
you've never once skimmed a
bottle or two for yourself?

400
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:51,184
[TODO] I'd never do such a
thing.

401
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,051
[YANAGIDA] Ah, and this funds
the operation.

402
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,151
[TODO] Yeah. We managed to
collect

403
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:58,051
some local currency from the
Alnus co‐op.

404
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:00,051
[TODO] From some grocery sales.

405
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:02,117
And now we'll be able to
put it to good use.

406
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:03,517
[YANAGIDA] Should be highly
effective

407
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:05,384
in stabilizing and growing a
developing country.

408
00:21:05,484 --> 00:21:07,117
[TODO] Yeah, something like
that.

409
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:08,884
Depends on the country,
right...?

410
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:11,017
This definitely beats
strong‐arm tactics.

411
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:12,717
[YANAGIDA] Yeah whatever you
say...

412
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:14,884
they already saw what happened
the last time they threatened
us.

413
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:18,784
[TODO] And that is why you are
never gonna be an ambassador.

414
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:21,951
We don't need to create
any more unnecessary trouble

415
00:21:22,051 --> 00:21:23,184
[TODO] For now, I'll just focus
on getting

416
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:30,984
more peace‐minded people to the
table.

417
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:33,151
[YANAGIDA] Itami. Make sure it
all gets through.

418
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,451
[YOJI] Yeah! We got this, okay?

419
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:45,084
[YOJI] Right!

420
00:21:45,184 --> 00:21:47,284
The capitol's next, so strap in!

421
00:22:01,184 --> 00:22:03,417
[YAO] A little more faith,
everyone!

422
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:07,184
[YAO] Soon... I will bring the
green ones,

423
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,317
and our salvation, back home!

424
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:48,051
[LELEI] Next time on "GATE:"

425
00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:50,217
Itami Might...
