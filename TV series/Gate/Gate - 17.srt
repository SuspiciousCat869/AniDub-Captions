1
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:02,533
[LELEI] Japan's Self Defense
Force

2
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:04,400
was dispatched to the
mysterious Special Region.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,866
And have begun mixing with the
locals.

4
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:12,800
At base camp, Delilah and
Yanagida engaged in a bloody
battle ending in dire results.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,833
[LELEI] In order to save Tuka,
who is traumatized by the death
of her father,

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,066
Itami sets off to fight the
flame dragon.

7
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,333
[LELEI] Once he and his friends
arrive at the settlement of the
dark elves ...

8
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:25,100
They prepare for the battle to
begin...

9
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,633
[ITAMI] That was a really bad
idea.

10
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:19,733
[LELEI] What was?

11
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,733
[ITAMI] Well...

12
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,000
I finally tried to deny it,

13
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,266
but Tuka still
thinks that I'm her father.

14
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,200
[LELEI] It's as if she's
avoiding reality

15
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,433
in order to somehow keep her
peace of mind intact.

16
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:31,200
[ITAMI] Exactly. And when
confronted with that
reality today,

17
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,066
she was unable to cope with it.

18
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,900
[LELEI] Should we try to make
her face it again,

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,166
or should we
wait for another time?

20
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:38,000
[ITAMI] No. We can't wait any
longer.

21
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,633
It's why we brought her out here
in the first place.

22
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:44,333
[ITAMI] And if it comes to it,
we'll force her to face it.

23
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,933
Hmm? Is something wrong?

24
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:51,500
[LELEI] My magic was unable to
have any real effect on the
flame dragon.

25
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,166
I don't like that.

26
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:56,566
I can't believe my halberd's
blade had no effect, either...

27
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,700
[RORY] If I can't slice it I'll
have to strike it.

28
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,166
But it's so tacky to beat one's
enemy to death.

29
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,766
<react>

30
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:08,033
[ELDER] Your holiness.

31
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:10,133
We humbly thank you for making

32
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,400
the long journey to our desolate
valley.

33
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,800
[RORY] Uh it's not like we came
here to see you guys.

34
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,933
[YAO] Okay Itami... Let me
introduce you.

35
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:19,666
The greatest warriors of my
people.

36
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:24,266
[YAO] Kurow, Meto, Ban, Fen,
Nocko, Komu, Seimi, Nayu.

37
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:26,266
It is an honor for all of us

38
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:29,366
to accompany you on your
mission.

39
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:32,100
[ELDER] You must travel on foot
to the nest of the dragon.

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,300
We will be your guides and help
carry your belongings.

41
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,100
[ITAMI] Thank you.

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,266
[ELDER] If you had not come to
us when you did...

43
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:42,366
everyone in our clan would have
surely perished.

44
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:44,700
[ELDER] We would all willingly
risk our lives

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,233
to ensure victory over this
beast.

46
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,733
[ITAMI] Tell me...Why does the
flame dragon

47
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,233
continue to attack your tribe?

48
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,566
[ITAMI] If it takes out
everyone,

49
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,966
then it only ends up without any
food at all.

50
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,333
[LELEI] Both their active period

51
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,200
and rest period are quite
lengthy.

52
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,233
So they typically eat all the
food they can find...

53
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,133
And then during their
hybernation,

54
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:05,233
the population rebounds and
replenishes itself.

55
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,400
[ITAMI] Well I guess this is
hunting season then.

56
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,033
So this is the equipment we're
going to need

57
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,533
to have a chance against that
thing.

58
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,266
[KUROW] These must be the iron
weapons

59
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:19,400
we're told severed the flame
dragon's arm!

60
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,766
[ITAMI] Yes...And I'm gonna show
you how to use them.

61
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:23,766
[KUROW] Is this correct?

62
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,100
[ITAMI] Uh‐huh. Now put the

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,100
target in your crosshairs,
and fire.

64
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,566
Now when you do, a huge
counter‐mass of force will shoot
out the back.

65
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,733
So for safety ‐ you must always
make sure there's no one behind
you.

66
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,166
[KUROW] I understand

67
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,000
[ITAMI] Yeah. That looks good
guys.

68
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,166
[LELEI] We are ready to go.

69
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,300
[RORY] Just tell us when
sweetie.

70
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,466
[LELEI] I've used a spell to
keep Tuka sleeping.

71
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,266
[RORY] She must've been so
terrified.

72
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:52,033
She kept saying "father" over
and over again.

73
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,800
[ITAMI] Is this it?

74
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,400
[YAO] Yes. Mount Duva,

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,466
our scouts saw the nest of the
flame dragon beneath its peak.

76
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:25,066
[KUROW] It goes in and out from
the mountain's crest.

77
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,500
Its nest is on the rock platform
inside the crater.

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,933
<Humm>

79
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,566
So how do we get in?

80
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,766
[KUROW] About halfway up..

81
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,566
there's a cave leading inside.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,400
[KUROW] I stumbled across
this place one day

83
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,900
when I was out foraging for
sulfur from fuming fruits.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,933
[RORY] <scared whimpering>

85
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:52,333
[KUROW] Deep inside, it opens up
to a room underneath the crater,

86
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:54,200
That's where I saw the flame
dragon. Sleeping.

87
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,300
For fear of waking the creature,
I fled.

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
[RORY] Can we not get inside
from the top?

89
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,566
[KUROW] It's far too steep. It's
impossible to traverse from
there.

90
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,033
[RORY] So we really have no
other way in but to go through
the cave?

91
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,600
[RORY] I really have a problem
with going underground!

92
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,866
[ITAMI] It's OK. Rory, you can
stay out here.

93
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,566
We'll go on in without you.

94
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,100
[ITAMI] And you can watch for
our scaly friend coming home.

95
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:36,933
[ITAMI] <react> How'd it go?

96
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:38,300
[YAO] It's just as Kurow said...

97
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
the cave leads right
to its nest.

98
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,633
[YAO] But the flame dragon
wasn't there.

99
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,533
[ITAMI] Good. Then we'll finish
eating and take a look.

100
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:46,766
<nodding yes>

101
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,933
[ITAMI] Can you hear me..Come in
Rory.

102
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:54,266
[RORY] Yes, I can hear you.

103
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,066
[ITAMI] Let's go.

104
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,900
[KUROW] Okay, it's right over
there.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,033
[ITAMI] Wait here.

106
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,700
Okay then... this is it... the
nest.

107
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,100
Are these egg shells?

108
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,000
[LELEI] During their active
period, just as all animals,

109
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,966
they eat, breed, and foster
children.

110
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,566
[LELEI] I guess I forgot about
that.

111
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,000
Does that mean.. there could be
more flame dragons?

112
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,233
[LELEI] No. These shells appear
quite old.

113
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,600
They likely hatched a long time
ago.

114
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,666
[LELEI] I'm sure they've already
left the nest.

115
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,500
[KUROW] The tribe has only
witnessed a single flame dragon.

116
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,033
[ITAMI] Good. We can only handle
one at a time.

117
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,033
[NOCKO] Wow...Look at all these
magical swords.

118
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,000
[SEIMI] These are... amazing.

119
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,100
[ITAMI] Oh.. They must belong to
people who've been killed by the
dragon.

120
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
[LELEI] Yes. Many have faced the
dragon ‐

121
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,700
We should let this be a reminder
of what we're up against.

122
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,300
[ITAMI] Alright! Ban, Fen, Nocko

123
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,466
I need a hole in the
middle of the nest.
[DARK ELVES] Right!

124
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,400
[ITAMI] And the rest of you
can help me with this.

125
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,133
We need to make six of these.

126
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,300
[YAO] This is going to kill the
flame dragon?

127
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,200
[ITAMI] It's 160 lbs of C4
plastic explosives.

128
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,100
If this explodes, even a flame
dragon should be blown to bits.

129
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,600
Well at least I hope so.

130
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:48,300
I'll do the rest of these.

131
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,066
Rory... Can you hear me little
lady?

132
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,400
How is it looking out there?

133
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,233
<static>

134
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,633
[ITAMI] She's not getting me.

135
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,900
The rocks must be interfering
with our reception.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,233
[ITAMI] Rory!

137
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,333
Not getting anything.

138
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:05,333
Shouldn't be wearing this radio
while I work down here anyway.

139
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:09,400
The radio waves set off the C4.
It's too dangerous.

140
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,300
Shit. No choice.

141
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,600
Kinda reminds me of training in
the SFG.

142
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,566
<distant roar>

143
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,666
<react>

144
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,366
[RORY] Itami! Are you there? The
flame dragon is back!

145
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:48,266
Um Itami? Please say something,
if you can hear me!

146
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:50,633
[RORY] Oh dear!

147
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,133
Itami!

148
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,266
[YAO] Why'd you put swords here?

149
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,133
[ITAMI] 'Cause we need to cause
all the damage we can.

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,666
Okay. It's. done.

151
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:15,833
<whew>

152
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:17,266
<terror>

153
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,266
<terror>

154
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,566
[ITAMI] What is it?

155
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,000
Here we go.

156
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,433
[bellow]

157
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,366
[ITAMI] Here we go.

158
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,666
Check behind you!

159
00:10:57,766 --> 00:10:58,766
<countermass screaming>

160
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:02,533
[KOMU] Yes!

161
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,766
<struggles>

162
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,566
[ITAMI] Extend the probe!

163
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,966
Look out! Nocko!

164
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:20,833
<chomped on by the dragon>

165
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,066
<screaming>

166
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,700
[YAO] Itami, go back to the
cave!

167
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,033
[ITAMI]

168
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,766
<grunt ‐ knocked into Itami>

169
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:36,666
No! Don't shoot!

170
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,366
[YAO] Itami! ... No! Itami!

171
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,100
<screaming>

172
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,766
<flashback screaming>

173
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,766
<terror gasping>

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,366
[TUKA] My father is dead...

175
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:07,233
it should have been me instead
of him.

176
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,300
[TUKA] He should never have
died...

177
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,633
My father is gone and it's all
my fault!

178
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,566
[LELEI] That is not true.

179
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:18,100
He died because the flame dragon
killed him. That is the truth.

180
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,166
[TUKA] But!
[LELEI] You believe the flame
dragon cannot be destroyed.

181
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:25,033
That is why you're choosing to
direct your anger at yourself.

182
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,400
[TUKA] But how can we kill it?!
It's impossible!

183
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:33,033
[YAO] Itami! You're still alive!

184
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,400
[ITAMI] Yao!

185
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,300
[YAO] You need to go
back to the cave right now!

186
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,400
[ITAMI] Wait, Yao!

187
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:44,233
[ITAMI] Shit! Damn thing's
broken!

188
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,766
<scream>

189
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,600
[ITAMI] You son of a bitch!

190
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:13,533
[ITAMI] There it is.

191
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,633
<heavy breathing>

192
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,833
[LELEI] My village and my home

193
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,166
was also taken by this monster.

194
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:25,400
[LELEI] And many of my loved
ones were killed.

195
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,400
[TUKA] Lelei?!

196
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,700
[LELEI] It's not fast
enough...Move Faster!

197
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,333
[LELEI] It went in...

198
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:50,666
<laughing>

199
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,133
It worked.

200
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,766
<react>

201
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,033
[ITAMI] Look at that.

202
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,033
[LELEI] This is it...our
revenge!

203
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:20,600
[LELEI] Now dragon! I shall send
you back to hell!

204
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,666
[YAO] Itami!

205
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:37,700
[ITAMI] No don't!

206
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,500
[KUROW] Save the magic user!

207
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,066
[BOTH] Lelei!

208
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,366
[KUROW] Get away from them!

209
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,033
[KUROW] <death by fireball
scream>

210
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,400
[YAO] Kurow!

211
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,600
[ITAMI] Come on!

212
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,766
<gasp>

213
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,766
<panting running>

214
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,533
[TUKA] No my father's going to
die!

215
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,433
<revenge scream>

216
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,766
<gasp>

217
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,633
<gasp>

218
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,566
[ITAMI] Go! Get outta here!

219
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,033
<screaming>

220
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:30,333
[ITAMI] Tuka!

221
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,100
[YAO] Hold on we have you!

222
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,666
[ITAMI] Is everyone alright?

223
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:51,900
[TUKA] I guess. I think so.

224
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
[ITAMI] What about you two?

225
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,333
[YAO] Somewhat.

226
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:56,733
[LELEI] I think I'm good enough
to walk.

227
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,233
[ITAMI] There.

228
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,700
[RORY] Hey, what took you so
long?

229
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,133
<pained breathing>

230
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,233
[ITAMI] Rory!

231
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,966
[ITAMI] What happened?! What's
going on?

232
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:18,166
[GISELLE] <evil laughter>

233
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:22,200
[GISELLE] My poor, poor sister.

234
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:31,966
You are supposed to become the
wife of a god.

235
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:33,900
Yet you so casually

236
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,500
interact with these filthy....
humans.

237
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,900
How dare you sully our family
line.

238
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,566
[RORY] You're wasting your time,

239
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,200
I will never marry Hardy!

240
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,133
<laugh>

241
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,833
[ITAMI] Uh. And who are you
supposed to be?

242
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,400
[GISELLE] My name is Giselle.

243
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,066
And as you can see, I am an
apostle!

244
00:17:57,433 --> 00:18:00,000
[GISELLE] I serve my Lord;
Hardy.

245
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,333
I've been ordered to retrieve my
disgraceful,

246
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:04,066
ungrateful sister and bring her
back,

247
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,233
...so here I am.

248
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:12,033
[ITAMI] Rory's a big girl
I think she can make that
decision for herself.

249
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,666
[GISELLE] You are a fool, human.

250
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:15,533
She is in a weakened state.

251
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:18,933
Because she has taken the burden
of your wounds for you.

252
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:19,700
[ITAMI] What?

253
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:27,066
[GISELLE] Normally, there's no
way

254
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,000
I would be able to take her down
on my own,

255
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,300
but her injuries have changed
all that.

256
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,833
I don't know what
you have done to her,

257
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:36,666
but she is foolishly harboring
your injuries as her own.

258
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:37,766
[ITAMI] Why?

259
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,700
[RORY] That would be
my business.

260
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,033
[GISELLE] Now that we all know

261
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,333
what the situation really is,

262
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:45,466
perhaps next time you won't hold
back.

263
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,700
[YAO] Oh no... Two more
dragons...

264
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,500
[ITAMI] Are those... from
the eggs inside the nest?

265
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,500
[GISELLE] I had to awaken the
flame dragon

266
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,933
so she could bear and tame her
offspring for me.

267
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,433
[GISELLE] With them by my side,

268
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,033
you have no chance against me,
sister.

269
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,133
[YAO] How could you do something
so reckless?

270
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,033
[LELEI] So it was Hardy's
apostle

271
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:06,833
who shortened the rest period,

272
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,233
[LELEI] ...by 50 years.

273
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,000
[YAO] But what about the people
of my tribe?

274
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,900
[RORY] The apostles of the gods

275
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,100
have no sympathy for humans nor
elves...

276
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,566
[RORY] And that would include me
as well.

277
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,700
<grunt>

278
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,900
[GISELLE] Precisely.

279
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,366
Humans and elves have no right

280
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:23,966
to interfere with such divine
matters.

281
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:26,566
[RORY] But this one here.. is no
ordinary human

282
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,466
for he killed the flame dragon
on its own ground.

283
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:33,566
[GISELLE] What? A human killed
the beast?

284
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,600
[GISELLE] Impossible. Where is
this dragon slayer?

285
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,100
<flinch gasp> [ITAMI] Who Me?

286
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,933
[GISELLE] Well this is
interesting.

287
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:44,333
Towato, Mowto! Come devour your
revenge.

288
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,366
[GISELLE] And spare him no pain!

289
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,566
[GISELLE] Show no mercy!

290
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,866
<surprise gasp>

291
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:50,866
<react>

292
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:51,700
[GISELLE] Where is he going?

293
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,500
Go! Follow him!

294
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,766
<breathing running>

295
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:02,033
[KAMIKODA] I see it!
Uh... Does the dragon look like
it's gotten smaller?

296
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:05,033
[KURIHAMA] There's two of 'em.
Completely different targets
than before.

297
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:06,866
[MIZUHARA] Well they're pissed
off.

298
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:08,266
And definitely after Itami.

299
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:10,566
[KAMIKODA] Yes, they are. Let's
do it.

300
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,933
[KURIHAMA] Target locked!

301
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:19,100
[KAMIKODA] Hawkwind 01,
Fox Two, fire!

302
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,100
[KAMIKODA] Fox Three!

303
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,066
[KAMIKODA] Trebor, this is
Hawkwind 01.

304
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,366
We chased the targets down to
the ground.

305
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:33,066
[TREBOR] Hawkwind, this is
Trebor, copy.

306
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,333
[TREBOR] The Artillery unit will
open fire. Over.

307
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,366
[SPOTTER] Ready! Impact!

308
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:40,933
Use the exact same coordinates.

309
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,133
Fire away men, hit it again!

310
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:58,700
[GISELLE] What is this?!

311
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,866

[TUKA] I don't know, I'm kinda
used to saying it now.
