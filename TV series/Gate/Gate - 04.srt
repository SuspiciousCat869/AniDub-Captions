1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:04,333
[LELEI] A Gate connecting to
another world
has appeared in Japan.

2
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:07,166
The Self Defense Force was sent
in to investigate,

3
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:10,000
where they met the people of the
Coda Village.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,833
[LELEI] While helping the
villagers evacuate,

5
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:13,366
they run into a powerful Flame
Dragon.

6
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:15,900
[LELEI] After finally beating
back the beast,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Itami and the others found a
mysterious oracle,

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,266
and an elf the lone survivor
of her people.

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,333
[LELEI] Her name... Tuka Luna
Marceau.

10
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:37,166
[HODREW] Tuka!

11
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,666
You need to get up! Right now!

12
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:42,000
[TUKA] Hmm... What is it?

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,733
[HODREW] We need to go!

14
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:49,233
[TUKA] A dragon!

15
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,133
[TUKA] Father!

16
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,900
[HODREW] You should be safe in
here!

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,533
[TUKA] But Father!

18
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:23,633
[TUKA] Father, NO!

19
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,266
[MARI] Good morning.

20
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:34,000
[TUKA] Uh...? Ah... Oh?

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,266
[YOJI] Oh. Well, well. Rise and
shine.

22
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:38,766
[YOJI] We're almost at camp.

23
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,200
[TUKA] Huh?

24
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,933
[GUY] What?
They drove away a flame
dragon?!

25
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,033
[MELIZA] That's right! They sure
did...

26
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,933
I saw the whole thing with my
own eyes!

27
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,033
[GUY] Oh, you're full of it!

28
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,766
You're the worst liar, Meliza.

29
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:33,700
[MELIZA] I'm not lying!

30
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,633
[GUY] Maybe you fell

31
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,566
and hit your head

32
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,966
and had a little dream!

33
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:40,433
[MELIZA] Whatever! Don't believe
me! See if I care!

34
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,033
[HAMILTON] So, Norma, what do
you think?

35
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,333
[NORMA] What do I think?

36
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,100
[NORMA] The food is atrocious...

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,733
and the only thing that's worse
are the drinks.

38
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,266
[GREY] Look, Norma...

39
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:52,233
we're here to conduct
reconnaissance on the way to
Alnus.

40
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,033
[GREY] Let's focus on the flame
dragon.

41
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,033
[PINA] Lower your voice. Go
ahead, Hamilton.

42
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:59,133
[HAMILTON] Oh? Yes.

43
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,266
There's a lot of talk on the
street.

44
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,200
About a group of mercenaries in
green...

45
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,433
They evacuated the people in
Coda Village.

46
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:10,333
[HAMILTON] They say they
defeated a flame dragon.

47
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,833
[NORMA] Uh yeah, well, I don't
know.

48
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,366
There are wyverns, and drakes,
and anything

49
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,500
that could be easily be mistaken
for something like that.

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,133
[MELIZA] I know a real flame
dragon when I see one, mister.

51
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:22,033
[NORMA] (laughs) You've been
drinking what you're selling.

52
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:24,100
[MELIZA] Laugh all you want, but
I saw what I saw.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,266
[HAMILTON] Okay, then.

54
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,233
The men in green that drove it
away.

55
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,166
What can you tell us about them?

56
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,866
[MELIZA] Hmm... Not so sure
about the details.

57
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:34,233
[HAMILTON] I think you might
remember. (gasp)

58
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,733
[MELIZA] Yeah, you know what?

59
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,200
I think it's coming back to me!

60
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,033
[MELIZA] You are in for a most
impressive story indeed.

61
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,800
[MELIZA] They came... the same
day of the attack...

62
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,400
nary a one of us would have
survived!

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,366
They had a magical weapon, a
deadly fire spear made of iron.

64
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:51,800
[MELIZA] And they were riding

65
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,400
an immense carriage as strong as
stone...

66
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,533
[MELIZA] All of them clad in
green.

67
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,433
[KATO] Wow!

68
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,333
[ALL] Ohhh...

69
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:05,166
[LELEI] This is their
fortress?

70
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:06,733
[HIGAKI] What?! And who the hell

71
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,400
told you to bring 'em here?!

72
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,500
[YOJI] So... bringing 'em here
was a bad idea?

73
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,000
[HIGAKI] Do we have anywhere to
keep them... dummy?

74
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,066
[YOJI] Uh... what do we do,
then?

75
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,600
[HIGAKI] I'm supposed to ask
that! Uhhh...

76
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,066
[HIGAKI] Guess I'll report it.

77
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,566
[YANAGIDA] General... the recon
teams have reported.

78
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,466
[HAZAMA] Good...! And what did
they find?

79
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:32,033
[YANAGIDA] There's a
considerable language barrier...

80
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:36,200
We have managed to make a few
peaceful contacts, sir.

81
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,600
Most of the locals at least

82
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,233
have the appearance of humans,

83
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,933
and their main industry is
agriculture and forestry.

84
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,400
[YANAGIDA] Details of what they
produce

85
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,200
and their economy is in the
report, sir.

86
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,733
Each of the settlements have
something like a chief in place,

87
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:51,033
but we still don't know
if there's a larger political
process at work.

88
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:54,733
We have to yet met any formal
representatives.

89
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:56,833
(sigh)

90
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,233
[YANAGIDA] What we could really
use

91
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,066
are a few of the locals to start
a dialogue with.

92
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,633
[HAZAMA] Could be problematic.

93
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:04,100
As long as we're having the
language issue.

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,133
Otherwise it'll look like we're
making an

95
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,833
attempt to kidnap them and bring
a retaliation.

96
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,166
[YANAGIDA] Perhaps, general...

97
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,633
But the Third Recon has some...

98
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:13,300
refugees from helping a village

99
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,500
they rescued from a recent
attack.

100
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,400
[HAZAMA] Hmm... they have
refugees?

101
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,866
Well... isn't that
convenient.

102
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,466
[HIGAKI] So for now, Itami...

103
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:25,933
we'll accept the Coda Village
refugees

104
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,966
as part of a humanitarian
effort.

105
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:30,100
[HIGAKI] And Lieutenant...
you're in charge

106
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
of housing and observing them
for now.

107
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,333
[YOJI] Uh...? Wait, you mean

108
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,633
I'M supposed to be responsible
for them?

109
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,600
[HIGAKI] That's right.

110
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,866
You brought 'em, Dummy...

111
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,266
SO YOU TAKE CARE OF 'EM!

112
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,633
[YOJI] Kuribayashi and Kurokawa,

113
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,733
we need some some rations from
the quartermaster.

114
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,233
Kurata and Tomita, see if you
can find us some tents.

115
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,800
I'll go ahead and get the
paperwork started.

116
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,000
[ALL] Roger!

117
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:53,700
[YANAGIDA] Itami.

118
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,233
[YOJI] Huh? Lieutenant
Yanagida...

119
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,400
[YANAGIDA] You have a moment?

120
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,733
[YANAGIDA] All right then...
just admit it.

121
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,133
[YOJI] Admit to what?

122
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,100
[YANAGIDA] Don't play dumb with
me.

123
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,366
In all your service you never
missed

124
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:08,900
one scheduled call in to
headquarters...

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
but after taking on this
dragon...

126
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,233
not one message has gotten
through.

127
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,600
[YANAGIDA] You thought we were
gonna

128
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,733
order you to abandon the
refugees, didn't you?

129
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,033
Huh... Must be this new place!

130
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:23,033
Messing with the radio and the
frequencies and whatnot?

131
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,766
[YANAGIDA] (nasal exhale) You're
full of shit.

132
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,500
[YANAGIDA] Look, Itami...

133
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,933
[YANAGIDA] There are a lot of
resources here...

134
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,533
There's a lot of habitable land
around us...

135
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,500
and there's not a trace of

136
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,333
environmental pollution to speak
of.

137
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:53,200
And from what our geologists
have found...

138
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,966
we could shake the world's
economy with what's here.

139
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:58,000
[YANAGIDA] And I don't have to
tell you how far

140
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,066
we are ahead of these people in
technology.

141
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,033
And it just happened the only
gateway to this world

142
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,900
...is right in the middle of
Japan...

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,133
The government
hasn't figured out

144
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,633
what to do with all this
treasure.

145
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:09,766
So the the Diet wants to know

146
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,466
exactly what we're sitting on.

147
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:16,500
[YANAGIDA] Specifically they
want to know if it's worth

148
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,333
turning half the world's major
powers against us.

149
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,100
[YOJI] And what if they decide
it is?

150
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,366
[YANAGIDA] Sometimes,

151
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,300
one must take possession
of what one wants.

152
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,900
[YANAGIDA] But in doing so...

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,633
the rest of the world could turn
away.

154
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,133
Now with this, we could still
support ourselves.

155
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:35,166
But, only if we're willing to do
it when the time comes.

156
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,933
[YOJI] Yanagida...

157
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:41,933
All I did... was bring in some
refugees.

158
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,400
[YANAGIDA] And in doing so
you've begun

159
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,266
the trust building process
on this side of the Gate.

160
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,366
[YANAGIDA] What that means
is you're sitting on

161
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,600
a potential goldmine of
information.

162
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,333
That being said, you're gonna

163
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,066
be given a great deal of
freedom, understand?

164
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,000
[YANAGIDA] You might wanna
rethink your work ethic.

165
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,166
[KATO] I'm what you'd call a
"wizard," Kato El‐Altestan,

166
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:10,166
[KATO] ...and this here is my
student...

167
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,433
[LELEI] Lelei la Lalena.

168
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:15,166
[RORY] You can call me Rory
Mercury.

169
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:19,233
[RORY] An apostle of the Dark
Lord Emroy.

170
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,666
[TUKA] And I'm... Hodrew's
daughter...

171
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:25,466
Tuka Luna Marceau. From Coan...

172
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,566
[MARI] Mmm...

173
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,733
[YOJI] Mmm‐hmm. Oh‐kay...

174
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,033
[YOJI] Oh! T‐Today. Avalu.
House. We're gonna balu!

175
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,633
[YOJI] So...

176
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:41,033
Everyone! Get ready! Divala!

177
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,900
[KURATA] Uh, yeah... you've
still got time

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,066
to take that language class.

179
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,666
[YOJI] Shut up!

180
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:57,566
[KATO] What kind of beast is
this?

181
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,200
[LELEI] I believe they may be
building houses for us.

182
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,766
[KATO] Uh... I guess that's
fine.

183
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,366
We can finally get some of our
things

184
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,500
off the wagon once they're all
finished.

185
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,566
[KATO] I'm going to get some
sleep...

186
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,300
This old man is exhausted.

187
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,200
[TUKA] Oh?

188
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,333
[LELEI] Is something wrong?

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,300
[TUKA] No...

190
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,433
I just know my father would be
really disappointed

191
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,566
to miss a sight like this so
close to home.

192
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,866
He would love it.

193
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:31,766
I must find a way to tell him.

194
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,766
[SOLDIER] 'Scuse me, Ma'am! It's
not safe here!

195
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,233
[LELEI] Uh... Oh Uh‐huh.

196
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,333
[FURUTA] Hunh?

197
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:54,633
[FURUTA] Uh... Oh... It's
daikon... dai‐kon.

198
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:55,733
[LELEI] Dai‐kon?

199
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,166
[FURUTA] That's right... Daikon.

200
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,500
[LELEI] Daikon.

201
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,733
[YOJI] Now... go ahead and
eat...

202
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,333
[YOJI] Illu, lakua.

203
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,133
[KATO] Oh yes! The bread's
wonderful!

204
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:17,366
And fluffy! Ohoo! Ohoo! Ai‐yah!

205
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:22,033
[LELEI] Daikon. Bread. Okay...

206
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,433
[KATO] Uh... Not hungry, Lelei?

207
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:29,100
[LELEI] Um... the soldiers
here... say this before they
eat.

208
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:33,566
[LELEI] Thanks for the food.

209
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:46,967
[PRESIDENT TAI] This "Special
Region..."

210
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:50,034
[PRESIDENT TAI] Hmm.

211
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:52,667
I wonder why the Gate appeared
in Japan.

212
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,001
[PRESIDENT TAI] A place like
that

213
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:56,034
would benefit more from our
administration.

214
00:11:56,134 --> 00:11:58,301
[FLUNKY] My thoughts exactly,
sir.

215
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:01,301
We cannot let the Japanese have
control of it.

216
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:04,667
Let's watch for now,
maintain diplomatic ties...

217
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,434
but we should be ready to go.

218
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:10,001
I want to be able to commit half
our forces to the Special Region

219
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:11,934
if the opportunity presents
itself.

220
00:12:12,034 --> 00:12:13,501
[POLITICO] We need to know
exactly how many

221
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,634
people died during the battles
in the Special Region!

222
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,934
[POLITICO] It looked like it
included many civilians!

223
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:19,667
[REPORTER] Prime Minister! About
the reports saying

224
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,934
civilians were among the victims
in the Special Region!

225
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,301
[REPORTER] Mister Prime
Minister!

226
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:25,167
The SDF appears to be out of
control!

227
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,501
[MOTOI] The problem they faced
was unique!

228
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:28,534
It was a monster...!

229
00:12:28,634 --> 00:12:29,801
They've had to improvise!

230
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:31,334
There's no rulebook for this!

231
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:33,734
To my knowledge,
we didn't cause any of those
casualties!

232
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:36,867
[REPORTER] Why did the
parliamentary vice‐minister
fail to mention that?

233
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,167
[MOTOI] He was answering
a specific question!

234
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:42,434
He was adressing the issue of
battlefield casualties!

235
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,567
[YOJI] (run efforts)

236
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:48,301
[YOJI] Good!

237
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:48,534
[YOJI] Hah!

238
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:54,934
Ah... This is awesome! (blow
bubbles) Ahhhh...!

239
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,334
[RORY] Oh?

240
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:12,267
[RORY] Aha...! Someone's already
beaten us here.
[TUKA] Um... yeah...

241
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:18,367
[SHINO] Show yourself!

242
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:20,601
(exhale)

243
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:21,901
Now.

244
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:28,867
[LELEI] (exhale)
I wanted to take a look
outside.

245
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:30,301
I borrowed this.

246
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,201
Now... I'm sweaty.

247
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:37,201
[RORY] Ahhh...! Now this...
is... divine.

248
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:40,167
I still can't believe these self
defense force people

249
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,034
set up an authentic bath in
here.

250
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:45,034
[LELEI] I never had... a warm
bath like this.

251
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:46,367
[RORY] Is that right?

252
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,234
[LELEI] I'm from the Lourdo
tribe...

253
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:50,834
we're nomads... we're constantly
moving.

254
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:54,067
[LELEI] So my baths... have
always been cold.

255
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,367
[LELEI] Miss Oracle...

256
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,301
is this new to you?

257
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,301
[RORY] Please dear. Call me
Rory.

258
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:00,667
[LELEI] Oh! You can call me
Lelei.

259
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,101
[RORY] Well, in the temple,

260
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:05,867
there was an absolutely gorgeous
imperial‐style bath.

261
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:07,767
[RORY] But as one of Emroy's
apostles...

262
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:11,067
I've bathed in more rivers and
streams than I care to count.

263
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,401
[RORY] So... I'm enjoying the
fact that

264
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:17,267
I can take a bath in such a way.
It's kind of luxurious.

265
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,634
[LELEI] They're going
to do this every day...

266
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,867
That's what Itami said.

267
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:24,434
[RORY] Itami? Oh...
the lieutenant?

268
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:27,367
[TUKA] Wait...! That's the man
who saved me, right?

269
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,901
[TUKA] Uh, ah...

270
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:31,301
It's just... when I was stuck

271
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,267
at the bottom of the village
well...

272
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,867
I wondered if he was the one
that pulled me out.

273
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,267
[LELEI] Yes... It was Itami's
team...

274
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,601
he was the officer in charge.

275
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:42,367
[TUKA] Itami...

276
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:46,667
[TUKA] Itami...

277
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,267
[BOTH] Hmmm...

278
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:52,234
[RORY] You know.. I think you
may be fully recoivered.

279
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:53,167
[TUKA] Huh?

280
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,367
[LELEI] Losing all your family

281
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,067
and your friends must've been
awful.

282
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:59,534
I'm sure you were in shock from
all that weren't you?

283
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:02,467
[TUKA] I guess... I was.

284
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:06,301
It seems like people have been
taking care of me since that
day.

285
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:08,667
[TUKA] I don't know...
if I deserve to be

286
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,401
in a place like this right now.

287
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,634
[RORY] Sure... why not?

288
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:14,134
You and all the kids here...

289
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:17,201
Anyone out there who has no
family to go back to.

290
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:25,034
[RORY] So Lelei. It seems like
you're picking up

291
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,534
on their language quite easily.

292
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:30,034
[LELEI] There's still a lot of
it I have to learn.

293
00:15:30,134 --> 00:15:33,167
But... I'm starting to get a
grasp of their culture.

294
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,134
[TUKA] Everything seems so
different.

295
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,467
[LELEI] These soldiers...

296
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:39,167
are known as the self‐defense
force of Japan.

297
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:41,234
[LELEI] And here's what's
fascinating...

298
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:44,767
Japan's not the only country
on the other side of the Gate.

299
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,234
[TUKA] There are more...
countries?

300
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:49,334
[RORY] Heh. That sounds
exciting.

301
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:51,967
[LELEI] There's a world we have
yet to discover...

302
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,234
It's even bigger than we
thought.

303
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,334
[PINA] Lord Duran...

304
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,067
[DURAN] Huh?

305
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,901
Hello Princess...

306
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:07,201
what are you doing here?

307
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,167
[PINA] I've been gathering
information on Alnus.

308
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,767
I came... when I heard someone

309
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,267
of noble birth was recuperating
here.

310
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:15,401
[DURAN] Information?

311
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,601
[DURAN] Are you telling me you
don't know

312
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:21,101
what happened at Alnus Hill?

313
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,034
[DURAN] Molto's own daughter...

314
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:25,767
[DURAN] Allow me to enlighten
you!

315
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:29,267
With some of the "information"
you seek!

316
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:32,501
[DURAN] We went through.

317
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:35,667
And on the other side we were
annihilated.

318
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,334
But after that... the Emperor

319
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:40,434
still summoned the armies of his
vassals.

320
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:44,467
[DURAN] Because your father was
afraid to have his throne
usurped!

321
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,067
He had US face them!

322
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,667
[PINA] Wait just a minute!

323
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:52,401
I know the Imperial Army in fact
lost the first battle. But...!

324
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:55,267
[DURAN] Princess... We fought
until the very last soldier

325
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,201
couldn't loose an arrow
anymore...

326
00:16:57,301 --> 00:17:00,467
but... our enemies were not the
creatures of iron.

327
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,701
[PINA] What "creatures?"

328
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:03,334
[DURAN] Listen to me...

329
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:04,867
[DURAN] (grunt) It was the
Empire!

330
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:08,134
Your father knew we had no
chance out there!

331
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:10,034
[PINA] (gasp) My Lord!

332
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:11,467
Please...! At least tell
me this!

333
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,901
What kind of enemy are we
dealing with out there?

334
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,201
[DURAN] You want to know...?

335
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,001
Go to Alnus Hill yourself

336
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:20,434
and see what looms before us!

337
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:26,934
[HAMILTON] Princess.

338
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:29,801
[HAMILTON] So I'm assuming the
Order of The Rose

339
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:32,034
is not charging into Alnus?

340
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,167
[PINA] I'm afraid that would
only make matters worse.

341
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,767
[PINA] However... I'm sure of
this...

342
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:38,534
to find out more we need to go
there.

343
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:41,701
[PINA] Norma... have the rest of
the cavalry move out.

344
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:42,701
[NORMA] Right.

345
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:44,201
[PINA] Grey... what's next?

346
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:46,967
[GREY] Italica. It would be the
largest settlement

347
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,634
between here and Alnus.

348
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,901
[PINA] Italica...

349
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,734
[YOJI] Whoa! I got a connection!

350
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:05,767
I guess they finally got the
antenna working out there,
didn't they?!

351
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,101
So badass!

352
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:09,667
[YOJI] Whoa! I just got a
crapton of updates!

353
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:10,767
[MARI] Lieutenant.

354
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:11,801
[YOJI] Oh, man...!

355
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:12,734
I've gotta save this one!

356
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,201
I can't believe it!

357
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,901
I totally would've missed this
puppy!
[SHINO] Hel‐LO!

358
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:19,367
[YOJI] Y'know what? I better
check this sucker off

359
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,934
before they get taken down.
[MARI] Reporting!

360
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,401
[YOJI] Phew! Now I can log in
every day!

361
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:26,501
[SHINO] Reporting, sir!

362
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:28,667
[YOJI] Hey, Major! Someone here
to see you!

363
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:34,967
[YOJI] Kuribayashi! I'm your
superior officer understand?

364
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,534
[SHINO] Not so sure about that.

365
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:40,934
[MARI] Lieutenant...
there's something going on with
Tuka.

366
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:42,301
[YOJI] Hmm? What's that?

367
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,434
[MARI] She's been asking for two
of everything...

368
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:48,134
meals, lodging, clothes, pretty
much demanding it.

369
00:18:48,234 --> 00:18:50,534
[MARI] And when we only bring
her one of something,

370
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:52,167
she just won't touch it.

371
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:54,534
[MARI] For your information,

372
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,401
she's asking for men's clothes.

373
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:59,467
[YOJI] Did you ask her what's
up?

374
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:02,101
[MARI] Well we tried to get
Lelei to find out...

375
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:04,867
[SHINO] Sir... she doesn't know
Japanese that well...

376
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,467
so it didn't really work out.

377
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:09,134
[MARI] We asked Master Kato if
he could help...

378
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:10,834
but he said she's a very rare
kind of elf

379
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,101
he knows very little about.

380
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:14,901
[MARI] He was as confused as us.

381
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:16,701
[YOJI] Hmm. Well that's weird...

382
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:19,634
Maybe she's got an imaginary
boyfriend.

383
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,401
[BOTH] Huh?

384
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:26,101
[RORY] Tuka.

385
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:27,434
[RORY] What's the matter?

386
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,734
[TUKA] Oh, nothing...

387
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,801
[RORY] Come on. You should enjoy
this.

388
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:35,634
The soldiers said...
everything that's here...

389
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:36,867
is just temporary.

390
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,701
[TUKA] They're making meals for
us...

391
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:40,201
and making baths for us...

392
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:44,467
it's much more lavish than
what I'm used to... I mean...

393
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,967
[RORY] You can talk to me.

394
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:47,134
[TUKA] We're gonna have to

395
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:48,667
fend for ourselves someday...

396
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,834
And my father always took care
of me.

397
00:19:50,934 --> 00:19:55,334
[TUKA] All I can think... is
that I'll have to sell myself...
to one of them.

398
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:58,434
[RORY] What now?

399
00:19:58,534 --> 00:20:01,667
[LELEI] It seems safe enough...
so uh...

400
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,934
[LELEI] There's something I'd
like to show you.

401
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:15,034
[RORY] Goodness... that is a lot
of dead wyverns.

402
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:16,834
[LELEI] What you see is all that
remains...

403
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:19,101
after the battle with the
outsiders.

404
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:20,967
[LELEI] We're free to take all
the scales...

405
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:22,934
the soldiers said they have no
use for them...

406
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:24,601
They're all ours.
[TUKA] Ehhh?!

407
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:27,834
Does he have no idea
what you can get for those?

408
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:30,901
[LELEI] The JSDF has no interest
in them.

409
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:37,234
[LELEI] You don't have to sell
yourself... 'K?

410
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:40,934
[KURATA] So... Now the SDF is a
delivery service?

411
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:43,101
[YOJI] Stop your bellyaching.

412
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,334
It'll give 'em a chance to start
supporting themselves...

413
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:48,734
Plus... We finally get a chance
to take a look at some of the
ways

414
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,934
they do trade and commerce
around here.

415
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:54,501
[YOJI] Whoa! Guess who got
another update... Me!

416
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,034
[KURATA] And... he's gone.

417
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,134
[LELEI] What's wrong?

418
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:07,567
[TUKA] We're... going somewhere
different, right?

419
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,934
[TUKA] I don't know... what to
do... Father.

420
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,067
[LELEI] Just come with us.

421
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:24,634
[LELEI] We trusted them before,
right?

422
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,067
Not even a dragon can harm us.

423
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,901
[LELEI] We'll be fine, okay?

424
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:32,634
[RORY] Come on. We'll look after
you.

425
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:45,467
[YOJI] Let's hit the road!

426
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,801
[YANAGIDA] He's been summoned
as an unsworn witness?

427
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:57,767
[HAZAMA] Yes... The Diet wants
to question them

428
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,134
about the civilian casualties...

429
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,734
so they'd like to talk to the
Officer In Charge

430
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,267
and any civilians who made it
out alive.

431
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:07,534
[HAZAMA] So let's get Itami in
here now. Where is he?

432
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:12,334
[YANAGIDA] Third Recon just took
off, sir... ...for the city of
Italica.

433
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:48,434
[LELEI] Next time on 'GATE': The
Battle of Italica
