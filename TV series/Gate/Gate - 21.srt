1
00:00:01,964 --> 00:00:03,628
Lelei:
Japan's Self Defense Force
was dispatched

2
00:00:03,728 --> 00:00:05,428
to the mysterious
Special Region.

3
00:00:05,528 --> 00:00:07,428
Where their Emperor has
unexpectedly collapsed

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:09,628
and Prince Zorzal
has taken advantage.

5
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:13,028
Running from the oppression,
Casel and Sherry seek refuge.

6
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:16,261
Japanese diplomat Sugawara
accepts them for protection.

7
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:19,494
Outside the gates, Zorzal's Army
and the Order of the Rose,

8
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:21,594
are poised for
a fierce battle.

9
00:00:21,694 --> 00:00:22,594
Kill them all!

10
00:00:22,694 --> 00:00:23,561
Attack!

11
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:25,428
(battle cry)

12
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:26,861
Take them down!

13
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,861
Ready! Raise your
spears... now!

14
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:38,461
(death screams)

15
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:39,994
No! Don't
back down!

16
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:41,828
You cannot escape!

17
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:47,894
Surrender! ,/
You must realize by now
that you are outmatched!

18
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:50,728
(growling, panting)

19
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:53,528
Sweeper:
(battle cry)

20
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:56,061
(panting, battle cry)

21
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:30,828
Uhhh. Morita, sir.

22
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:32,594
What are you
so upset about?

23
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,861
The citizens of the Empire are
currently fighting one another.

24
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:38,261
They're at Jade Palace,
with the Vice‐Minister.

25
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:42,794
We need your permission
to rescue our people
immediately from the area.

26
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:43,461
Can't do it.

27
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:44,994
Uh... and why not?

28
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,361
It's not the right time.

29
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:49,061
The delegates from
overseas would not let up.

30
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:52,128
We were forced to invite them
to see the Region.

31
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:54,461
And now the media is hungry.

32
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:57,461
Chomping at the bit
to publicize any missteps.

33
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,161
It's a disaster over there!

34
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:04,461
Shirayuri and her people
are in danger

35
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:05,961
and will to be evacuated
immediately from the premises. ,/
It is not safe.

36
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:09,561
Oh, they'll be fine.

37
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:10,028
Ah!

38
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:12,494
Morita:
It's not like they are
completely defenseless.

39
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:16,094
This 'Order of the Rose' will
do their best to protect them.

40
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:20,161
You honestly believe that?

41
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:20,828
Kano:
Huh... Morita? ,/
(sighs)

42
00:03:20,928 --> 00:03:24,161
Look, how I personally
feel about it is irrelevant.

43
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:24,328
(grunts)

44
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:28,161
Besides... the plan
that you are proposing ‐

45
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:32,528
would involve our troops
occupying the Imperial Palace.

46
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,494
Even if it is only temporary...

47
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:37,128
our people would immediately
be on us to finish it.

48
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:40,694
To occupy the Special Region
and end the war.

49
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,028
And we can't do that.

50
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:44,294
We don't have the intel
to take over the entire Empire.

51
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,961
Then we should come out and
explain that to our citizens.

52
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:50,194
This is much bigger than
just pleasing our citizens.

53
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:54,294
With the media presence...
we have whole world watching us.

54
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:56,861
Okay. So what
do you suggest

55
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:59,194
for dealing with this
rather sensitive matter?

56
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:00,761
Morita:
As long as our overseas guests

57
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:05,028
and the media are in the Special
Region, we cannot make a move.

58
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,561
But once they're gone,
you can do whatever you like.

59
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,594
That is a week away, they could
all very well be dead by then.

60
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:12,961
Sorry but they will just
have to hang on a bit longer.

61
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,394
You are disgusting!

62
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,528
If the Order's security
does get breached...

63
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:19,328
Imagine the atrocities that
would befall both our delegates

64
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:21,328
and the people
within Jade Palace.

65
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,894
If something happens to them,
the blame will be on you.

66
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:26,428
Yes, as I expect
it should.

67
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:32,461
Stand down now! Why are you
protecting these criminals?!

68
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:36,228
This building is bound by law
with diplomatic immunity.

69
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:37,594
I don't care who you are.

70
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,528
Vifita:
Anyone trying to intrude
will be crushed!

71
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:42,594
In the name of the Emperor!

72
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,128
I must witness this.

73
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,294
Uh?

74
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:54,861
I'm sorry, Sugawara... ,/
I hope you don't find my need
to watch this event repulsive. ,/
I knew this was
a possibility

75
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,761
when I chose to
come to the palace.

76
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:57,728
And that's why...

77
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:01,594
that is why I cannot dishonor
them by looking away.

78
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:03,928
They are dying
for my freedom.

79
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,928
Is something
wrong, Sugawara?

80
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:09,361
I just realized
that my actions...

81
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:12,661
have caused a great deal
of strife and bloodshed.

82
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,594
Do you regret
your decision?

83
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:17,394
No. If I hadn't stepped in,

84
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:20,294
I would have regretted it
for the rest of my life.

85
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:22,528
Oh, Sugawara...

86
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:26,594
And I refuse to apologize...
for choosing to save yours.

87
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,761
My decision triggered
this struggle.

88
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,394
I know their sacrifice...
is mine to bear.

89
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:35,028
Casel:
No matter what
you choose,

90
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,794
You still would have
been responsible

91
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:38,828
for the consequences
of those crimes.

92
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:40,328
Marquis Casel!

93
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:42,661
A person who looks away
from a fight

94
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,428
and chooses the
road of disgrace,

95
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:47,461
will only find himself
trapped between the fight

96
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:48,661
and the disgrace.

97
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:50,128
The only option we have‐

98
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:52,061
is to choose the path
we can live with

99
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:54,161
for the betterment
of our conscience.

100
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:58,161
The Empire has requested that I
become Sherry's legal guardian

101
00:05:58,261 --> 00:06:00,661
and to keep her under
my protection and care

102
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:01,994
as if she were my own.

103
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:05,861
In other words, as of today,
I am to be your father.

104
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:07,094
Ah!
Ah!

105
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:07,761
Uh...

106
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:12,961
(sounds of fighting continue)

107
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:14,861
Gah...

108
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:17,161
Fall back! Retreat now!

109
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:42,128
Komurazaki:
(scoffs) Look at
those lazy bastards...

110
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:44,261
just sitting around
doing nothing.

111
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:48,528
That is the true character of
the Japanese Self Defense Force.

112
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:50,561
You see it, don't you?

113
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,961
When our backs our turned...

114
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,828
When the citizens look away,
this is what they do.

115
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:58,561
They don't look like
they're slacking off to me.

116
00:06:58,661 --> 00:06:59,961
Ohhhh, that's right.

117
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:02,694
I almost forgot that you were
rescued by them, weren't you?

118
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:03,428
I was.

119
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:06,294
It feels like such
a long time since then.

120
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:13,094
Okay well... it's understandable
you would give them the
benefit of the doubt.

121
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:16,261
Right now... my job is to be
a liaison for the press corps,

122
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:19,361
so I need to do whatever I can
to stay neutral in all of this.

123
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,228
Noriko:
But, what seems
strange to me..

124
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:23,528
is that the reporters
from Japan...

125
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:27,228
They're the ones most skeptical
of the JSDF activities.

126
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:30,328
Because that is our job
as true journalists.

127
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:34,128
I know the people in
Alnus, seem to accept
and trust their presence,

128
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:37,094
Komurazaki:
But I believe that's because
the area has been staged

129
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:38,494
for the benefit
of the media.

130
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:42,228
I bet other areas might
have different reactions.

131
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:42,961
It's a shame.

132
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:46,128
Because most likely...
we will only get
to see the places

133
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:48,528
the JSDF will
allow us to see.

134
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:51,361
You seem to be harboring some
sort of preconceived notion

135
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,494
that there is some
kind of hidden agenda.

136
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:55,761
That manner of thinking
is anything but neutral.

137
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:59,028
There's no such thing as
a neutral point of view
in journalism.

138
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:00,061
Speak for yourself.

139
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:02,361
If that's the case...
how can you believe anything?

140
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,428
How can the media ever
report the truth?

141
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:07,528
The truth is not
the media's responsibility.

142
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:11,861
We just need the people
to keep tuning in. Grow up.

143
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:14,194
Nanami:
Excuse meeee!

144
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,361
Noriko, Noriko!

145
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,328
Would you mind helping
us out please?

146
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,228
Sure... what's
the matter Nanami?

147
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:21,728
A French news team seems
to have gotten themselves

148
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:23,761
into some sort of trouble
with the locals.

149
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:25,428
Okay, let's go.

150
00:08:26,494 --> 00:08:27,861
(chuckles)

151
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:30,194
I'll just stay here
and take some pictures.

152
00:08:30,294 --> 00:08:31,994
A little photo
expose...

153
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,528
on how the SDF is
spending our tax dollars.

154
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,728
French Officer:
It was my understanding
the negotiations

155
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:39,061
were already in
progress.

156
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:42,294
We have yet to be able to
sign a cease‐fire agreement.

157
00:08:42,394 --> 00:08:45,094
At the moment, the Empire's
leadership is refusing

158
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:46,928
to move forward with
the peace summit.

159
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:48,561
Well if that's
the situation,

160
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,361
then they must accept
an unconditional surrender.

161
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:53,461
The issue here is how
they're going about it.

162
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:53,894
That's right.

163
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:56,961
And according to our sources,
the Empire has begun a series

164
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,094
of aggressive
guerrilla tactics.

165
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:01,628
That is definitely going
to be a problem for us.

166
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:03,761
Is it really a full
600 kilometers

167
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:05,961
to get from here to
the Imperial Capital?

168
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:08,761
Did we not provide you with
a map of the Special Region?

169
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:10,928
It's more like a child's
doodle than a map.

170
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:14,261
I cannot believe that's
the best map you can offer us.

171
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:15,828
Meia:
Well, this is it.

172
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:17,428
Whoa!

173
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,728
U.S. Officer:
Is this of the entire Empire?

174
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:21,128
How much do you want for it?!

175
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,194
Three hundred eighty
thousand please.

176
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:24,661
I'll take it!

177
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:26,361
Oh no you won't!

178
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:27,661
Ahh!

179
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,894
Sold to the lady
from the JSDF!

180
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:31,894
(JSDF soldiers weeping)

181
00:09:31,994 --> 00:09:34,394
I am keeping this protected!

182
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:39,094
Been a while since
we were here in Rondel.

183
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:42,294
Do we honestly need to come back
to this particular city Itami?

184
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:45,161
Well yeah of course we do.
You have your conference.

185
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:47,028
If I were to give up
on my degree,

186
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,928
we can avoid a great
deal of trouble.

187
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:52,961
But there's no guarantee...
that the assassins will
stop looking for you

188
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,394
everywhere else,
you know.

189
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,961
That's right. Even if
we did go back to Alnus,

190
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:58,628
they would still
be coming for you.

191
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:01,428
Exactly.
Lelei, let's go.

192
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:11,128
(snickers)

193
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:13,494
Hotel Porters:
Here she comes.

194
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:30,961
Okay Shandy...

195
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:33,294
whatever you do,
do not open your eyes.

196
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:33,994
O‐kay...

197
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:38,161
Itami:
Because if you do, then you're
gonna be in big trouble.

198
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:39,861
Right. Okay!

199
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,494
(battle cries)

200
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:04,294
Gotcha!

201
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:05,061
It is done!

202
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,094
Not this time fellas.

203
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:12,494
Hotel Porters:
(screaming)
Rory:
(giggling)

204
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:14,128
Shandy:
(screaming)

205
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:14,394
Ah!

206
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:15,161
Ooh!

207
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:15,694
Ugh!

208
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:16,261
Rory:
(giggling)

209
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:22,594
Shandy:
My eyes! My eyes...!
(sobbing)

210
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:27,428
I think we're safe now.

211
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:30,394
No one else seems to be coming
down the corridor, father.

212
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:31,528
It's all clear.

213
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:32,861
How are the perps doin?

214
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,928
Fine. They're still
alive anyway.

215
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,128
Wait, don't I
recognize you guys?

216
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:41,194
They are employees
of the hotel.

217
00:11:41,294 --> 00:11:43,794
(groveling)

218
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:45,594
Talk to me...

219
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:54,028
We were tricked into
doing this I swear it!

220
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:55,494
Then tell us
all about it.

221
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:58,628
We met someone at the bar
who told us about these guys!

222
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,828
They're not really
who they say they are!

223
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,528
That they are really
monstrous murderers,

224
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:05,561
out to take the lives of any
merchants staying at the hotel!

225
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:09,294
And we were told that
they're actually felons
wanted by the police!

226
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,661
You just believed
whatever they told you?

227
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:12,761
We saw the
warrant ourselves,

228
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:16,428
and we were given part
of the gold bounty
placed upon their head!

229
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,694
Oh and just like that...

230
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:19,861
you sneak in their
room and try to kill them?

231
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:25,094
But we didn't
actually do anything!

232
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:25,828
We got caught, everything's
fine, no one died right? ,/
(crying)

233
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:26,861
But you tried.

234
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:29,294
You were stabbing
knives into our beds.

235
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:31,061
We're very sorry

236
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:34,961
Hmm. This sounds like something
the piper would try and pull.

237
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:37,094
Can you tell us
what he looks like?

238
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:39,128
Well sometimes he's
a human male,

239
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:41,661
and other times he's
been an elf woman.

240
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,761
He's even been known
to disguise himself

241
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:45,161
as a dwarf every
now and then.

242
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:49,561
But what's most scary about him,
is that he can somehow get
inside people's heads

243
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:52,228
and turn a regular person
into an assassin.

244
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:54,528
Even the sweetest,
most harmless little child,

245
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:57,094
or an elderly person
who can barely get around.

246
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,961
So the piper doesn't like
to get his hands dirty.

247
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,761
Unless we can get rid of
the piper once and for all,

248
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:05,094
His assassins will never
stop coming for us.

249
00:13:05,194 --> 00:13:07,128
All he has to do
is create more.

250
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:09,528
So they were just
his pathetic pawns

251
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:11,328
to use in his sick
little game.

252
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:12,328
Please! Please...

253
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:15,328
You must forgive me
for what has transpired here!

254
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,261
Your Holiness, and her
wonderful friends!

255
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:20,528
I know what they did
was horrible,

256
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:23,228
But all they wanted to do
was to protect the customers

257
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:25,494
and reputation
of the hotel!

258
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:28,861
I'm sure you've lost
your trust in the Hotel Shokai,

259
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:30,794
But these little guys
are still young,

260
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,628
please allow them to
change their ways!

261
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,828
Oh Harmar!

262
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:35,161
Harmar!

263
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:35,528
Harmar!

264
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,194
Oh, please
forgive them!

265
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:37,928
We forgive them.

266
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:39,994
But you will need
to better educate them

267
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:41,261
of these sorts
of things.

268
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:44,028
This cannot happen in
your establishment again.

269
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:46,728
Ohh! Thank you,
I promise you, it won't!

270
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:48,161
Hotel Porters:
We promise!

271
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,694
Yeah well it's the
least we could do, y'know.

272
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:52,594
I will speak to a
very good friend of mine

273
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:53,661
who runs an inn.

274
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,061
It's just down
the street.

275
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:56,761
You can move your things
over there right away!

276
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:58,528
There's no need
for that, sir.

277
00:13:58,628 --> 00:13:58,928
Harmar:
Huh?

278
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:01,028
Lelei:
Once someone has
been manipulated,

279
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:03,461
they are more careful
the next time.

280
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:05,461
Your hotel is now safe.

281
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,194
Are you serious?

282
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:09,961
We would like to continue
staying here, please.

283
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,994
If that's all right with
everyone else...

284
00:14:12,094 --> 00:14:13,828
Yes! Uh,
certainly!

285
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:17,528
I am humbled to serve her
Holiness and her dear friends.

286
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:19,628
Ugh... hooo...

287
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:22,928
Do you really think it's
a good idea to trust
those little porter guys?

288
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,194
They seem a bit
shady to me.

289
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:26,861
It's not easy to
change a mind

290
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:29,661
that fundamentally
knows murder is wrong.

291
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:30,894
It's a systematic belief.

292
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:35,461
The piper is likely skilled
at finding minds that
are easily changed.

293
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:36,361
Okay then.

294
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:38,061
So he's got a knack
for finding people

295
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,094
who are morally challenged.

296
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:41,761
"Morally challenged"?

297
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:45,828
It means people out there
whose sense of values can
be easily broken or swayed

298
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,228
one way or another.

299
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:49,928
Such a phrase was not
in the dictionary.

300
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:51,928
I'll make it a point
to remember it.

301
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:54,294
You can file it
under "Chunibyo."

302
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,628
People who are able
to get tricked...

303
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,294
will get
targeted again.

304
00:14:58,394 --> 00:14:58,528
Eh?

305
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:01,794
If we stay here, we can
narrow down our enemies.

306
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:03,728
The piper will
want to collect.

307
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:05,228
He will contact
the trolls.

308
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:07,861
For their "morally
challenged" minds.

309
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:08,894
Well done.

310
00:15:08,994 --> 00:15:10,661
Now I see why
you forgave them.

311
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:12,461
We let the little
guys go free...

312
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:15,761
and then we just wait for
the piper to come calling again.

313
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,594
But how... do we
keep our eyes on them?

314
00:15:17,694 --> 00:15:20,128
By now they already know
what all of us look like.

315
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:22,094
Well... not
everyone exactly...

316
00:15:22,194 --> 00:15:24,294
There's someone who's face
has yet to be been seen

317
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:28,128
by the employees, because she
was rolling around on the floor.

318
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,394
Huh?

319
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:31,128
Oh!
Mm?

320
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:34,394
Oooh Why did it have
to be so bright?

321
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:35,628
Oh hey...

322
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:40,928
(crowd chattering)

323
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:43,861
(yawning)

324
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:45,961
What's going on?

325
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,328
Earlier this morning...

326
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,794
One of the bridges was fixed,
allowing a messenger

327
00:15:49,894 --> 00:15:50,994
to arrive on horseback.

328
00:15:51,094 --> 00:15:52,928
Grey:
He told stories of
the flame dragon's head

329
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,761
being hung in the
Imperial capital.

330
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:58,494
The rumors have quickly spread
that you were the ones
that defeated it.

331
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:00,794
Not only that, but I have
heard some stories

332
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,128
about Alnus as well.

333
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,428
My behavior has been
grossly exaggerated.

334
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,761
The whole thing
is very embarrassing.

335
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,461
And I was insane at the time.

336
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:11,261
I can't be held
responsible for my actions.

337
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:14,061
I don't like that the story
says I played a major role

338
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:15,694
in the killing
of the dragon,

339
00:16:15,794 --> 00:16:17,728
when I actually did
next to nothing.

340
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:20,328
The story is getting
rather twisted.

341
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:21,461
How so?

342
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:25,528
According to rumor, Lelei is
the one that gave the dragon
the final blow.

343
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:26,428
Oh...

344
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,561
The people in the Empire are in
desperate need

345
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:31,961
of a strong human hero that
everyone can rally around.

346
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,094
I can see that.

347
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:35,594
On the one hand they want to
give Lelei all the credit.

348
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,828
But on the other hand they
also want to take her out.

349
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:42,428
There something
bothering you? Itami?

350
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:45,328
When you came to Rondel
from the Imperial Capital,

351
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:48,528
you had already heard that we
had killed the flame dragon.

352
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:50,861
But it's only now that
the people in town

353
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:53,594
are getting around
to finding out about us.

354
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:54,628
Grey:
Like I said,

355
00:16:54,728 --> 00:16:58,294
a messenger was able to cross
over the bridge just today.

356
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,361
Is there only one bridge
crossing the river

357
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:02,228
between the Empire
and Rondel?

358
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:04,528
No. There are at least
three others.

359
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:07,728
And if we count small ones,
there are a few more.

360
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:08,661
What about this...

361
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,928
What if someone had them
all destroyed on purpose?

362
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:14,928
Something must have
happened at the Capital.

363
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:16,661
Something that they
don't want to spread

364
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:17,861
throughout the
entire Region.

365
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:20,061
Have you heard anything
from the SDF?

366
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:22,528
No we're still too far out
of the network's range

367
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:24,394
to get a clear
signal through.

368
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:24,961
But I'll try.

369
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,361
I'll do what I can
to contact 'em.

370
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:36,460
Ruflus:
I am pleased to report that
we are spreading the word

371
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,193
across the realm...

372
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:40,660
that you are now leading the
Empire as the Crown Prince.

373
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,227
Good to know Ruflus...

374
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,093
But aren't you neglecting
to tell me about something?

375
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:46,227
Uh... what do you mean?

376
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:49,293
His Highness is wondering
about the quality of your men.

377
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:52,560
He was under the
impression that the people
enforcing the Oprichnina,

378
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,760
were supposed to be elite,
and yet they were
soundly defeated

379
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,027
by a group of
women and old men.

380
00:17:58,127 --> 00:17:59,060
Oh, yes sire!

381
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,860
Uh, uh, for that I'm
afraid I have no excuse!

382
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,627
I have already
dealt with Gimlet,

383
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,160
who was in charge
of the unit.

384
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,227
And I intend to take immediate
action with the new army.

385
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:11,827
I will be waiting
to hear some good news.

386
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:12,893
Sir!

387
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:14,993
The Marquis Casel
is a key player

388
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,593
for those who
support peace.

389
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:20,627
It doesn't sit well with us
that he is still free.

390
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:23,027
Thule:
We're counting on you.

391
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:25,960
What's happening at
Jade Palace is unfortunate.

392
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,027
Princess Pina, what Boses
and Vifita did...

393
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:32,493
it's still within the wishes
of what the Emperor expressed...

394
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:33,727
But, well...

395
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:35,793
The current Senate
wouldn't dare approve it,

396
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:38,893
because they are under
my brother's influence
at the moment.

397
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,827
I recently heard
something troubling...

398
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:43,427
that even the royal guards
at the Imperial Capital

399
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:45,627
were called in
for the Oprichinina.

400
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,460
Then I will be leaving
directly for Jade Palace.

401
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,393
Helm:
Excuse us.

402
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:52,493
Get out of here!
The Princess is bathing!

403
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:54,827
I do apologize for the
interruption, my ladies.

404
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:58,193
But Prince Zorzal has
ordered us to come here.

405
00:18:58,293 --> 00:18:58,760
Princess Pina.

406
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,227
He needs you to come to
his chambers immediately.

407
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:12,227
Vifita:
It's looks like morale
is still pretty high, Boses.

408
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:13,360
That's good to hear...

409
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,593
though I wish I could ask
why you would do such a thing.

410
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:18,460
Do you think we were
in the wrong?

411
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,027
No, Vifita I don't.

412
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:23,327
But our Order is under
Princess Pina's command.

413
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,227
Our actions can
ultimately influence

414
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:27,727
how well she will be treated
by the Crown Prince.

415
00:19:27,827 --> 00:19:28,627
Mmm.

416
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,727
All we can do is
protect the palace.

417
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:33,293
Which is also a fight
for the peace agreement.

418
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:35,193
We will not only
honor diplomacy...

419
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,660
but we will remain the sword
that protects the will

420
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,493
and dignity
of the Empire.

421
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:41,093
Right.

422
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:42,427
Vifita!

423
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:44,927
The enemy has
returned yet again.

424
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,693
No...

425
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,627
Dear God...

426
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,827
It can't be...

427
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:59,627
Vifita:
Our comrades are now our enemy?

428
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:01,760
Boses:
They have 800 soldiers!

429
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,293
No! Almost 1,000!

430
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,027
Zorzal:
Pina.

431
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:11,560
I'm sure that you are well
aware of what's going on

432
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,227
at Jade Palace,
aren't you?

433
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:14,193
Pina:
Yes.

434
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:17,293
I do not want to cause any more
trouble than necessary,

435
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:19,993
but I also cannot allow
the traitors who fled there

436
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,527
to be free to insult
the Empire... can I?

437
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:25,493
I need you tell your
Order of the Rose

438
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:27,760
to stop protecting
the Jade Palace.

439
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,660
Zorzal:
If they do, we won't lay
a finger on the delegates.

440
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,827
We just need them
to temporarily stand aside

441
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,960
until the nation
has been stabilized.

442
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,827
I cannot simply hand you
the Marquis Casel.

443
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:40,227
It was my mission given
to The Order of the Rose

444
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:41,660
to protect Jade Palace.

445
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,460
How can you still be
so unreasonable,

446
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,127
Yet so very
predictable?

447
00:20:46,227 --> 00:20:49,060
This country is already
yours for the taking.

448
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,493
Do whatever you see fit.

449
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:52,860
And I shall do whatever
I like as well.

450
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,527
I'm headed to Jade Palace now.
I bid you farewell!

451
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:57,627
(gasps)

452
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,560
What in the hell is this?

453
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,993
I am sorry, Pina.

454
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,160
It creates far
too many difficulties,
if you're allowed to leave.

455
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,560
I'm afraid you will need
to remain here for a while.

456
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,360
Zorzal:
But don't worry, you'll be back
out and about in no time.

457
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,593
(seething)
(laughing)

458
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:13,693
Like I said...

459
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:16,193
I need you to wait until the
foreign delegates and the media

460
00:21:16,293 --> 00:21:17,427
have returned from Alnus!

461
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,160
We cannot wait
that long.

462
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,827
They are already
under attack at Jade Palace.

463
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:24,893
Everyone who supports
the peace movement is in danger.

464
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,760
And that will land directly
on Kano's head!

465
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,427
I thought I made it clear
that we will not be accepting

466
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:31,460
any requests for asylum.

467
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,627
It is our job to clean up the
mess that any of our people

468
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:35,760
out in the field
have made!

469
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,693
If we stir this thing
up any further...

470
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:39,927
the media will have a
field day butchering us!

471
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:42,127
And we will lose the election!
Is that what you want?!

472
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:45,093
I would rather lose in the
election than regret not doing

473
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:47,593
what we should have done for our
people in the first place!

474
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:48,760
It's our job...

475
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,460
to make the
difficult decisions

476
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,993
that benefit the
good of humanity.

477
00:21:53,093 --> 00:21:54,527
Argh...

478
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:02,960
Alright then fine.
You have permission.

479
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,893
But you... you take full
responsibility for this.

480
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,760
Sir... I will
take it gladly.

481
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,693
(growls)

482
00:22:10,793 --> 00:22:13,527
Kano:
Let's get our people back home!

483
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:48,960
Lelei:
Next time on Gate:
A Princess in Slave Clothes.
