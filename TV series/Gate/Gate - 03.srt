1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:04,266
[LELEI] A Gate connecting to
another world appeared in Japan.

2
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:06,600
After fighting back the army
that came through it,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,800
the Self‐Defense Force was sent
to the other side.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,733
[LELEI] Itami was put in charge
of the 3rd Deep Reconnaissance
and Surveillance Unit.

5
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,333
The group witnesses a flame
dragon attacking a settlement.

6
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:20,766
[LELEI] There, they discover a
girl, the sole survivor of the
attack.

7
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,400
[YOJI] (grunts)

8
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:32,100
[YOJI] Got her!

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,400
[KUWABARA] Easy, you guys!
Steady, steady...

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,033
[YOJI] We found a person! Hurry
up!

11
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:44,333
[ALL] Roger.

12
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:46,200
[YOJI] Eh?

13
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:51,633
I guess not exactly a person.

14
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:27,873
[MARI] Her BPs high
enough to move her!

15
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:30,873
But we gotta get her out of
these wet clothes!

16
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:31,973
[SHINO] Sorry, but this has
gotta go.

17
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:36,007
[KURATA] (happy) An elf!

18
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:38,140
And not just any elf. A blonde
elf too!

19
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,507
[KURATA] Now that's the kinda
thing

20
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:42,073
I was expecting to find out
here!

21
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:43,673
[KURATA] (giggles) We hit the
jackpot this time baby!

22
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:45,907
[YOJI] OK... you're into elves?

23
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:48,040
[MARI] Excuse me, sir.

24
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,273
[YOJI] So, how's she doing?

25
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:51,007
[MARI] Her temp's back down to
normal...

26
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:52,940
She's no longer in critical
condition.

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,973
[YOJI] That's good to hear.

28
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:57,873
[MARI] All right... so how would
you like to proceed?

29
00:02:57,973 --> 00:03:00,040
[YOJI] Let's see...

30
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,173
A dry pair of boots'd be pretty
kick ass right about now!

31
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:04,273
[MARI] What?

32
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:06,973
Never mind. no way we
can leave her here...

33
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:09,507
she ended up losing her entire
village.

34
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:12,107
We'll classify her as a refugee
and take her with us.

35
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:14,073
[MARI] Now why did I get the
feeling you were gonna

36
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:16,907
come up with something like that
Lieutenant?

37
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:18,773
[YOJI] Eheh... pretty humane
of me don'tcha think?

38
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,973
[MARI] Yeah...
wouldn't go that far.
[YOJI] Huh?

39
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:23,707
[MARI] I mean, I was thinking
you might've done it

40
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:24,973
because she was an elf...

41
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:27,507
Knowing what you do in your
spare time...

42
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,207
it'd be pretty rude of me to
point out now wouldn't it sir?

43
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:40,007
[YOJI] That's it.
We should head back to Camp
Alnus.

44
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:43,273
It'll be best to take the road
through Coda Village.

45
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:45,307
[KURATA] You know what,
Lieutenant...

46
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:47,307
[KURATA] I'm thinking we'll
probably run into

47
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:49,940
a dragon again before a
cat‐girl, huh?

48
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,073
[YOJI] Better watch what you
say,.

49
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:54,473
Or else it might come true,
you know.

50
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:57,707
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Dear God!

51
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:00,907
The entire village has been
destroyed?

52
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,140
[YOJI] Malu haluu. Uh, Big bird.

53
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,707
[YOJI] Lahoo. Forest. On fire.

54
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:07,440
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Flame dragon!

55
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,440
[VILLAGER] (slow gasp) No way...

56
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,573
[VILLAGER ] Unbelievable...

57
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:11,707
[YOJI] Mlapalaa, shooting
fire...

58
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:13,573
Pabla maloo burned to death.

59
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:18,273
[YOJI] And one girl. We saved...
Yarimila?

60
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:19,373
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Oh?

61
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:21,573
And she's the only survivor?

62
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:23,007
That is just awful.

63
00:04:23,107 --> 00:04:24,807
[YOJI] Kalahoo. Can you help?

64
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:28,907
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Mm‐mmm...
We can't care for an elf.

65
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,673
And besides, we need to find a
way

66
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,973
to get out of here ourselves.

67
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,940
[YOJI] Onaha... You leave?

68
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,573
[VILLAGE CHIEF] Yes...

69
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,373
Once a Flame dragon gets a taste

70
00:04:38,473 --> 00:04:41,873
of human or elven flesh
it will be back for more.

71
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:45,907
[MELIZA] (grunt) Come on! We
gotta go!

72
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:47,240
[HUSBAND and SON] Got it!

73
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,273
[MELIZA] Right!

74
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,373
[KATO] (grunts and groans)

75
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,373
[KATO] Ahhhhhhhhhh!

76
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:11,340
[LELEI] Um Master we can't load
anything else on the cart.

77
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,907
Lelei...! I need to take my
books with me! Hear me?

78
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:17,340
[KATO] Lelei... we've got to
come up with something.

79
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:19,140
[LELEI] Certainly...

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,873
The books that have spells
and incantations

81
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:22,373
should be given
the highest value.

82
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:25,540
[KATO] That's right! You really
are a genius, aren't you?

83
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,607
[KATO] why is there dragon here
anyway? Most peculiar.

84
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:32,540
50 years sooner than expected!

85
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,240
What am I supposed to do without
any sort of warning?!

86
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,307
[KATO] Most inconsiderate!
[LELEI] Master we really
need to ride.

87
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:40,407
[KATO] Pardon me, how could you
be so lewd?

88
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,840
I'm way too old to be riding a
girl as young as yourself.

89
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,873
(laughs) Now, your sister...
she's another story.

90
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:53,207
[KATO] Boom! Bang! Boom! Yeah!
ACK!!!

91
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:55,240
[KATO] Hey! magic is the world's
most sacred thing!

92
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,573
It shouldn't be used for trivial
matters AGGGGHH!!!!

93
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:03,273
[KATO] Well now...
guess we're gonna have to work
on that sense of humor.

94
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:06,407
[LELEI] If I don't have one it's
because of your teaching.

95
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,273
[KATO] We're not moving...

96
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,873
I don't suppose you overloaded
the cart?

97
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:18,973
[LELEI] You wanted all of your
books, Master...

98
00:06:19,073 --> 00:06:21,707
you should've expected something
like this.

99
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:23,073
[KATO] It's a good thing we're
wizards...

100
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,507
let's just magic it out.

101
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:27,040
[LELEI] "Magic is the world's
most sacred thing ..."

102
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,707
"It should never be used for
trivial matters!"

103
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,307
[LELEI] Your words,
if I remember.

104
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,007
[KATO] Yeah, well...

105
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:35,507
[LELEI] But in this case I
believe we're out of options ...

106
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:45,073
[KATO] I'm... sorry.

107
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:49,873
[LELEI] It's fine. I've gotten
used to it... Master.

108
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:56,807
Huh? What's going on? Why are we
just sitting here?

109
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:58,907
[VILLAGER ] Master Kato...!
Lelei...!

110
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:01,140
The road is being blocked by a
carriage's broken down!

111
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,307
Someone overloaded and snapped
the axle!

112
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:05,573
[KUWABARA] Let's get this column
moving, people.

113
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:07,040
[BOTH] Uh... Huh?

114
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,973
[KUWABARA] Hey, Lieutenant!
Look in that book of yours

115
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:10,540
and tell the Chief we need some
help!

116
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,873
[YOJI] Got it, Old School!

117
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,307
[KATO] never heard a
language like that before.

118
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:16,373
[LELEI] I've never seen clothes
like that before.

119
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:18,407
[KUWABARA] Kurokawa. Check
around for injuries!

120
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:19,607
[MARI] Yes, sergeant major!

121
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,907
[KATO] A woman... who's also a
soldier?

122
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:24,873
I shall go take a look, Master.

123
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:27,473
[KATO] Huh? Wait a minute!
Lelei!

124
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
(horse in distress)

125
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,307
[LELEI] Life‐threatening
injuries...

126
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:49,840
[MARI] It looks like she might
have a concussion...

127
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,107
looks like her ribs might be
broken, too.

128
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,740
[FURUTA] Please! It's not safe
here!

129
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,407
[LELEI] You're a healer? Uh!

130
00:07:57,507 --> 00:07:59,973
(panicked horse)

131
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:23,373
[MARI] Hey! Are you okay?

132
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,973
[LELEI] These people...

133
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,040
[LELEI] ...these people just
saved my life.

134
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:32,607
[KURATA] Lieutenant...

135
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:34,040
[KURATA] How long do you think

136
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,873
we're supposed take care of all
these folks anyway?

137
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:38,707
[YOJI] What's that?

138
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:40,040
[KURATA] Don't they have some
kind of

139
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,040
noble lords or whatever to look
after them?

140
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,607
[YOJI] Well, I asked about it.
[KURATA] Uh?

141
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,273
[YOJI] I bounced it off the
chief when we were talking.

142
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:49,507
The lord over this area took his
army with him

143
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:52,040
and they ended up part of the
body count at Alnus Hill.

144
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,807
[YOJI] We wiped all of them out,
Kurata. All of them.

145
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:06,373
[BANDIT] I heard everyone in
Coda is bailing out tonight.

146
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:08,507
[BANDIT BOSS] Sounds like easy
pickins for like us.

147
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,707
[BANDIT] It's not like we got a
lot of guys, man!

148
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,640
[BANDIT BOSS] Well check this
out.

149
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,607
a buncha defeated soldiers
camping out...

150
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:16,940
they'll jump at the chance to
join us.

151
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,740
[BANDIT BOSS] We offer those
guys a little something,

152
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,107
we can make an army of our own

153
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:22,073
and take down an entire city!

154
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:25,007
[BANDIT] And force a lord out of
the area!

155
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,040
[BOSS] Eheh! From leading a
bunch of troublemakers,

156
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,973
to having my own city...

157
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:33,040
I like it.

158
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,140
[RORY] (giggle) [RORY] Good
evening, gentlemen!

159
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:51,173
[RORY] I'm so glad you could all
get together like this.

160
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:56,940
[RORY] And... I am very thankful

161
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,073
for you offering your lives to
charity...

162
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,773
[RORY] The Supreme God... loves
the way

163
00:10:03,873 --> 00:10:06,807
you naughty boys have behaved
yourselves.

164
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:11,373
[RORY] You should be honored
he's asked you to join him... in
the afterlife!

165
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:17,040
[RORY] (giggles)

166
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,173
[RORY] You may call me Rory
Mercury.

167
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:24,040
[RORY] I am an apostle...
of the Dark God Emroy.

168
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:31,373
[BANDIT] Holy shit it's really
her! It's Rory the Reaper!

169
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:33,073
[BANDIT] The gown!

170
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:36,773
The Temple of Emroy's
Oracle Robe!

171
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:38,207
[BANDIT] Get outta here!

172
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:40,307
[RORY] No you don't...

173
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:25,674
[MARI] One‐twenty over eighty.

174
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:27,841
She'll be up and around pretty
soon, sir.

175
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:32,408
[YOJI] That's good... but... not
sure she wants to.

176
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:35,441
[KURATA] So, have any of 'em
said where they're going?

177
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,041
[YOJI] Hmm?

178
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:38,974
Nope. Not really.

179
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,008
[KURATA] Huh? You're kidding
right?

180
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:44,341
[YOJI] (sigh) Leading an
evacuation effort,

181
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:46,308
is a lot more tiring than I
thought it'd be.

182
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:50,841
[KATO] Ahhh... I really need a
drink of water...

183
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,574
[LELEI] We won't be able to stop
for a while.

184
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:59,708
[KUWABARA] Comer on. Move it!
Get your backs into it!

185
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:01,141
[KUWABARA] Move it!

186
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:07,108
[YOJI] So here's the thing...
If they have to pick a spot

187
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,941
it's gonna be in a place
where the dragon can't get them.

188
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,941
It's the same for any refugee
no matter where you live.

189
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,974
Except for the whole dragon
part.

190
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:19,408
[TOMITA] It's not gonna work,
sir. The axle snapped.

191
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:23,874
[VILLAGE CHIEF] If we
stay we're only sentencing
ourselves to die.

192
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:34,441
Only carry what is necessary.
Leave the rest.

193
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,708
[VILLAGER] Uh... Fine. I get it.

194
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:40,074
[SON] (crying)

195
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:43,241
[MARI] So why did you make them
burn it, Lieutenant?

196
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:45,474
[YOJI] Because they were just
sitting in front of their stuff

197
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:46,608
and wouldn't leave it behind.

198
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,108
I suppose you have a better
idea?

199
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,208
[MARI] We could have put in a
call for more vehicles.

200
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:52,741
[YOJI] Take a peek at your map
and

201
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:54,774
you'll see we're behind enemy
lines already.

202
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,674
[YOJI] I mean they might let a
few vehicles get by,

203
00:12:56,774 --> 00:13:01,074
but if we bring too many in, it
could get real ugly real fast.

204
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:03,141
[YOJI] They shoot at us, we call
in a strike,

205
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,741
they die, more take their place,

206
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:06,674
then it's an air strike, and
we've pretty much

207
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:07,974
failed the mission we were given

208
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:09,741
to establish peaceful relations

209
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:11,374
We'd end up escalating the
conflict

210
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:12,874
trying to help them out.

211
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:16,341
So we won't be able to get more
vehicles... understand?

212
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,808
[MARI] Guess the major told you
that in advance.

213
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:23,608
[YOJI] We have to help them
out as best we can...

214
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,674
cause nobody's gonna help us,
got it?

215
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:28,041
[MARI] Oh? Huh?

216
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,974
[KURATA] What's that?

217
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:32,574
[KURATA] I see something...
up the road.

218
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:37,574
[YOJI] Crows?

219
00:13:42,574 --> 00:13:44,041
[YOJI] No... way...

220
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:47,741
[YOJI] Goth lolita girl!

221
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:49,008
[KURATA] What'd you say?

222
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:52,341
[RORY] (giggle)

223
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:57,841
[RORY] (giggle)

224
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:01,174
from where do you fine ladies
and gentlemen hail...

225
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,941
and what's that that strange
contraption?

226
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,808
[YOJI] She looks like trouble.

227
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,108
[KURATA] Yeah...

228
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,774
[MARI] The maids around here
sure are young.

229
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:11,308
[BOY] She's an oracle!

230
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:12,774
[BOY] Oracle!

231
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:14,141
[BOY] Hey, Oracle!

232
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:15,574
[YOJI] Oracle?

233
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:18,741
[RORY] And where are you kids
from?
[BOY] Coda Village, Ma'am.

234
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,074
[OLD LADY] We're running away
from our village.
It was attacked.

235
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:24,541
A flame dragon appeared...
so we evacuated.

236
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:26,974
It almost looks like they're
praying to her doesn't it?

237
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,141
[YOJI] Do you think maybe that
fancy outfit of hers

238
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,308
has a special meaning or
something?

239
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:35,074
[RORY] Oh...?

240
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,574
[RORY] So who are these
strangers you're with?

241
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:39,808
[BOY] They came and helped us
out!

242
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:41,441
They're the good guys!

243
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,308
[RORY] And you're sure
they're not taking you
against your will?

244
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:45,374
[BOY] Mm‐mm!

245
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:47,974
So how is this moving
without any horses?

246
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:50,074
[BOY] I... don't know. But one
thing for certain

247
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:52,174
it's a lot more comfortable than
a carriage!

248
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:56,541
[RORY] Really? More comfortable
than a carriage?

249
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,974
[RORY] Well I would just love
for you to show me...

250
00:15:02,074 --> 00:15:04,608
how "comfortable" the ride is.

251
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,541
[YOJI] Uh... Za...

252
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:09,374
Zavalu. Halu uguluu? Hehe...

253
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,941
[RORY] (giggle)

254
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:21,441
(discomfort)

255
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,141
[YOJI] Hey! Hang on a second...!

256
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:26,308
[YOJI] That is not where you
sit!

257
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:28,274
[YOJI] Please just move!

258
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:29,941
[KURATA] How is this happening
to you right now?!

259
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,841
[YOJI] I just need you to get
off, okay!

260
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:33,141
[RORY] Oh! really?

261
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,874
[YOJI] Don't touch my gun!
That's dangerous!

262
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:36,641
[RORY] Ehhh?
[YOJI] Keep your hands off!

263
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:37,708
[KURATA]You're the luckiest guy
ever!

264
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:38,874
[YOJI] I'm not enjoying this!

265
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,641
[RORY] Oop‐sie!

266
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:41,774
[KURATA] I'm dyin' over here!

267
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,574
[YOJI] Hey! That thing is
loaded!

268
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:45,241
I mean it! Get off of
me!

269
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:50,341
[VILLAGER] Oh, look it's Roche
Hill.

270
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:53,141
[VILLAGER] I can't believe we
walked so far!

271
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:55,141
[KURATA] The terrain's starting
to look a little different.

272
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:57,374
[YOJI] Yeah... we really put
some distance

273
00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:59,074
between us and the village.

274
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:03,041
I really hope we get this whole
evacuation over with.

275
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:05,208
[KURATA] A‐men to that, sir.

276
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,508
[YOJI] It sure gets a lot hotter
out here

277
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,408
than it does in Japan, you know?

278
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:37,674
[YOJI] Wha‐?!

279
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:38,808
Contact!

280
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:02,341
[KATO] An honest to goodness
flame dragon!

281
00:17:02,441 --> 00:17:05,208
[KATO] I've never actually seen
one! Wahhahhhh!

282
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:18,074
[KUWABARA] I know it's the
tradition of the self defense
force to fight for the people,

283
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:20,174
but we might wanna run!

284
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,908
[YOJI] I need a diversion,
Katsumoto! 50 CAL!

285
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,008
[YOJI] Don't let up! Keep on
shooting!

286
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:33,541
It's gotta have a weakness
somewhere!!

287
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:37,541
[YOJI] Watch out, guys!

288
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:46,108
[KURATA] That thing could fry us
all in a second!

289
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,074
[YOJI] 50 cal isn't making a
dent!

290
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,874
[YOJI] Shit! Come on!

291
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:06,308
[TUKA] ONO!
[YOJI] Huh?! Well look who's up!

292
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:08,541
[TUKA] O‐NO!

293
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:10,508
[TUKA] O‐NO!

294
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:11,574
[YOJI] What?

295
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,174
[YOJI] The eyes! Aim for the
eyes!

296
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,808
[DRAGON] (growl)

297
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:32,508
(roars in pain)

298
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,808
[YOJI] He didn't like that. RPG!

299
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:45,308
[KATSUMOTO] Oops... better check
my rear.

300
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:46,574
[ALL] Just shoot it!

301
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:52,908
[YOJI] You pulled it!

302
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,441
[YOJI] It's not gonna hit!

303
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:19,474
(roar of rage and pain)

304
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,274
[KURATA] That... was kind of
awesome.

305
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:46,074
[YOJI] Well, glad you had fun.

306
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:09,474
[VILLAGERS] (lamenting, crying,
moaning)

307
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,408
[GIRL] (sobbing)

308
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:30,247
[KUWABARA] Most of the survivors

309
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:32,247
have relatives they can stay
with nearby.

310
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:35,614
[KUWABARA] And a few others
have arrangements for shelter
and lodging.

311
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:38,981
[YOJI] What about the rest?
Are they sure they're gonna be
able to find something...?

312
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:40,881
If they're on their own out
there?

313
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:42,147
[KUWABARA] I hope so,

314
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:44,181
but we've got a bigger issue to
deal with.

315
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:46,181
[YOJI] A lot of kids and older
folks...

316
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:49,147
lost their family... in the last
attack.

317
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,047
[VILLAGE CHIEF] It might seem
heartless,

318
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:53,947
but we have our hands full
trying to find another place to
live.

319
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:56,147
We simply can't stretch
ourselves any thinner

320
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:57,514
adding someone else.

321
00:20:57,614 --> 00:21:00,314
[YOJI] You're leaving... Without
them?

322
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:02,814
[VILLAGE CHIEF] We thank you.

323
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:05,114
You'll always have... our utmost
gratitude.

324
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:12,681
[SHINO] Take care of yourselves!

325
00:21:13,447 --> 00:21:14,947
[VILLAGERS] Thank you!

326
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:18,014
You were a big help! Be well!

327
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:31,547
[MARI] All right. So what are we
gonna do with the rest of them?

328
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:32,681
[YOJI] Well...

329
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:40,781
[YOJI] Refugees, right?

330
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:44,114
[YOJI] Don't you worry... it'll
be fine!

331
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:52,614
[MARI] (half‐laugh)

332
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:55,214
[YOJI] Eh? Huh?
What're you smiling at?

333
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,247
[MARI] Nothing.

334
00:21:57,347 --> 00:22:00,014
Just had a feeling you'd
say something like that.

335
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:04,414
See? You do think I'm humane!

336
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:08,547
[YOJI] Let's mount up, people!

337
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:11,181
[YOJI] We're heading Alnus Hill!

338
00:23:45,714 --> 00:23:47,581
[LELEI] Next time on "GATE:"

339
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:50,147
To the Land of the Unknown.
