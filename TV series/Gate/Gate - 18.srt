1
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:03,066
[LELEI] Japan's Self Defense
Force

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,766
was dispatched to
the mysterious Special Region.

3
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:07,466
[LELEI] After arriving in the
secret village of the dark
elves,

4
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:12,433
[LELEI] Itami and his friends
team up with Yao and her people
to fight the vicious flame
dragon.

5
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:15,433
[LELEI] Many were killed, but
they were able to defeat the
dragon.

6
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:20,933
[LELEI] Tuka who was traumatized
by the death of her father was
saved from her own insanity.

7
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:24,533
[HIGAKI] Chief of Special Region
Dispatch 3rd Deep Recon
Surveillance Unit,

8
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:28,766
[HIGAKI] First Lieutenant Yoji
Itami, You are suspended for two
weeks.

9
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,200
Relieved from your rank,

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,033
[HIGAKI] and confined to
Special Region Headquarters.

11
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,000
[ITAMI] Yeah... I figured as
much.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,133
[HIGAKI] You're a disgrace.

13
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:37,300
You abandoned your subordinates

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,233
and acted solely on
your own accord.

15
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,633
[ITAMI] I was prepared for the
consequences.

16
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:42,733
<react>

17
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:44,866
<surprise gasp>

18
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:45,600
[HIGAKI] Sir?

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,600
<gulp>

20
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,766
<react>

21
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,500
[HAZAMA] Now to receive your
honors!

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,633
What?

23
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:57,933
[HIGAKI] Did you say honors?!

24
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,733
[HAZAMA] Commendations are
bestowed upon you

25
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:00,833
by the Minister of Defense,

26
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,733
For saving the
Japanese hostages!

27
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,233
Also, from the King of Elbe,
you have been given a letter of
appreciation...

28
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,000
And granted a
title of nobility.

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,133
You also received another letter
of appreciation...

30
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:14,500
[HAZAMA] from the tribal leader
of the Dark Elves making you an
honorary tribe member.

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,566
[HAZAMA] You've earned some sort
of ownership of a girl named
Yao.

32
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,333
I hope I can trust you will not
abuse this.

33
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:23,066
[HAZAMA] But now for the true
topic at hand.

34
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,333
[HAZAMA] First Lieutenant
Yoji Itami,

35
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:29,000
[HAZAMA] You are to be in charge
of all research projects
concerning resources in the
Special Region.

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,800
[ITAMI] Research projects for
resources?

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,766
[HAZAMA] You are hereby
permitted to walk freely
throughout the Region

38
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:35,000
searching for usable assets.

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,100
You can hire the 'team'
you've assemble

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,466
as your regional guides.

41
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:39,966
<react>

42
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,400
[HAZAMA] Once your suspension is
over,

43
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,266
you are to report
immediately to said mission.

44
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:45,400
[ITAMI] Yes, sir! Thank you,
sir!

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,700
[ITAMI] I was actually hoping to
relax a little bit.

46
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,800
[ITAMI] So how's it going over
there, uh?

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,866
[LELEI] I'm trying to
focus...Don't speak to me right
now.

48
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:34,266
[ITAMI] You look like you might
be getting the hang of it.

49
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,533
[LELEI] Maybe a little.

50
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,233
[ITAMI] I think you have a knack
for this.

51
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,566
Especially compared to the rest
of the girls.

52
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,333
[RORY] Um excuse me?!

53
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:44,433
[ITAMI] Ha! Now... you just keep
going straight till we get to
Rondel.

54
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,533
[LELEI] Understood.

55
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:51,566
[ITAMI] The city of magic, huh.

56
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,866
It'd be real nice if we could
get there by noon.

57
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:57,400
[LELEI] The streets to Rondel
are narrow and can be congested
with travelers.

58
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,766
[LELEI] It's safe to assume that
it will take some time.

59
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:03,500
[RORY] By the way... how long
would it take to get to Bernago?

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,633
[ITAMI] Isn't Bernago the place
where uh...

61
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:09,066
[RORY] That's right. It's where
Hardy's temple is located.

62
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,200
[RORY] I'm wanting to tell her ‐
to her face

63
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,100
she will never in a million
years have me as her own.

64
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,066
[YAO] If possible..I'd like to
go too.

65
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:19,933
[ITAMI] Maybe, we could go in
between Lelei's presentations
for the conference.

66
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,433
[LELEI] That wouldn't be a
problem for me.

67
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,733
[ITAMI] Tuka, is there anywhere
you want to go?

68
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:24,966
[TUKA] Are you kidding?..

69
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:26,633
You just took me somewhere
horrible

70
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,766
that I never wanted to go to in
the first place, remember?

71
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:31,233
[TUKA] Remember, father?

72
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,866
[ITAMI] Yeah sorry about that.

73
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:34,000
<laughing>

74
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,566
[TUKA] No need to apologize.

75
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,700
[TUKA] I appreciate what you did
for me.

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,000
[ITAMI] You're quite welcome
Tuka.

77
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:47,100
[ITAMI] Hey we totally defeated
the flame dragon, ...didn't we
guys?

78
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,766
<crowd chattering>

79
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:57,100
[LELEI] Rondel has a longer
history than the Empire.

80
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,200
[LELEI] The city's origin is the
school that was constructed by
the gods of learning,

81
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,433
Elran and Lah, Back when they
were still demigods.

82
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:07,366
[ITAMI] Wow. You can feel the
history of this place. And
man...

83
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:09,600
[ITAMI] Most of the people look
like they're just kids.

84
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,300
Guess that makes sense given
that there are so many students.

85
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,133
[LELEI] One of the Rondel's most
distinctive traits...

86
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,733
...is everyone's irrational
attitude towards life.

87
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:22,100
[LELEI] We should be able to
find a hotel around here.

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,166
[ITAMI] Oh! I could use a nap!
Let's go!

89
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,566
[HOSTLER] It's an honor to
welcome friends of her
Holiness...

90
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,033
Do make yourselves at home.

91
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:37,966
[HARMAR] Welcome Apostle, and
all who are in service to the
God of Emroy.

92
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:41,100
Tis an honor beyond our highest
expectations.

93
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,633
Welcome each of you to Hotel
Shokai.

94
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,400
[ITAMI] When did we...

95
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,833
become an entourage to her great
Holiness?

96
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,366
[LELEI] Keep it quiet.

97
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:52,200
The higher our status, the
better we will be treated here.

98
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,533
[ITAMI] I guess old po‐dunk
towns are all the same,

99
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,100
no matter what dimension.

100
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,233
[HARMAR] Welcome to the city of
Rondel.

101
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,366
We've prepared the very best
accommodations for you.

102
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:06,000
[HARMAR] Our staff here will be
in charge of showing you to your
rooms...

103
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,566
as well as taking care of your
every need.

104
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,800
[HARMAR] Please rest assured

105
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,633
you will be in excellent hands
with them.

106
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:13,300
They're the best we have.

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,433
[ITAMI] Ah... well that's great.

108
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,066
[HARMAR] Are you here to
accompany

109
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,300
this young lady on her magical
appointments?

110
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,133
[HARMAR] We'll see to it that
it's as pleasant as possible.

111
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:25,000
Now please make yourself
comfortable.

112
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,966
It is Room #2 at the south end
of the third floor.

113
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,000
[ITAMI] Excuse me.

114
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,000
[HARMAR] Hm?

115
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
[ITAMI] What about my room?

116
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,666
[HARMAR] Oh, yes Manservant.

117
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:36,166
Your quarters are right across
from hers. Room #3

118
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:38,366
[HARMAR] It's a tool shed, but
it's convenient for you to

119
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,733
receive orders and run errands.
I thought it useful.

120
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,200
You're welcome.

121
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,566
[ITAMI] Well crap. Oh well so
much for my honorary nobility.

122
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,533
[ITAMI] May I come in?

123
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:53,166
[RORY] Of course.

124
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,466
[ITAMI] Wow...now that's a fancy
outfit.

125
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:58,433
<react>

126
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,233
[TUKA] You look like a great
scholar!

127
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,033
[YAO] Is it customary in this
city to wear things like this?

128
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,200
[RORY] Only custom for certain
people.

129
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,633
Anyone trying to become a master
mage will wear this in Rondel.

130
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,266
[ITAMI] Master, you say? Is it
like a college professor?

131
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:16,133
[LELEI] Yes in your system...
that would be very similar.

132
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,200
[LELEI] Do you think... this
fits me?

133
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,800
[ITAMI] Yeah.. suits you very
well. You look great.

134
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,533
<blushing>

135
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,700
[LELEI] If my presentations at
the conference are not accepted,

136
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,700
then those in attendance... will
throw ink all over my robes.

137
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,466
[LELEI] And from then on, I
won't be allowed to take it off
while in the city,

138
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:38,300
[LELEI] Nor will I become a
master.

139
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,600
[ITAMI] You study very hard and
excel at everything you do.

140
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,900
[ITAMI] You'll be just fine!

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,333
<react>

142
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,166
<react>

143
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,166
[HARMAR] Goodness.
Your garments!

144
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:51,533
[HARMAR] Are you telling me this
young lady is going for the
title of master?

145
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:55,800
<Laughing>
[ITAMI] Oh and I'm not a
manservant either!

146
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,633
Could you please remember that?

147
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:02,000
[LELEI] That's the hall where
the conference presentations are
to be held.

148
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,700
[LELEI] The city council hall is
over there.

149
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,166
[LELEI] And over here is the
District of Research and
Development.

150
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,200
[ITAMI] I assume this must
be where the great teachers are.

151
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,800
[LELEI] They stay secluded.

152
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,433
[ITAMI] Huh? Secluded?

153
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,333
[LELEI] Yes

154
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:15,633
[explosion]

155
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,566
[RESEARCHER A] No!!! That was
all of my research!

156
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,600
[RESEARCHER B] Someone! Please
make it stop!

157
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,533
[RESEARCHER C] Augh! It's the
papers I wrote my new formula
on!

158
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,100
I've been working on that for
months!

159
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,566
[RESEARCHER A] Oh my god
not again! Not again!

160
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,033
[RESEARCHER B] Everything is
soaking wet! What have you
done?!

161
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,300
[RESEARCHER C] Unbelievable! No
no noooo!

162
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,100
[LELEI] As I said.. they stay
secluded.

163
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,066
[ITAMI] Oh. I gotcha.

164
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,166
[MIMOZA] Yes?

165
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:40,766
[LELEI] It's Lelei.

166
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,333
[MIMOZA] Aah! Ahhhhh!!!

167
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,900
[LELEI] It's been a long time.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,033
[MIMOZA] Oooh! Oh dear! Oh my!
Oh my! Oh dear!

169
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:50,766
[MIMOZA] Is it really you...?

170
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,066
Lily!

171
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,233
[LELEI] Um It's... Lelei.

172
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,933
[MIMOZA] Is that right...

173
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,200
Well, I think Lily is a little
bit cuter.

174
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,500
[MIMOZA] We'll just change it to
Lily starting today.

175
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,766
[LELEI] No, thank you.

176
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:04,633
Wellll, well now please do come
in, all of you please!

177
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,800
[MIMOZA] Welcome everyone!

178
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
<react>

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,933
[TUKA] Uh. She's very cheerful.

180
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,600
[ITAMI] That's putting it
mildly.

181
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,766
[MIMOZA] Here. Let's look at
this, I see, I see...

182
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:16,300
Oh! that's what happened?

183
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,500
[MIMOZA] Ah this is great, Lily!
[LELEI] My name is Lelei.

184
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,833
[MIMOZA] And here I thought
you were way too young

185
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,333
to try and achieve a master's
title,

186
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,900
[MIMOZA] but as far as I can
tell from Kato's letter,

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,166
your achievements are
outstanding.

188
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,133
[LELEI] You heard from Kato?
[MIMOZA] Yes!

189
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,900
[LELEI] May I ask,
where is Arpeggio?

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,033
[MIMOZA] She just left to go
shopping.

191
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:36,033
Oh! By the way, Lily...

192
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,866
Would you mind helping me?

193
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,766
We need some chairs for all the
guests.

194
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:41,566
[LELEI] Um my name is Lelei.

195
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,800
<screaming fall>

196
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,633
[LELEI] Are you okay?

197
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:44,800
[MIMOZA] Oh dear.

198
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,033
I'm so very clumsy.

199
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,900
Oh dear. Just look at me.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,833
[ITAMI] Are you alright?

201
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:49,800
[ARPEGGIO] Mimoza?

202
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,000
[MIMOZA] Yes?

203
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,033
<screaming>

204
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:56,333
[MIMOZA] Oh Arpeggio..
oh my oh dear... I'm so sorry.

205
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:58,866
[ARPEGGIO] What tha!
I told you not to make
a mess of things

206
00:09:58,966 --> 00:09:59,833
while I was gone!

207
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,033
[MIMOZA] Oh dear oh my....

208
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,266
[ARPEGGIO] Ah! Honestly!

209
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:03,400
I will clean all this up,

210
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,000
just get out of the way alright!

211
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,800
[ARPEGGIO] Please, just stay
outside for a while.

212
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,800
[MIMOZA] Listen. While you were
out,

213
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,466
Lily dropped by to see us!
Uh‐huh.

214
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,733
[ARPEGGIO] Lily? Who the heck's
that?

215
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,633
[LELEI] Ugh. It's Lelei.

216
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,166
[ARPEGGIO] Uh. Oh. MMhph.

217
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,766
[ARPEGGIO] Mimoza.

218
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:20,300
Would you please get
us a table

219
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,900
at our regular restaurant.

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,733
[ARPEGGIO] I will be there
shortly.

221
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,966
I have a sister

222
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:26,733
who is about to test
for master mage,

223
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,066
[ARPEGGIO] Meanwhile her older
sister

224
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,600
will still be working towards
her doctorate.

225
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,733
My younger sister is flirting
around with attractive men

226
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,700
while her older sister
still has no experience at all.

227
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,500
My younger sister, who
apparently gallivants with the
rich and famous

228
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
while her older sister struggles
to get by.

229
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,466
And oh yes, a little sister,

230
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,400
who travels with elves and
divine apostles!

231
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,666
She's so greeeat.

232
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:46,266
We certainly have lots and lots
of catching up to do!

233
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:49,900
[ITAMI] Lelei... Is she by any
chance...uh...?

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,300
[LELEI] Yes.

235
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,800
She is my... sister. Arpeggio.

236
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,400
[MIMOZA] Oh dear.

237
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:22,885
[PINA] This is a fine day.

238
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:26,052
I can't believe we finally made
it this far.. Sugawara.

239
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,419
[SUGAWARA] Yes...The peace talks
between the Empire and Japan

240
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,952
are finally set to begin.

241
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:34,152
[PINA] It's good. Once the talks
finally move forward...

242
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:36,152
I think my work will be done.

243
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:39,319
[PINA] I will be able to fully
indulge myself in studying the
arts.

244
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:41,619
[PINA] Oh by the way, Sugawara?
[SUGAWARA] Huh?

245
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:45,252
You seem to have a young admirer
with an interest in you.

246
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:47,319
<nerves>

247
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:47,585
<surprise react>

248
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:51,085
[PINA] Those pearls are
impressive.

249
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:53,019
Looks like you may have won the
heart

250
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,552
of the Tueli's daughter with
such expensive gifts.

251
00:11:55,652 --> 00:11:58,285
[SUGAWARA] Let's take it easy.
Y'see in my country...

252
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,985
it's not proper for an older man
to treat a young girl as we
would a woman.

253
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:04,819
[PINA] Oh that doesn't mean
anything in our world.

254
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,985
You should know that.

255
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:08,952
[PINA] That girl has
a crush on you.

256
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,885
[SHERRY] Sugawara! Sugawara!

257
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:16,119
[SHERRY] The fruit that grow on
that tree over there are really
great!

258
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,619
[SUGAWARA] I'm very sorry...
but I am busy right now Sherry.

259
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:21,219
[SHERRY] Sugawara! Did you see
all the food over there?

260
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:24,785
[SUGAWARA] I'm sorry... but I
have a very important meeting to
attend.

261
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:27,252
[SHERRY] Sugawara! You wanna
take a walk with me?!

262
00:12:27,352 --> 00:12:30,752
[SUGAWARA] Aah... I'm very
sorry... but I need to stay here
right now.

263
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:32,085
[SHERRY] Sugawara!

264
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:32,852
Sugawara!

265
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,052
Sugawara!

266
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:38,452
[SUGAWARA] Listen Sherry. I
can't play with you tonight
okay.

267
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:40,919
My work must come first. Please
understand.

268
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,719
[SHERRY] You really shouldn't be
so unkind to me.

269
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:45,919
Because in just four short
years...

270
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,552
I will become a most suitable
woman for you to marry.

271
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:51,085
[SHERRY] This would be a
wonderful opportunity for you

272
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:54,019
to introduce me to your
country's vice minister.

273
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,352
[SUGAWARA] And why would you
want that?

274
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:56,385
[SHERRY] To say hello!

275
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,319
It's important to
meet important people,

276
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:01,285
especially if they work with my
future husband.

277
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:02,819
[SUGAWARA] Excuse me.

278
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,419
[SHERRY] I'm just messing with
you.

279
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,785
Take a look around.

280
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:08,352
The guests from the Empire...

281
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:11,652
None of them are going anywhere
near the Japanese delegates.

282
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,519
[SHERRY] All they know about
Japan...

283
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:16,919
is it's a mysterious country
with great military power.

284
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:19,785
[SHERRY] They're afraid of you
above anything else.

285
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:20,985
[SUGAWARA] You're right.

286
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:23,119
[SHERRY] That is not
an ideal position

287
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,652
‐ for either you or your country
to be in.

288
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:27,185
We need to improve relations.

289
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:28,652
[SHERRY] How can we talk peace

290
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:30,485
if we can't hold a conversation?

291
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,285
[SHERRY] Please understand...

292
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:35,419
I'm more useful than you might
think I am.

293
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,852
<react>

294
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:39,852
[SUGAWARA] Vice Minister
Shirayuri.

295
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,919
This is the daughter of the
Tuelis.

296
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,485
[SHERRY] It is a pleasure ma'am.

297
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:45,152
[SHIRAYURI] Nice to meet you.

298
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:47,519
I am Vice Minister Shirayuri.

299
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,852
[SHIRAYURI] You're so young.

300
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:50,985
And yet you can speak fluent
Japanese already?

301
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:52,719
[SHIRAYURI] That's very
impressive.

302
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:54,585
Tell me, who taught you to speak
so well?

303
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:56,052
[SHERRY] Sugawara of course!

304
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:58,552
He has been a very kind and
patient teacher

305
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:00,985
helping me learn so many things!

306
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:02,119
[SHERRY] Look he even gave me

307
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:03,619
this beautiful string of pearls.

308
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:04,685
[SHIRAYURI] Oh?

309
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:06,119
<Ahem>

310
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:08,452
[SHIRAYURI] Listen Sugawara...

311
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:09,752
I hope you haven't done anything

312
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:11,819
that might create an
uncomfortable situation.

313
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,319
[SUGAWARA] Please Miss Vice
Minister

314
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,852
give me a little credit
here for god's sake.

315
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:20,652
[SHERRY] Oh I was wondering
about something, Miss Shirayuri.

316
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:24,852
[NOBLEWOMAN] I'm very interested
in women's fashion over there.
Must be fabulous.

317
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:28,219
[SHIRAYURI] Then you must be
extremely disappointed to see
what I'm wearing.

318
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:30,352
[NOBLEWOMAN] Not at all, you
look splendid in that outfit.

319
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,352
<giggle>

320
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:32,985
[SHERRY] So... I think that went
well.

321
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:34,452
[SUGAWARA] You were right.

322
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:37,185
Thanks to you, they are feeling
much safer around us.

323
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:38,752
[SUGAWARA] Thank you very much
Sherry.

324
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:40,752
[SHERRY] Oh. It was nothing.

325
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:42,752
Anything for my future husband.

326
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:44,219
<react>

327
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:48,585
[SUGAWARA] Oh God... what have I
gotten myself into?

328
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:50,952
<annoyed grumble>

329
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:54,219
[THULE] The ceremony will begin
soon, Your Highness.

330
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:55,152
[ZORZAL] Quiet!

331
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,085
[THULE] Apologies, sire.

332
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:00,085
[ZORZAL] Augh! These
ridiculous peace talks

333
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:01,719
were never
supposed to happen.

334
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,719
I did everything I could to
derail this.

335
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,852
[ZORZAL] I even made it look
like that Japanese whore's
assassination

336
00:15:06,952 --> 00:15:07,985
was ordered by my own sister!

337
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:10,852
[THULE] I know sire...
I'm sorry...

338
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,652
[ZORZAL] Don't apologize Thule,
I'm not blaming you.

339
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:15,119
You're just the messenger.

340
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:17,819
It's not your fault the
assassination attempt failed.

341
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,652
[ZORZAL] But there'll be no more
tricks from now on.

342
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,319
We're going to need support
in case something happens...

343
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:24,585
We'll need more numbers to see
this through.

344
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:25,552
[THULE] Yes.

345
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:27,085
[ZORZAL] I'm at a loss.

346
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:30,285
I don't have clue what I could
possibly do anymore anyway.

347
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:33,452
[THULE] But you are the next
rightful heir. Your Highness.

348
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:35,085
[ZORZAL] That's exactly it.

349
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:37,919
I am but a step away from the
throne.

350
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:39,919
It's maddening being so close to
the Emperor

351
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,819
without being able to take it!

352
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,919
Hmph.

353
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:46,319
He is such an idiot.

354
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:49,019
[THULE] As well as so easily
manipulated.

355
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:51,985
<laughing into slurpy grossness>

356
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:55,285
[BOULO] I'm here for you.

357
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,085
What would you like me to do
next?

358
00:15:57,185 --> 00:16:00,252
I have gathered some fresh
elites to join our cause.

359
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:02,019
[THULE] They'll have to wait for
now.

360
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:05,152
They will have their chance soon
enough.

361
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:08,319
There's... something I want you
to prepare for me.

362
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:10,352
[BOULO] Anything.

363
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:15,943
[CHAMBERLAIN] Ladies and
Gentlemen, Presenting:

364
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:20,676
the great Emperor Molto, Prince
Zorzal, and Princess Pina!

365
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,376
[SUGAWARA] The first is The
Emperor Molto,

366
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:34,843
behind him his children Prince
Zorzal and then the Princess.

367
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:38,376
[SHIRAYURI] That's Prince
Zorzal?

368
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:39,243
<react>

369
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:41,910
[PINA] What're you doing?

370
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,276
[ZORZAL] Guys! I'm so glad

371
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:44,710
you all made it back.

372
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,776
Helm, you are safe!

373
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:47,976
[HELM] Yes..Your Highness!

374
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:50,043
[ZORZAL] Kalasta.
I hope you're well.

375
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,710
[KALASTA] Yes thank you my
Prince.

376
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,976
We are all very grateful!

377
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:54,843
[ZORZAL] I'm glad
you made it too, Mudra!

378
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:57,743
[PINA] Zorzal! We're in the
middle of a ceremony!

379
00:16:57,843 --> 00:16:59,543
[MOLTO] Pay it no mind, Pina.

380
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,243
[MOLTO] Allow him to
congratulate

381
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:02,676
those who have returned to us.

382
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:05,510
[MOLTO] We shall continue with
the ceremony, please.

383
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,410
[CHAMBERLAIN] Yes, sir, of
course.

384
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,776
[CHAMBERLAIN] Japan, who has
returned

385
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:11,910
our prisoners of war to us,

386
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,276
Has sent their esteemed
delegates!

387
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:15,910
[MOLTO] Have them come forward.

388
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,276
I would like to greet our
guests.

389
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,243
[CHAMBERLAIN] Representatives
from Japan,

390
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:22,176
please come before the Emperor!

391
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:24,743
[SHIRAYURI] I am honored to meet
you, Your Majesty.

392
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,743
[MOLTO] I appreciate you two
coming all this way.

393
00:17:27,843 --> 00:17:29,643
We are honored to have you here.

394
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:32,310
I welcome you, as the Emperor of
our great land.

395
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,043
[SHIRAYURI] Thank you, your
majesty

396
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:35,976
<react>

397
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:37,343
<seething> [HELM] Your Highness!

398
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:38,776
This is an utter embarrassment!

399
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:41,176
[KALASTA] I know that it was
all for our safe return,

400
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,776
But the Empire is making peace
with these people

401
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:46,510
under inauspicious conditions.

402
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,710
[ZORZAL] That day of my
humiliation was sheer agony...

403
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,243
[ZORZAL] It was the day I chose
not to resist...

404
00:17:53,343 --> 00:17:55,310
[ZORZAL] I chose to appear as
though I was incapable

405
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,376
to avoid being purged...

406
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,676
[ZORZAL] But...THOSE DAYS ARE
OVER!

407
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,543
[SUGAWARA] Is he directing this
anger

408
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:08,676
toward the Emperor?

409
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:10,743
<sigh>

410
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:13,243
[BOSES] Oh you look exhausted,
your Grace. Y'okay?

411
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,543
[PINA] Yes I am.
His Majesty has at last approved

412
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:18,210
the peace negotiations with the
delegates.

413
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,043
[PINA] My dream is finally
coming true.

414
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,510
[PINA] No matter how tiring,

415
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,676
the path toward peace is now
under way.

416
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,476
[SHANDY] I am glad you have
finally found a place

417
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:28,043
where you can feel at ease,
Princess.

418
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:30,443
[PINA] I think I deserve
this moment. Uh‐huh.

419
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:31,676
<food chomp>

420
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:37,876
[MOLTO] So the flame dragon has
been slain.

421
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:39,310
[MARCUS] Yes, your majesty.

422
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,443
We are still at a loss as to who
was responsible.

423
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:44,976
This was merely dropped at the
gates.

424
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:47,010
[MOLTO] We must find this hero..

425
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,810
[MOLTO] Does anyone in
attendance

426
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,543
...know of the warrior who
defeated this great beast?

427
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:53,210
[PINA] Your Majesty!

428
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,443
<running whimpering>

429
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:56,110
[MOLTO] Yes what is it, Pina?

430
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,443
Do you know... something about
this victory?

431
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:01,076
[PINA] She does. She can
tell us who was responsible

432
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:02,976
for the killing
of the flame dragon.

433
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,276
[PINA] Go ahead.

434
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,210
[SHANDY] Sire! A man named
Itami,

435
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,776
and Rory, Lelei, Tuka, and Yao.

436
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:10,843
It was all five of them who put
down the dragon!

437
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:12,210
[MOLTO] Rory the Reaper?

438
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,876
[SHANDY] Yes! It was! It was Rory
Mercury...

439
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:17,010
the divine apostle of the God
Emroy!

440
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,443
<Ohhhh>

441
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,476
[MOLTO] Well that I can believe.

442
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:23,676
[MOLTO] If she was indeed there
helping them...

443
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:26,676
then the besting of the flame
dragon is understandable.

444
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,176
[MOLTO] Although... it does
surprise me

445
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:29,676
that an apostle would involve
herself

446
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:30,810
in something like this.

447
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,810
[MOLTO] But I guess that means

448
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,410
the glory goes to the gods.

449
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,443
[SHANDY] Well. It was Yoji
Itami...

450
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:39,476
who led the team on the attack,
sire.

451
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:40,476
[MOLTO] Itami?

452
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:42,343
[PINA] The same man
who was in charge

453
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:45,143
when Prince Zorzal...
was beaten...

454
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,210
[PINA] By a young girl.

455
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,743
[MOLTO] Oh, yes of course.

456
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:52,410
So you're saying our enemy was
involved in the killing?

457
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,343
[MOLTO] And what about the other
members?

458
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,043
[SHANDY] Tuka is an elf from the
Forest of Lodo.

459
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:58,743
[SHANDY] And Yao is a dark elf

460
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:00,610
who lives in the Schwartz Woods.

461
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,710
[MOLTO] They're of so many
breeds and races.

462
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,410
[SHANDY] Yes. And the last was
Lelei la Lalena,

463
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,076
a disciple of the sage Kato.

464
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:08,976
[SHANDY] From the Coda Village.

465
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:13,010
[MOLTO] Ohhh! A disciple of Old
Master Kato.

466
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,107
[MOLTO] Then I take it she is
human.

467
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:17,362
[SHANDY] Yes. Right.

468
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:18,795
She's a descendant of Lourdos,

469
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,794
[SHANDY] but recently settled in
the Coda Village,

470
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:23,453
so we can rightfully call her a
subject of the Empire!

471
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:27,246
[MOLTO] Oh? S'that so?!

472
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:30,946
Well that is excellent news to
hear! Pina...

473
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:34,213
[MOLTO] I give you the task of
finding this heroine, Lelei.

474
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:37,046
You are to bring her back to the
palace for me, my dear.

475
00:20:37,146 --> 00:20:38,846
[MOLTO] I would like to reward
her.

476
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,780
This is a wonderful thing, is it
not?

477
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,613
[PINA] It is!

478
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:43,546
[MOLTO] Very well then.

479
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:45,680
So it is ordered
to bring her here.

480
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,213
[SUGAWARA] He seems very happy
about it doesn't he?

481
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,713
That one of his own subjects was
involved.

482
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:53,313
[SHIRAYURI] It's the same in any
country I guess.

483
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,946
We would have similar feelings
in Japan as well.

484
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,446
[SUGAWARA] I suppose so.

485
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:01,880
<disgust>
[ZORZAL] What in the hell is
going on here?!

486
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,646
What makes her so damn special?!

487
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:06,280
<angry react>

488
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,046
[ZORZAL] Why is my father
pandering

489
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:10,813
to offer praise to some dirty
commoner?!

490
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:14,113
[ZORZAL] I AM THE CROWN PRINCE!

491
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:15,813
[HELM] Your Highness! You must
set this right!

492
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:19,013
[KALASTA] We cannot sit back and
watch this happen!

493
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:19,713
[HELM] Your Highness!

494
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:20,846
<seething>

495
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:24,580
[PINA] What's wrong with him?

496
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,813
[MOLTO] Everyone!

497
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:28,780
<evil smile>

498
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,580
[MOLTO] To our noble Empire...
and to all its people!

499
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,180
[GUESTS] To the Empire!

500
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:42,580
<gasp>

501
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,346
<gasping, screaming>

502
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,213
[GUESTS] No! Your Majesty!
[PINA] Father!

503
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:55,180
<evil laughter>
[BOULO] An elixir from the
Haryo.

504
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,080
It has a most... satisfying
effect.

505
00:21:58,746 --> 00:21:59,846
<gasp>

506
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:04,946
<smirking>

507
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:06,380
<gasping to evil smirking>

508
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,513
[PINA] Father!

509
00:22:09,613 --> 00:22:12,013
Wake up! Father!

510
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:15,180
[PINA] AAgh!!

511
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,746
[LELEI] Next time on Gate:

512
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:49,513
The Dangerous Sisters
