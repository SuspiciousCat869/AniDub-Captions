1
00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:04,566
[LELEI] A Gate connecting to
another world has appeared in
Japan.

2
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,966
[LELEI] After fighting back the
army that came through it,

3
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:09,800
the Self‐Defense Force was sent
to the other side.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,233
[LELEI] Yoji Itami, one of the
troops involved in the Battle of
Ginza,

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,700
and a helpless otaku, joins the
team.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,900
[LELEI] When they arrived,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,033
thousands of troops were
awaiting them.

8
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,766
[CASEL] My Lord, the Gate
situation is an utter
catastrophe!

9
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:33,400
[CASEL] I am sorry to report,
but over 60% of the Imperial
Army is gone!

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,033
[CASEL] How do you propose we
respond to this situation?
[SENATORS] (harrumphs,
uncertain)

11
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:39,300
[CASEL] How do you intend to
lead the nation

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,800
in the face of such a crisis,
Your Majesty?!

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,300
[MOLTO] Steady, Marquis Casel...

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,233
no doubt things seem untenable
at the moment.

15
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,966
[MOLTO] And yes, it would appear
the military advantage we had

16
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:54,000
has been completely obliterated.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,266
[MOLTO] But I believe what
actually troubles you

18
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:58,300
is whether or not our
subordinate nations

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
could combine their remaining
strength...

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,366
and bring rebellion to the steps
of the capital.

21
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,433
[MOLTO] That's the true threat
is it not?
[CASEL] Huh?

22
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:11,566
[MOLTO] Every time we find
ourselves in a precarious
situation,

23
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:16,233
the Emperor, the Senate, and the
people of the Empire unite,

24
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,300
and thus manage to grow even
stronger from it, My dear
Marquis.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,233
[MOLTO] You cannot win every
single battle in a war.

26
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,900
Therefore, I will not hold
anyone accountable for what
happened in this fight.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,433
[MOLTO] And I'm sure that
neither the Marquis nor the
Senate

28
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:30,100
have time to engage in these
debates...

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,433
[MOLTO] ...rather than trying to
keep the Capital

30
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:35,366
from being surrounded by unknown
enemy forces.

31
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:40,233
[SENATORS] (approving) [CASEL]
He's conveniently forgotten he
started this.

32
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,466
[GODASEN] What is your plan,
Your Majesty?

33
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:44,233
[GODASEN] Two days was all it
took for the army

34
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,366
from the other side to cause
such incredible losses.

35
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:48,433
[GODASEN] On top of that,
they've seized control
of the Gate,

36
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:52,166
and are now establishing
a foothold on our land!

37
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,766
[GODASEN] We tried to take the
gate after they arrived.

38
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,133
it was a complete disaster.

39
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:58,500
[GODASEN] But we couldn't even
get close to them!

40
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,333
[GODASEN] I have never seen such
sorcery!

41
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,166
It's as if they read our minds
and cast fire right at us!

42
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:05,100
[PODAWAN] We must fight!

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,033
[PODAWAN] Our vassals must give
us what we demand!

44
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,300
Rebuild our army using their
soldiers!

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,233
[SENATOR] That will only make
things worse, senator!

46
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,100
[SENATOR] And only repeat
Godasen's mistake!

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,233
[SENATOR] That's right!

48
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,433
We must stand firm!
[GODASEN] Uh?

49
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:25,333
[MOLTO] Sitting here and waiting
for matters to worsen is not the
answer.

50
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:28,700
Therefore... we will fight.

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,200
[MOLTO] Send messengers as far
and wide as their horses will
take them.

52
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,100
[MOLTO] Tell them we need their
assistance in repelling the
invading forces...

53
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,066
and we need them now!

54
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,033
[MOLTO] Make it so!
Have Godu Rino Gwaban

55
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,366
and all of the allied Kingdoms
rally to us!

56
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:45,966
It's time to re‐take Alnus Hill!

57
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,366
[SENATORS] Pledge loyalty to the
Emperor Molto!

58
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:55,033
[CASEL] Your Imperial Majesty...

59
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,400
[CASEL] I fear Alnus will be
another battlefield

60
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,633
littered with the corpses of
men.

61
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,633
[MOLTO] Heh!

62
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,066
[SOLDIER] My Lord!

63
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,633
[SOLDIER] We've spotted what
seems to be

64
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,700
the enemy's scouts at a high
vantage point two hills ahead.

65
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
[DURAN] Let them be for now.

66
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,400
[DURAN] I must hurry to the
gathering of kings!

67
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:59,466
[DURAN] Why isn't the commander
of the Imperial Army coming?

68
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,200
[MESSENGER] We're in the midst
of an offensive

69
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,100
on Alnus Hill, Milord.

70
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,066
It's impossible for the
commander to leave his post.

71
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,766
[KINGS] (concerned)

72
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,666
[DURAN] That doesn't sound
right.

73
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:16,300
[DURAN] My observers only saw
a modest number of enemy troops.

74
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,866
[REIGOUX] Oh, come now...

75
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:21,166
Sir Duran the Imperial Army is
holding down the enemy forces.

76
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,633
[DURAN] Are you sure of that?

77
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,066
[MESSENGER] Sire... we only need
one thing from you...

78
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,166
we need you to strike the enemy
tomorrow morning.

79
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:29,500
[KING OF ARGUNA]
Very well then...!

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
My army shall be the spearhead
of the attack!

81
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,766
[KING OF MOWDWAN] Hold it!

82
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,800
Let my army take
the lead this time!

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,100
[REIGOUX] Now wait a moment!

84
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,933
Let us be at the forefront of
this victory!

85
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,300
[KINGS] (arguing)

86
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:44,366
[MESSENGER] Tomorrow morning.
Alnus Hill. We'll wait for you.

87
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,566
[KING OF ARGUNA] It shall be a
glorious day.

88
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,200
[KING OF MOWDWAN] Perhaps
but my army's all you will need.

89
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,366
[REIGOUX] A shame. This should
be our time to shine.

90
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:57,366
[DURAN] The enemy army
has only ten‐thousand men.

91
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:00,133
We outnumber them thirty to one.

92
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,800
[DURAN] I don't think being
the first into battle

93
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,166
will be very distinguished.

94
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:06,000
[REIGOUX] So where else would
the glory be?

95
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,533
In being the first to sound the
retreat?

96
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,400
[DURAN] In all my years we've
never seen such a foe.

97
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,000
[REIGOUX] (laughs) Even
Lord Duran, the Lion of Elbe,

98
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,500
can't keep the ravages of time
from catching up with him!
(laughs)

99
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,200
[KING OF ARGUNA] For‐ward!

100
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,633
[SOLDIERS] (war cries)

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,466
[DURAN] It is about time we join
them on the battlefield.

102
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,566
[SOLDIER] My Lord!
[DURAN] (surprised)

103
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,200
[SOLDIER] Majesty... the other
kingdoms...

104
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
They've departed to
assault Alnus Hill...

105
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,200
And Lord Reigoux is set to join
them.

106
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,900
[DURAN] And where is the
Imperial Army?

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,133
[SOLDIER] My Lord... no Imperial
troops...

108
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,166
none have been sighted on the
hill.

109
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,533
[DURAN] What was that?!

110
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,766
[REIGOUX] Why don't I see the
Imperial Army?!

111
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:02,500
[SOLDIER] They're not here, Sir.

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,133
[REIGOUX] That can't be.

113
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,366
[artillery whistle]

114
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,700
[KING OF ARGUNA] Uh...?

115
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,233
[REIGOUX] What is this? Ahhhh!

116
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,333
[DURAN] Impossible! Is... the
hill erupting around us?!

117
00:07:55,633 --> 00:08:00,000
[DURAN] Where's Arguna's king?
Where's the King of Mowdwan?

118
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,300
[DURAN] Where the hell is
Reigoux?!

119
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,300
[LORD] We brought over one
hundred thousand of our own
troops,

120
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,266
but half of them are already
gone...

121
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,266
How can this be happening?

122
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,966
[LORD] What is the Imperial Army
doing and why aren't they here?!

123
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:33,400
[LORD] No, even the Imperial
Army is no match for this
opponent.

124
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,533
Falling back might be the only
option left!

125
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:38,433
[DURAN] Retreat is not an option
that's open to us gentlemen.

126
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:39,866
[LORD] What?

127
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,333
[DURAN] For the realm...
we must strike back!

128
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:46,500
[LORD] Lord Duran! We have
neither the men nor the
materials!

129
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,966
[DURAN] A night raid might
give us the advantage.

130
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:52,200
[DURAN] The new moon is tonight.

131
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,200
[DURAN] If we take advantage of
the dark,

132
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,033
and come in from the side of the
hill blocking out the stars,
slowly and quietly...

133
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,933
We should be able to make our
approach.

134
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:04,866
[CAPTAIN] Don't shuffle about...
be quiet... pick your feet up.

135
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:06,433
[SOLDIERS] (surprised)

136
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,366
[DURAN] (breath catch) Where is
that coming from?!

137
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,533
[DURAN] (breath catch) No! HAH!

138
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,566
[DURAN] All troops! For‐ward!

139
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,266
[DURAN] Keep moving! Don't let
them hit you!

140
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,733
[DURAN] Go! Go! Go! HAH!!!

141
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:31,500
[DURAN] Move! Keep going!

142
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,633
[DURAN] Hyah! Follow me!

143
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,933
[SOLDIER] My Lord! Let me help
you!

144
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,300
[SOLDIER] We need more shields!

145
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,000
[SOLDIERS] (reacting to the
starburst rounds)

146
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,166
[DURAN] (growl) Get out! Do you
wanna get hit?!

147
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,333
[DURAN] Goddammit!

148
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,200
[DURAN] How could you...

149
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,666
What did we do... to deserve
this.

150
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:49,260
[DURAN] Heh! (maniacal laughter)

151
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:30,289
[KURATA] Did you hear the
report?

152
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,523
Intelligence says they lost 60
thousand.

153
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:36,256
[YOJI] Plus 60 thousand in
Ginza... 2 army corps worth
of men.

154
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:37,889
[KURATA] Don't tell me you're
worried about them.

155
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,123
[YOJI] A hundred twenty thousand
people?

156
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:41,389
[YOJI] Why would they send so
many?

157
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:43,523
And what kinda country are we
fighting?!

158
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,456
[MARCUS] Your Imperial
Majesty...

159
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:51,556
[MARCUS] The damage of the
Allied Kingdoms' Forces

160
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:55,023
is expected to reach over
100,000 dead and injured.

161
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:57,256
[MARCUS] The defeated armies
have no officers

162
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:00,123
remaining and are making their
way back home on their own.

163
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:03,256
[MOLTO] Hmm... Just the way I
conceived of it.

164
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,589
[MOLTO] The potential threat of
our quibbling neighbors

165
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:09,189
coming to raze the Empire has
successfully been eliminated.

166
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:12,989
[MOLTO] Torch all the towns and
villages between us and Alnus.

167
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,423
Poison all of the wells and herd
their livestock this way. And
burn the crops.

168
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:21,156
[MOLTO] That should keep their
armies from eating our food and
water...

169
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:23,523
then we can plan a
counterattack of our own.

170
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,723
[MARCUS] So it's a scorched
earth policy...

171
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:29,489
[MARCUS] That causes me worry
about the tax revenue decrease
and inside secession.

172
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:31,289
[MOLTO] What do you mean?

173
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,623
[MARCUS] Well... there's a
problem, Your Majesty.

174
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:38,489
A movement is forming behind
Marquis Casel to replace you at
the head of the Senate, Sire.

175
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:40,589
[MOLTO] (laughs) Can you imagine
how much service

176
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:42,923
I'll get from the Senate
when I expose this travesty?

177
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,523
[MOLTO] Go ahead and let
the Private Council know

178
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:47,056
I'll be needing their
services right away.

179
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:48,589
[PINA] Your Majesty!

180
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,256
[MOLTO] My darling daughter...
What is it?

181
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:58,956
[PINA] It's Alnus, of course.
[MARCUS] Hmm?

182
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:02,389
[PINA] It is my understanding
we were soundly defeated at
the Gate...

183
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:05,023
And that the armies of all our
subordinate nations

184
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:07,423
were routed on Alnus Hill
just a few days later...

185
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:10,423
[PINA] What is Your Majesty
doing in response to this
situation?!

186
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,189
[MARCUS] Obviously we aim to
re‐gathering our forces

187
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,056
and create a plan to
counterattack...! (breath catch)

188
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:15,423
[PINA] Create a plan?!

189
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:17,723
The enemy is on our doorstep,
we must move now!

190
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:21,989
[MOLTO] Pina my dear, you're
right. You're absolutely
correct.

191
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,823
However the issue at hand is
that

192
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:27,956
we do not know much about the
enemy forces occupying the hill.

193
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:29,389
[MOLTO] Why don't we try this?

194
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:32,023
Take all of your knights from
the Order of The Rose

195
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:33,589
and scout
the situation for us.

196
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,523
[PINA] But... Your Majesty?
You want me to take my people?

197
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:37,856
[MOLTO] Well why not?

198
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:39,589
You've been longing to prove
that your knights

199
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:42,056
are doing more than just
marching and color guard.

200
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,689
So... here's your chance.

201
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:52,156
[PINA] Consider the mission
done... Your Majesty.

202
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:55,123
[DIRRELL] What in the hell does
Japan think they're doing?

203
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:57,589
[DIRRELL] They move an entire
division across the Gate,

204
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:58,956
and then box themselves in

205
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:01,089
like a bunch of baby turtles for
crying out loud!

206
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:02,589
[KREARON] Their first mission
statement

207
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:04,923
regarding this has been to
evaluate politics...

208
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:07,289
They're only interested in
controlling certain areas.

209
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,956
[DIRRELL] (laughs) Oh my god.

210
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,323
Well they're missing out aren't
they?

211
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:12,789
[DIRRELL] They've stumbled upon

212
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,289
a goldmine of untouched
resources!

213
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,556
[DIRRELL] Are they gonna just
let it sit there,

214
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,823
that does nobody any good.

215
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,289
[DIRRELL] What about this...?

216
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:21,856
We've already got guys in
Okinawa, just send them in.

217
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:24,156
[KREARON] That's not a good
idea, sir.

218
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:26,056
The other leaders are hoping to
allow Japan to uh...

219
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,856
drop the ball on this.

220
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:30,989
[KREARON] The thought is to
let Japan simply fail on
their own this time.

221
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:32,256
[DIRRELL] Interesting.

222
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:34,423
We don't want to get pulled down
with them.

223
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:37,689
"Plausible deniability" is a
good friend to have.

224
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:40,856
[HIGAKI] ...With this is mind...

225
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:43,089
We need intelligence to decide
future policy.

226
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:45,489
Investigating their political
base... religious faith...

227
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:47,556
and what kind of industries are
the most prevalent

228
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:49,323
in this world are
at the top of our upcoming

229
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,289
fact‐finding missions Lieutent
Itami.

230
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:53,256
[YOJI] Well that seems
like a great idea...

231
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:55,356
Best of luck to whatever dummy
gets that job.

232
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:57,689
[HIGAKI] Congratulations,
"Dummy" ‐It's all yours.

233
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:58,456
[YOJI] Huh...? Please not me.

234
00:14:58,556 --> 00:14:59,589
[HIGAKI] What?

235
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:01,356
[YOJI] I can't do something
like that myself.

236
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,656
[HIGAKI] We wouldn't entrust it
to just you.

237
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:05,089
[HIGAKI] We've already
organized the

238
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:07,189
six deep recon and surveillance
units we need.

239
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:08,823
[HIGAKI] And you, Lieutenant,

240
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:10,289
will command of one of them.

241
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:12,189
[HIGAKI] Your mission will be
to make contact

242
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,256
with the inhabitants inside the
disputed area...

243
00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:15,823
And if you don't get your ass
shot off,

244
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:17,523
start a friendly relationship
with them.

245
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:21,056
[YOJI] Ahhh... sure...
I guess if that's an order.

246
00:15:21,156 --> 00:15:22,523
[HIGAKI] It is.

247
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,523
[HIGAKI] And as much as it pains
me to say this...

248
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,189
[HIGAKI] You are officially in
command of the

249
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:28,456
3rd Deep Recon and Surveillance
unit!

250
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:29,656
[YOJI] Yeah...

251
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:30,789
[KUWABARA] Fall in!

252
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,856
Sir! 3rd Recon... is ready, sir!

253
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:36,223
[YOJI] Hey, Old School! And
we're...

254
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:47,589
[YOJI] Uh... thanks for falling
in or whatever.

255
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:50,189
I'm Lieutenant Itami. So, now...

256
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:54,956
[YOJI] Oh, god... miss one
train on the way to sexy
Shimbashi and now I'm here...

257
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:56,989
In a platoon fulla... dudes.

258
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,556
[YOJI] All right... let's get
crackin' folks.

259
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:04,289
[SHINO] You kidding? This is the
diipshit they sent us?

260
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:07,523
[KUWABARA] Mount up!

261
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:49,032
[YOJI] Man it's bright out here!

262
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:50,498
Just like I hoped it would be.

263
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:51,765
[KURATA] Oh come on Lieutenant

264
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:54,132
we've got some beautiful scenery
back home.

265
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:56,065
[KURATA] I mean, for me,
I was figuring

266
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:59,232
I'd see freakin' dragons flying
all over the place.

267
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,632
Maybe a fairy or two.

268
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,665
[KURATA] Look at all
the towns we've seen.

269
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:04,732
Just boring 'ol humans
all over the place?

270
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,498
[KURATA] I'm pretty
disappointed.

271
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:09,032
[YOJI] Oh that's right, you got
that whole cat‐girl thing.

272
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:11,265
[KURATA] A cat‐girl, or a hot
little witch, yeah!

273
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,765
I could definitely
go for one of those.

274
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,732
[KURATA] So... what about you...
you got a preference?

275
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:19,098
[YOJI] Well, uh... magical girls
are cool.

276
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:20,165
[KURATA] Seriously?!

277
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:21,765
[YOJI] Emu is smokin'.

278
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:23,532
[KURATA] Whuh? Your standards
are low.

279
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:26,432
[YOJI] Hmm? Don't be talkin'
about my waifu like that!

280
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:27,698
[KURATA] Easy, man! She's
alright.

281
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:28,998
I can sing her whole opening
theme song!

282
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:30,898
[YOJI] Really?!

283
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:31,965
[KURATA] Hell, yeah, sir!

284
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:33,598
[YOJI, KURATA] When I, feel low!

285
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:35,065
There's one, place to go!

286
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:38,165
Mei Com! Mei Com! Mei Company!

287
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,398
It's the, one place Put's a
smile on, my face Mei Com! Mei
Com! Mei Company!

288
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:41,498
[SHINO] Oh dear God.

289
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:51,865
[TOMITA] By the way, What are we
doing with gear that's, like,

290
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:53,198
ancient history?

291
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:54,332
[TOMITA] I mean our vehicles

292
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:55,698
seem to be up to date, don't
they?

293
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:57,365
[YOJI] It's probably a cost
management thing.

294
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,965
They figure, worst‐case, we
might have to

295
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:01,565
ditch 'em and run like hell.

296
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,265
[TOMITA] So we were given
weapons we can afford to lose.

297
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:05,765
[YOJI] Besides,
all the new stuff

298
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,665
has all that gadgetry
that needs GPS.

299
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:10,732
No satellites out here.
So no need for it.

300
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:13,432
[KUWABARA] We're just bringing
along what we need.

301
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:15,065
Kurata... There oughta be

302
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:17,732
a small river comin' up here in
a little bit, all right.

303
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:19,665
[KUWABARA] Follow along the
banks for a while

304
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,965
and we oughta get a look
at that forest they were
tellin' us about.

305
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:23,698
[KURATA] Got it, Top.

306
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:25,832
[YOJI] Well, there's the river.

307
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:28,465
Looks like you know what
you're talking about, Old Timer.

308
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,965
[KUWABARA] Considering I taught

309
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,198
nearly everyone here how to
land‐navigate, I hope so...

310
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:35,132
I'd say we better put stakes
down in front of the trees
tonight.

311
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:37,198
[YOJI] Sounds good.

312
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:39,498
[KUWABARA] Huh? Hmm? You've
already called back to the rear?

313
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:41,265
[KURATA] So we're going in,
right, no need to stop.

314
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:42,565
[YOJI] Well think about it.

315
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,132
If we just plow right in there

316
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:46,498
then we're gonna have to setup
somewhere deep in the forest.

317
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:48,332
F'we do that... we could be a
risk...

318
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:51,432
to any settlements and villages
that're in there.

319
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:54,598
[YOJI] Y'see we're the
"Self‐Defense Force that cares."

320
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:56,465
[YOJI] The general and the major
told us to

321
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:59,232
build a friendly relationship
with everyone we can.

322
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:01,098
[YOJI] Check this out...

323
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:02,498
Zavalu, Halu uguluu...?

324
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:04,732
[KURATA] Yeah I don't know
Lieutenant.

325
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:06,865
They might think you have a
speech impediment.

326
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:07,932
[YOJI] Oh shut up!

327
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:09,132
[KURATA] Hehehe! Huh?

328
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,298
[YOJI] Hang on... I got more
books

329
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:11,998
and I'm not afraid to use them.

330
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:13,065
[KUWABARA] What's that?

331
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:15,532
[YOJI] A Fire?

332
00:19:21,232 --> 00:19:23,298
[KURATA] It's on fire all right.

333
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:24,732
[YOJI] And it's really big...

334
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:26,465
what the hell coulda caused it?

335
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,432
[KUWABARA] You gotta see this
one for yourself Lieutenant.

336
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:34,298
[YOJI] Holy crap!

337
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:36,498
[DRAGON] (roar)

338
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:40,665
[KUWABARA] It's like King
Ghidorah with only one neck.

339
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,332
[YOJI] You really are
a classic aren'tcha.

340
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,665
[SHINO] Lieutenant.
[YOJI] Huh?

341
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,598
[SHINO] What would you like us
to do, sir?

342
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:47,332
[YOJI] Sergeant Kuribayashi...

343
00:19:47,432 --> 00:19:49,398
do you think you could hold my
hand for me?

344
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:51,698
Your CO is gettin' kinda scary
over here.

345
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:52,398
[SHINO] Eat it.

346
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:54,365
[YOJI] Yeah...OK.

347
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:55,698
[DRAGON] (roar)

348
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:05,965
[KUWABARA] It's buggin out.

349
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:09,598
[YOJI] It makes you think...

350
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:11,632
Why in the hell would a dragon
just burn down

351
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:14,265
an entire forest with nothing
else around?

352
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:15,532
[SHINO] Well you know if you're
really

353
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,198
that curious about it Lieutenant
Itami...

354
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,065
I'm sure our new dragon friend
would be happy

355
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,432
to sit down for a quick
interview.

356
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:22,598
[YOJI] Are you always like this?
[SHINO] Huh?

357
00:20:22,698 --> 00:20:24,698
[YOJI] They told us back
at the Village.

358
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,832
There's a small settlement
inside that forest.

359
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:29,232
[SHINO] Oh! Uh...

360
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:30,598
[KURATA] Holy shit!

361
00:20:30,698 --> 00:20:32,998
[YOJI] Hey, Top...
bivouac's gonna have to wait.

362
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,332
[KUWABARA] Got it! We're back on
the move, people!

363
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:52,065
[TOMITA] There's still smoke
coming from the ground.

364
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:55,698
[KURATA] It'd take a miracle for
anyone to survive this.

365
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,065
[KURATA] (breath catch) Um...
sir...

366
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:02,032
[YOJI] I know. Keep moving.

367
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:07,032
[KUWABARA] Rest in peace...

368
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:13,565
[SHINO] Lieutenant...

369
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,765
[SHINO] Our first
glance here... there are 32

370
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:18,298
foundations coming up out of the
ground...

371
00:21:18,398 --> 00:21:19,632
The majority of which appear to

372
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:21,898
be roughly the size of family
dwellings, sir.

373
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:23,765
[SHINO] We only found twenty
seven bodies...

374
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,365
the rubble and the wreckage
could be hiding the rest.

375
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:29,365
[YOJI] Assuming you have three
people in a house...

376
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:32,198
That gives us one hundred dead
and no survivors.

377
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:33,765
[SHINO] This is just horrible.

378
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,998
[YOJI] I suppose then that
Dragons in this world

379
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:37,365
will attack groups of people.

380
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:39,632
That sounds like something to
tell the General.

381
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,032
[SHINO] Maybe but I'm not sure
the general

382
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:42,798
is going to like what else we
have to tell him.

383
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:45,465
Fifty‐cal barely put a dent in
the wyverns we hit in Ginza,

384
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:48,298
and they weren't breathing fire
all over the place.

385
00:21:48,398 --> 00:21:49,898
[YOJI] A flying tank with
a flame thrower

386
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:51,465
is not a good thing.

387
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:53,298
[YOJI] We should see what kind
of recon

388
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:55,065
we can do to learn more about
them.

389
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:57,698
[klunk]

390
00:21:57,798 --> 00:21:58,698
[YOJI] What?

391
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:01,098
[SHINO] Sounded like it hit
something.

392
00:22:01,198 --> 00:22:02,565
what's down there?

393
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:11,798
[YOJI] Not a "what," ...a "who!"

394
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,898
[YOJI] We need a hand over
here!!!

395
00:23:45,065 --> 00:23:48,898
[LELEI] Next time on "GATE:" A
Flame Dragon.
