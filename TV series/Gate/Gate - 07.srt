1
00:00:01,066 --> 00:00:03,066
[LELEI] Dispatched to the
Special Region,

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,833
the 3rd Deep Reconnaissance Unit
led by Yoji Itami

3
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:09,233
saved the town of Italica from
bandits.

4
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,566
But on the way back to Alnus
Hill,

5
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,533
they encountered Princess Pina's
knights,

6
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:13,400
the Order of the Rose.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,033
[LELEI] Itami was taken captive

8
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:17,500
and his subordinates forced to
retreat.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,766
[LELEI] Itami's fate now lies in
Pina's hands.

10
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:23,633
[SHINO] Hmm...

11
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:25,266
[SHINO] I dunno guys...

12
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,133
he could totally be dead
already.

13
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,433
[KURATA] Hey, come on Sarge

14
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,600
you're not supposed to say
things like that.

15
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,000
[SHINO] Seriously, Kurata.

16
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,600
They were really roughing him up
when we drove off.

17
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,233
[TOMITA] Be patient, guys...
wait for the sunset.

18
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,000
[KURATA] Aw, maaan...

19
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,333
[PINA] What the hell have you
done?

20
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:45,766
<stunned>

21
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:47,600
(hard breathing)

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,866
[PINA] (hard breathing) You
idiots...!

23
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:52,666
(confused exhale)

24
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:53,933
[PANACHE] Your Majesty...!

25
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,066
What have we done to make you
this angry?

26
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,100
[PINA] Don't you get it?

27
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,733
[HAMILTON] Master Itami!

28
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:02,700
(breath catch)

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,066
[HAMILTON] Master Itami!

30
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,200
Say something. Are you okay?
Master Itami?

31
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,266
[HAMILTON] Talk to me, please!

32
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:12,166
[YOJI] (flops)
[HAMILTON] Aaahh!

33
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,700
[PINA] We have broken the treaty
on the very first day.

34
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,266
[GREY] They can use this as a
reason to restart the war.

35
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:57,500
I wouldn't put it past your
father to do that...

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,733
But we don't know if these
"Japanese" would do the same
thing.

37
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,566
[PINA] If they did, it would all
be over very quickly.

38
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,066
[GREY] At the very least...

39
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,733
Boses and Panache didn't go
overboard and kill the guy.

40
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,466
Maybe come forward and apologize
for what they did.

41
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,933
[PINA] You want me to just
grovel before them?

42
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,900
[GREY] I don't think you want a
fight...

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,033
all things considered.

44
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,466
(breath catch)

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
[SHINO] What?... What'd you say?

46
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,800
[KURATA] The lieutenant doesn't
have anything to worry about?

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,933
[SHINO] That is not what you
said!

48
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,100
[TOMITA] Kurata said that

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,266
Lt. Itami happens to be a
Ranger.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,133
[SHINO] Huuhhhhhhh?!

51
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,200
You're joking... there's
no freakin' way

52
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,466
in the world a jackass like that
has a Ranger Badge!

53
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:43,200
[LELEI] Hmmm? What's wrong with
Itami

54
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,166
having one of these Badges? Zit
a bad thing?

55
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,466
[SHINO] Look, it's not like we
give 'em out to just anyone!

56
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:49,666
You gotta be really tough to go
through the training!

57
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:52,266
And then you gotta be able to
prove you can accomplish
something afterwards!

58
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,933
It's s'posta be a goddamn honor!
(gasp)

59
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,966
[SHINO] Rangers are total
badasses!

60
00:03:57,066 --> 00:04:00,000
[SHINO] And the Lieutenant is
not a badass.

61
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,700
(giggle)

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,566
[RORY] So that means he must be
stronger than he looks.

63
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:09,566
[TOMITA] All right... It's time
for us to get moving people...

64
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:18,066
[MILITIAMAN] Ah, this sucks...

65
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,900
I don't care if they're
Imperial Soldiers or not.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,700
They're so full of themselves it
makes me sick!

67
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,233
[MILITIAMAN] Easy.
C'mon you don't want these guys
hearing you, do you?

68
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,333
[MILITIAMAN] Yeah, whatever,
man. Hunh?

69
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,433
[MILITIAMAN] It's the Apostle
and her friends.

70
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,633
[TUKA] Oh? (giggle)

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,266
Oh ye spirit of slumber...
Take these souls with you...

72
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:45,233
Allow them to experience your
peace and harmony.

73
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,100
(zonked)

74
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,600
(snoozes, flops)

75
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,500
[TOMITA] We're clear.

76
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,333
(rousing)

77
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:09,166
[MOMU] Are you awake, Master
Itami?

78
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,400
[YOJI] Huh? Where am I?

79
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,800
[MOMU] You are in the mansion of
House Folmar.

80
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,466
[YOJI] The home of the Count...

81
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,233
[YOJI] Which would mean that I'm
back;

82
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,700
they brought me all the way back
to Italica.

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,866
[YOJI] Ehhh... Those are cat
ears. Uh...

84
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:30,766
[PERSIA] Hmm?

85
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,133
Is sommmmething wrong?

86
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,633
[YOJI] Uh... Oh, no... I was
just kinda wondering

87
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:35,800
what the heck is going on.

88
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,000
[KAINE] There's no need to
worry.

89
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,700
We've been ordered by the
Princess to give you the best
service possible.

90
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,433
All you have to do is ask one of
us and we will take care of you.

91
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:49,466
Also... regarding the Knights
who mistreated you...

92
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,500
they've been severely
reprimanded.

93
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,200
[KAINE] Your actions have given
this town a new life...

94
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,200
and for this we are eternally
grateful, My Lord.

95
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,366
[YOJI] Ohhh... y'know don't
mention it.

96
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:02,833
[KAINE] To assault the savior of
Italica

97
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:04,733
in the way they did is
unforgivable.

98
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,433
As such, if you wish to reduce
this town to rubble

99
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,033
I will assist you in doing so.
They certainly deserve it.

100
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:15,300
[KAINE] But please... I ask that
you spare our mistress the
Countess.

101
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,533
[KAINE] Please don't make her
part of your retribution.

102
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:20,233
[YOJI] It's okay. I'd never do
something like that.

103
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,433
I'm not that kind of guy.

104
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,300
[KAINE] Thank you for your
generosity.

105
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,800
It's definitely appreciated.

106
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,666
[YOJI] Ah... (gulp)

107
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,000
[YOJI] Sure... It was nothing.

108
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,266
[KAINE] These four are your
personal nurses...

109
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:34,766
feel free to ask them for
anything while you're
recovering.

110
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:39,833
[MAIDS] Count on us Master...

111
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,766
we are more than happy to serve
you.

112
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:45,233
[KAINE] As I said.... Just ask
them for anything you need.

113
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,433
[YOJI] Yeah... will do.

114
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,133
(gasp)

115
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,333
[KAINE] What's happening?

116
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,000
[MAMINA] Someone's at the
back door...

117
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,766
It sounds like they're trying to
force their way in.

118
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:08,200
[KAINE] More than likely... it's
Master Itami's people.

119
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,933
[KAINE] Show them the way in and
bring them here.

120
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:12,766
If it's someone else, then you
know what to do.

121
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,700
[PERSIA] Yes, M'yam.

122
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,133
[YOJI] Ah... Ohh. 'Scuse me...
can they really uh...?

123
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,466
[KAINE] Can they handle
themselves?

124
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:25,366
Mamina's a voglia warrior
bunny...

125
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:28,633
and Persia is a very adept
cat‐person.

126
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,633
[KAINE] Aurea is a medusa...

127
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,400
[KAINE] ...and Momu is human.

128
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
The late head of the family was
very open‐minded,

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,800
and actively made a point of
employing species of all
varieties.

130
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,900
You could go as far as to say
it was an "interest" of his.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,100
[YOJI] Now that... sounds like
the type of guy

132
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,766
I could get along with. <react>

133
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:50,266
[AUREA] Itami you have a very
similar smell to the late
Master.

134
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:51,766
[SNAKE] (menacing sound)

135
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,700
[MOMU] Hey! You cannot just say
things

136
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,933
like that to our guest okay!

137
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,000
[AUREA] Okay...

138
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,366
[KAINE] Medusas use their hair

139
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:02,400
to drain the life from their
adversaries.

140
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,066
[KAINE] Aurea knows better but
you'll still want to watch
yourself.

141
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,133
[YOJI] Eh... OK.

142
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,433
[MOMU] And... ahhh....
[YOJI] Ahhh... Uh?

143
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,866
[KURATA] Lieutenant!

144
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,266
Are you all right?

145
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,133
[YOJI] Hey guys!

146
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,233
[SQUAD] <bewildered>

147
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,466
[PINA] Boses... Panache...

148
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:31,566
You have attacked an
officer of the Japanese Self
Defense Force...

149
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,266
You treated Master Itami in a
less than hospitable way

150
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:35,833
and endangered his life.

151
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,833
This is a violation of our
treaty.

152
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,033
[PINA] These people possess

153
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,633
the power to fight off
a Flame Dragon.

154
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,433
So imagine what would happen
if they decided to declare war,

155
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,733
wouldn't be good I can assure
you.

156
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:48,666
[PINA] The Empire would fall!

157
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,700
[BOSES] Yes.

158
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,033
[PINA] It is on you...

159
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,266
to make them forget this ever
happened.

160
00:08:56,366 --> 00:08:58,700
You're going to need to offer
that man your body.

161
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,933
(gasp)

162
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,233
[PINA] I know it's degrading,

163
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,433
but you will do whatever it
takes.

164
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,700
[BOSES] I am a daughter of
nobility, Your Majesty.

165
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,100
And I understand what it takes
to protect the realm.

166
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,066
I will do what must be done...

167
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,066
If that is what it comes to.

168
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:26,000
Uh... ma'am! Corporal Takeo
Kurata reporting milady!

169
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,266
[KURATA] 21 years old, single!

170
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,800
My hobbies are anime and
doujinshi!

171
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,200
And I'm totally single.

172
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,400
[PERSIA] Uh?
[KURATA] 100 percent single!

173
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,133
(giggle)

174
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:37,200
[MAMINA] The way you fought
those bandits was awesome!

175
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,766
I really mean it! I totally saw
everything!

176
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,166
[SHINO] Nah... it wasn't that
great!

177
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,433
[LELEI] These snakes of yours,
how do they shed?

178
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,966
[AUREA] That's kind of a secret.
[SNAKE] (hiss)

179
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,666
[MOMU] How do they make the
fabric like that?

180
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:51,133
[TUKA] I don't know what kind of
loom they used...

181
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:54,366
but it's extremely stretchy and
really comfortable.

182
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,933
[KAINE] To have you here today
Your Holiness,

183
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:58,900
is truly a great honor.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,833
[KAINE] The mercy of the Mighty
Emroy

185
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,266
is a wonderful thing to behold!

186
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:03,933
[RORY] (annoyed) Something like
that.

187
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:05,366
[KURATA] Ah‐haaaa!

188
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:07,500
[PERSIA] Mwell, meow. How's the
tea?

189
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,866
[KURATA] Oh! It's the best tea
ever!

190
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:11,233
[PERSIA] Rowl!

191
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,333
[YOJI] Well now... looks like
we're comfortable.

192
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:14,933
[TOMITA] I don't think we're
gonna need

193
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:16,433
to be calling for a dust‐off
anytime soon.

194
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,100
[KATSUMOTO] Guess the Sergeant
Major

195
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,233
can take the night off and we'll
call him later.

196
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,533
[YOJI] Yeah... let's just call
tonight a cultural interchange.

197
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,700
(steeling herself)

198
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,000
[PINA] It's on you... to make
them think this didn't happen.

199
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,233
You're gonna need
to offer that man your body.

200
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,433
(several uneasy breaths)

201
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:51,766
[KURATA] Say cheese!

202
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,200
(laughter)

203
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,033
[BOSES] Uh... Wha‐

204
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,333
[KURATA] Oh. This is a good one.

205
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,066
[SHINO] And you can take a
picture with this.

206
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,533
[RORY] Takes pictures of what?

207
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:03,200
[chatter]

208
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,466
[YOJI] Oh, wow... and they let
you in?

209
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:08,300
That's kinda hilarious Tomita.
(big laugh)

210
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,700
[TOMITA] It wasn't that funny.

211
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,533
[BOSES] I don't believe this.

212
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,166
[BOSES] I am the second daughter
of the honorable Count Palesti!

213
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:21,666
[BOSES] The nerve of this man.

214
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:25,333
This pig has no idea what it
took for me to lower myself!

215
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:29,833
[YOJI] Huh?

216
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:31,200
[BOSES] (swing) <SLAP>

217
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,366
[YOJI] Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

218
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,766
[PINA] All right...

219
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:44,366
What's... wrong with his face?

220
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,600
[BOSES] Um that was my doing
Your Majesty.

221
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,100
(wail/gasp)

222
00:11:49,766 --> 00:11:50,966
[PINA] Oh dear God...!

223
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:52,400
How do I explain this?!

224
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,466
[TOMITA] Well, Ma'am...
if it's all the same to you

225
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:56,133
we'd like to take our leave
now...

226
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,033
and you just do whatever you
need to.

227
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,500
[LELEI] He says that whatever
you want ... s'fine.

228
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,733
[PINA] This is not good!

229
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:02,966
[PINA] Uh.. the sun's almost up!

230
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,400
Why don't we sit down for
breakfast!

231
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,433
We can talk it out. Get to know
each other better!

232
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,666
[KURATA] Uh we appreciate the
offer, Milady...

233
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:12,266
the thing is... Our government
has called the Lieutenant
back home...

234
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,766
to report to some of our
lawmakers.

235
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,333
[LELEI] Itami is returning to
Japan

236
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:17,766
to testify to their Senate.

237
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:19,200
[PINA] To their Senate?!

238
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,500
[LELEI] That's correct...

239
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,000
that's why they are in such a
hurry.

240
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:29,300
[PINA] Huh... The Japanese have
a senate...

241
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,433
[PINA] So then... ...then that
means...

242
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,733
[PINA] Depending on what he
tells them,

243
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,800
[PINA] They could have their
military do something in
retaliation!

244
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,700
Something.. horrible... (gasp)

245
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,533
[PINA] Wait!
[SQUAD] (reax)

246
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,433
(reax)

247
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,466
[PINA] I... want to...!

248
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,200
(uneasy)(gasp)

249
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,066
[PINA] I would like to... to
accompany you to Alnus Hill!

250
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,333
[YOJI] What's that? <react>

251
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:53,200
[PINA] I must speak
with your superior...

252
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,766
and apologize to him... for
violating the treaty.

253
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:57,533
[PINA] Is that possible Sir
Itami?

254
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,200
[YOJI] Come with us?

255
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,733
[BOSES] Princess...?
[PINA] Mm‐hm.

256
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:16,433
[KURATA] Take it easy Persia!
I'll be back soon!

257
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,100
[PERSIA] MyI'll be waiting for
you!

258
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,300
[KURATA] I love you!

259
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,833
[YOJI] I guess the princess

260
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,600
is really coming with us,
isn't she?

261
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,066
[TOMITA] Sir... a message from
the major...

262
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,366
"he said we can bring them in."

263
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:28,233
"And treat them with all due
courtesy."

264
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,966
[YOJI] Yeah, yeah...
just let him know what our ETA
is willya?

265
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:33,000
[YOJI] Move out!

266
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,000
(uneasy)

267
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,233
(breath catch)

268
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:52,866
[BOSES] Uh... Princess! I can
see it!

269
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,700
[PINA] You mean we're already
there?

270
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,766
[PINA] That was fast.

271
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,333
[PINA] What are those staffs?

272
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,700
Is every soldier in this
army a Wizard?

273
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,333
[LELEI] No, ma'am. They're not
using any magic. Um...

274
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:18,000
Those are weapons they call
"rifles".

275
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,333
[PINA] Those are weapons?!

276
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,100
[LELEI] This is how they work.

277
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,066
A small amount of fire is
ignited within the cylinder...

278
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,000
forcing out a small stone at
high speed...

279
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
[PINA] Every single Japanese
soldier has a weapon like that
one...

280
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,233
[LELEI] Yes...

281
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,033
It's part of their basic
teachings.

282
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:34,566
Every Japanese soldier is
trained to use one...

283
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,133
apparently quite well.

284
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,766
[PINA] They don't even have to
be in the proximity

285
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:40,933
of their enemy to take them out.

286
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:43,200
[LELEI] It's the reason
the Imperial Army fell.

287
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,400
(nasal inhale, pensive)(gasp)

288
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,300
[PINA] First their flying
steel... and now steel
elephants.

289
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,466
[PINA] They really are...
Creatures from another world.

290
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,666
[PINA] Why have they come here?

291
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:07,266
What do they want from us?

292
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,833
[LELEI] The Empire stepped on
the griffon's tail.

293
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:12,000
[BOSES] Mind your mouth, girl.

294
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,300
Do not speak so casually

295
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,566
when the Empire is on
the verge of collapse.

296
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,433
[LELEI] My tribe roams
where it pleases, Knight.

297
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,666
[LELEI] We've never answered to
the Empire.

298
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:26,066
[PINA] I suppose you can rule a
nation by force...

299
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,000
[PINA] But you can't control
what they think

300
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,533
no matter how hard you try.

301
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,433
[PINA] Lieutenant Itahmi...
Since were both here,

302
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:38,033
could I have a moment to speak
with you? Uh?

303
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,833
[YOJI] Uhhh... Sorry, no...

304
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:41,366
I really need to attend a few
briefings

305
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:43,666
about all this
meeting‐with‐the‐government
stuff. Hehe.

306
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:47,800
Sgt. Kuribayashi should be able
to help you I'm sure!

307
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,766
(gacking)

308
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:49,733
[BOSES] Princess?

309
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,066
[PINA] I lost my chance

310
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,666
to tell him how peaceful we are.

311
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,766
[HAZAMA] Sorry for the wait.

312
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:01,866
[LELEI] This is General Hazama
from the Self Defense Force.

313
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:04,300
[HAZAMA] Please, go ahead and
have a seat.

314
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,233
Well now... having you here is a
bit unusual so...

315
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,033
there must be something you
wanted to discuss with me.

316
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,500
[PINA] Regarding the treaty...

317
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,900
I'm afraid things have gotten
off to a rough start...

318
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,533
And I would like to apologize
for that.

319
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:18,633
[LELEI] She is sorry.

320
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,333
[HAZAMA] Itami's report was very
thorough...

321
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:23,666
You hadn't communicated with
your inferiors yet.

322
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:26,933
[PINA] (erk!) It's true...
but we've taken care of that.

323
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,366
[LELEI] It's true.

324
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:30,300
[HAZAMA] We're currently using
you as an intermediary

325
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,766
between our government and those
running your Empire.

326
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,366
If this is causing you any
problems

327
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:36,500
we'll be more than happy to
reconsider terms of the treaty.

328
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,166
[PINA] The treaty's fine
as it is! I don't think any
changes are necessary.

329
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,066
[YANAGIDA] Can you clarify
something for me...?

330
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,600
Part of the report said
your knight over there
really gave him the business.

331
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,533
[PINA,BOSES] (gasp)
[YANAGIDA] Covered the poor guy
in bruises and scratches...

332
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,600
[YANAGIDA] <giggles> I found it
hilarious.

333
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,066
As you might expect Itami was
naturally embarrassed

334
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,866
and tried to pretend it never
happened.

335
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,400
[YANAGIDA] Or course it kinda
made me wonder

336
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,466
if perhaps he said or did
something out of line.

337
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:00,933
[PINA] (nervous laugh)

338
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:02,433
[LELEI] Allow me to clarify...

339
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:05,866
Did Lt. Itami do something rude
to make you strike him?

340
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:07,966
[BOSES] No... no sir, he didn't.

341
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,800
[LELEI] Very well...
what did he do to make you
want to hit him?

342
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,500
Create a situation where you
needed to defend yourself?

343
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,766
Tell us in detail, if you would
please.

344
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,733
[PINA,BOSES] (uneasy sounds)
[LELEI] He'd like to know.

345
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:19,933
[HAZAMA] All right Yanagida,

346
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:21,433
I think that'll be more than
enough.

347
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:23,600
Don't you see how
nervous you're making them?

348
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,233
[YANAGIDA] Sorry, sir.

349
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,033
[TUKA] What? You really
want me to go

350
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,533
to the other side of the GATE?

351
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,600
[YOJI] That's right. You know
what this world is like...

352
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,833
so I would like you to talk to
them about it.

353
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,200
[YOJI] We'll be leaving
tomorrow... and staying for two
nights...

354
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,866
We're gonna be back before you
know it.

355
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:42,300
[TUKA] So you'll
be going as well?

356
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,666
[YOJI] Yeah I've gotta go.

357
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:44,966
Oh and Lelei's coming...

358
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,666
She'll interpret for us.

359
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,633
[TUKA] OK, Father... what would
you do now?

360
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:54,566
[YOJI] What?
[TUKA] Oh. No no it's nothing.
So it will make you happy

361
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,966
if I go to the other side and
speak to your government?

362
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,233
[YOJI] Well not just me.

363
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,300
It's more like all of us'd be
happy.

364
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,533
We'd all really appreciate it if
you went with us. M'kay?

365
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:06,633
[TUKA] Well... If that's the
case, yes, I'll go.

366
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,200
[RORY] Wait just a minute!
(grunt) [BOTH] Huh? Hm?

367
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,933
[RORY] You cannot seriously be
considering

368
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:15,766
going to the other side without
taking me.

369
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:17,666
[YOJI] <react> Now hang on...
Ehh?

370
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:20,066
[KATO] Yoohoo! I wanna go too...

371
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,166
[YOJI] Huh?

372
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,466
[YOJI] (big stretch) Ah! I'm
beat!

373
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,033
Making sure the ammo gets back
to the armory...

374
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,466
Breaking down the guns and
cleaning them up...

375
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:36,566
taking all the vehicles to the
wash rack and

376
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,066
getting all the mud and dirt off
of 'em.

377
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,400
They are gonna run me ragged.

378
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,733
[YOJI] Huh?

379
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,266
[YOJI] What now?

380
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:56,000
[YOJI] Wait a second... it's
winter there isn't it?

381
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,433
[YOJI] I gonna make it to that
convention

382
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:58,900
if it's the last thing I ever
do!

383
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,266
<notice door>

384
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:02,466
[YOJI] It's getting kinda late,
don't you think?

385
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:06,000
[LELEI] Uh, Itami... May I get a
ride back to camp...

386
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,733
I'm so tired...

387
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:13,733
[YOJI] You've been interpreting
this whole time?

388
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,000
'Splains why you're tired.

389
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,700
[YOJI] But well... I don't think

390
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,133
I can check out a car this late.

391
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:20,366
[YOJI] So, why don't you just
stay... oh..

392
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,400
(snoozies)

393
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,633
[YOJI] I'll take that as a yes.

394
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:54,523
[YOJI] Ah! Oh crap! Uh uh!

395
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:57,456
I definitely do not need to have
Kurata seeing me like this! Mph!

396
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:03,090
[YOJI] I should probably get
something to eat.

397
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,256
I wonder if there's any dinner
leftover.

398
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,456
[BOSES] Your Majesty... Do you
think it's possible they

399
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:20,356
would use this incident to start
a war with the Empire?

400
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:22,523
[PINA] No. If they wanted to do
that...

401
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:25,190
they'd never have let us come
here in the first place.

402
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,090
Not to mention how civil the
general was today.

403
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,090
[BOSES] Why then...?

404
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,323
[PINA] I'm not really sure...

405
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:33,190
These people are so different
from us...

406
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,223
I honestly have no idea what
they're fighting for.

407
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:37,056
I don't get it.

408
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:38,790
[PINA] But I could find out...

409
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,323
[BOSES] Your Majesty... you
can't do that...

410
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:48,090
[PINA] We must go with them...

411
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:53,390
[TOMITA] You sure this is okay,
Lieutenant?

412
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,090
[TOMITA] Come on, sir. Isn't she
a little much?

413
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,690
[YOJI] Absolutely, but I got
permission.

414
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,756
[YOJI] Besides... do you really
want her

415
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:02,423
going off here while we're away?

416
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:05,023
[TUKA] Why are we wearing such
heavy clothes?

417
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:06,656
[LELEI] The soldiers are saying
that

418
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:09,423
it will be much colder when we
get there.

419
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:10,756
[YANAGIDA] I do apologize...

420
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:12,490
The paperwork took a while...
but we're done.

421
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,390
[YOJI] Huh?!

422
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,190
[YANAGIDA] These two are flying
under the radar,

423
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,790
if you get my meaning,
Lieutenant.

424
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,323
Keep an eye on them for us.

425
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:26,423
[YOJI] Are we just showing up
unannounced?

426
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:28,756
[YANAGIDA] People already know
they're going to be there.

427
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:30,356
This is directly from the
General.

428
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,156
He wants all of our guests to
have a proper welcome.

429
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:35,156
[YANAGIDA] Treat the Princess

430
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:36,823
like you would any ambassador.

431
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:39,890
And a quick tour around Tokyo
wouldn't hurt.

432
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,023
[TUKA] This is the gate to the
other world.

433
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:54,023
[RORY] Oh how exciting.

434
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,456
[LELEI] We're not going to the
other side to have fun, Rory.

435
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:58,423
[RORY] Speak for yourself, kid.

436
00:22:00,923 --> 00:22:02,523
[BOSES] This is it.

437
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:04,956
[PINA] Yes...

438
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,390
[PINA] The country on the other
side...

439
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,790
[PINA] Come. Let's go.

440
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,656
[LELEI] Next time on Gate:

441
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:50,256
Japan, The Other Side of The
Gate
