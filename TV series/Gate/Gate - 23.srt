1
00:00:01,894 --> 00:00:03,558
Lelei:
Japan's Self Defense Force
was dispatched

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:05,092
to the mysterious
Special Region.

3
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:07,892
In order to stop the piper
from creating more assassins,

4
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:10,258
Itami and his friends head
to the Imperial Capital,

5
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:13,792
where the Order of the Rose
and the Imperial Army
are raging in battle.

6
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:16,025
With the number of innocent
victims mounting,

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,558
the Japanese government has
finally given the order

8
00:00:18,658 --> 00:00:21,225
to initiate a
critical rescue mission.

9
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:23,958
We've been ordered to
attack the Imperial Capital

10
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:26,325
and occupy the target at once!

11
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:29,792
Our objective is to rescue our
people being held at Jade Palace

12
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:32,292
Hazama:
as well as protect those
who support peace

13
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:33,558
who are seeking asylum.

14
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,392
To get this done,
timing will be everything!

15
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:40,792
Kengun:
We must complete the entire
mission by 1800 hours!

16
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:44,558
Soldiers! Prepare
to sync your watches now.

17
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:46,558
In ten seconds!

18
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:50,392
Eight, seven, six, five,

19
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:55,725
four, three, two, one. Mark!

20
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,225
JSDF Superior:
During the Ginza incident,

21
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:51,725
we saw our citizens being
captured by the Special Region.

22
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:52,492
But, at the same time,

23
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:54,992
there are political leaders
in their local government

24
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,758
seeking to negotiate
a peaceful path with us.

25
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:00,792
Their lives depend on
the success of your mission.

26
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:02,225
With bravery and honor,

27
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:04,858
I expect that you will
do your duty efficiently

28
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,792
and make our country proud.

29
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:08,858
Let this be my order.

30
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:15,825
This is Saber.
At the ready.

31
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:17,358
Radio:
Target locked.

32
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:21,558
Saber:
Air defense facility
is destroyed.

33
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:23,925
(dragons roar)

34
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:28,158
(dragons death rattle)

35
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:31,425
Radio A:
There is no threat over
the Imperial Capital, over.

36
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:34,792
Radio B:
Roger. Now to proceed
to phase two.

37
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,492
You there!
Send a messenger now!

38
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,125
Uhh... ah!

39
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,158
Uh... oh!

40
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:51,358
(strained death rattle)

41
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:54,058
This is Assassin.
It's done.

42
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,025
Assassin:
The west gate
is now under our control.

43
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:00,025
We will continue
to stay alert.

44
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:00,892
Tomita here.

45
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:03,725
I'm with Kuribayashi
at the top of the tower.

46
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:12,925
Don't advance
too far.

47
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:15,058
We will attack with
the Special Forces...

48
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:16,425
and 4th Recon Unit.

49
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:18,492
Soldier:
Let's go!

50
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,325
The enemy has
reached the west gate.

51
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:20,858
Ahh!

52
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,792
Side gate is clear.

53
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:37,892
Soldiers:
Ahhh!

54
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:44,258
(death screams)

55
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:47,725
Kuwabara:
Status!

56
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:48,425
Nishina:
Clear!

57
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:49,125
Katsumoto:
Clear!

58
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:49,825
Kurata:
Clear!

59
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:51,658
Kuwabara:
Room is clear!

60
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:54,292
(chuckles)

61
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:56,625
I'll leave the rest to you guys.

62
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,925
Soldier:
Six minutes before jump!

63
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,225
Ready?! Let's go!

64
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:05,725
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!

65
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:06,192
Superior:
What?

66
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:07,192
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!

67
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,858
Stand up!

68
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:16,692
Radio:
Convoy No.1. The course
is clear. Ready! Ready! Ready!

69
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,925
Jump away!

70
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:19,458
We're green!

71
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:22,258
Superior:
Go, go, go!

72
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,925
Go, go, go, go!

73
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:38,925
That's about it.
Line's clear!

74
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:40,992
See you when
it's over!

75
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,225
Aah!

76
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:57,725
Ah!

77
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,358
Zorzal:
What are those?!

78
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:00,325
Your Highness!

79
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:04,325
That is the enemy!
They're raining down
from the sky!

80
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:06,992
Look at 'em all!

81
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:09,992
My Prince! We must
prepare a counterattack!

82
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:11,258
Ah...

83
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:12,158
Your Highness!

84
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:12,658
Uh...

85
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:15,558
Yes you're right!
We can defeat them!

86
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:18,158
We have a higher number
of men than they do.

87
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:20,625
We should be able
to overpower their forces.

88
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:21,358
Reporting sir!

89
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,225
An enemy unit has already
taken over the west gate!

90
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:26,292
And there are several
more enemy soldiers

91
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:27,725
waiting on the
other side.

92
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:31,025
Argh! We are not
ready for this!

93
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,092
Huh?

94
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:36,792
Damn it, what in the hell
are the guards doing over there?

95
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:38,725
They're going to come
looking for us, sire!

96
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:41,958
(frightened groans)

97
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:49,492
Your Highness.

98
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,592
I sincerely hope you're
not thinking about

99
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:53,625
running away from
your throne.

100
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:55,625
What? No no of
course not!

101
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:58,758
You are the all powerful
ruler of the Empire.

102
00:06:58,858 --> 00:06:59,792
If you were to flee,

103
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:02,192
the Empire would forever
be lost to the hands

104
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:03,458
of foreign intruders.

105
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:05,792
(growls)

106
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,492
Hmph! You needn't
worry about that.

107
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,192
They will never
take it from me.

108
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:11,025
Very well.

109
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,225
It pleases me to hear that
you're going to remain here.

110
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:17,125
Even if the enemy were
to breach the Palace,

111
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:19,825
I know that you would be brave
and fight back.

112
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,358
Because you proudly
stand for everything

113
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,292
that this country
represents!

114
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:26,325
How you go,
so goes the Empire.

115
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:26,758
Ah...

116
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:29,458
I know! I am well aware
of my position!

117
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:32,725
I'm sorry... if I was
being out of line.

118
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:35,992
I am certain that you will
make the right decision.

119
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:45,792
Radio:
Landing coordinates
are three‐one‐zero.

120
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:47,358
Landing zone "Sakura."

121
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,058
Wind direction
is three‐zero.

122
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:53,925
(death screams)

123
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:58,058
Emperial Soldiers:
(battle cry)

124
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,458
Assassin here.
A large number of enemy soldiers
are approaching the west gate.

125
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:04,825
Assassin:
This is not good!

126
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:07,658
What do you see?

127
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:09,592
They're down there
by the corner.

128
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,092
Let's move out!

129
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:16,958
Recon 1:
There's a large
number of soldiers

130
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:18,658
waiting to cross the bridge.

131
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:21,692
Recon 2:
I see it. It's gonna be
trouble if they cross.

132
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,425
(helicopter overhead)

133
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:25,192
Ah. Here they are.

134
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:33,958
Ok, We'll take
over from here!

135
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:34,392
Roger that!

136
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:37,358
Good luck, we're gonna
get the evacuees to safety!

137
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:47,758
This is three‐one. I can see the
enemy unit at Bassoon Prison.

138
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:49,825
Look to be moving towards
the Palace. Over.

139
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:51,925
Radio:
Four‐zero, roger.

140
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,458
What're they doing?

141
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:57,325
Why aren't they making
any moves this way?

142
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:58,792
Ah! They're here!

143
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:01,592
Go straight ahead.
Jade Palace in two miles.

144
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:03,725
Right, copy, that!

145
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:12,258
Unit Leader:
Confirming the target!

146
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:15,925
Shino:
Don't push! Follow
the person in front of you!

147
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:18,925
Listen there is enough
transportation for everyone.

148
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,358
There's no need to worry!

149
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,092
I don't get it,

150
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:24,425
why can't we just leave
all the nobles behind?

151
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:26,525
Oh you know
better than that.

152
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,592
The men‐in‐green have provided
everyone here with so much.

153
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:33,958
I would say it is time we
repay them for their kindness.

154
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:36,725
Misery:
And we do that
with kindness ourselves.

155
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,058
Oh hey there
Mrs. Cicero!

156
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:39,925
Kuribayashi.

157
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:41,625
I can't tell you
how happy I am

158
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:42,758
to see you here!

159
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:43,258
Oh thank you so much!

160
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:44,158
Ahhh... Alrighty then.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
Oh thank you so much!

161
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:47,192
Ahhh... Alrighty then.
I'm just doing what I'm told.

162
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:47,792
Ma'am?

163
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,576
Oh?

164
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:50,509
Would your husband
happen to be with you?

165
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:53,909
Yes. He's right
over there, dear.

166
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,076
I know the SDF has our best
interests at heart...

167
00:09:57,176 --> 00:10:01,009
But judging by the looks
of the current situation ‐

168
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:05,109
Are you taking us over?
Has the empire been defeated?

169
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:07,676
No, ma'am. ,/
All we've been ordered to do
is see to your rescue

170
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:10,143
and provide safe passage
out of the area.

171
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,243
We're taking all of you
to Italica!

172
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:14,343
Climb in and make room
for everyone.

173
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:16,009
We have a lot of
people to fit in.

174
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:17,609
We'll be leaving
very shortly.

175
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,843
We'll use the
west gate exit.

176
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:21,809
(horses whinny)

177
00:10:25,443 --> 00:10:27,576
(screaming)

178
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,543
Itami, please
be careful!

179
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:32,776
Do you honestly
need to drive so fast?

180
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,376
You're scaring
us, Daddy!

181
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:37,409
You need to stop driving
so fast slow down!

182
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:38,843
Yao:
Itami!

183
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:40,376
No!

184
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:48,343
Nobody... is going
to die on my watch!

185
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:00,467
Reporting sir!

186
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:01,833
The 401st Company...

187
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,033
has secured
the landing point.

188
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:04,833
We're all green
and good to go.

189
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,833
Airborne 12th Company
has taken over all routes

190
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,967
to the Capital.
The road is clear.

191
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,767
All units have begun
evacuating the civilians.

192
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:14,267
Everything is going
according to plan.

193
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:17,533
The Airborne 11th Company should
be arriving at Jade Palace

194
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:19,700
just about
any moment now.

195
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:22,767
Grr...

196
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:35,767
(long breath)

197
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,900
(death screams)

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,133
Fan out to the right.

199
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:45,367
Our targets are the
officers wearing black.

200
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:49,167
Take them out and the
rest of their soldiers
will be in disaray.

201
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:52,900
We will provide any needed
support. Now fire away!

202
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,167
(battle grunt)

203
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,367
(death rattles)

204
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,233
The commander is really
getting into this.

205
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,167
Yeah well it's our first real
battle in the Special Region.

206
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,033
Just about everyone
out here's excited.

207
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,900
Unit Leader:
Get down!

208
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,933
Gah! Uhh...

209
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:13,167
Shit! Medic! Medic!
I need some help over here!

210
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:14,000
Calm down!

211
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,400
Keep him still,
and do not remove that arrow!

212
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,600
Unit Leader:
He'll have massive bleeding,
if you just yank it out.

213
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,767
(battle cries)

214
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,300
Keep firing men!

215
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,100
We can't let them
break through the barrier!

216
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:30,800
(death screams)

217
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,300
(screaming continues)

218
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,167
(cowarding pant)

219
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,367
Unit Leader:
Well done, men!
Excellent job!

220
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:46,300
(panicked panting)

221
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,333
You're not getting away from me!

222
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,267
Boses!

223
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:53,300
(panic intensifies)

224
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,933
Burn in Hell!

225
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:57,600
Ruflus:
(echoing death scream)

226
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,067
Radio:
Jade Palace is now secure.
Send in the last order. Over.

227
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:07,667
Huh?

228
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,967
You're gonna
be okay!

229
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,633
Radio:
Located the VIPs.

230
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13,533
They're all safe
and accounted for!

231
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,667
Jade Palace is
under our control!

232
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:18,600
Roger. All units,
damage report.

233
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,233
Remain on
high alert. Over!

234
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:21,867
Radio 1:
Roger.

235
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,067
Radio 2:
Roger.

236
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,000
Shirayuri:
Welcome gentlemen
we're glad you came.

237
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,133
Kengun:
We will begin an
evacuation immediately.

238
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:30,433
Miss Vice Minister,
do you have anything
you're bringing with you?

239
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,100
No thank you
I'm fine.

240
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,867
Good to see you again,
Colonel Kengun.

241
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:37,533
It's good to see you, too.
You look well.

242
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:38,033
(clears throat)

243
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,133
All of the civilians
are on route.

244
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,433
The entire Capital
will be cleared.

245
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:43,967
You will need to have safe
passage.

246
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,333
Have you secured
yourself a way out?

247
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:47,133
I have.

248
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,167
Then I have a favor
to ask of you.

249
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:50,567
Oh?

250
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:53,567
I would like...
the Order of the Rose...

251
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,400
to accompany you
out of the city.

252
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,733
Uh... I guess that's ok.

253
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,700
Once we are clear
of the area...

254
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,033
We go to the lands
of Count Folmar.

255
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,233
Understood.

256
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,400
And another thing.

257
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
We have a lot
of wounded soldiers.

258
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,900
They're in need of help.

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,767
And with our
limited resources...

260
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,600
We will have to
leave them here.

261
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,967
And it looks like they
won't be able to move
on their own, either.

262
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:22,600
Those men
are soldiers.

263
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,267
We will take them with us.
As if they're our own. ,/
You're a good man...
Colonel.

264
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:24,767
Huh?

265
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:27,033
Uh... I have
an idea sir.

266
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,600
I think maybe we can get
them out on the Chinooks.

267
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,633
Kengun:
Not bad. We'll transfer people
with serious injuries by air,

268
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:36,100
and the ones with
light injuries by land.

269
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,300
Soldier:
Sir! We're ready
for the transfer!

270
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,100
Everything will be fine.

271
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,333
If we hurry, we'll be able to
just make the rendezvous point.

272
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:46,933
Good. Well then...

273
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,033
I wish you
the best of luck.

274
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:49,867
Wait what?

275
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:52,133
Okay Vifita!
I leave the rest to you!

276
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:55,433
Where are you going?!
And what do you mean
"the rest"?!

277
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:57,933
I am off to rescue
Princess Piña.

278
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:00,900
I can't leave her!
I'll be back!

279
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,033
Hmm!

280
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,467
What! Are you crazy?!
You cannot do this alone!

281
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,267
Yah!
(panting)

282
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:09,967
Hmph... What the hell do you
think you're doing, you idiot?!

283
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,900
Boses, wait!

284
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,133
Uhhh...

285
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:19,667
Vifita:
We'll be back! Wait for us
at the rendezvous point!

286
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:23,400
Uhh... What...
just happened...?

287
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:27,233
Helm:
Reporting.

288
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,567
The dragon knights' camp has
been completely destroyed.

289
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:31,133
There were no survivors.

290
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:34,200
Kalasta:
Every last one of the
Opri‐chi‐nya member
has been killed.

291
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,767
And Ruflus was part
of the deceased!

292
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:39,500
Tch. What purpose
did they serve?

293
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,500
So Thule!

294
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,467
Yes, sire?

295
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,233
I need you.
I need some ideas.

296
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:47,167
Your Highness. You cannot allow
our enemies to go unpunished.

297
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:49,633
Gather all of your
remaining royal soldiers...

298
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,400
and send them to take
down Jade Palace.

299
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,167
Yes of course.

300
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:57,633
Send the soldiers
to Jade Palace right away!

301
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:00,067
I'm sorry...
But that's impossible.

302
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,133
Your guards are already on their
way to the Imperial Palace.

303
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:06,367
If we were to give them
a conflicting order
at this point...

304
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:07,767
It would cause
mass confusion.

305
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,033
Shut your mouth, shut up!

306
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,467
Yes, please
forgive us sir!

307
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:15,600
Look. If you can't
move the soldiers
that are already on route,

308
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,833
Then send the ones
that are already here.

309
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,100
Zorzal:
Have them move
out immediately!

310
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,433
Sir!
Sir!

311
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:30,833
Oh!

312
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:34,300
Oh! Marquis Casel,
it's you!

313
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
You're alive!

314
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,533
Mercifully we managed
to escape to Jade Palace.

315
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,300
But it was close.

316
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,567
What happened to all
those who were captured?

317
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,133
Well those who stayed quiet
are still alive,

318
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:48,333
but the ones who spoke out ‐
not so lucky...

319
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Just as I had feared...

320
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,733
My debt is paid.
Thanks, JSDF.

321
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,733
You on the horse!
Stop right there!

322
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,367
I am acting
commander, Boses.

323
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,833
Here on behalf of
the Order of the Rose.

324
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,267
I demand to see
Princess Pina right now!

325
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,000
That woman
is a traitor!

326
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,133
She's not allowed
in the palace!

327
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:42,500
Boses!

328
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,200
(battle cries)

329
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,567
Vifita:
Come on!

330
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:46,500
Princess Piña!

331
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,033
Vifita:
Get up!

332
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:52,100
Princess Pina!

333
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,933
Boses:
(crying)

334
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:58,133
If you die, it will all be for
nothing! We have to go back!

335
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,733
That should just about do it
for all the civilians!

336
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,967
Job well done.
We're the last ones here!

337
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,333
Good. It's time.

338
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:16,833
Move out!

339
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,733
Why are we still here, sir,
why haven't we left yet?

340
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,667
I have no idea, soldier.

341
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:30,600
But I'm sure the
Colonel must have a plan.

342
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,767
(growls)

343
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:36,267
Soldier 1:
Yeah... but still...

344
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,733
Soldier 2:
An enormous cavalry
is approaching!

345
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,333
Dammit! This doesn't
look good!

346
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:49,433
Kengun:
Prepare to fire!

347
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:52,100
Target the leading pack
of the chasing cavalry!

348
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,600
Distance, 200 meters!
Short, quick bursts!

349
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,100
Do NOT hit the girls
in front! Fire!

350
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,667
Fire!

351
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,333
(death screams)

352
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:07,433
Kengun:
Keep firing! Step back
to the second line!

353
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,100
(battle cries)

354
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,667
I gotcha.

355
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,000
Mooove! Don't leave
anyone behind!

356
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,933
Everybody hop on!

357
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,933
(exerts force)

358
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:37,833
Argh!

359
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:40,833
Everybody's on!
Get moving!

360
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,900
(angry yelling)

361
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:52,867
We almost didn't
make it, guys.

362
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:55,133
We did cut it
pretty close.

363
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:58,067
Uh... excuse me

364
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:00,767
Excuse me!

365
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,733
Oh... I'm sorry miss.
I'll uh put you down.

366
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,267
Princess Pina!

367
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:11,067
Colonel Kengun!
You must help the princess!

368
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,367
I am very sorry.

369
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:16,200
But I fear there is nothing
we can really do at the moment.

370
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,333
(gasps)

371
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,267
But, that can't be...

372
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,233
Boses:
Princess!

373
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,167
(sobbing)

374
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:29,200
Princess!

375
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:35,867
Where's Itami?
He could get it done.

376
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,600
Helm:
The enemy soldiers
have rescued all the
pro‐peace representatives

377
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,933
held at Bassoon Prison.

378
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,733
They recruited the people
of Trouble Town to help,

379
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,167
and got them out of
the Imperial Capital.

380
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:55,233
The losses to our forces
are catastrophic.

381
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,133
I'm very sorry,
your Highness.

382
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,333
Now Thule...

383
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,233
Yes?

384
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,100
I've got to come up
with a way to fix this.

385
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,033
It's quite simple.

386
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,067
You'll inform the
remaining citizens,

387
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,267
that your Imperial Army
has repelled Japan.

388
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:15,233
You mustn't let them know...
that this was a defeat.

389
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,467
(seething)

390
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,300
But be sure. This will not be
the last time we see of them.

391
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,000
I know this ‐ Because we have,
in our possession,

392
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,967
the very key to
controlling the peace
talks to however we see fit.

393
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:36,967
Pina:
(pounding door)
(crying)

394
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:41,733
Someone please!
Let me out of here!

395
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,400
I can't stay here any longer!

396
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:51,967
Is anyone here?!
Answer me!

397
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,200
Say something!

398
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,800
Please... Someone...

399
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:04,367
Pina:
Help me...

400
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:49,667
Lelei:
Next time on Gate:
Thus They Fought
