00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,333
[YOJI] You wanna keep on arguing
with me?

82
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,700
Or do you wanna keep these
people from dying?

83
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,133

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,766
What's that...
reinforcements are coming.

96
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,433

[GENERAL] It's just a relief to
see, my friend.

101
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:23,366
Knowing we have
a few things in common.

102
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:27,766
[GENERAL] Honestly... when we
decided to come to this world...

103
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:31,233
I had no idea what we
would find here.

104
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,766
[SWATGUY] Contact ahead!

105
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,533

in the face of an emergency of
such ferocity and magnitude...

120
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,933
His response was immediate...

121
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:29,133
without any regard for his own
life and safety.

122

You know I didn't get one damn
plushie that day.

147

148
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:15,466
[KURATA] You did just get
promoted, didn't ya?

149
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:18,200
I'm not sure you have a whole
lot to complain about dude.

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,366
[YOJI] Yeah well I didn't ask

[KURATA] OK... so you
don't wanna be here?

152
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,800
[YOJI] Bingo... I just took this
job so I could keep up with my
hobbies.

153
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,466
[YOJI] And if someone asks me to
make some sorta choice...
(slurp)

154
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:34,933
[YOJI] It's the otaku life for
me...

155
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:37,566
[KURATA] Heh. OK... how about
this?

156
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,233
[YOJI] Hmm?

157
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,533
[KURATA] I know I didn't mention
this before...

158
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:45,300
[KURATA] But I... I was there at
the comics convention.

159
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,500
[YOJI] ERK! (inhale) Are you
serious?!

160
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,033
[KURATA] Yeah... But... since
you did all the hero stuff and
all...

161
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,533
I didn't know how to bring it
up.

162
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:57,133
[YOJI] How did you make out?!
What did you buy, man?!

163
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:59,000
[YOJI] You gotta come by my
place!

164
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,600
[KURATA] Whoa! Wait a minute,
sir!

165
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,200
[YOJI] What are you afraid of?
We're both fanboys aren't we?!

166
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,233
[TOMITA] Thank you for this
wonderful meal. Uh...?

167
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,300
[YOJI] My place! Twenty‐hundred!

168
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,266
It'll be fun, Kurata, okay?!

169
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,000
[KURATA] (squicked out)

170
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,166
[YOJI] Come on Kurata!
What the heck is your problem?

171
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:18,700
[KURATA] Look sir I'm flattered
but I'm really not interested.
[YOJI] Wait, what?!

172
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,300
[KURATA] Look! I'm into girls,
okay, Lieutenant?!

173
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
[YOJI] Whoa no no. Hold on a
second! I think you're totally
misunderstanding me here!

174
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,300
[KURATA] It's okay!
It's just not me!

175
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,033
[TOMITA] Looks fun to me.

176
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:29,366
[YOJI] Huhhh? What's this?

177
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:32,366
[TOMITA] Yes.
Combat uniform four,

178
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:33,900
freshly arrived from the
quartermaster.

179
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,200
Ever since the advance
recon unit went in...

180
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,366
Everybody in the SDF is gonna
have them.

181
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:40,266
[TOMITA] It's just a matter of
time...

182
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:44,133
budget cuts to the
defense ministry are
slowing down the rollout.

183
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,933
[YOJI] Huh... Hm?

184
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:51,266
So why the hell did our unit
get them instead of everyone
else?

185
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,700
[KURATA] Well I suppose...

186
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,033
it has to do with all that stuff
you did Lieutenant.

187
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:57,600
[YOJI] Come on, what is THAT
supposed to mean?

188
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,266
[TOMITA] You know... all of your
well documented heroics.

189
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:00,866
[YOJI] Ugh. Why would that
matter?

190
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:05,666
Well sir... I'm guessing some
of your actions in the past...

191
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:07,666
made us the "go‐to" unit.

192
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:12,233
[HOJO] This region isn't on a
map.

193
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,966
It is truly, a great
unknown to us.

194
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,133
We don't know... what anything's
like there...

195
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:18,866
neither the land
nor the people...

196
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:21,766
Nevertheless we must
learn what we can.

197
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,066
[HOJO] During the incident,

198
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,000
we captured several of the
perpetrators.

199
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,233
[HOJO] For now... we've charged
these individuals with breaking
the law...

200
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:33,100
as we would with any criminal or
terrorist operator.

201
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,266
[HOJO] It would seem destroying

202
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:35,766
the opening isn't the answer.

203
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:37,100
For all we know there is a
danger

204
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,100
of another gate opening
up somewhere else

205
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,800
if we attempt to shut this one
down.

206
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,466
[HOJO] So for now...
We've decided...

207
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:48,566
to treat this "Special Region"
as if it were part of Japan
itself.

208
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,033
[HOJO] We are going to make
every effort

209
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,700
to learn about the
other side.

210
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,033
We must get the members of the
governments there

211
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,933
who brought the fight to our
soil

212
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,000
to sit at the negotiating
table with us.

213
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,533
[HOJO] And even though there's
a great risk in this
undertaking...

214
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:08,300
[HOJO] We, the Japanese
Government, have determined that
we must search the area,

215
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,266
arrest the person who
masterminded this invasion that
resulted in the Ginza Incident,

216
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:17,000
and demand compensation
for the damages.

217
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,900
[HOJO] Therefore, we are
authorizing

218
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,066
a deployment of the
Self‐Defense Forces to the other
side!

219
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:38,000
[YOJI] (sigh) Do I get a day off
first? There's something I need
to do...

220
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:48,100
[DIRRELL] The United States...
is prepared to assist Japan
during their expedition through
the portal...

221
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,300
in this we are resolute.

222
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,200
We will gladly provide
any men, materials and

223
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,400
intelligence resources to
support this endeavor.

224
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:13,100
[woman crying]

225
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,324
[MOTOI] Thanks to the efforts of
former Prime Minister Hojo

226
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:18,991
and much multipartisan
support

227
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:23,057
[MOTOI] This action is finally
authorized... and ready to
begin.

228
00:18:23,157 --> 00:18:27,424
You carry all the hopes and
dreams of our people with you.

229
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,591
[MOTOI] Members of the defense
force...

230
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:34,357
Serve us with distinction...
we shall expect nothing less of
you.

231
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:39,457
[HAZAMA] Soldiers, I am
Lieutenant General Hazama!

232
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:43,157
[HAZAMA] Several missions have
scouted the Region over the last
4 weeks.

233
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:45,191
[HAZAMA] So far, all of them
have returned safely...

234
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,257
but we still don't know what
we're facing.

235
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,557
[HAZAMA] Therefore, I
suggest you all get ready

236
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:51,557
for the possibility
of a fire‐fight

237
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:53,724
the moment you reach the other
side.

238
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:09,224
[HAZAMA] We're moving out
shortly. Stand by.

239
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:17,657
[SOLDIER] Kick the tires and
light the fires, people!

240
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,224
Stay buttoned up and watch your
vision blocks

241
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:22,224
like your life
depended on it!

242
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,791
[CAPTAIN] Move out!

243
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:20,357
[YANAGIDA] General. Our
spearhead....

244
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:22,257
is currently on
their way through...

245
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:23,391
the rest are following,

246
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:24,224
but we don't really
understand...

247
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,757
[HAZAMA] I know.

248
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,991
I told them to be ready for
a fight when they get there...

249
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:31,257
That thing's a bottleneck so we
just have to deal with it.

250
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:58,191
[KURATA] Hey... you got a sec?
[YOJI] Hmm?

251
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,357
[KURATA] I hear there's
catgirls and stuff over there...

252
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:02,624
you think that's true?

253
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,791
[YOJI] Huh... Well hell, why
wouldn't there be?

254
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:13,257
[LELEI] Thus... it begins.

255
00:21:17,924 --> 00:21:20,124
[LELEI] ...the story of two
worlds...

256
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:23,624
...mysteriously
connected to one another.

257
00:21:43,857 --> 00:21:45,857
[GUNNER] We've got contact!

258
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:59,224
[LELEI] Between the two worlds
rests a single path,

259
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:01,524
tying them together...

260
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:05,691
...that path...came to be
known...

261
00:22:07,557 --> 00:22:11,891
[LELEI] As... "The Gate."

262
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:48,591
[LELEI] Next time on "GATE:" Two
Forces.
