1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:01,844
(tremulous) (apprehensive)

2
00:00:01,844 --> 00:00:03,777
(giggle) [RORY] So tell me...

3
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:04,744
am I a child?

4
00:00:04,844 --> 00:00:05,444
(fighting temptation)

5
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:06,544
(giggles)

6
00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:08,477
(inhale/exhale)

7
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,744
(ring tone)

8
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:12,910
[RORY] Uhhhh?

9
00:00:15,177 --> 00:00:16,510
(surprised)

10
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:19,210
[RORY] What is that thing?

11
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,510
[YOJI] Oh uh, well...

12
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,544
[YOJI] This is called a cellular
telephone...

13
00:00:23,644 --> 00:00:26,610
And it happens to be a device to
contact me with important
matters.

14
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,677
[RORY] It is a rude and useless
piece of trash...

15
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:30,744
that obviously doesn't know its
place.

16
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:33,177
[YOJI] Eheheh

17
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:38,544
[YOJI] Huh? Not good...

18
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:50,477
(gasp)

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,077
(crunch)

20
00:01:07,177 --> 00:01:08,844
(slurp)

21
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,810
[RORY] Hello, boys...

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,177
Didn't anyone ever tell you that
it's dangerous to play in the
middle of the night?

23
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:15,610
(giggles)

24
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,277
(giggle/gasp)

25
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:53,777
(giggles)

26
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,177
(slashed)

27
00:02:58,277 --> 00:02:59,710
(giggles)

28
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:01,644
(slashed)

29
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:02,877
(giggles)

30
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:04,610
(hit)

31
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:17,877
(ricochets)

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,177
[RADIOGUY] What happened?!
What's going on?

33
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:31,977
(slashed)

34
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:33,410
(slashed)

35
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:36,010
(heaving for breath)

36
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,210
[CHUCK] The mission... failed.

37
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,077
Aahhh... the mission has failed.

38
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:41,377
[RADIOGUY] What the hell
happened?

39
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:43,277
Did the Japanese attack you?

40
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:44,177
[CHUCK] No sir.

41
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:47,577
It's crazy out here...

42
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:51,144
[CHUCK] Special ops...from other
countries...

43
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:52,744
and something else...

44
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,777
[CHUCK] There was a girl... in a
kimono...

45
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:01,777
[RADIOGUY] What was that? Say
again! Say again!

46
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,044
[YOJI] On the floor!

47
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:08,010
[SHINO] And do not get up!

48
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,410
(breath catch)

49
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:14,010
[YOJI] Damn it! I can't get
a good look at what's going on.

50
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,544
(aggressive sound)

51
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:25,610
[ROGER] These guys are goddamn
MSS, man!

52
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,244
[HEIDEGGER]
What it looks like to me...

53
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:29,244
they want the same thing we do.

54
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:30,344
[ROGER] So what now!

55
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:32,277
(giggle)

56
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,544
(giggles) (gasp/swing)

57
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,910
(slashed)

58
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:40,177
(giggle)

59
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:41,177
(breath catch)

60
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:42,510
[HEIDEGGER] You bitch!

61
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:46,644
(giggles)
(ricochets)

62
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,710
[HEIDEGGER] Aagh! Damn it! Damn
it! Damn it!

63
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,244
[HEIDEGGER] Aaaahh!!!

64
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:06,610
(gasping for air)

65
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:10,644
[HEIDEGGER] Fuck me...

66
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:26,944
[YOJI] Holy shit...

67
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:28,977
[SOLDIER] Group Alpha's gone
silent, sir.

68
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:31,044
[SOLDIER] The Unconfirmed
sources are gone

69
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:33,444
all except for Target Black.

70
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:34,944
[SOLDIER] Heat sources ‐
negative.

71
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,844
[KANO] And the girl in black...

72
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:39,044
she said she was a demigod.

73
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:40,344
[RYUZAKI] We need Action Three.

74
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:42,677
Get me in touch with the Bureau
right away.

75
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:49,177
[RISA] Ehhhhhh!!!! What...
the... hell happened here.

76
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:51,010
[TOMITA] A massacre... that's
what.

77
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,277
[YOJI] We're gonna be surrounded

78
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:53,644
by a bunch of Public Security
goons soon,

79
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,544
we should get out of here.
[RISA] Sounds good!

80
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,010
I want you to collect
all the weapons that're
still serviceable

81
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,044
and get everyone's bags back
together.

82
00:05:58,144 --> 00:05:59,977
You got it?!

83
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:01,510
[BOTH] Roger!

84
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,210
[SHINO] I need the two of you
back in your street clothes

85
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,277
as soon as you can get changed.

86
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:06,277
[PINA] Uh‐Understood.

87
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,077
[RORY] Don't worry about me.
Bullets are cute and all

88
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:21,344
but they don't do me a lot of
harm.

89
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:24,244
[RORY] Demigods don't like
dying.

90
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,810
In fact. We can't die.

91
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,177
[TOMITA] Jesus... all we've been
doing is running away lately.

92
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:40,677
[YOJI] So much for our good time
I guess.

93
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,677
[SHINO] We should be counting
our blessings

94
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,210
that the hotel is in the SDF
pension network.

95
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,977
Or we might have had an early
retirement

96
00:06:47,077 --> 00:06:47,910
thanks to those assholes.

97
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,810
(nasal exhale)

98
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,810
[YOJI] Got that right

99
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,210
(notice)

100
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,877
[TOMITA] Sir... the van up
ahead.

101
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,577
[YOJI] Hey, there buddy...

102
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:01,010
sorry but we're gonna need to
borrow your ride.

103
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,144
[SHINO] Okay so...
I can shoot him if he's one of
the bad guys can't I?

104
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:07,477
[TOMITA] We both know you don't
wanna do that... are you still
drunk or something?

105
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,144
[SHINO] What else are we gonna
do with him?

106
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:11,344
[SHINO] I was thinking of
beating on his face

107
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:12,444
until he passes out.

108
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:13,977
But that'd probably kill him
too.

109
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,610
[YOJI] Yeah, see that would be
bad.

110
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,010
[LELEI] Um Itami... you're
wanting to stop him,

111
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,377
without killing him, correct?

112
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:20,710
[YOJI] Huh? That's right...

113
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,810
(snoozies)

114
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,644
[YOJI] You know... We shouldn't
go straight to Ginza.

115
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,610
They're gonna be waiting
to jump us.

116
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,877
[TOMITA] I dunno... maybe it'd
be better

117
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:39,010
if we just went straight back
through the Gate instead of
staying here.

118
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,844
[SHINO] Ugghhh...
You wanna head back to a war
zone, so we can be more safe?

119
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,177
[YOJI] Huh?
[LELEI] The Princess wants
to ask you something.

120
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:49,177
What's the point in all this
running around

121
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:51,777
when you're supposed to be our
security detachment?

122
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:53,044
(exhale)

123
00:07:53,144 --> 00:07:54,210
[SHINO] She's got a point!

124
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,777
Why're we running? What're we
doing?

125
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,944
(exhale)

126
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:01,044
[SHINO] Um Lieutenant! What's
the deal?

127
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:03,544
We're trained to be the brave
ones remember!

128
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:05,244
Lieutenant!

129
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:08,344
[YOJI] Mph... Well, the truth
is...

130
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,910
(breath catch)

131
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,177
(nasal exhale)

132
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:16,610
[YOJI] I have no idea okay!

133
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,744
[ALL] What the hell?!

134
00:08:18,844 --> 00:08:21,277
[YOJI] Wahhhhhh!!!! Hang on a
second, will ya?!
Just lemme explain!

135
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,710
[SHINO] I am going to kill you!
You're just winging it!

136
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,577
[TOMITA] Hey. You are still
drunk aren't you?
[SHINO] I wish I was!

137
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:30,744
[PINA] Hang on...
I think I'm starting to
understand the situation here.

138
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,610
[PINA] But first, let me ask‐

139
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,044
Am I going to be used as a
political hostage?

140
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:37,110
[YOJI] Course not. That's not
why we're here.

141
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,910
[PINA] I wish to believe you,
Lieutenant...

142
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,277
but we've had far too many
transportation changes in the
last few days.

143
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:43,544
[PINA] And the hotel...?

144
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:46,044
It would seem someone is out to
get us...

145
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:47,777
and I am in no rush to go with
them.

146
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:50,744
[PINA] We came here to mediate
negotiations.

147
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:52,810
Between Japan and the Empire.

148
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,577
Because that needs to happen.

149
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:56,344
[PINA] But out there... are
people who think

150
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:58,810
you will be benefitting too much
from this negotiation...

151
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,477
and they want a say in it.

152
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:02,744
[PINA] Do you understand?

153
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,344
[DIRRELL] What... are you
telling me?

154
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:10,544
We ended up losing one of our
bargaining chips,

155
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,644
as well as a special ops team in
the process?!

156
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:14,310
[DIRRELL] And if that wasn't
enough,

157
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,310
we also managed to lose our
diplomatic guests!

158
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,444
[GRAHAM] From what the report
said Mr. President,

159
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:20,777
our team ran into hostile forces
from other countries.

160
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:23,810
[DIRRELL] Do you think I wanna
hear that bullshit?

161
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,677
Get your act together, Graham!

162
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:29,244
[GRAHAM] Yes, sir.
We'll do what we can to bring
them to Washington...

163
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:31,144
[GRAHAM] Count on it.

164
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,577
[LELEI] Whoooa. It's warm.

165
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,244
[TUKA] And all we had to do was
push a button!

166
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:42,210
[RORY] How does it work, anyway?

167
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,844
[LELEI] I don't know...
But the SDF had a bunch of
machines like this at the base.

168
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:54,777
[RISA] A fairy from the forest
and a black demigod and a cute
little magic‐user...

169
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:56,910
[RISA] Which one are you into?

170
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,244
[RISA] Thinking you'd like the
elf because she's got the looks
and the legs.
[YOJI] Guilty.

171
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:03,277
[RISA] But you'd like the goth
lolita for her personality.
[YOJI] That's true.

172
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:07,277
[RISA] Then again the magic user
with the hair brings out your
protective side.

173
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:08,977
[YOJI] Once again you've proven
you know me.

174
00:10:09,077 --> 00:10:11,210
[RISA] Haven't changed since
middle school, have ya! You dog.

175
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,210
[YOJI] Ouch!

176
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:18,077
[RISA] Guess who's back...!

177
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:19,410
[TUKA] Here. This is for you...

178
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,844
[SHINO] Aw... You're so sweet.

179
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:24,577
[RISA] Uh... soup?
So what did you get this for?

180
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:26,644
[TUKA] I picked the one that
looked the yummiest.

181
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:29,910
D'I do it right?
[RISA] It does look
delicious but geez.

182
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,777
[LELEI] And, these are for you.

183
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:33,844
[PINA] Oh... thanks.

184
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:39,644
[YOJI] Hey, so... D'you get me
anything or...? No?

185
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:41,910
[RISA] What did you do to piss
her off?

186
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,710
[YOJI] It's more like what I
didn't do.

187
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,444
[RISA] Here's the deal. At two
o'clock, we've got Itami,

188
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:53,144
Tuka and Lelei offering flowers
for the fallen from Ginza.

189
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:57,410
And after that, they'll be going
back to the Special Region...
There!

190
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,677
[RISA] Good! People're talking!

191
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:02,544
[SHINO] I don't remember
something like this
being on the schedule!

192
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:05,844
[YOJI] There's been slight
a change to our itinerary.

193
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:07,177
So, they're talking now.

194
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:08,144
How many of 'em?

195
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:09,544
[RISA] A whole lot of 'em!

196
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:11,310
Not to mention the video from
the summons meeting

197
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,610
is getting views from all over!

198
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,310
[RISA] If it works out the way
we want it to,

199
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,877
I'm betting that you're gonna
have a crowd of

200
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:18,277
at least a thousand people there
for the offering.

201
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,410
[YOJI] That'd be perfect!

202
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,610
With a crowd like that in the
way,

203
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,177
the agents will have a hell of a
time

204
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:23,677
getting anywhere close to us.

205
00:11:23,777 --> 00:11:25,877
[RISA] I'll keep on posting for
the next couple of hours

206
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,310
to get as many out there
as we can.

207
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,244
[YOJI] Thank you for helping
us out with this Risa.

208
00:11:31,944 --> 00:11:33,544
We're coming up on dawn.

209
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:35,577
(nasal exhale)

210
00:11:35,677 --> 00:11:38,510
[YOJI] Hopefully this will all
be over today.

211
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,744
I'm getting tired of all this
cat and mouse nonsense.

212
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:54,956
[ANCHOR] Earlier this morning,
Prime Minister Motoi was taken

213
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:57,089
to the emergency room with an
undisclosed ailment.

214
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:59,623
The sudden announcement of his
resignation

215
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:02,589
is being received in various
measures of shock.

216
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,356
Opposition parties are
criticizing his resignation,

217
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:07,023
stating it as an irresponsible
ploy.

218
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:09,189
[NANAMI] Uh... 'Scuse me!
[GALS] Huh?

219
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:12,223
[NANAMI] Um the Prime Minister
got kinda sick...

220
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:13,489
and like he quit...

221
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:15,556
I mean that's totally crazy
right?

222
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:17,523
[GAL] What? The Prime Minister
quit?

223
00:12:17,623 --> 00:12:19,523
[GAL] Weird... why'd he do that?

224
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:20,989
[MAN] Pretty expected though
right?

225
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,089
[WOMAN] Whatever, politics are
such a yawner.

226
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:25,123
(whimpery thingy)

227
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:27,556
[CAMERA] You need to stop acting

228
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:28,889
like you're afraid of that
microphone

229
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:30,656
and start getting some freakin'
quotes okay?

230
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:31,989
[NANAMI] Yeah I'm sorry.

231
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:34,423
[CAMERA] Go talk to people,
get some comments,

232
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:36,256
stir the pot,
do your stupid job!

233
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,923
[NANAMI] ERK! You're right!

234
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,789
(beleaguered)

235
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:43,556
[NANAMI] It's... It's just my
first time on something so big!

236
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:44,589
(groan)

237
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:45,823
(chatter picks back up)

238
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:49,023
[CAMERA] Huh? What's going on?

239
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:52,589
[NANAMI] I'm not sure... but
that's a huge crowd.

240
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:55,523
(chatter)

241
00:13:04,356 --> 00:13:07,356
[GRAHAM] All right it looks like
everyone's in position here.

242
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:08,789
If they make it past the
station,

243
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,689
it's gonna be hard to do
anything.

244
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,723
[GRAHAM] We've got to find a way
to get 'em before that.

245
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:15,489
[AGENT] Yeah well that's not
all, sir.

246
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,356
We're not the only ones who're
looking for 'em.

247
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:20,289
[GRAHAM] This mission's been a
huge mess.

248
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,423
The Hakone strike team was wiped
out.

249
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:24,756
And once the Japanese Prime
Minister resigned,

250
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:27,123
we lost any political advantage
we had.

251
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:33,023
[GRAHAM] So now...
looks like we're gonna
have to do it the ugly way.

252
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:34,656
[GRAHAM] Disrupt the whole damn
thing when it starts...

253
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:36,156
and at the same time cut off the
broadcast lines.

254
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,489
[GRAHAM] And then...

255
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,356
get 'em off the streets
before anyone notices.

256
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:40,523
(intensity picks up,
anticipation)

257
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:41,956
<reacts>

258
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:48,823
Okay. Was there supposed to be
some event today?

259
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:51,556
[GRAHAM] This is way too many
people.

260
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:57,689
[TOMITA] It looks like we're
stuck here for awhile.

261
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:59,089
[RISA] Yeah I guess so.

262
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:01,689
I had no idea that this many
people would show up.

263
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:04,223
[BOSES] Are all these soldiers
lining up to invade the Gate?

264
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:06,356
[PINA] And how did they all get
here so quickly?

265
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:10,656
[SHINO] What d'we do?
[YOJI] Looks like we're gonna
have to walk it. Buuut...

266
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:12,023
(more anticipation)

267
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:16,323
Trying to go through that crowd
is really gonna suck.

268
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,823
[SHINO] Thanks, Lieutenant
Obvious.

269
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:23,789
[TOMITA] I hate to say it but
we're not movin'. Any ideas?

270
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:25,623
[RORY] Give me a minute, okay?

271
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:26,589
(street buzz)

272
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:27,356
(breath catch)

273
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:30,123
(big stretch)

274
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:31,789
[YOJI] What the? Rory! Wait!

275
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:33,923
[RORY] Is something wrong?

276
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:37,089
[RORY] Hey, handsome...
[GUY] Uh... Oh!

277
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,889
[RORY] Can you tell me where
Ginza is?

278
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:41,956
[YOJI] This isn't good. We have
no idea

279
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:43,956
what kind of people are in that
crowd.

280
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:46,889
[YOJI] Some of the victims'
families aren't gonna take too
kindly

281
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:48,756
to seeing girls from the enemy's
country out there.

282
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:50,089
[TOMITA] She can handle
herself...

283
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,689
but we are NOT letting the
Princess out, sir.

284
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:54,823
[YOJI] I know... maybe we should
call this thing off.

285
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,989
[SHINO] Hold up... if we change
the timing we're gonna

286
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,856
be up to our ass in people
trying to shoot us.

287
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:01,189
(nasal exhale)
[YOJI] Yeah probably.

288
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:15,456
Well... I guess we don't have a
choice but to do it now...

289
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:17,989
Otherwise we lose what
advantages we do have.

290
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:22,089
[YOJI] Damn!
It's like I'm running from
debt collectors again or
something.

291
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,856
[YOJI] Risa, I'm sorry, but we
gotta go.

292
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:27,156
[YOJI] Take the car somewhere
safe and leave it there.

293
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:28,089
Just park and walk way.

294
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:29,323
[RISA] Whuuu‐HUH??!

295
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:30,423
Wait Itami!

296
00:15:30,523 --> 00:15:31,756
[YOJI] I'm counting on you.

297
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:33,656
[RISA] I haven't driven
in a really long time!

298
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:35,156
[YOJI] I know you can do it
Risa!

299
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:36,823
[RISA] This doesn't make sense!

300
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:40,056
(resignation)

301
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:44,289
[YOJI] Huh? Aw you don't have to
make that face.

302
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:46,023
[RISA] You're coming back,
aren't you?

303
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:47,256
(breath catch)

304
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:51,156
[YOJI] Well it might take me a
while...

305
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:53,089
but I'll be in touch I promise.

306
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,989
[YOJI] And you better pay me
back for all that money you
spent, got it?!

307
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,723
[RISA] Fine! I'll get you the
money

308
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:01,556
as soon as I get my comic
finished okaaaaay!!!

309
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:04,956
[YOJI] Yeah... take care.

310
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:12,223
[YOJI] Here is the deal... I
need you to be sharp.

311
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:13,856
Right now... we're officially

312
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:16,389
back in full bodyguard mode,
people.

313
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:17,723
[YOJI] If anyone makes any
attempt to harm

314
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:19,756
the diplomats from the Special
Region...

315
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:21,823
[YOJI] Take 'em out.

316
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:23,156
[BOTH] Roger that.
Yes, sir.

317
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,089
(awed shouting)

318
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:29,689
[ANCHOR] We have received
reports

319
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,056
that the young ladies,

320
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,423
who created quite a scene
at the Diet yesterday,

321
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:35,123
are now in Ginza.

322
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:37,656
[ANCHOR] We have been told
that after offering flowers at
the altar,

323
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:39,756
they will be heading back to
their home through the GATE.

324
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:43,223
But at the moment, they are
surrounded by fans,

325
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:45,656
clogging the streets of Ginza.

326
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,523
[ANCHOR] Let's see what Nanami
has for us!

327
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,023
[NANAMI] Test... test... Ah. Ah.

328
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:50,089
[ANCHOR] Hello? Nanami?

329
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:52,056
[NANAMI] Ah‐Eh‐Ee‐Woo... Hm?

330
00:16:52,156 --> 00:16:53,123
Oh! Waahhhh!!?

331
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:55,589
[NANAMI] Whup! This is...
Ginza in Nanami!

332
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:57,623
No! Nanami in Ginza here!
Mmmm...

333
00:16:57,723 --> 00:16:59,923
[ANCHOR] So, how's the
situation over there?

334
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:01,956
[NANAMI] There is like a whole
bunch of people, y'know.

335
00:17:02,056 --> 00:17:04,556
And our guests from another
world

336
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,589
are going up to that...
praying... thingy.

337
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,223
[NANAMI] Oh! I thought there
were only three of them...

338
00:17:08,323 --> 00:17:10,156
but it looks like there are much
more than that...

339
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:12,389
I'm thinking like eight or so!

340
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,389
<notice>

341
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:14,289
[NANAMI] No way.

342
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:18,423
[NANAMI] Hey, Shino!

343
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:19,789
[SHINO] Back off!
[NANAMI] (shock & fear)

344
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:21,789
[SHINO] Oh hey Nanami!

345
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:24,523
[SHINO] Huh? What are you doing
here?

346
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:27,923
[NANAMI] I'm...I'm like on the
TV.

347
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:29,423
[NANAMI] Um maybe I could get...

348
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:31,389
get like an interview with you
or something?

349
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:32,756
[SHINO] Not happening!

350
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:35,623
They gotta head back to the
Special Region ASAP.

351
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:36,789
[NANAMI] Uh? [NANAMI] You're
taking them?

352
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,823
[SHINO] Mm‐hm!
Oh, tell you what!

353
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:40,623
Maybe you could do me an itsy
bitsy favor!

354
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:41,656
[NANAMI] Huh?

355
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:44,156
[SHINO] Hey, mom, how are ya?

356
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:45,623
I hope you're good!

357
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:47,656
[SHINO] Y'know I can't get home
for a while...

358
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:49,389
[CAMERA] What are you doing?!
Interview her!

359
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:50,989
[NANAMI] I'm sorry!
[SHINO] But I have no
idea when that will be.

360
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:52,589
[SHINO] Cuz I mean like we've
been

361
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,156
getting chased the last two
days.

362
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,523
[SHINO] Seriously we couldn't
even go to a freakin' hotel

363
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:58,189
without some idiots popping off
at us.

364
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:00,823
[SHINO] The assholes are
probably here too!
[NANAMI] Shino!

365
00:18:00,923 --> 00:18:04,589
[SHINO] What? What's the
matter?! I'm talking to mom!
[NANAMI] You can't say
assholes on the air!

366
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:07,856
[GRAHAM] This is not good at
all.

367
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,456
[KOMAKADO] Aah... My old friend
Agent Graham.

368
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:13,156
[GRAHAM] Kinda busy here,
Komakado.

369
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:15,523
If this is about the hot
springs, that's been settled.

370
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:18,956
[KOMAKADO] Oh, yes...
that time when your boys
got their collective asses

371
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:19,823
handed to them.

372
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:21,156
I've been told more than once

373
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:23,689
not to complain
about how you handle business,

374
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:25,789
but I still have a duty to the
people who pay my salary

375
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:28,556
to keep an eye on those with
"foreign interests."

376
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:30,923
[KOMAKADO] By the way, Mr. CIA.

377
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:33,756
It'd make my job a lot easier if
you Americans

378
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:36,456
did a bit more to communicate
who you are.

379
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:37,489
[GRAHAM] What do you mean?

380
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:38,723
[KOMAKADO] It can be difficult

381
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:40,089
to know which agents are which
out there,

382
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:42,489
I might accidentally target
the wrong one.

383
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,956
[GRAHAM] Son of a bitch!

384
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,156
(laugh) I'd be making
a few phone calls if I were you.

385
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:51,123
Maybe your people could wear
a special hat or something.
(laughs)

386
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:53,789
(busy signal)

387
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:56,623
(seething)
[GRAHAM] You rat...

388
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:58,389
[KOMAKADO] Okay lieutenant...

389
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:00,623
I did my part now it's your
turn.

390
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,156
[DIRRELL] What did you just
say?!

391
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:08,289
Every single one of
your guys got captured?!

392
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:09,656
[GRAHAM] Sorry, sir.

393
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:11,856
[DIRRELL] So what's with this
SDF chick anyway?!

394
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:15,023
Flapping her stupid big mouth
like that on camera!

395
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,089
[DIRRELL] Son of a bitch!

396
00:19:21,523 --> 00:19:22,956
[ZYUGANOV] Yes. That's good.

397
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:27,123
[PRESIDENT TAI] Send the order
to pull our teams.

398
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:37,956
[RORY] We need a bell for the
souls of the departed.

399
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:40,989
They're not going to rest until
it's done.

400
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:41,823
[RORY] I need a bell.

401
00:19:41,923 --> 00:19:43,289
Someone needs to ring a bell.

402
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:45,456
[YOJI] Huh? A bell? Oh...!

403
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:56,889
(station clock bell)

404
00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:00,756
[RORY] Ah. Thank you very much.

405
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:10,256
(cheers)

406
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:17,923
(cheers)

407
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:21,523
(exhale)

408
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,156
(surprised)

409
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:45,089
[KURATA] Your chariot... is here
at last!

410
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:46,789
Oh?

411
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,889
[YOJI] Carry me... please.

412
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:53,723
[YANAGIDA] Hello... how was your
little vacation?

413
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:55,656
[YOJI] That wasn't a vacation!

414
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,689
I've still got three days of
PTO!

415
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,489
[YANAGIDA] Right... you should
check

416
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,223
with your chain of command on
that.

417
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:03,189
And by that I mean the General.

418
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,989
[RORY] I really did enjoy
visiting Japan.

419
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:09,489
[LELEI] Well if you go again...
take me with you.

420
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:11,789
[TUKA] Shopping was totally my
favorite part.

421
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:19,156
[KATO] Ahhh! So what is this?!

422
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:24,123
[KATO] Whoa?! It glows!
Lelei, it's glowing!

423
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:25,656
[TUKA] And I'm home!

424
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:27,956
Uh hello?

425
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:30,156
[TUKA] Uh father...?

426
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,123
Ugh... are you gonna do this

427
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:33,989
every time I go somewhere?

428
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:42,223
[PINA] The other side...is
overwhelming.

429
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:44,023
[PINA] Continuing this war

430
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:46,556
will only result in a major
setback for the Empire.

431
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:49,923
[PINA] No, the destruction of
the Empire.

432
00:21:50,023 --> 00:21:51,056
[BOSES] Princess.

433
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:53,156
[PINA] We shall leave here in
the morning

434
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:54,456
and make our way to the Capital.

435
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:57,189
[PINA] We need to begin the
negotiations...

436
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:58,823
as soon as possible.

437
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:07,856
[PINA] My mission now...

438
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:14,189
[PINA] ...is to bring an end to
this war.

439
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,223
[LELEI] Next time on "GATE:"

440
00:23:47,323 --> 00:23:49,989
A Visitor.
