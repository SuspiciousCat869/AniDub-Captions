1
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:05,866
[ZORZAL] In the great name of
Zorzal El Caesar,

2
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:10,633
[ZORZAL] I declare... the
foundation of the office of
Crown Prince!

3
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:14,166
[ZORZAL] As of this moment,
the Empire is under my command!

4
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:16,300
[ZORZAL] And our Empire is
vulnerable.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,566
[ZORZAL] After suffering great
losses in so many battles, the
Senate chooses not to fight.

6
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,566
[ZORZAL] Instead wants to
surrender to our foes,

7
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,366
[ZORZAL] They wish to sell out
the freedom and dignity

8
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:28,433
of each and every one of you!

9
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,533
[ZORZAL] All to protect only
themselves!

10
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:33,466
[PEOPLE] <outrage>

11
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,400
[ZORZAL] Their true cowardice
and complacency is showing.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,200
We won't entrust our nation to
weakness. No!

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,666
This realm is ours!

14
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:47,000
[ZORZAL] You are the strong and
noble people of this Empire.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,466
[ZORZAL] You are the chosen ones
that have

16
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:53,200
successfully ruled this realm
for over 600 years.

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,100
[ZORZAL] Now is the time for us
to come together,

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,633
We must show what we are capable
of.

19
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:01,400
[ZORZAL] It is time to overcome
the turmoil around us,

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
And grow our Empire's strength
and power.

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
[ZORZAL] Let us all gather
around our flag,

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,433
[ZORZAL] And let us all make
history together!

23
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,466


24
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:17,600
[CROWD] Zorzal, Zorzal, Zorzal,
Zorzal, Zorzal, Zorzal, Zorzal

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,766
<Chanting, hollering>

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,000
[ZORZAL] And so... now it's time

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,066
[ZORZAL] To begin the war with
Japan

28
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,866
[IMAZU] Well... it looks like
Prince Zorzal's coup d'etat was
successful. Over.

29
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:29,533
[NYUTABARU] Yes. That's right...
And the Empire's under martial
law,

30
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:32,366
[NYUTABARU] So leaving the
premises is restricted. Over.

31
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:34,500
[IMAZU] Is the Vice Minister
safe?

32
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,933
[NYUTABARU] Yes. Jade Palace is
protected under the agreement.

33
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,400
[NYUTABARU] there should be no
need to worry.

34
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,233
[IMAZU] We are in no position to
let our guard down.

35
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:45,066
See if you can find out
the condition of the Emperor.
Over.

36
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,766
[NYUTABARU] Will do. Over and
out.

37
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,800
[PINA] Did you learn the
whereabouts of Lelei?

38
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,966
[GREY] Yes. Apparently, she is
trying to become a master of the
magic arts.

39
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,466
[PINA] She's in Rondel?

40
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,833
[ZORZAL] Pina.

41
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,233
[PINA] Brother!

42
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,666
[ZORZAL] That girl is a hero of
the entire Empire.

43
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:05,066
Bring her back safe and sound.

44
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,433
[GREY] Of course, your Highness.

45
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,666
[PINA] Zorzal. May I ask you
something?

46
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:12,366
[ZORZAL] What is it now?
It may not look it,
but I am a busy man.

47
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,433
[PINA] Would you mind telling me
why you're placing

48
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:17,033
the pro‐peace representatives
under house arrest?

49
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:20,266
<annoyed tsk>
[ZORZAL] Oh yes of course that.

50
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:21,766
[PINA] What did you say?

51
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,266
[ZORZAL] The
representatives‐for‐peace

52
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:25,433
have been receiving bribes and
other gifts from Japan.

53
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,966
[PINA] That's absurd! Do you
have any evidence of this?!

54
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,933
[ZORZAL] Oh I will find proof
eventually.

55
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,466
A definitive source that cannot
be rebuked.

56
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:37,300
[PINA] Then tell me. What is it
you're planning to do?

57
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,366
[ZORZAL] Nothing at all...

58
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:41,233
In the absence of the Emperor...

59
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,533
[ZORZAL] I am simply to carry
out my Princely duty as I see
fit.

60
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:47,033
[ZORZAL] But if you stand in my
way...

61
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,300
[PINA] Will you make a prisoner
out of me as well?

62
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,033
[ZORZAL] That shouldn't be
necessary.

63
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:54,500
I need you to act as an
intermediary peace negotiator
with Japan.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,566
[PINA] You're continuing with
the negotiations?

65
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,700
[ZORZAL] Of course I am.
But without... resorting to a
defeatist mentality,

66
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,466
[ZORZAL] and after taking
measures to ensure our victory
that is. Understand?

67
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,433
[HELM] Um Prince Zorzal, we have
come at your request.

68
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,433
[ZORZAL] These are the men
I have appointed as my generals.

69
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,033
[ZORZAL] I'm sure you know a few
of them.

70
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,100
[PINA] I do.

71
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,233
[ZORZAL] Very well...

72
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,066
I called you for a simple
reason.

73
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,333
[ZORZAL] Gentlemen do you
have a plan in place...

74
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:21,966
to fight the upcoming battle.

75
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,866
[HELM] Our enemy is extremely
powerful, sire.

76
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:26,733
If we approach it as a
traditional fight, we'll surely
lose.

77
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,266
[HELM] We will need to adopt a
more sinister course.

78
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:31,566
[ZORZAL] Really now. A sinister
course?

79
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,500
[HELM] Yes.

80
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,266
We will gather goblins,

81
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,266
[HELM] And have them attack the
villages near Alnus.

82
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:37,266
[PINA] What?!
[HELM] And have them attack the
villages near Alnus.

83
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:38,500
[ZORZAL] Don't you think

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,633
that would provoke them.

85
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,333
Our enemy will seek
retaliation and invade us.

86
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,233
[KALASTA] There's no need to
worry about that.

87
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,300
This will be the work of
a group of freelance thieves
and bandits.

88
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,066
[HELM] And we can take it even
further.

89
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,233
Our soldiers could disguise
themselves to look like

90
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,466
the enemy when they are
attacking the villages.

91
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:56,100
[ZORZAL] Ha Ha. So we make our
enemy look like the bad guys.

92
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,533
[HELM] That way their reputation
will be compromised..

93
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,500
and our people will turn against
them.

94
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,266
[PINA] You should be ashamed of
yourselves!

95
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:05,000
You are supposed to be a
dignified soldier of the
Empire?!

96
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,900
[HELM] It is the only way we can
fight them.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,733
We can't possibly win otherwise,
Princess Pina.

98
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,900
I think you know that.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,366
[ZORZAL] Very good

100
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:15,200
[ZORZAL] Proceed with the plan.
[PINA] But you can't!

101
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,833
[HELM] We'll start preparations
right away.

102
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,733
<react>

103
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,633
[PINA] Helm... It was a mistake
to have negotiated your release.

104
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:23,500
[HELM] I have no words to
describe how grateful I am

105
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,666
for your kindness, Princess...
as my former superior.

106
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:30,766
[HELM] Now leave everything to
us, and get yourself some rest.

107
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,433
[PINA] Diavo! Brother!

108
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:39,600
[PINA] What's going on?!.. What
is this, where are you going?

109
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,700
[DIAVO] Just keep moving.

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,533
[PINA] You answer me right now!

111
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:45,666
[DIAVO] I'm getting as far as I
can from this place.

112
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:49,900
[PINA] But you can't!
You must help me stop Zorzal
from destroying everything.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,900
You have responsibilities
as a member of the imperial
family

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
[DIAVO] I am carrying out
my responsibilities.

115
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,066
I shall stop our deranged
brother by gathering forces
from foreign nations.

116
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,066
[PINA] What? You're inviting
them into the Empire?!

117
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,466
[DIAVO] I'm afraid there's no
other way.

118
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,833
[DIAVO] Get out of the road you
idiot!

119
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,233
[PINA] Diavo. Please think about
this.

120
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,800
[PINA] If you do this our land
and people will be taken away.

121
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,600
[PINA] There will be no Empire
left.

122
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,633
[DIAVO] And if Zorzal's
dictatorship continues.

123
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:20,300
The empire will fall anyway.

124
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,500
[DIAVO] That bigot needs to be
forced into listening

125
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,433
through a demonstration of
strength.

126
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,133
[DIAVO] That's all I can tell
you now get out of the way!

127
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,600
[PINA] I will not!
[DIAVO] Move or I'll run you
over!

128
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,800
[PINA] If it's for the sake of
the Empire...

129
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,166
I don't care what happens to me!

130
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:35,366
[DIAVO] Oh, grow up! Hyaa!!
[PINA] Stop! Diavo!

131
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:39,666
[DIAVO] Ideals aren't going to
help you survive, Pina!

132
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:41,566
<react>

133
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,866
[LELEI] I would like to
introduce you to her properly.

134
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,333
This is Mimoza.

135
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,766
[LELEI] She's a wizard and a
great sage.

136
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,800
She's one of the elders in
Rondel.

137
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,500
[MIMOZA] It is nice to meet you.

138
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,066
So how long has it been, Rory?
[ITAMI] Huh?

139
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,066
[TUKA] You know each other?
[LELEI] I had no idea.

140
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,866
<laugher> [MIMOZA] We traveled
together awhile back.

141
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:03,966
[MIMOZA] About 50 years ago,
doesn't that sound right? Rory?

142
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,600
[RORY] Mimoza... You're so...
old.

143
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,033
[MIMOZA] Oh my. Yes, I am. I've
earned some wrinkles haven't I?

144
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,200
[MIMOZA] Sure you're jealous.

145
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,633
[MIMOZA] So I heard that you
went on

146
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,866
a little holiday to the other
side of the Gate.

147
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:18,600
[MIMOZA] What was it like over
there?

148
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,200
[RORY] Hmm... It was just
lovely...

149
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,600
the streets were nice and
impeccably clean.

150
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,066
[TUKA] Every shop had a wide
variety of products.

151
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,700
And looked like they were doing
well.

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,800
[LELEI] I especially liked their
wonderful bookstores.

153
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,133
[ITAMI] Lelei?
[LELEI] They had books from
every field you can think of.

154
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,800
Sold at very affordable prices
even for the commoners.

155
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,533
[MIMOZA] The commoners could buy
books?

156
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:42,933
[LELEI] In Japan, the ability
to publish books is very
accessible.

157
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:46,000
[LELEI] There was even a market
with books by amateurs for sale.

158
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,600
[MIMOZA] Oh dear dear. That
would be incredible to have
books for everyone.

159
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,066
[ARPEGGIO] Oh no no no!

160
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,300
That's one thing that can never
ever happen! Never ever ever
ever...

161
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,933
Never ever.

162
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,900
If my magic encyclopedia that I
copied by hand night after night

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
after night were to go down in
price...

164
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,266
[ITAMI] What is wrong with her?
[Arpeggio rants]

165
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,533
[LELEI] One of Arpeggio's
jobs is a scribe writing books.

166
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:07,733
She's upset how cheap
they are to make.

167
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,600
And how easy her job is.

168
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,600
[Arpeggio continues]

169
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,933
[MIMOZA] Her specialty
is in mineral magic,

170
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,233
which can be rather pricey
in order to maintain.

171
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,500
...AND if book prices go
down on top of that...

172
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,033
Ugh... How will I pay
for food and rent?

173
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:23,233
I'll get kicked out if I miss
another payment...

174
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,033
[LELEI] Now don't you worry.

175
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:27,533
I'm sure the price won't drop
right away.

176
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,700
[LELEI] That would be far into
the future.

177
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,200
[ARPEGGIO] Sure about that?

178
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,766
Welllll why didn't you say so,
you trying to scare me?!

179
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,166
What. Is. Your. Deal?!

180
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:39,033
Anyway. Like I said...
she's a mineral specialist.

181
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,000
[MIMOZA] Which means she could
really be of help

182
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,466
for your resource survey.

183
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,700
[ITAMI] That sounds great, would
you be up for that?

184
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,566
[ARPEGGIO] Well sure... I would
be happy to help you.

185
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,766
<giggle>

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,233
[MIMOZA] Are you curious?

187
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,566
You seem to be very interested
in that picture.

188
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,066
[RORY] Oh no not really.

189
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,500
Glad you came, even if you were
just tagging along.

190
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,166
I've been wanting to give you an
answer

191
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,166
to
the homework you gave me.

192
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,533
[ITAMI] Homework?

193
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:06,733
[RORY] That's correct.

194
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,166
I gave her a problem to resolve

195
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,766
before we parted ways.

196
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,466
[RORY] To answer why there are

197
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,900
such varied species in this
world.

198
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,533
[ITAMI] Is there an answer to
that?

199
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,133
[RORY] Of course there is.

200
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,766
[MIMOZA] It is because...

201
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:21,733
[MIMOZA] Of the Gate. Oh dear.

202
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
[MIMOZA] The creation legend for
the elves

203
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,066
begins with a man and woman

204
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,233
...who were led by a God to the
Forest of Origin.

205
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,100
[MIMOZA] Now, elves are spread
throughout the realm,

206
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,766
but every tribe has their own
version of the origin story.

207
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,666
[MIMOZA] When you ask the
location

208
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,000
of the Forest of Origin,

209
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,500
...the elves in the
north point to the south,

210
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,433
...and the elves in the
south point to the north.

211
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:53,600
And it all leads to one
location.

212
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,033
[ITAMI] So... Alnus.

213
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,200
[MIMOZA] That's correct.

214
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,066
[LELEI] So all elves come from
Alnus?

215
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,933
[MIMOZA] Oh well not just elves.

216
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:03,766
All sorts of species across the
region

217
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,000
claim Alnus as their home.

218
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,500
[ARPEGGIO] And what do you think
about that, Master?

219
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,033
[MIMOZA] I've traveled this
world my entire life

220
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,866
and my research has born much
fruit.

221
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:13,733
[RORY] And tell me, what is the
answer

222
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,333
you were finally able to
discover?

223
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,733
[MIMOZA] That there are
different kinds of demi‐humans

224
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,400
throughout this world,
and all of them moved here
once the Gate was opened.

225
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,200
[MIMOZA] The GATE remains
dormant for several hundred or
even thousands of years at a
time.

226
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,233
But then, it opens.

227
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:31,533
And every time it does,
new inhabitants emerge from it.

228
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:34,233
Sometimes they fight other
species who were here first

229
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,600
[MIMOZA] and other times they're
able to mix peacefully.

230
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,866
They become rooted, and join our
existence.

231
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,766
[MIMOZA] Then, as always,

232
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,666
the Gate goes back into a long
slumber.

233
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:47,566
That history has been repeated
for as long as time.

234
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,666
[MIMOZA] And we are a part it.
Judging by antiquity and
literature,

235
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:53,533
We're most likely the most
recent to come through.

236
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:56,833
[MIMOZA] It makes sense the
Empire regard Alnus as holy
ground...

237
00:11:56,933 --> 00:12:01,333
And why the new foreign visitors
have chosen to set up their base
there.

238
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,933
[RORY] Very well done, Mimoza

239
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:05,966
[MIMOZA] Oh dear! Thank you
ma'am!

240
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:08,233
I'm finally free! Oh Thank the
gods!

241
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,166
[ITAMI] Did you already know
about all that, Rory?

242
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:14,366
[RORY] Yes, for the most part.
It is but God's will in the end.

243
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:17,200
Demigods like myself only follow
their will

244
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,466
and do our duty to protect this
world.

245
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:22,466
At times we guide those
exhibiting high potential,

246
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:26,366
and sometimes we have to
eliminate those who venture
astray.

247
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:29,900
It's how we maintain harmony for
all who live with us in this
realm.

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
[LELEI] I don't think I ever
heard that story.

249
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,300
That's because it's MY research
that I spent years studying.

250
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,500
I don't think Kato is very
interested in much history.

251
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,900
[ARPEGGIO] That's what I've been
telling you all along.

252
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,433
Instead of learning from one
person,

253
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,666
staying here allows you to learn
several points of view.

254
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:47,366
[LELEI] If I stayed here. I
couldn't try for the

255
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,366
rank of master for a very long
time.

256
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:50,833
[ARPEGGIO] That may be true...
but you'd've learned more.

257
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:52,233
[MIMOZA] So then...

258
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,333
What is it that you're going
to be presenting Lily?

259
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,966
[MIMOZA] I'd love to hear what
you've been working on.

260
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:01,033
[ARPEGGIO] What's that thing?
[LELEI] It's a device from the
Japanese.

261
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:03,733
[ARPEGGIO] Oh God with this,
no one would ever even need
books anymore!

262
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,233
[MIMOZA] Look at that,
it's even more amazing inside.

263
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,366
[MIMOZA] She's incorporating the
knowledge

264
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,500
of another world into the
framework of magic.

265
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,466
[MIMOZA] This might be able to
make even the most

266
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:14,633
stubborn of old mages shut up
and listen for once.

267
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,666
[ARPEGGIO] My own little sister.
She has completely surpassed me.

268
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:22,166
I hate this! I've got no money,
and my sister's way ahead of me.

269
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,966
I've been working on my research
for years

270
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,300
and gotten absolutely nowhere.

271
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,333
[ARPEGGIO] Maybe I just don't
have any talent.

272
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,866
[ARPEGGIO] Wait I know! I'll
get married and start a family!

273
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:31,000
[ARPEGGIO] What kind of man is
Itami?!

274
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,033
[ITAMI] <spit take>

275
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:34,000
Yoji Itami. He's an Officer.

276
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,533
And he's also a Lord... Of Elbe.

277
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:38,600
[LELEI] And an honorary tribal
leader of the dark elves,

278
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,100
Itami holds many titles.

279
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,566
[TUKA] Are you alright, father?

280
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:45,466
Hmm. So he's an elite noble with
an elf child.

281
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:46,466
How's that possible?

282
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:47,966
[LELEI] Um... Don't worry about
it.

283
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,233
[ARPEGGIO] What about his
finances?

284
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,233
[YAO] He possesses a large rare
diamond.

285
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,000
It was given to him by the
people of my tribe.

286
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,033
[YAO] About this big.

287
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,000
[ARPEGGIO] OH! Is he married?!

288
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,533
Itami is currently single.

289
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,133
[BOTH] That's perfect!

290
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,300
[MIMOZA] Oh my oh dear.

291
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,000
[LELEI] No. He is no longer
single.

292
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,733
Itami and I completed the Three
Nights Ceremony.

293
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,566
[TUKA] Ah! When was that?!
[RORY] You'd better explain
yourself!

294
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,433
[ITAMI] What!?
What are you talking about?!

295
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:11,533
What is the Three Nights
Ceremony?

296
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,133
Our practice of proving
common‐law marriage,

297
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:16,733
if a man and a woman share a
bedroom for three nights.

298
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,133
[MIMOZA] In other words, it's a
declaration to let

299
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,066
everyone know that you are now
betrothed!

300
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,166
[ITAMI] What?! I don't remember
doing that.

301
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:25,800
[LELEI] We've slept together
exactly three times.

302
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,166
[LELEI] The first was
at the camp.

303
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,833
The second was in Risa's room.

304
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:32,200
[LELEI] And the third was
the hotel in Hakone.
That makes three.

305
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,533
[ITAMI] The camp, Risa,
the hotel... I suppose so.

306
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:36,666
[TUKA] Counting like that,

307
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:38,533
I've slept with him way more
than three times!

308
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:39,700
[MIMOZA] Oh, bigamy?

309
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,666
[LELEI] Well you had lost
your mind at the time

310
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:44,000
and thought that Itami was your
deceased father .

311
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,900
[LELEI] So it really doesn't
count.

312
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,800
[RORY] Itami!

313
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,600
Unbelievable. All this time
and not once did you try
to take advantage of me.

314
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,866
[RORY] Guess you were too busy

315
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,866
getting frisky with every other
girl here.

316
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:58,000
[RORY] Care to enlighten me,
lover boy?

317
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,233
<growl>

318
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,866
[LELEI] Arpeggio?

319
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,600
[ARPEGGIO] Defeated yet again.

320
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,633
[ARPEGGIO] My sister has bested
me academically,

321
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,100
financially, and romantically.

322
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,033
It's almost as if have no
dignity as an older sister.

323
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:13,966
There's only one more thing
left to do.

324
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:18,566
[ARPEGGIO] Do not hesitate.
This is necessary for the future
of our sisterhood.

325
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,566
<surprise gasp>

326
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,766
<grunt>

327
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,400
[MIMOZA] Ahhhhh.

328
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,333
<pissed off huff>

329
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:32,466
<growl>

330
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,366
[MIMOZA] Oh dear, oh my...

331
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:40,666
[MIMOZA] Oh dear, oh dear ...

332
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:42,933
[MIMOZA] Oh dear, oh dear ...

333
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:45,733
[MIMOZA] Oh my, oh dear ...

334
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:52,600
[ARPEGGIO] Now! Do you admit
defeat?! [MIMOZA] Oh my, oh dear
...

335
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,333
[RORY] As of now, the 13th
Battle

336
00:15:57,433 --> 00:15:59,600
of the Lalena Sisters is
approved.

337
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,600
[RORY] In the name of mee!!

338
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,466
[RORY] The rules are simple:

339
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:06,033
You are not allowed
to kill your opponent.

340
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,400
That's very important.

341
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,800
There are to be no unsightly
marks to the face.

342
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,666
Or you shall
answer to me, understand?.
[continues]

343
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,166
[ITAMI] What is going on here?

344
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,666
[MIMOZA] These two still like to
fight each other, whoo!

345
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,733
A bit differently from before,
but I'll take what I can get.

346
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,533
[ITAMI] Heh. This isn't good.

347
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,266
[RORY] Are you ready?

348
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,300
[RORY] Begin!

349
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,133
[ITAMI] What is that?

350
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:31,433
[MIMOZA] You like it...?

351
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,166
Arpeggio uses minerals as a
catalyst,

352
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:35,700
[MIMOZA] so she can skip the
laws of science

353
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,000
and interfere with the
principles.

354
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,800
[ITAMI] I don't know what that
means,

355
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,266
but I do know that this isn't
any normal sibling rivalry.

356
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:45,133
[MIMOZA] It is a normal wizard
fight, though.

357
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:47,533
[MIMOZA] Oh dear.

358
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:50,733
What an exquisite show of magic.
Oh my.

359
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,533
[ARPEGGIO] Oh No!

360
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:01,000
[ITAMI] What's that thing
surrounding them?

361
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,500
[MIMOZA] It's a barrier of
magical protection.

362
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,400
[MIMOZA] Protecting one's self
is the first thing the

363
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,733
wizards of the Lyndon Faction
learn

364
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,366
when they are new to the craft.

365
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:10,333
[MIMOZA] This battle is about
who can break

366
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:12,300
the opponent's barrier first.

367
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,766
[ARPEGGIO] Stupid idiot
genius...

368
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,933
[ITAMI] Hello, 'scuse me,
Rory...

369
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,900
Don't you think this has gone a
bit too far?

370
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
[RORY] If we stop them now,

371
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,266
they'll never reach
reconciliation.

372
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:41,633
[ITAMI] Maybe, but I don't want
anybody to get hurt.

373
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:44,366
[RORY] Just shut up and watch
them do their thing.

374
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:58,800
[ARPEGGIO] My special attack!

375
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,300
Big Sister's Dignity! Hwaaah!

376
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,400
[ARPEGGIO] Craaaaaaap.

377
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:36,833
[ITAMI] What's happening now?

378
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,000
[RORY] Oh a tie‐breaker.

379
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,766
<ominous footfall>

380
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:45,633
<gasp>

381
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,433
<ohhhh>

382
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:01,300
<react>

383
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:05,066
<dying noises>

384
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,039
[RORY] Grey Co Aldo.

385
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:19,939
[RORY] This is my holy
battlefield

386
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,205
and you have just brazenly
soiled it.

387
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:25,039
[RORY] You'd better have some
justification.

388
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:28,639
[GREY] I suggest you and
your people leave this place
as soon as possible.

389
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:33,372
[GREY] I killed one assassin,
but there will be others
on the way.

390
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,472
[ITAMI] Assassins?

391
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,539
[BOY] Mommy. Where'd our house
go?

392
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:41,972
[GREY] I received an order from
Princess Pina.

393
00:19:42,072 --> 00:19:44,172
I'm to invite Lelei to the
Imperial Capital,

394
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:45,539
[GREY] so I came to Rondel to
find her.

395
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:47,739
[SHANDY] But while we were on
the way here,

396
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,572
we received information that
there

397
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:51,072
are assassins after her.

398
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:52,972
[ITAMI] You have any idea who
might've hired them?

399
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:55,005
[GREY] It's only a speculation
on my part.

400
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:57,605
So I should probably avoid
saying who I think it is.

401
00:19:57,705 --> 00:19:59,439
[GREY] To be fair.

402
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,372
[SHANDY] Ever since the head of
the flame dragon was hung for
all to see,

403
00:20:02,472 --> 00:20:05,872
Lelei's fame has been
growing in the Imperial Capital.

404
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,272
[SHANDY] Whoever it is..

405
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,005
they don't like sharing the
spotlight with others.

406
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:11,039
[ARPEGGIO] What do you mean,

407
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,105
the head of the flame dragon?

408
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,205
What the heck does that have to

409
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:14,372
do with my stupid jerk sister?

410
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:15,872
[GREY] You mean she didn't tell
you?

411
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:17,005
[GREY] Your little sister

412
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:18,739
joined arms with the people
here.

413
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,905
Together they attacked

414
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:21,372
and defeated the flame dragon.

415
00:20:21,472 --> 00:20:22,972
[ARPEGGIO] Oh yeah right that's
good.

416
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:24,172
Come on, you're messing with me.

417
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:25,805
I know she's all
smart and everything,

418
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:27,572
But she wouldn't be
able

419
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:29,072
to kill a flame dragon.

420
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:30,705
Could she?

421
00:20:31,572 --> 00:20:32,839
IS IT TRUE?!

422
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,472
[ITAMI] The dark elves told us
that they would

423
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:36,105
show the Empire the head of the
dragon,

424
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:37,505
and let everyone know that it's
dead.

425
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:39,439
[GREY] Their presentation was
effective.

426
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,472
[ITAMI] But why is it that only
Lelei

427
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:42,739
is becoming famous for it?

428
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,839
[SHANDY] That probably

429
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:45,172
has something to do with the
fact

430
00:20:45,272 --> 00:20:46,472
that she is the only one who is
a

431
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:49,105
citizen of human descent from
the Empire.

432
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:50,672
[LELEI] I am a member of Lourdo.

433
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:54,005
I don't ever remember becoming a
citizen of the Empire.

434
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:56,739
[GREY] The people care not about
such things.

435
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,305
[GREY] You are under no one's
submission

436
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,039
and yet still did something so
great.

437
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:01,639
[GREY] That is the reason people

438
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:03,639
have been praising you.

439
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:05,305
[ITAMI] Okay so it's safe to
say,

440
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:07,505
whoever's hiring the assassin...

441
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:09,205
Is jealous of Lelei.

442
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:12,872
[ZORZAL] Ooh! This is so good,
Furuta!

443
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,005
[RUFLUS] Are you sure about
this?

444
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:16,172
[THULE] You have a problem

445
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:17,972
with Prince Zorzal's new
legislation?

446
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:22,105
[RUFLUS] 'Course not...
But the way it's worded
is rather confusing...

447
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:25,105
As to what sort of crimes are
enforceable and by whom.

448
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:29,105
[THULE] That is preciously what
His Highness wants.

449
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:33,972
[RUFLUS] I understand...
I'll pull some strings in the
Senate. To see it's heard.

450
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:35,472
[THULE] I take it you'll be able
to ensure

451
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:37,405
the bill gets the support it
deserves.

452
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,772
[RUFLUS] I will make the proper
arrangements.

453
00:21:39,872 --> 00:21:40,939
Leave it to me.

454
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,139
[ITAMI] The Piper?

455
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,105
[GREY] Yes. He's one of the
assassins

456
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:50,239
most recently hired.

457
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:51,739
[GREY] He's extremely deadly,

458
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,672
the two of us would be no match
for him.

459
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,072
[RORY] Given her achievement

460
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:57,405
of killing the flame dragon, it
is no surprise.

461
00:21:57,505 --> 00:22:00,772
[SHANDY] If you please,
we will need your assistance
with this, Itami.

462
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:04,039
[ITAMI] No one needs to beg me.
I'll protect Lelei anyday.

463
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:05,839
[GREY] You're the man in green
I've been hearing about.

464
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:07,805
[GREY] Why don't the two of us
join forces

465
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:09,772
and take out these cowardly
assassins.

466
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:10,639
[ITAMI] I don't think so.

467
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:14,339
[ITAMI] I've a better idea...

468
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,439
Run away.

469
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:48,339
[LELEI] Next time on Gate:

470
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:50,072
The Lovers.
