1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,066
The JSDF was dispatched
to a mysterious world
beyond the GATE,

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:07,066
referred to as
the Special Region.

3
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:12,000
Yoji Itami, one
of the members of the JSDF

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,366
Has experienced many battles
encountered many of the local
inhabitants.

5
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:17,466
And Pina, the princess
of the Empire that rules the
Special Region,

6
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:19,600
has made contact with Japan,
inspiring her to seek
a way toward peace talks

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,766
between the two countries.

8
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:23,066
But, there are a great
many obstacles

9
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,433
that stand in the way
of progress.

10
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,366
[KUWABARA] Attention!

11
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:03,033
Officer present!

12
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,766
[KURATA] 
You're lookin' good, sir!

13
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:14,966
[MARI] That outfit...

14
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:16,733
[SHINO] Just priceless.

15
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,733
<holding in laughter>

16
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,000
[KUWABARA] It uh... it looks
good on you.

17
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,566
[ITAMI] I know when you're lying
to me.

18
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,600
[KUWABARA] Uh... well it at
least looks like it fits.

19
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,133
[CHILD] Hey, check out the
biggest dork in the universe!

20
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,566
[CHILD'S MOTHER] Honey stop it!

21
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,366
[CHILD] Huh? But look at him ‐
how can you not laugh?

22
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,400
[CHILD'S MOTHER] Hush!
[KUWABARA] Sorry sir.

23
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,766
[ITAMI] Listen up! Today's
mission may not be the usual,

24
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,233
but this is still very
important.

25
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,600
I expect everyone to be alert

26
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,733
and to do their job well and
with purpose.

27
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,866
[KUWABARA] It's almost time.

28
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,633
[ITAMI] OK! They're coming
people,

29
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:49,933
everyone get to your post.

30
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,566
[SOLDIERS] Yes, sir!

31
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,600
[ITAMI] Welcome! We're so glad
you could make it!

32
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,533
<angry sex>

33
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,733
<not fun sex>

34
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:15,333
[ZORZAL] Come on! Cry for me!
Scream! Let's hear it!

35
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,666
<not fun sex>

36
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:21,133
[THULE] Your Highness, please...
Please...I'm trying....

37
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,566
[ZORZAL] You're the chief
of the voglia bunny tribe.

38
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,033
<reacts>

39
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,633
Is that all you got?
[THULE]

40
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,966
[ZORZAL] Come on, bitch
I know you got it in ya!

41
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:33,900
[ZORZAL] What's wrong?
Now scream. Let it out!

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,600
Scream for me!!

43
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,066
<laughter>

44
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,500
[ZORZAL] Well... Guess that's
it. Disappointing.

45
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,300
[ZORZAL] If that's all you can
handle, then you'll never be
able to satisfy me.

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,433
[THULE] I'm sorry You're
Highness. Please forgive me.

47
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,200
[ZORZAL] The destiny of your
people

48
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,866
depends on how well you
prove your dedication to me .

49
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:01,100
Did you forget that?

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,166
[THULE] Please sire.
Show them mercy.

51
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:06,233
[ZORZAL] That's enough.
You may leave.

52
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,566
I'm afraid all your quibbling
has caused me to lose interest.

53
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,300
<pained breathing...>

54
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,900
[MARCUS] I can't say that's very
gentlemanly behavior.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Royalty like yourself
should never seek the pleasures
of such a lowly beast.

56
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,300
[ZORZAL] What can I say, Marcus,
I'm a renaissance man,

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,033
petty differences in race and
breed mean nothing to me.

58
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,866
[ZORZAL] You should try it out
yourself.

59
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:32,933
I'll let you borrow her.

60
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,166
[MARCUS] Surely you jest.

61
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:35,800
[ZORZAL] Is that all you wanted
from me?

62
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,233
[MARCUS] I have something
trouble news I must report to
you.

63
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,366
There appears to be a rising
level of unrest

64
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,433
among the current Senate
representatives.

65
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,700
[ZORZAL] Ah. It must be
Diavo's scheme.

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,633
My poor younger brother will do
whatever it takes

67
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,733
in order to alter the
succession of the throne.

68
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,300
[MARCUS] No. Our enemy's envoy

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,066
is attempting to buy out
the representatives.

70
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,266
[ZORZAL] What?!

71
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:57,766
[MARCUS] Apparently,
they have captured

72
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,900
some of our people on the other
side of the gate...

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,600
[MARCUS] and the representatives
are being used as leverage,

74
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,200
weighing on the value of their
safe return.

75
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,366
[ZORZAL] Preying upon
the bonds of one's family...

76
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:14,233
What a coward. Sounds
like something pathetic
barbarians would do!

77
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,133
[MARCUS] There is a formal
meeting in the Imperial Garden.

78
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,000
They are gathering as we speak
and ...

79
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,433
(reaction to weiner)

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
[MARCUS] Uh... you may want
to make an appearance, sire.

81
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,233
[ZORZAL] I see.

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,333
But tell me Marcus?

83
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:32,800
Why would you come to me
with such an important matter?

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,300
[ZORZAL] And not
go to my father?

85
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,800
[MARCUS] With all due respect
if His Majesty learns of this

86
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,400
then things could
get complicated.

87
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,933
It could cause undue strain
on a member of the royal family

88
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,466
who is next in line to become
the Emperor...

89
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:46,166
[MARCUS] A leader who would want
the Senate on his side.

90
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:49,800
[ZORZAL] Oh, that's awfully
sweet of you.

91
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,833
Then I'll go!

92
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,800
And I'll let them all know

93
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,066
that the Empire
is watching them!

94
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,533
[MORITA] What is the latest
update regarding the Special
Region?

95
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:06,566
[MIN. OF FA] The Ministry of
Foreign Affairs is currently
seeking measures

96
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,500
to open up peace‐talks with the
Empire.

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,500
[MIN. OF DEFENSE] The team
that was dispatched to
the Special Region

98
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
has secured a strongpoint in the
Empire,

99
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,766
and begun collecting
information.

100
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:18,466
[MORITA] And is there anything
we've discovered that we can
announce to the public yet?

101
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,500
[MIN. OF FA] Prime Minister...
it's early yet,

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,533
the team has only just began
working with their
representatives.

103
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,033
[MORITA] Yes I know we're just
getting started.

104
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:29,733
But I am receiving a great deal
of pressure from countries all
over the world

105
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,566
as well as the media to release
some sort of information.

106
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,766
Ugh... God...

107
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,233
[MORITA] Work with me here.

108
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:42,800
I need some sort of something to
release that isn't classified.

109
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,500
[PINA] Well I'm impressed.
You've hosted a splendid affair,

110
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,366
inviting the entire family and
the whole of the tribe as well.

111
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:51,466
It is a fine example of your
great generosity, Mr. Sugawara.

112
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,500
[SUGAWARA] No, it's nothing. I
assure you.

113
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,800
Besides, the head maid from
Italica was gracious enough to
join us.

114
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,266
She's been extremely helpful.

115
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,933
[PINA] I understand Count
Folmar's family offered

116
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,266
to assist in any way they can.

117
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:02,866
They understand as well
as anyone

118
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:04,500
that Italica's
booming economy

119
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,466
is directly related to the
presence of open trade with
Alnus.

120
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:09,100
[SUGAWARA] I can't help
but notice,

121
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,966
that the only maids who
have been sent are human.

122
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,566
Not quite how I remember the
make‐up in that house.

123
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,500
[PINA] This is the Imperial
Capital, of course.

124
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:16,733
[SUGAWARA] Uh... I see.

125
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,166
I guess all the nobles I've met

126
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:21,233
in the Imperial Capital have
been humans as well.

127
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,600
[SHERRY] Mr. Sugawara!

128
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,266
<breath catch>

129
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:25,500
[SUGAWARA] Uh...
what can I do for you?

130
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,133
[SHERRY] My stupid cousin
won't stop

131
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,866
bragging about her necklace
and showing it to me!

132
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:32,100
[SHERRY] Great so she has a
string of pearls, but who cares!

133
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,200
[SHERRY] It's very irritating

134
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,866
and making it impossible to
enjoy your party.

135
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,600
You gotta help me.

136
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,033
[SHERRY] Please, there must be
something you can do.

137
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,466
<small whimper>

138
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,533
[SUGAWARA] I'm...not sure
exactly what I could do...

139
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:50,000
[MOTHER] Sherry no!
Mr. Sugawara, I'm sorry,
please forgive her rudeness.

140
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,133
[PINA] She's a member
of the Tuelis.
[MOTHER] I don't believe this,

141
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,133
[PINA] They're in
the Marquis Casel family.
[MOTHER] you should know better!

142
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:55,933
[SUGAWARA] Well he's a key
player in the Senate?

143
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,000
[PINA] Yes.

144
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,533
[SUGAWARA] Please wait a moment.

145
00:07:58,633 --> 00:07:59,666
You must be her parents.

146
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:01,100
Please don't be too hard on her,

147
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,133
I assure you it was no trouble.

148
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:11,166
[SUGAWARA] Listen Sherry.
You should try not to trouble
your parents, understand.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,333
And if you're a good girl...

150
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:16,666
I'm sure a wonderful reward
will be coming your way.

151
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:17,833
I promise.

152
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,266
<react>

153
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,866
[PINA] Quite the ladies' man
aren't you?

154
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,466
So I'm guessing that
in a few days,

155
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,000
she might receive
Japanese pearls

156
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,633
that would make her
cousin jealous.

157
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:36,333
[SUGAWARA] Can't hurt to have
a connection with Marquis Casel.

158
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,166
[PINA] Did you see the
expression on the poor girl's
face?

159
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:41,266
[PINA] I think she's in love.

160
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:47,733
[SUGAWARA] <Hmph>
Please. You flatter me.

161
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,500
[PINA] Who's the cook?

162
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,666
[SUGAWARA] That's Furuta.
He works under Itami.

163
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:58,066
[SUGAWARA] I'm told he was
working as a chef at a

164
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,633
[PINA] That must be why it's so
good.

165
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,166
So where is Itami anyway?

166
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:03,733
[SUGAWARA] I'll take you to him.

167
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,700
[ITAMI] So whatcha think?
What you're seeing is the
powerful Type 64 rifle and uh...

168
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,500
[CICERO] Sell some to me!
No! You need to teach me
how to make those things.

169
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,833
[ITAMI] Well... I wouldn't
really know how to explain
that uh...

170
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:24,366
[DUCIE] So tell me... Just how
many of these so called rifles
do you possess?!

171
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:27,133
[ITAMI] I can't tell you exactly
uh...

172
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,566
But it's safe to say that each
of our soldiers carries one.

173
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,633
<react>

174
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:32,833
[ITAMI] 'Kay guys, why don't we

175
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,300
move on to the mortars.

176
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:38,866
[SOLDIER D] Half‐load!
[SOLDIER A] Half‐load, complete!

177
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,300
[SOLDIER D] Fire.

178
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,100
[SOLDIER E] Impact!

179
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,500
Now!

180
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,066
[CICERO] <horror>

181
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,766
[SOLDIER] Half‐load!
[SOLDIERS] Half‐load, complete!

182
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:56,666
[SOLDIER D] Fire.

183
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,766
<horror>

184
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:14,766
<city in terror>

185
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,600
[CICERO] Marquis Ducie...

186
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,533
[DUCIE] Yes... If we continue
to fight with Japan,

187
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,133
we will be destroyed.

188
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:34,466
[SUGAWARA] Hello Marquis Ducie.
It's been some time we dined at
your home.

189
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:38,033
[DUCIE] Sugawara. There's no
need for idle chit chat.

190
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,533
Just tell us what Japan wants

191
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:42,700
in order for us to proceed with
the peace negotiations?

192
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,566
[SUGAWARA] I'd be happy to.

193
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,866
[ARCHER] Avenger.
This is Archer. Come in.

194
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:49,733
[ITAMI] This is Avenger.
Whatcha got?

195
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,900
[ARCHER] A small group of mean
on horseback are about to cross
the cordon.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,300
[ARCHER] They don't appear to be
guests, but they are dressed
well,

197
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,266
and don't look like bandits or
anything like that.

198
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,933
[ARCHER] How would you like us
to handle 'em?

199
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,866
[ITAMI] Standby. Continue to
monitor them.

200
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:03,033
[ARCHER] Roger.

201
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,433
[ITAMI] A group of men are
approaching on horseback.

202
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,066
[ITAMI] I'm getting the VIPs out
of site.

203
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,766
[ITAMI] The garden party will
continue as planned.

204
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:15,133
[ITAMI] Your families can stay
and enjoy themselves.

205
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:17,233
[ITAMI] I'm sure you understand
we can't make it public

206
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,533
we've been in contact with you
yet.

207
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,133
[ITAMI] As a precaution
we've decided

208
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:21,500
to take you to the
Imperial Capital.

209
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,066
[KURATA] We're going to be
making our way

210
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,400
to the Southeast gate.

211
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,366
[CICERO] What? You're
taking us to the slums?

212
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:29,000
[DUCIE] It's the perfect place
not to be seen.

213
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,266
Get those mortars and rifles
packed away now!

214
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:34,466
[ITAMI] Fall Back!
[SOLDIERS] Yes sir!

215
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,300


216
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,966
[ZORZAL] What is this?

217
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:52,533
[NOBLE GIRL A] Hey Prince
Zorzal!

218
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:55,766
[NOBLE GIRL B] Oh! When did you
get here?

219
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,100
[ZORZAL] What's going on here?

220
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,233
[HEAD OF MAIDS] Princess Pina
and Mr. Sugawara

221
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,100
are hosting a
little garden party.

222
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
As you can see,
they've invited

223
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,066
a few families together
for the afternoon.

224
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,466
You seem surprised, were you not
invited?

225
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,033
[ZORZAL] Pina, huh?

226
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,166
[PINA] Zorzal!

227
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,833
What brings you to us today?

228
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:14,100
[ZORZAL] Hello Sister.
You sound like you didn't want
me to come.

229
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,400
[PINA] No no.

230
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,000
It's just you never seem
interested

231
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,600
in these sort of
silly banquet events.

232
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,700
[ZORZAL] Hmph... I guess so.
[PINA]

233
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,100
[ZORZAL] You invite any Senators
or members of the enemy's envoy?

234
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,700
[PINA] What? Seriously, don't be
ridiculous.

235
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,266
[ZORZAL] Right. Of course not.

236
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:33,933
[PINA] Brother!
Since you're here,

237
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:36,466
why don't you get yourself
something to eat.

238
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:38,933
[PINA] I recommend ma nuga meat.

239
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:41,100
It has this special
sauce called mustard!

240
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,966
[ZORZAL] It's all yellow.
Most unappealing.

241
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,400
<bite>

242
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,666
[PINA] I'm certain it was Count
Marcus that gave my brother an
idea.

243
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:55,133
[SUGAWARA] So it was a
reconnaissance‐in‐force, then?

244
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,366
[PINA]  No. I wouldn't
go that far.

245
00:12:57,466 --> 00:13:00,166
It was a warning. The Count
simply used my brother

246
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:02,600
to make some sort of veiled
impression on us.

247
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,500
[SUGAWARA] I can't help but
wonder what would have happened

248
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,466
if the representatives were
still here when he arrived.

249
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:08,500
[PINA] Most certainly a huge
disaster.

250
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,533
[SUGAWARA] I'd like to move
forward with the peace talks

251
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,866
before the Empire has a chance
to make their next move.

252
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,133
[PINA] Do you realize what
you're saying?

253
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,466
Sugawara please.

254
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:17,166
The amount of compensation
you proposed earlier

255
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,700
as a condition
of the peace talks

256
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,133
was quite frankly unreasonable.

257
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,933
<small laugh>
I thought you were
going to pass out.

258
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:24,266
[PINA] How could you blame me!

259
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:25,733
You asked for 500 million swan.

260
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,066
Even if we collected all the
gold coins in the Empire,

261
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,433
we still won't have enough.

262
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:30,700
[PINA] <sit up>

263
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,300
[PINA] Itami! Forgive me!
Forgive me! Aaahahh...

264
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
[ITAMI] Okay!
I forgive you! Okay!

265
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,233
[PINA] <embarrassed>
[SUGAWARA] Consider it an
opening offer.

266
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,166
There's still room for
negotiations.

267
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:47,733
[PINA] Well that's good.
We should hurry and set up a
meeting with Marquis Casel

268
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,966
as soon as possible.

269
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll ask Lord Cicero to be the
mediator.

270
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,533
[MOLTO]  Let me get
this straight.

271
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:57,100
So he goes all the way out there
and just comes out with some
lunch.

272
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,866
Sounds like him.

273
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,266
[MARCUS] Your Majesty.

274
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:02,333
If we allow the Senate to
approve the peace talks,

275
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:05,633
then the situation could get
more complex and... worrisome.

276
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,500
[MOLTO] I don't care.

277
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,866
But I guarantee you,

278
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:11,300
they will not see one piece of
our gold or plot of our land.

279
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,633
[MOLTO] They can talk and
prattle on all they want.

280
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:17,466
But it's only a matter of time
before discussions break down

281
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,133
and the outsiders call the whole
thing off.

282
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:23,100
You may do whatever you like
Count Marcus.

283
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,533
But whatever you choose,

284
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:27,000
losing a battle is not an option
for the Empire.

285
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,866
[MARCUS] Yes. Sire.

286
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,100
I swear on my life.

287
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:34,500
[KURATA] <impressed> So this is
it, huh.

288
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,633
The most infamous spot in the
Empire!

289
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:40,366
[MARI] A hotbed of violence and
crime. Trouble Town.

290
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:42,333
[KURATA] Aww man,
I mean I was hoping for

291
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:44,433
a paradise full of sexy animal
girls.

292
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:47,900
I didn't know it'd be like...
this.

293
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,366
[KUWABARA] 3rd Deep Recon and
Surveillance Unit has arrived.

294
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:52,466
[NYUTABARU] I'm Director
Nyutabaru.

295
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:55,966
I take it you must be the
soldier with a medical
background?

296
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,966
[MARI] Yessir. I'm Kurokawa.

297
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,300
[NYUTABARU] Great. Wonderful.

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,833
You can start helping us right
away.

299
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,166
[MARI] M'kay...

300
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:06,166
[OFFICIAL] Okay Misery,
you're next. Go on in.

301
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:07,433
[MISERY] Thanks, hun.

302
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,200
Oh, uh...

303
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,266
[MARI] Please have a seat.

304
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:12,666
[MISERY] Haven't seen
you before.

305
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:17,233
[MARI] My name's Kurokawa.
It's nice to meet you.

306
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,233
<smoking...>

307
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,133
[MARI] So what can I do for you
today?

308
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,933
[MISERY] I'm sure you can figure
it out sweetie.

309
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:32,433
I'm a prostitute. You know what
I need.

310
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:35,233
[MARI] I do? Oh.

311
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,600
[MISERY] Thanks so much.

312
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,900
I can't believe something
like this even exists.

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,933
I mean it's a lot easier
to stay in business if
you're not knocked up.

314
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:44,433
[MARI] Yeah well...

315
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:45,900
<Hmph>

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,200
[MISERY] Lemme guess...

317
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,733
You're gonna tell me I should
quit smoking.

318
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,233
[MARI] No. It looks like you
could probably use it.

319
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,933
[MISERY] You really are an
expert.

320
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:55,966
[MARI] Besides...
you've looked pretty relaxed
since you came in.

321
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,866
That's probably best
in your line of work.

322
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:01,233
[MISERY] The two of us
just met and you're already
talking like you know me.

323
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,266
Well... At least I know there's
a safe place to go,

324
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:06,333
not much of that around here.

325
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,700
[MARI] Is it really that bad?

326
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,900
[MISERY] You don't know?

327
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,333
The name Bessala
mean anything to you?

328
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:13,000
[MARI] I'm sorry no.

329
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,200
[MISERY] Girl...

330
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,233
He's one of the big bosses
around here.

331
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:20,466
Well... He WAS one of the big
bosses anyway.

332
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,100
Until that night.

333
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,566
[BESSALA] Heh.

334
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,566
Let's teach these unwanted
guests a lesson!

335
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,500
<running, charge, death>

336
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,833
<grunt>

337
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:34,600
[BESSALA] What tha?

338
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,366
<death rattle>

339
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,233
<door swings open>

340
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,500
<screams>

341
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,300
<scream>

342
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,033
<death>

343
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,066
<death>

344
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:51,500
Who the hell are these guys?

345
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,666
<die>

346
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,133
[MISERY] Bessala and his entire
squad were wiped out in one
night.

347
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:04,733
All the other bosses gather his
money and divided it up.

348
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,366
Along with his territory.

349
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:10,400
And they agreed they'd never
try to get in the way of the
JSDF.

350
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,600
Not only that,

351
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,033
I heard they're even selling
you some information.

352
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:18,233
Even gangsters can learn to
coexist huh?

353
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,400
There's only one thing I don't
like about all this.

354
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,300
The men in the JSDF with their
big fat wallets

355
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,933
won't do any business with us.

356
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:30,433
[MISERY] It's like they don't
find us attractive or something.

357
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:33,666
I must admit it hurts my
confidence a little.

358
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:34,866
[MARI] Misery.

359
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,266
[MISERY] Yeah sweetie.

360
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:38,266
[MARI] Have you heard what
people say about Alnus?

361
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:41,533
[MISERY] Yeah. I hear it's as
close to heaven as you can get.

362
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,766
[MISERY] But you need a referral
to get in right?

363
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:45,066
[MARI] Yeah. But I could...

364
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,666
[MISERY] And besides...

365
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:50,166
My skill set... doesn't go much
further than moaning for men.

366
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,633
It's kinda my thing.

367
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:55,866
[ITAMI] Right... if you can't
care for that girl

368
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,866
until the very end...
then let her be.

369
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:00,700
[MISERY] See ya later, doc.

370
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,400
[SOLDIER] Be careful out there.

371
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,529
[ITAMI] Holy crap man...

372
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:15,229
Will you look at this
place?

373
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:18,596
[PINA] This is actually the
smallest of the homes in our
family.

374
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:21,796
But there's plenty of room. So
please rest well tonight.

375
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:24,096
[HAMILTON] It is truly wonderful
to have you back home, Your
Highness.

376
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:27,196
[ITAMI] I guess Pina really is a
princess after all, isn't she?

377
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:29,463
[TOMITA] This feels like we're
in a whole different world.

378
00:18:29,563 --> 00:18:32,029
[SHINO] well that's because it
is a whole different world.

379
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:33,129
[ITAMI] She has a point.

380
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:35,029
[SHINO] C'mon. Let's get going!

381
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:39,829
[YAO] I'd like to ask you a few
things about Itami.

382
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:41,829
[MUTY] I mean I shouldn't even
be alive.

383
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,563
I lucked out when I
got a job here.

384
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:45,896
Seriously, it was totally by
chance.

385
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:48,529
Six months ago I couldn't have
even imagined this life!

386
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,629
[YAO] Yes. Well I'd like to ask
you about Itami if I could...

387
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,196
[MUTY] Oh! Delilah! Another one
of these, please!

388
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:54,596
[DELILAH] <hm?> Alrighty!

389
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:56,563
[MUTY] Huh? What do you want to
know about Itami?

390
00:18:56,663 --> 00:19:01,396
[YAO] To be honest...
I ended up being rather rude to
him when I first met him.

391
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:03,029
[YAO] So I was wondering if
there's anything I can do

392
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:04,796
to make up for such an ugly
first impression.

393
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:07,463
[MUTY] Mmm. Yeah, yeah. I know
exactly how you feel!

394
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,863
[MUTY] Whenever I first met
Rory, I...

395
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:11,563
[YAO] Does Itami have anything
important to him?

396
00:19:11,663 --> 00:19:13,263
Something outside the JSDF?

397
00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:14,629
[MUTY] Mmm...

398
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:16,263
[YAO] Something important to
him.

399
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,763
Something he wouldn't want to
lose.

400
00:19:17,863 --> 00:19:20,063
[YAO] Something he would be
willing to sacrifice

401
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:21,629
his very life in order to
protect.

402
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:23,663
[DELILAH] Here you go! Enjoy!

403
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,496
[MUTY] Oh! You are the best
Delilah!

404
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:26,829
Thank you so much! (laughter)

405
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:29,129
[YAO] Hey! Just answer the
question!

406
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:33,129
[MUTY] Okay okay... (nervous
laughter) Take it easy...

407
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:34,763
[MUTY] Well...lemme see...

408
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:38,396
there are three people.I think.

409
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:41,363
[YAO] Three people.

410
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:44,963
[MUTY] <drinking
happiness>

411
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:48,496
[MUTY] I got the chills. I may
be drinking too much.

412
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:53,896
[MARI] <react to door>

413
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:00,196
[MARI] The clinic is closed.

414
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:01,529
[MISERY] Is that you, Kurokawa?

415
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:04,463
It's me, Misery. Can we talk?

416
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:06,829
[WHORES] <whimpering>

417
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:08,063
<notice>

418
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:13,629
[MARI] Okay, come on in.

419
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:16,396
[NYUTABARU] So you said your
name was Tuwal?

420
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:18,396
Could you explain that one more
time?

421
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,463
[TUWAL] <shy> Where I come from,

422
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:21,763
we live under a volcano.

423
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:24,063
Every time before it erupts,
the earth moves.

424
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:26,996
I've been having that same
feeling ever since this morning,

425
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:29,463
Something is coming!

426
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,729
[NYUTABARU]  grunt>

427
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:37,396
[KUWABARA] What's the matter...
Director?

428
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:39,296
[NYUTABARU] It's like when I was
deployed in Kobe...

429
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:47,696
<animal craziness>

430
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:49,829
[NYUTABARU] Right before we had
an earthquake...

431
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,929
the birds and other wildlife
panicked and started going
crazy.

432
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:54,263
[KUWABARA] What?!

433
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:55,496
[NYUTABARU] Send an emergency
message to Alnus

434
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:57,096
and each unit in
the Imperial Capital!

435
00:20:57,196 --> 00:21:00,296
We need to prepare ourselves
for a possible earthquake.

436
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:02,429
Evacuate everyone... outside the
Capital as well.

437
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,963
[NYUTABARU] Okay people.
Gather up your equipment and
regroup in five!

438
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,196
[ALL] Right. Roger that!

439
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:08,296
<yawn>

440
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:11,263
[RORY] What could be
so important in the middle
of the night?

441
00:21:11,363 --> 00:21:12,663
[TUKA] They said an
earth tremor.

442
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:14,863
My father told me about these a
long time ago.

443
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:16,529
[LELEI] I've read about these
phenomena

444
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:17,696
in the ancient texts.

445
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:18,996
[JSDF OFFICIAL] This is an
emergency.

446
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:20,163
We have reason to believe

447
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:21,229
there is an impending
earthquake...

448
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:22,229
err earth tremor!

449
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:23,696
Extinguish all open flames,

450
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:26,296
and evacuate to an open area as
quickly as you can...

451
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:28,329
[PINA] There's no way
the earth can just move!

452
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:30,029
Do you have any idea what time
it is?!

453
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:32,863
[ITAMI] Look I'm sorry.
We just know that there is
a possibility.

454
00:21:32,963 --> 00:21:35,296
[ITAMI] Damn it! I can't believe
this is happening

455
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:37,563
right before we start the
negotiations!

456
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,396
[ITAMI] Tomita!
[TOMITA] Uh‐huh. I feel it.

457
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:46,863
<rumbles>

458
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:10,063
[ITAMI] It's coming!

459
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,329
[LELEI] That night,

460
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,696
an earthquake hit
the Imperial Capital.

461
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:46,263
[LELEI] Next time on GATE:

462
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,863
The Great Quake at The
Imperial Capital.
