1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,200
[LELEI] Japan's self‐defense
force was sent the Special
Region.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,633
[LELEI] There, the 3rd Deep
Reconnaissance Unit

3
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:11,600
encountered Tuka the elf, Rory
the Reaper, and Lelei the
wizard.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,466
[LELEI] They were also joined
by the Third Princess of the
Empire, Pina CoLada,

5
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:18,933
who journeyed to Japan after
their losses at Alnus Hill and
Italica.

6
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:21,366
[LELEI] She recorded her first
impression:

7
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:24,433
[LELEI] "I came out of the Gate
separating our worlds..."

8
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:27,733
[LELEI] "...and into
the land of skyscrapers."

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,633
[BOSES] These towers... they're
so... tall.

10
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,566
[PINA] Look at that... there's
people inside.

11
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,500
[LELEI] Because of the limited
lands they've built upwards.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,033
[RORY] I suppose that means
the country is relatively small.

13
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:45,200
[LELEI] Or they simply have a
large population.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,966
[PINA] One thing's for sure...

15
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:50,500
We've discovered a country
where they make miracles
like this every day.

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,333
...and our Empire has
started a war against them.

17
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,066
(exhale, shiver)

18
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:34,933
[TUKA] Oh my, it's cold out
here.

19
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,466
[SHINO] Yeah I toldja it was
gonna be.

20
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:39,600
[YOJI] Are you OK? I can get you
a coat.

21
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,100
[TUKA] Hm? Nuh‐uh. I'm fine.

22
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,266
[SHINO] Well you just let us
know

23
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,566
when you realize you need one.

24
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,233
[TUKA]

25
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,633
[KOMAKADO] Well, there he is.

26
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:52,633
Komakado from the National
Defense Intelligence
Headquarters.

27
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:56,133
I'm here to make sure you get to
your destination in one piece.

28
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:58,466
[YOJI] So you're...
Public Security?

29
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:01,033
[KOMAKADO] (laughter)
You're so perceptive!

30
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,933
[KOMAKADO] No wonder
you're such a big hero.

31
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:04,266
[YOJI] It wasn't really
anything.

32
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:07,966
[KOMAKADO] Well not
everyone agrees do they?

33
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,700
[KOMAKADO]
I did a little reading.

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,900
Says here you were second to
last

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,566
in the basic officer's course.

36
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,100
Lucky for you one of your
colleagues was injured
and dropped out.

37
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,733
[KOMAKADO] It also says here
they wanted to keep you as a
sub‐lieutenant for a while.

38
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,066
But that your commander go so
frustrated with you

39
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,666
he sent you to Ranger School
but somehow managed to pass.

40
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:26,866
Then here we go...
transferred to Narashino...

41
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,233
Where your superiors were
content

42
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,433
to leave you at Second
Lieutenant, but then...

43
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:33,266
[KOMAKADO] Then there was the
famous Ginza Incident.

44
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:35,333
Where you received a meritorious
promotion in spite of yourself.

45
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,233
[YOJI] Give the man a gold star.

46
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,366
[KOMAKADO] (laughs)
"Underachiever"... "juvenile"...

47
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,766
and those're just the
highlights. (laughs)

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,900
(nasal exhale)

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,233
[KOMAKADO] A Ranger, maybe.

50
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,833
But why the Special Forces?

51
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:50,266
(breath catch)

52
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,300
[SHINO] Huh? Wh‐? Whaaat?!

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,433
[YOJI] (nasal exhale) K.
You get TWO gold stars.

54
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,466
[YOJI] Check it out.

55
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,166
You kick one lazy ant out
of an army,

56
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,133
another one sloughs off to take
its place.

57
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,700
It's just one of those things in
nature.

58
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,100
[KOMAKADO] You're saying the
military needs lazy soldiers?

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
[YOJI] All I know...

60
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,533
is I tried telling the colonel

61
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,766
that story when he was chewing
my ass...

62
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,100
[KOMAKADO] And you wound up

63
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,666
with even more responsibility.

64
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:18,466
[YOJI] I guess my logic got all
twisted around.

65
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,200
[KOMAKADO] (laughs) Who knows.

66
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,000
Perhaps they need someone like
you.

67
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,600
Sometimes it's better to simply
not do anything.

68
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,466
(maniacal laughter)

69
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:31,200
[SHINO] No! That's a lie!
Tell me it's a lie!

70
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,733
[SHINO] This idiot's a Ranger

71
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,300
and he's in special forces
too?!?

72
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,833
(laughs)
[YOJI] S'not that funny.

73
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:38,066
[KOMAKADO] There's more to you

74
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,666
than you let on, isn't there?

75
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,033
Uhh...It takes a lotta guts

76
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,100
to be the lazy one when everyone
else is working.

77
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,100
Kinda respect you for that.

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,633
[SHINO] You're lying.
You're lying.

79
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:50,466
You're lying to me!

80
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:51,266
It's all a dream,

81
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:52,100
just a terrible awful dream.

82
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,000
It's not possible.

83
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,966
I'm ready to wake up.

84
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,600
[YOJI] Let's go all right?

85
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,133
[LELEI] So many of them.

86
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,100
[RORY] Could be a market or
something like that.

87
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,266
[TUKA] Maybe a faire?

88
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,666
[TUKA] Oh wow... look at that.

89
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:09,300
[LELEI] They put decorations all
over that tree.

90
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,466
[RORY] Perhaps they're some sort
of good luck charms.

91
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:13,233
[TOMITA] Isn't this a bit off
our route?

92
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,533
[YOJI] Yeah just a tad.

93
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:18,566
We gotta get her...
something else to wear.

94
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,766
[SHINO] Wow girl!
You've got one of those perfect
hot bodies you make me sick.

95
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,500
You ladies wanna get something
too?

96
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,566
[LELEI] I'm fine.

97
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,033
[RORY] I don't think so.

98
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,433
This is the Oracle's
formal attire.

99
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:33,000
[YOJI] Ah... and make sure
National Defense gets the bill.

100
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:34,966
[WAITER] Here you go.

101
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:37,033
[TOMITA] Why the beef bowl?

102
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,366
[YOJI] Because this is
considered

103
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,166
a business trip until the day of
the summons.

104
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:42,400
And they're only giving us 500
yen per meal.

105
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,000
[SHINO] At least you're a cheap
date.

106
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,700
(pensive)

107
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,866
[BOSES] An egg...?

108
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:49,900
[PINA] Are we supposed to eat it
raw?

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,333
(trembles)

110
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:52,833
[BOSES] Princess!

111
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,166
[PINA] Boses. Eat it.

112
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,200
You're not going to be
any good to me in there

113
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,066
if you're hungry and losing
focus.

114
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,600
[BOSES] Yes ma'am.

115
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,000
(nervous) (chomp/chews)

116
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,700
(surprised)

117
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
(cooing)

118
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,733
(happy chews)

119
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:11,700
(happy chews)

120
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:22,233
[PINA] So this is the Japanese
Senate.

121
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,233
Are we not getting off here
Sergeant?

122
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,666
[TOMITA] Technically, 'we' are
not doing anything, Princess...

123
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:34,166
you're not here... in fact I
don't even know who you are.

124
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:39,600
[SHIRAYURI] I am Reiko
Shirayuri, welcome to Japan,
Ladies.

125
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,066
And this is Koji Sugiwara, he's
from Foreign Affairs.

126
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,400
Please. Have a seat.

127
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:49,333
[SHIRAYURI] This in and of
itself is not the peace
conference.

128
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,633
That being said... we're using
this platform to discuss the
manner

129
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:55,700
in which our two entities will
be negotiating in the future.

130
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,533
[SHIRAYURI] In the hopes of
helping things go smoothly

131
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,733
[PINA] It should be fine.

132
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,066
[ANCHOR] Four months have passed
since the Ginza Incident.

133
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,500
Today, there will be the first
question‐and‐answer period at
the Diet.

134
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,300
Several unsworn witnesses have
been invited to testify;

135
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,833
a member of the on‐site forces
and a few

136
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,633
Special Region locals who are
under military protection.

137
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:18,000
[REPORTER] Oh, the witnesses
are entering the room right now!

138
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,000
[CHAIRMAN] Ladies and gentlemen,

139
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,700
we will now begin questioning
the witnesses.

140
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:38,666
[KOHARA] I'm going to be as
straightforward as possible...

141
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,466
[KOHARA] The self defense force
gave us reports

142
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:42,166
regarding an incident with a
"dragon..."

143
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:44,466
A creature which attacked you.

144
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:48,733
As well as caused the deaths of
150 civilians.

145
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,766
[CHAIRMAN] Lieutenant Itami.

146
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,600
[YOJI] Yeah... well uh...

147
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,300
[YOJI] It was a dragon, it was
really big and scary.

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,266
[KOHARA] And... what do you mean
by that Lieutenant?

149
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,500
People are dead, don't you think
you and the self defense force

150
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,400
could have done more to protect
them?!

151
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,033
[YOJI] I certainly have regrets
that

152
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,500
so many people died that day,
ma'am... However...

153
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,233
[YOJI] We didn't really have any
way to stop it.

154
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,366
[KOHARA] So then... are you
telling me that the self defense
force is incapable?

155
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:27,633
[YOJI] No... I'm saying we
didn't have the firepower.
[KOHARA]

156
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,100
[YOJI] I mean the machine guns
we had available to us

157
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,366
didn't help much, Senator.

158
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:33,933
Neither the 30 caliber nor
the 50 calibers

159
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:35,133
did any damage to it.

160
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:37,000
[YOJI] We needed stuff like
railguns

161
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,000
and laser cannons and
graviton bombs.

162
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,766
[WATANABE] Ah...Mr. Chairman.

163
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:44,200
The Self Defense Force brought
back samples for examination.

164
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,600
And they're pretty tough...

165
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,200
it has scales stronger than
tungsten sheets.

166
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,333
[WATANABE] And they actually
breathe fire.

167
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:54,033
It's almost as if they're some
sort of flying tanks.

168
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,133
[WATANABE] They were faced with
such a creature,

169
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,333
and you're telling them not to
expect casualties?

170
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:01,433
That's kind of an unrealistic
expectation, don't you think?

171
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:03,733
[KOHARA] Very well then.

172
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:07,933
[KOHARA] Now... I'd like to call
Lelei La Lelena to take the
stand.

173
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,200
Do you understand
Japanese?

174
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,000
[LELEI] Yes, a little.

175
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,533
[GUY] She seems pretty young.

176
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:14,466
[GAL] Is she a wizard?

177
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:15,766
[KOHARA] Then let's get
started...

178
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,033
I want to take a moment

179
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,800
to address living conditions
at the camp...

180
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,266
Do you have any
restrictions there?

181
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,866
[LELEI] I'm not sure what you
mean by "restrictions..."

182
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:25,600
Isn't that every single human
being?

183
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,200
We're all born into this world
with some kind of restrictions.

184
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,400
[KOHARA] (frustrated) Let me
rephrase it for you...

185
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,633
Are you lacking any of life's
basic necessities at the camp?

186
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:38,200
[LELEI] Well, no...
we have plenty of food,
clothing and shelter...

187
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,233
there's really nothing missing I
guess.

188
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,966
We never seem to run out of
anything.

189
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,933
[KOHARA] Really... You don't
feel the SDF,

190
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,733
which was described as
ill‐equipped,

191
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,000
is responsible for the 150
victims?

192
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,600
[LELEI] No.

193
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,266
[TUKA] I'm an elf from the
Forest of Lodo,

194
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:57,833
The daughter of Hodrew...
Tuka Luna Marceau.

195
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:58,666
[GAL] Did she say "elf"?

196
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,066
[GUY] Seriously?

197
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,766
[KOHARA] I'm sorry but I'm
afraid I have to ask...

198
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,400
are those ears actually real?

199
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,400
[LELEI] "Are those your real
ears?"

200
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,766
[TUKA] Sure... these are my
ears.

201
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,700
Do you wanna touch them?

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,100
[ALL] Wow!
[CHAIRMAN] Quiet! Order please!

203
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,066
[KOHARA] A...ahem.

204
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,966
[KOHARA] Miss Tuka.

205
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,600
When you were attacked by the
dragon,

206
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,066
did you witness the SDF soldiers
doing anything inappropriate?

207
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,966
[TUKA] Uh... I... can't say.

208
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:31,466
I was... unconscious at the
time.

209
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:32,600
(exhales)

210
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,833
[KOHARA] Very well then.

211
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,366
The next witness please!

212
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:39,966
[CHAIRMAN] Miss Mercury,
will you please take the stand.

213
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,800
[KOHARA] Dressed in black
and a veil...

214
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,900
in mourning perhaps?

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,100
now I've got you.

216
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,566
[KOHARA] Please state your name.

217
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,266
[RORY] Rory Mercury.

218
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:50,566
[KOHARA] Please tell us what
your life is like

219
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,633
in the Alnus Hill camp.

220
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,266
[RORY] It's simple really.

221
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:57,000
In the morning when I wake, I
pray.

222
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,333
And then... Then well I take
some lives. Then pray.

223
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,233
And when night comes, I go to
sleep.

224
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,966
[KOHARA] What do you mean "take
some lives?"

225
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,700
[RORY] I kill... I kill people
for my Lord's sake.

226
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,600
He is the God of death... it's
kind of his thing.

227
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,733
[KOHARA] (nasal exhale) Let's...
try a different question.

228
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,300
You appear to me to be a person

229
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,233
who's lost someone dear to them
recently.

230
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:22,766
Is it safe to say the self
defense forces are to blame for
that?

231
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,766
[LELEI] She says she doesn't
understand the meaning of your
question...

232
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:26,933
Rory's entire family is... Uh!

233
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:28,200
[KOHARA] According to the
report...

234
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,800
When the dragon attacked...

235
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,000
it killed one hundred and fifty
people fleeing the village...

236
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,333
but not a single soldier was
killed or injured during that
engagement.

237
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:39,033
[KOHARA] The self defense force
is supposed to risk their lives

238
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,400
and fight for those
who are in danger!

239
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,633
But here... they chose to
run from that fight

240
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:46,666
and cost people their lives!
[RORY] (breath catch)

241
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,100
(gasp)

242
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,733
[KOHARA] Heh... So.. you need to
tell us everything!

243
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,433
[KOHARA] Tell us what you saw!
Tell us what they did!

244
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,000
Tell us the truth.

245
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,866
[RORY] <breath> Are you a
goddamn idiot?!

246
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:15,233
[mike feedback]
(painful)

247
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,933
[KOHARA] Uh... Huh... excuse me?

248
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,233
[RORY] I believe you heard my
question.

249
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,833
You're probably asked that a
lot.

250
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:27,233
[RORY] Little Miss Thing...

251
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:39,890
[KOHARA] You speak... Japanese?

252
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,823
[RORY] (giggle) Well look
who just caught up.

253
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:46,823
[RORY] I assume what you really
want to know

254
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,055
is how Itami and his people
fought against the dragon,
am I right?

255
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,271
[RORY] They did everything they
could... and then some.

256
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,571
[RORY] They did not hide in
their carriages

257
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:54,904
nor behind any civilians.

258
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:58,437
[RORY] I tell you they did
nothing of the sort.

259
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:00,871
[RORY] Let's get to the point,
shall we?

260
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:02,571
There are times when a soldier

261
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:04,037
must protect their own life.

262
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:05,937
You sit here safe and
comfortable,

263
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:08,137
and accuse others of being
cowards.

264
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:12,804
If you ask me you're the coward
Little Miss Thing.

265
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:15,104
[KOHARA] What did you call me...
Mmmph..

266
00:13:15,204 --> 00:13:16,937
[RORY] They faced a flame
dragon...

267
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,204
And lived to tell the tale.

268
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:20,004
[RORY] So... you should offer
them praise

269
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:21,204
for pulling off such a feat.

270
00:13:21,304 --> 00:13:23,237
You demonstrate a
rather creative way

271
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:26,937
of manipulating numbers
to make them look
a certain way don't you?

272
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:30,537
[RORY] Your Self Defense Force
SAVED four hundred and fifty
people.

273
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:31,871
[RORY] I can only imagine

274
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:34,104
the problems the soldiers in
this country face

275
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:36,571
if this is how they are treated.

276
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:40,437
[RORY] Itami and his team
accomplished something no one
has ever done.

277
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:44,504
[RORY] And that... is my answer
to that stupid question of
yours.

278
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:49,004
[RORY] Is that truth enough for
you, Little Miss Thing?

279
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:53,737
(seething)

280
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:55,037
[KOHARA] It looks like someone

281
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:56,737
forgot to teach you how to speak
to an adult.

282
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,037
"Little Miss Thing."

283
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,804
[RORY] You're not talking about
me are you?

284
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,504
[KOHARA] Of course I'm talking
about you!

285
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:03,371
I don't know how things are in
the Special Region,

286
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:06,704
but in this country we respect
our elders!

287
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,171
[RORY] Oh, I am
going to love this.

288
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:13,204
[YOJI] Ehhhh! Mr. Chairman!

289
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:15,404
There has been a huge
misunderstanding!

290
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:17,104
[RORY] Hmph... What do you think
you're doing?

291
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:20,271
[YOJI] Just put that thing away,
okay? Dear God.

292
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:22,337
[YOJI] Ahem... I should take
this opportunity

293
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:25,004
to let the Diet know
that Miss Mercury is actually

294
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:27,437
the eldest person in attendance
here today.

295
00:14:27,537 --> 00:14:31,071
[KOHARA] Hmph! And just how old
is she supposed to be?

296
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,904
[RORY] 961 of your years, honey.

297
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,271
[KOHARA] Huh...?! Nine hundred?!

298
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:41,104
And... just how old do you
happen to be, Miss Marceau?

299
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:42,904
[TUKA] One hundred sixty five.

300
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:45,437
[KOHARA] Uhhhh... What about
you...?

301
00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:46,637
[LELEI] I'm fifteen.

302
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,971
(sigh)

303
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:52,204
[LELEI] And I'm human.

304
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:53,771
[LELEI] Where I come from...

305
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,604
we live around seventy years...

306
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:59,704
In fact, most of the people in
my world are humans.

307
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:00,937
[LELEI] Tuka is an elf,

308
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:03,037
and elves have incredibly long
lifespans.

309
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:06,537
Those of her kind have the
potential to live forever.

310
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:08,671
[LELEI] Rory started out as a
human being,

311
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:12,671
but her body stopped aging when
she became a demigod and an
oracle.

312
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:15,804
[LELEI] A demigod will abandon
her body after a thousand years,

313
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:19,271
transforming into a spiritual
apostle and eventually a god.

314
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:22,337
She has no concept of "life
expectancy".

315
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:23,337
(astonished)

316
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:25,537
(surprised)

317
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:33,271
z[CHAIRMAN] Do you have any more
questions, Ms Kohara?

318
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:35,137
[KOHARA] (deflated sound) I
guess I don't.

319
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,737
[SUGAWARA] Lastly, regarding
the treatment of war prisoners.

320
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:43,271
We are currently holding
officers and soldiers from your
country.

321
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,537
We have approximately six
thousand detained.

322
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:47,704
[PINA] Oh... my... [BOSES] (OM
breath catch)

323
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:50,971
[SUGAWARA] We're prepared to
start sending some of them back
to you.

324
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,804
Feel free to offer a list of
priorities.

325
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:54,237
[PINA] And what will that cost
us exactly?

326
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:56,037
[SHIRAYURI] Oh nothing of
course...

327
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:58,004
we do not adhere to the barbaric
practice

328
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,271
of holding other people's
countrymen hostage.

329
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:02,004
[SHIRAYURI] However... we might
end up

330
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:03,537
asking for a few concessions.

331
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:05,304
[SUGAWARA] The names of the POWs
are here.

332
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:10,137
We should be able to repatriate
a few of them right away.

333
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,337
[BOSES] There are many of our
senators missing...

334
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:14,904
and several nobles belonging to
the Empire.

335
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:16,471
[BOSES] If they're really being
held prisoner...

336
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:17,404
[PINA] Yes yes I know...

337
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:19,004
if we were to help them get
out...

338
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,971
it would be seen as a favor.

339
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:23,771
[PINA] That's what he's saying.

340
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,337
[PINA] Give me some time to
look...

341
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:28,171
we'll need to consider who we
would like released.

342
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:29,804
[SUGAWARA] Very well, then.

343
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:31,871
It looks like we're done for
today.

344
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,304
(exhale, relieved)

345
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:35,537
[SHIRAYURI] Your Highness...

346
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:36,704
(breath catch)

347
00:16:36,804 --> 00:16:39,771
It was a pleasure to meet you
today.

348
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:41,737
[TOMITA] It's how we greet each
other...

349
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:42,937
go ahead and take her hand.

350
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:45,071
[PINA] Okay.

351
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:49,104
[SHIRAYURI] I hope this is
simply the start...

352
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:51,171
of a long relationship together.

353
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:54,771
[PINA] I'll do what I can of
course.

354
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:57,537
[REPORTER] We're just now
starting to see the inhabitants
of the Special Region

355
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:59,237
come out of the Diet building
after the summons.

356
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:01,737
They appear to be moving to a
new venue.

357
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,637
[PS.GUY] Whoa!
(breath catch)

358
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:13,071
(screech)

359
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,937
[KOMAKADO] Unit one checking
in...

360
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:23,571
our guests have changed their
location.

361
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:25,604
(surprised)

362
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:26,904
(frightened)

363
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,037
[LELEI] It opened.

364
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:30,404
[YOJI] Yes, it did.

365
00:17:31,004 --> 00:17:32,204
Let's get going guys!

366
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:34,604
Come on now! We don't have a
lotta time!

367
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:36,771
[YOJI] Come on!

368
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:38,204
(sigh)

369
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:46,271
[YOJI] And, I look like one of
those

370
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:47,871
shady internet talent scouts.

371
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:49,437
[TOMITA] Lieutenant...

372
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:52,771
[YOJI] Hey. Good work, man.
[TOMITA] Almost didn't make it.

373
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,237
I wasn't aware that the bus was
a decoy... I got lucky back
there.

374
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:57,871
[YOJI] Well.. we got everyone
back together

375
00:17:57,971 --> 00:17:59,104
so it's all good.

376
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,471
[SHINO] Maybe for you but not
for them.

377
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:02,237
They're scared to
death of the tunnel.

378
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:04,037
[SHINO] I mean they keep saying
something about

379
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:05,404
being dragged into the abyss.

380
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:07,804
[YOJI] It's everyone's first
time on a subway...

381
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:09,337
just give'em a chance.

382
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:13,737
[BOSES] Mmm... Pardon me.

383
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:14,671
[TOMITA] It's fine...

384
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,937
[YOJI] What's the matter? Are
you okay?

385
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:21,004
[RORY] No it's just that the
underground reaches

386
00:18:21,104 --> 00:18:22,037
are Hardy's territory!

387
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:23,104
[YOJI] Who's... Hardy?

388
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,204
[RORY] She is completely nuts!

389
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,437
She asked me to marry her 200
years ago.

390
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:31,204
And she demanded over and over
and over again!

391
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:34,404
[RORY] I just don't want to be
close to anyone right now!

392
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:36,904
[YOJI] OK... so why are you
getting so close to me?

393
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:38,937
[RORY] So she won't come near
me.

394
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:40,771
[RORY] She absolutely despises
men.

395
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,704
So if I am around you maybe she
won't come around me!

396
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:47,404
[YOJI ] Uh‐uh. That's not how I
think that would work out.

397
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:51,504
[YOJI] "I'm just... trying my
best to blend in here..."

398
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:54,437
"With my man... my big strong
handsome muscle man..."

399
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:55,237
[YOJI] 'Bout right?

400
00:18:55,337 --> 00:18:56,637
[SHINO] I'm gonna throw up!

401
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:59,704
[F.PA] Kasumigaseki Station.
Kasumigaseki Station.

402
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,450
[KOMAKADO] Hey, stranger.

403
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:10,850
[KOMAKADO] Let's push things up
and head to Hakone.

404
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,517
We'll stay on this
line until Tokyo...

405
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:14,617
[YOJI] What about the bus?

406
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:16,250
[KOMAKADO] It served its
purpose.

407
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,083
Whoever the mole is didn't know
about the change,

408
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:20,717
and so I've got our potential
leak

409
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:22,350
narrowed down to two at this
point.

410
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,217
[KOMAKADO] So... we'll let him
run himself ragged

411
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:25,850
trying to figure out where we'll
be next.

412
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,650
[RORY] Itami!
We must get out of here!

413
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,950
Please! I need some air!

414
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,117
[YOJI] Just give it a bit. At
the next stop, okay?

415
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:38,217
[RORY] But...
I have to... please

416
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:42,283
[RORY] Please...! You need
to get me out of here!

417
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:47,983
[P.A.] Transfer available
for Hibiya Line and Ginza Line.

418
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:50,850
[YOJI] All right... let's get
off here.

419
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,217
[KOMAKADO] Huh? What?

420
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,517
(run efforts)

421
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:57,650
[KOMAKADO] Hey! You can't change
your stops! Stick to the plan!
Stick to the plan!

422
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,717
[M.PA] Attention Tokyo Metro
passengers

423
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:00,417
[M.PA] The Marunouchi Line

424
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:01,917
is currently out of service

425
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:04,883
due to a wiring problem between
Ginza and Tokyo.

426
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:06,050
[M.PA] Service will resume

427
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,017
as soon as the issue is
resolved.

428
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:09,817
[M.PA] The Marunouchi Line
is currently out of service

429
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,250
due to a wiring problem between
Ginza and Tokyo.

430
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,683
(big stretch)

431
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:15,150
[RORY] The air isn't all that
fresh,

432
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,917
but it's 10,000 times better
than underground!

433
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,750
[YOJI] Stopping the subway.
So what're they after, anyway.

434
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,917
[KOMAKADO] To show us they can
do it.

435
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:26,883
They want to let us know we're
not safe anywhere... but...

436
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,550
They've shown they don't really

437
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,150
know where we are, either.

438
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,083
Next time they won't be able to
do something

439
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:34,617
that can just be passed off as
some kind of accident.

440
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:35,917
[KOMAKADO] For example...
[RORY] Excuse me.

441
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:39,283
[KOMAKADO] Yeah, kinda
like that guy. Yeah.

442
00:20:39,383 --> 00:20:40,717
(stumble/splat)

443
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,283
[KOMAKADO] Eh... direct, but not
too bright.

444
00:20:45,383 --> 00:20:46,250
[KOMAKADO] Amateurs.

445
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,483
[YOJI] Uh... Be careful...

446
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,917
[KOMAKADO] Hm? What now?

447
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:51,283
[KOMAKADO] (back cracked reax)

448
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:54,117
[CROWD] (was it an accident?)

449
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:56,550
[RORY] Mister Creepy Pants
probably should've known better.

450
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,250
[LELEI] Well he's not a demigod,
Rory.

451
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,617
[KOMAKADO] Keep going

452
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,450
till you get to Ichigaya, all
right?

453
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,917
[TOMITA] Are you about ready to
get moving, sir?
