1
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:02,400
[LELEI] Japan's Self Defense
Force

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,600
was dispatched to the
mysterious Special Region.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,166
[LELEI] Where their Emperor has
unexpectedly collapsed

4
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:08,833
and Prince Zorzal has taken
power,

5
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:10,133
[LELEI] Hunting down all those

6
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:12,266
supporting peace talks with
Japan.

7
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:15,000
[LELEI] Lelei, while in the
magicians city of Rondel,

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,133
barely escapes an assassination
attempt.

9
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:18,466
[LELEI] She and her friends have
fled

10
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:20,600
and are now on the move to a new
location.

11
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,766
<hmmm>

12
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,566
[LELEI] Itami... um what are you
doing?

13
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:29,300
[ITAMI] Well Lelei. I'm deciding
which way we'll be going next.

14
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,966
[ITAMI] And today, it's this way

15
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,533
[LELEI] I don't think we'll find
any resources

16
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:35,800
if we go this
direction.

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,300
[ITAMI] That's not exactly our
priority.

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,766
Right now, we have to get away
from the assassin, okay.

19
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:42,400
[ITAMI] Like this... No one will
know which way we're going.

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,166
We need to be as unpredictable
as we can.

21
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:46,566
[LELEI] So we don't even really
know ourselves.

22
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,700
<laughing>

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,100
[ITAMI] Bingo that's exactly
right.

24
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:57,533
[ITAMI] M'kay! Let's get a
move‐on.

25
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,133
[KANO] What the hell is this?

26
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,866
[COUNSELOR GLASSES] Prince
Zorzal

27
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:37,666
has issued a new law
called the Oprichinya.

28
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,966
Because oppression towards
anyone threatening his power

29
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:41,366
is becoming stronger
within the Capital.

30
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:44,333
[KANO] He is turning this into a
reign of terror.

31
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:48,600
What does... this
Oprichnina Law mean anyway?

32
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,633
[COUNSELOR GLASSES] It's an
ancient political tactic.

33
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:53,166
It states that "A committee can
vindicate and recover

34
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,300
the sovereignty and
authority of the Emperor."

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,866
[KANO] Sounds rather vague, but
gives him power to do

36
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:59,933
whatever he wants to "protect
the empire."

37
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:01,166
[COUNSELOR BAGS] That it does.

38
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,933
Pro‐peace representatives and
nobles

39
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:04,500
are being arrested one
after another.

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
[COUNSELOR BAGS] Many of which
have asked us

41
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,633
to keep them under
our protection.

42
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:10,433
Not a chance! There's
no way we can take them in!

43
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:14,300
If we were to get involved
in this... it antagonizes
the Empire.

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,566
[COUNSELOR GLASSES] Yes but...

45
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,766
[KANO] The time will come

46
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:18,066
when we can make a move.

47
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,133
But until then...
we stay under their radar.

48
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,966
[KANO] Advise our men how to
proceed.

49
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:24,300
[KAMO] Lieutenant General!

50
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,900
Are you abandoning our
most loyal supporters?!

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,866
[KAMO] Call in the 1st Combat
Team.

52
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,433
Send us out on a rescue mission!

53
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:33,100
[KAMO] We can save everyone from
the Imperial Capital!

54
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,866
[KENGUN] Sir! Order the 4th
Combat Team to go.

55
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,600
[KENGUN] Do it from the air. A
heliborne assault can get this
over with quickly.

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,233
[HAZAMA] Just settle down! We're
going to have to wait.

57
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,933
The higher‐ups will ever approve
something like that.

58
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,500
[KENGUN] But sir...

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,333
[HAZAMA] Look, no one is telling
us to abandon them.

60
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:51,600
[HAZAMA] The best you can do is
to keep yourselves ready,

61
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,466
so you can move quickly once the
orders have been issued. Is that
understood?

62
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,200
[BOTH] Yes, sir!

63
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,033
[PINA] I see. The Marquis Casel
is alive and has taken refuge
with the Tuelis.

64
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:06,533
[HAMILTON] He seems to be safe
for the time being. But it's
difficult to say for how long.

65
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,700
[PINA] There's nothing I can do
at the moment.

66
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
[HAMILTON] Sorry Your
Highness...

67
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,500
[PINA] How did I.. become so
powerless?

68
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:22,000
[SHERRY] Sir Marquis. Would you
like to have a little more soup?

69
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,200
[CASEL] I think I've had enough,
thank you.

70
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,366
<door> [MAID] Sir! Madam!
We're in trouble!

71
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,433
[MAID] It's the Oprichinia. The
"Sweepers" are coming,

72
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:31,633
they're on the way, they're
almost here at the house!

73
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:32,566
<react>

74
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,733
<screaming>

75
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,766
[SHERRY'S FATHER] Sherry.
You will take care of the
Marquis Casel!

76
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,233
[SHERRY] But what about you and
Mommy?

77
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,700
[SHERRY'S FATHER] Don't worry.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,533
Your mother and I will be coming
right behind you dear.

79
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:48,166
[SHERRY] OK Father. Please
Casel. Come along!

80
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,733
[SHERRY'S FATHER] If she can
just survive this raid.

81
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,833
The Tuelis will live on.

82
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,133
[SHERRY'S MOTHER] Yes.

83
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,200
[GIMLET] Hello... I'm Gimlet
from the Imperial Protection
Committee.

84
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,266
[GIMLET] You are being placed
under arrest on suspicion of
imperial infringement.

85
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,400
[GIMLET] Submit to us now.

86
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,333
[SHERRY'S FATHER] Submit, huh?
Well.. What say you?

87
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,833
[SHERRY'S MOTHER] Oh hon. Why
don't we ask these nice
gentlemen

88
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,166
if they would like something to
drink?

89
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,600
[SHERRY'S FATHER]
You're so right.

90
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,700
Failing to offer drinks
to our lovely guests...

91
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,833
would be a shame that would
taint our family name forever.

92
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:28,966
<react>

93
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,433
[SWEEPERS] You son of a bitch!

94
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:35,133
Please. This little stunt
won't buy you any more time.

95
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,300
<pissed>

96
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,000
<breathing>

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,666
[SHERRY] Father...

98
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,033
[CASEL] Dear god.

99
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,066
[CASEL] No you can't go back!

100
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,933
[SHERRY] Get your hands off me!

101
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,233
My parents are in there!

102
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,833
[SHERRY] Let me go! Mommy!
Daddy!

103
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,200
<slap>

104
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,200
[CASEL] Do not let their
sacrifice be in vain!

105
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:33,300
<whimper>

106
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,566
[GIMLET] This was found after
the fire, it leads to a sewer.

107
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,900
[GIMLET] Casel, and the daughter
of the Tuelis must have fled
through here.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,933
[RUFLUS] Are you saying you
failed to capture who we were
after?

109
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,233
[GIMLET] They set their own
house on fire.

110
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,200
[THULE] Are you neglecting your
duties?

111
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,100
[THULE] Or is it, that all your
talk of undying loyalty is
actually a farce.

112
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,233
[THULE] Deep in your heart,
are you quietly questioning
Prince Zorzal's judgment?

113
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,533
[RUFLUS] No. That is not it at
all.

114
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:02,700
[THULE] Then prove it. Show that
you put the Empire above all
else.

115
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,066
[THULE] Before I decide to
report your unfortunate blunder
to His Highness.

116
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,633
[RUFLUS] This is the exit of the
underground passage.

117
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:14,200
Close all the streets within a 2
league radius from here,

118
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,866
and search every single building
inside.

119
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:18,366
[THE SWEEPER] Of course sir
but...

120
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:20,900
we don't have enough manpower
for an area that large.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,633
[GIMLET] I pretty sure you'll
find...

122
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,633
that you will only need to
search a few houses.

123
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,033
[RUFLUS] Why do you say that?

124
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:29,433
[GIMLET] I think if we make
enough noise in town,

125
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,366
[GIMLET] Then The Marquis Casel
will be compelled to make a
move.

126
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:34,900
[RUFLUS] So we smoke the rat
out.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,900
[GIMLET] And we will purposely
leave a hole

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,466
big enough for him to crawl
through.

129
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:41,366
[RUFLUS] He will emerge exactly
where we want him. Yes.

130
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:45,133
I like it! Let's implement this
plan of yours right away.

131
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:49,233
[GIMLET] Right! But there is one
thing... Jade Palace is well
within the 2 league radius.

132
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:53,166
And it is protected under
Princess Pina's
Order of the Rose,

133
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:59,266
[GIMLET] If they decided to go
there for help, things could get
complicated.

134
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,433
[RUFLUS] No need to worry.

135
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:03,866
[RUFLUS] Even though she may be
the princess.

136
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:08,233
She must follow Oprichnina law,
or she will be considered an
insurgent.

137
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,933
[RUFLUS] Proceed with
confidence.

138
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,366
[SWEEPERS] Will do.

139
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:15,533
[THULE] Boulo.

140
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,233
[BOULO] Yes, my dear?

141
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,066
[THULE] It's time to make things
interesting.

142
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,033
[BOULO] Anything for you.

143
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,366
<laughing>

144
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,700
<single laugh>

145
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:38,233
[CASEL] I guess I should have
accepted seconds whenever you
offered me earlier.

146
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:42,466
[SHERRY] I'm hungry too. What
can we do about getting some
food?

147
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,766
[SHERRY] We must eat something.

148
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,300
[SHERRY] I'll go and find some
provisions.

149
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,666
<surprise>

150
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:58,466
[RED TURBAN] Can I help you?

151
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:01,200
[SHERRY] I'm wondering if you
can spare something to eat.

152
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,033
[RED TURBAN] Oh yeah and what
can you give me?
[SHERRY] How about two of these?

153
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:07,966
[RED TURBAN] Sorry, that's not
gonna be enough.
[SHERRY] How about four then?

154
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:12,300
[RED TURBAN] Hmph... How about
you give me all you've got and
maybe I'll think about it.

155
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,500
[SHERRY] I wouldn't mind that,
but it could cause great discord
within your household.

156
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,400
[RED TURBAN] How so?
[SHERRY] This one was made
for a small child,

157
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,533
so if you were to give it
as a gift for your wife,

158
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:24,133
you would need 10 more to
complete the necklace.

159
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:25,633
[RED TURBAN] Then I'll just use
two of them

160
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,933
to make her some earrings
and then sell all the rest.

161
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,100
Maybe so... But women can be
awfully greedy

162
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,500
when it comes to jewelry
from their husbands.

163
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,200
[SHERRY] She would only want
more so that she could

164
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,266
have a beautiful necklace to go
with her new earrings.

165
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,800
[SHERRY] If that happens,
who do you think she would be
pestering?

166
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,100
Just imagine the
insufferable whining.

167
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,900
[RED TURBAN] I uh...

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,266
[SHERRY] Perhaps you should
settle

169
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,266
for five of these gorgeous
pearls.

170
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,466
[RED TURBAN] Little lady, how
old are you?

171
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:51,766
[SHERRY] I'm 12, sir.

172
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:55,000
[RED TURBAN] You're gonna be a
force when you get older.

173
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,333
[RED TURBAN] Here. This is all I
have.

174
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,700
<react>

175
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,600
[SHERRY] Is this from... Japan?

176
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,266
[RED TURBAN] Yes. It is.

177
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:09,200
I've been working as a footman
over at Jade Palace.

178
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,300
[RED TURBAN] I get some of their
leftovers sometimes.

179
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,933
[SHERRY] Do you know... if the
delegates are okay?

180
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:17,566
[RED TURBAN] Uh‐huh.
They are protected under
Princess Pina's Order,

181
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,566
as long as they stay inside,
they should be safe.

182
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,700
[SHERRY] Well that's good to
know.

183
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,833
[RED TURBAN] Listen... The
guards there switch

184
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,300
twice a day, every morning and
evening.

185
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,766
[RED TURBAN] When they do...

186
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:34,333
Their security ends up
shorthanded for a brief period.

187
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,633
What?

188
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,033
[RED TURBAN] Now be safe.

189
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:42,566
[SHERRY] Thank you very much.

190
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:49,266
And thank you for giving me the
pearls Sugawara.

191
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,400
It's all to see you again.

192
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,466
Please understand... my husband.

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,966
[SHERRY] Um...Marquis.

194
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,933
[CASEL] Yes what is it, Sherry?

195
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,266
[SHERRY] We should go into
exile.

196
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:14,666
[CASEL] What are you talking
about?

197
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:17,166
[CASEL] We're completely
surrounded by all sides.

198
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:19,966
It's not possible to get out of
the Imperial Capital.

199
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:21,833
[SHERRY] There's no need for us
to try to get out.

200
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:25,366
There is a foreign entity right
here within the Capital.

201
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:27,066
[CASEL] You mean the Jade
Palace.

202
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,900
[SHERRY] Yes! It is protected
by a diplomatic accord.

203
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,166
In other words.

204
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:34,533
No one from the Empire can touch
us there.

205
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,833
[CASEL] But Sherry, would the
Japanese delegates

206
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:39,000
even accept us into their
territory?

207
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,933
[SHERRY] Right now, we must

208
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,933
throw ourselves at Sugawara's
mercy.

209
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:48,633
[CASEL] That would
cost him. A lot.

210
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,033
He and his people could get into

211
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,500
a great deal of trouble trying
to help us.

212
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,766
[SHERRY] Marquis Casel.

213
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:57,233
I am going to get revenge for
the death of my parents.

214
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,700
[SHERRY] But in order to do
that,

215
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,200
I will need great power behind
me.

216
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,900
[CASEL] Sherry please. Listen.

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,833
[CASEL] Do you have any idea
what that means.

218
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,233
The consequences.

219
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,400
[SHERRY] Yes...of course.

220
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,933
<laugh> [CASEL] Looks
like they're going after
the wrong people,

221
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,266
perhaps they'd be better off
catching you first.

222
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,600
[CASEL] Alright, fine. I'll do
it.

223
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,466
I'll share this crime with you,
little one.

224
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,266
<whimpering/crying>

225
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,266
[SHERRY] Looks like it has
begun.

226
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:36,600
If we stay here... we could
cause trouble for those
in this house.

227
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,766
Come.

228
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,100
<laughing into his gross
slurping noise>

229
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,166
[BOULO] Oh so very naive.

230
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,566
[BOULO] Who would lend you a
room

231
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,400
purely out of the sheer kindness
of their heart?

232
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,333
[BOULO] And you, you could have
lived much longer.

233
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:55,566
If you hadn't chosen to do
business with the sweepers.

234
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:56,533
<laughing>

235
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,866
[BOULO] Now... it's time for the
dance to begin.

236
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:04,300
We'll see how far you get.

237
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,700
[BOSES] It looks like
something's happening in town.

238
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,233
[VIFITA] I've already sent
scouts to take a look around.

239
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,500
They should be back shortly.

240
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,266
[YELLOW ROSE A]
I bring word ma'am!

241
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,600
It has been confirmed that The
Sweepers are indeed the ones

242
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,600
causing the commotion
within the Imperial Capital.

243
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,100
[YELLOW ROSE A] It would
appear that they are
hunting down fugitives,

244
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,933
and they are considering
Jade Palace as part of their
sovereign territory.

245
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:31,400
[BOSES] OK!

246
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,200
Make an emergency call to the
Yellow Rose Unit!

247
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,500
[BOSES] Tell everyone to prepare
for battle!

248
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,233
Stay on high alert!

249
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,566
[YELLOW ROSE A] Right!

250
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,066
[BOSES] Looks like it's going to
be a long night.

251
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,666
[CASEL] Hmm... I guess we have
to

252
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:49,833
wait until the guards switch

253
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,133
in order to get near the palace.

254
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,233
[SHERRY] We do not have that
kind of time.

255
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,400
We must be brave and vigilant,
and go straight in.

256
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,766
<settle>

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,200
[CASEL] Evening my name is
Marquis Casel,

258
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,533
a representative of the senate.

259
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:10,333
We need to speak with
the Japanese delegates.

260
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,633
[YELLOW ROSE B] You're The
Marquis?

261
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:14,100
It's rather late, isn't it?

262
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,566
[CASEL] Yes we have an
emergency.

263
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,566
I would like to speak with them
right away please!

264
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:25,466
[SHERRY] See? It's working
perfectly.

265
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:28,566
[CASEL] You are indeed a brave
little lady

266
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,000
<giggle>

267
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:36,366
[YELLOW ROSE B] Please wait
right here.

268
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:37,600
<react yes>

269
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:47,733
[GREY BEARD A] Pardon me Miss.
But you cannot go beyond this
point without permission.

270
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,100
[SHERRY] And why not?

271
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,000
[GREY BEARD A] Under the
agreement the grass area

272
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,933
is effectively the property of
Jade Palace.

273
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,033
[GREY BEARD A] Which means...

274
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:58,533
The Empire ends right here.

275
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,766
[SHERRY] It's the country of
Japan

276
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:05,400
[BOSES] I'm glad that you're
unharmed.

277
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,000
[CASEL] Yes we are, fortunately.

278
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,133
But my family and her parents
were not so lucky.

279
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:13,233
[BOSES] You have my sympathies.

280
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,500
[CASEL] Thank you. Now about our
meeting with Japan?

281
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,266
[BOSES] They said they must
decline...

282
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,233
...and send their deepest
regards.

283
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,866
[CASEL] Really. Just like that?

284
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:24,800
[SHERRY] Excuse me, but may I
please

285
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,133
at least see my Sugawara?

286
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,900
[VIFITA] Sherry what you are
asking...

287
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,233
is an unreasonable request.

288
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,866
[SHERRY] You don't understand,

289
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:32,200
he is my future husband!

290
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,100
[SHERRY] And if he knows that
I'm out here...

291
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,666
I'm certain that he will accept
us into the palace!

292
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,500
[VIFITA] You are quite
tenacious.

293
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,233
[BOSES] Knight Captain Vifita.
Will you please find out?

294
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,366
[VIFITA] Right... Yes of course.

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,966
[SUGAWARA] Vifita, I thought we
just told you

296
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,000
that we cannot do that.

297
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,500
[VIFITA] Yes I know but...

298
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,533
[SUGAWARA] The Marquis is a
major player

299
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:53,433
in the push for peace.

300
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,700
Of course, we want to
save him.

301
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,233
[SUGAWARA] But we... we've been

302
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,000
notified by our country that...

303
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,266
[SUGAWARA] If we save one,

304
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:01,966
then we will have to save two.

305
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,000
[SUGAWARA] If we save two we
save four...

306
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,266
As you can see it would become
endless.

307
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,533
[SUGAWARA] And if that happens,

308
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,366
then the Prince would feel
antagonized,

309
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:12,133
and this already tenuous
situation will only get worse.

310
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,166
[VIFITA] I understand the
predicament.

311
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,966
But sir... he has a companion

312
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:18,633
who is very adamant about seeing
you.

313
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,066
[SUGAWARA] A companion?

314
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,833
[SHERRY] Sugawara!

315
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:24,466
[SHERRY] Sugawara! It's me,
Sherry!

316
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,266
[SHERRY] I'm right here!
Sugawara, let me inside!

317
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:29,266
[SUGAWARA] Sherry's here!?

318
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:30,866
[VIFITA] How interesting.

319
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,166
So what she was telling us

320
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:33,700
wasn't all fantasy was it?

321
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,266
[SUGAWARA] What'd she say
exactly?

322
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:37,966
[VIFITA] It happens quite often
with girls around her age.

323
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,300
A girl meets someone
kind who treats her nicely,

324
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,733
and quickly becomes obsessed

325
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:42,933
with thoughts of marriage.

326
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,266
[SUGAWARA] Did she happen to say

327
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:45,866
that I was her future husband?

328
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,300
[VIFITA] She did.

329
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,700
[VIFITA] I'm sure you wouldn't
attempt

330
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,966
to try and lay a finger on her.

331
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,466
[VIFITA] But well... this sort
of thing

332
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,800
will be extremely hard to deal
with.

333
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,133
[VIFITA] She's royalty. She
believes

334
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,133
she's chosen to be treasured
forever.

335
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,701
[SHERRY] Sugawara! Please
listen!

336
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,534
I want see you, and hear your
voice again.

337
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:11,134
<crying gasp>

338
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:13,767
[VIFITA] She came all the way
here,

339
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,967
trusting in your kindness.

340
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:19,401
[VIFITA] Risking her life.
Believing in your devotion.

341
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:31,834
[SHIRAYURI] Are you sure about
this? This what you want?

342
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,567
[SUGAWARA] Look I am a diplomat.

343
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,267
I cannot let my personal
feelings

344
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:38,201
get in the way of our national
interests.

345
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:47,501
Well that is the perfect answer
for a diplomat.

346
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,101
But only for a diplomat.

347
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:58,301
[CASEL] So... I guess they will
not be able to accept us.

348
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:00,934
[VIFITA] I wish we could help
you. I'm sorry.

349
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:04,501
[CASEL] No. You are only doing
the job you were given.

350
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:06,367
[CASEL] Pay it no mind.

351
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,634
[BOSES] The Sweepers? Are here?

352
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:12,534
[CASEL] It is time.

353
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:19,601
[BOSES] Allow them to come in.

354
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:21,767
[GIMLET] Well... If it isn't
Marquis Casel...

355
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,234
so this is where you have
hiding.

356
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:25,734
[CASEL] Huh. Like you didn't
know already.

357
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:28,034
[GIMLET] You've done an
excellent job, Boses.

358
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:30,701
[GIMLET] I'm sure Princess Pina
will be pleased.

359
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:33,267
[BOSES] Oh really? Why's that?

360
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,534
[GIMLET] Right now, she's found
herself

361
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:37,301
in a very delicate position you
know.

362
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:39,834
[GIMLET] How she chooses to
treat this situation

363
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:43,367
with the Marquis could put her
at great risk.

364
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:46,567
[GIMLET] Heh.. I almost feel
sorry for the little girl.

365
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,734
[CASEL] She doesn't want your
pity.

366
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,567
You killed her parents.

367
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:51,834
[GIMLET] Spare me the drama

368
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:54,934
we lost some of our finest
people as well.

369
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,301
<sigh> [CASEL] It would seem
that this is our end.

370
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,801
[GIMLET] Let's go child.

371
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:12,567
[SHERRY] Sugawara! Please! Let
me in!

372
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:15,067
[SHERRY] Ow! Let me see you!
Sugawara!

373
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:19,634
[SHERRY] Sugawara!

374
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,667
[GIMLET] That is just about
enough!

375
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:22,967
[GREY BEARD A] Let the girl go
now.

376
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:24,434
[GIMLET] If you try to defy us,

377
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:27,034
you will be treated as a
dissident!

378
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:28,067
[GIMLET] You're coming with me!

379
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,967
[SHERRY] No! Get away from me!

380
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:34,267
[SHERRY] Sugawara help!
Sugawara! Sugawara!

381
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,067
[GIMLET] Let's go!

382
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,834
[SHERRY] Sugawara!

383
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:41,101
[SUGAWARA] Get your filthy hands
off her!

384
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:43,834
[SHERRY] Sugawara

385
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,967
[GIMLET] Look here it's Mr.
Ambassador.

386
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:47,834
What brings you out join us?

387
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,867
[SUGAWARA] You will release that
girl to me at once.

388
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:53,834
[GIMLET] Excuse me? She is a
citizen of the Empire.

389
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:59,301
[GIMLET] What sort of basis
could a Japanese bureaucrat
possibly have to ask for her
release?

390
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,667
[SUGAWARA] She's mine, and when
she comes of age,

391
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:06,901
it has been decided... that she
will be my bride!

392
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:10,034
[SHERRY] Sugawara...

393
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:15,367
[GIMLET] Heh. That is absolutely
ridiculous.

394
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:16,434
[GIMLET] Back off!

395
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:17,667
[GREY BEARD A] You can go, miss.

396
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:20,267
The ambassador has given his
permission.

397
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:23,234
[GREY BEARD A] Go! You'll be
safe in Japan!

398
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,434
[GIMLET] Noooo!

399
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:48,067
[SHERRY] Sugawara!

400
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:51,067
[SUGAWARA] It's okay...

401
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,667
[SHERRY] Oh... Sugawara. I'm so
sorry.

402
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,567
[SHERRY] I... had to sell the
pearls

403
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:00,801
you gave me for food.

404
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:02,967
Please... forgive me
for what I've done.

405
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,701
[SUGAWARA] Don't you worry.

406
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:06,434
They can always be replaced.

407
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,701
But you are a different story.

408
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:14,034
[SHERRY] Thank you.

409
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,534
[SECRETARY] We're in trouble,
Vice‐Minister.

410
00:21:22,634 --> 00:21:24,034
Sugawara has acted out on his
own.

411
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:25,567
[SHIRAYURI] Yes I am aware.

412
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,034
Call Kano. We must let him know

413
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:29,101
what's happened right away.

414
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:33,534
[GIMLET] Goddammit! Do you know
what you've done?

415
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:35,101
[VIFITA] Form a line now!

416
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:39,801
[VIFITA] Our sworn duty is to
guard Jade Palace.

417
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:41,034
[VIFITA] No matter the cost.

418
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,901
We must let no one enter these
grounds

419
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,901
without being given permission.

420
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:47,001
[VIFITA] We will defend it with
our lives!

421
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:48,701
[ALL] Right!

422
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:49,901
[GIMLET] You've sealed your
fate!

423
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:51,367
You are harboring a known
criminal.

424
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:52,834
[GIMLET] And no 'agreement'

425
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:55,701
will prevent us from taking them
back! Prepare to die!

426
00:21:58,434 --> 00:21:59,401
[VIFITA] Swords!

427
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:05,701
[GIMLET] Charge!

428
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:47,201
[LELEI] Next time on Gate:

429
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,967
The Dead line.
