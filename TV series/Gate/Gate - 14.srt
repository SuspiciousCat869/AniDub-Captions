1
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:04,733
[LELEI] The JSDF was
dispatched to a mysterious
world called the Special Region.

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:07,933
A formal peace agreement
has taken shape, led by
Itami and Pina.

3
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:11,200
In order to ensure the
accord's success,

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,200
the JSDF secured a base within
the red light district of the
capital, known as Trouble Town.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,333
While their presence
has gradually been accepted
by the locals,

6
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,766
no one could predict what would
happen next.

7
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,766
<panic, screaming>

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,333
[SOLDIER A] Stay down!

9
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,266
<react>

10
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,366
Everyone try to remain calm!

11
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,066
[HAMILTON] Your Highness!

12
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,500
<scared noises>

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,300
[GUARD A] Aaugh!
It's the end of the world!

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,566
[GUARD B] Shut up!
Calm yourself!

15
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,266
[GUARD C] Save us!

16
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:54,333
[ITAMI] Jeez this is a pretty
big one.

17
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:57,600
[ITAMI] I'd say it's like
a level 4 or 5 maybe.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,833
[SUGAWARA] Judging by the
preliminary tremor,

19
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,566
I'd say the epicenter
isn't very close.

20
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,966
[PINA] Itami what's going on?!
[ITAMI] Huh?

21
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:07,333
[PINA] How can be so relaxed
at a time like this?

22
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:10,866
[ITAMI] Well uh... this
magnitude of earthquake

23
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,833
sorta happens
all the time in Japan.

24
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:15,000
[ITAMI] It'll be over in no
time.

25
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:22,166
[recedes]

26
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:24,233
[ITAMI] What'd I tell ya?

27
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,466
[ITAMI] Tomita! Status update!
[TOMITA] Roger!

28
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:27,600
[ITAMI] Kuribayashi,

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,700
check on the women and
make sure they're okay.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,833
[KURIBAYASHI] Roger.

31
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:31,100
[ITAMI] Furuta,
contact all units.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,366
I'm going to need a damage
report.

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,733
[MEDIC] Is everyone okay?

34
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,766
[MEDIC] If you're hurt,
speak up. We'll get to you.

35
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,233
[MEDIC] And if you can't speak,

36
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,700
[MUTY] Um... Is it over?
[MEDIC] use your hands, arms,

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,000
[RORY] It would appear so.
[MEDIC] give us a signal!

38
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,733
Is everyone alright?

39
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,200
[RORY] So uh... where's Tuka?

40
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:24,466
She's over there.

41
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:27,266
<sigh>

42
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,566
[TUKA] Oh Father...

43
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,833
<sads>

44
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,533
[PINA] There's going to
be another one?!

45
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:36,900
[ITAMI] Uh‐huh. Y'see,
usually after an earthquake
of that size,

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,700
there's going to be some
aftershocks.

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,600
[PINA] We have to do something!

48
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,000
I must inform my father!

49
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,133
[PINA] Gather our clothes.

50
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:45,700
We're going to the
Imperial Palace!

51
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,500
[ITAMI] You ladies be careful.

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,533
[BOTH] <react>

53
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:49,800
[BOTH] Huh?

54
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,666
[PINA] What are you saying,
you're not coming with us?

55
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,833
[ITAMI] Your dad's the Emperor,

56
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:57,500
I mean what am I supposed to do
about it?

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,000
[SUGAWARA] Even if this is an
emergency situation...

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,633
...I'm not sure it's a good idea
for enemy soldiers

59
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,566
to just show up unannounced.

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,433
[PINA] You let me handle that.

61
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:14,066
But please... I need you on
this.

62
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,566
I need you by my side Itami!

63
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,766
<react>

64
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,700
<nervous laughter>

65
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,766
<whimpering>

66
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:42,033
[PINA] No one has even asked us
to identify ourselves.

67
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,733
The Guards have completely
lost their nerve.

68
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,000
[ITAMI] Whoa... this is like
some mad king's evil fortress.

69
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,900
[PINA] Itami.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,500
Please wait here for a
moment.

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,033
<waking>

72
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,766
[MOLTO] Well look at this.

73
00:04:57,866 --> 00:05:01,033
Pina. You're here.

74
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:04,000
[PINA] Your Majesty. Please
prepare yourself.

75
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,900
Now listen! Send a message
to the ministers and generals
of all the Imperial camps.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,500
They are to report here at once!

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,666
Officers of the military take
charge of the Imperial Guard.

78
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:14,866
You are to secure the area
around the Imperial Palace!

79
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,500
[OFFICERS] Right!

80
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,866
[PINA] And I want this place
cleaned up immediately.

81
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,700
[MAIDENS] Yes ma'am!

82
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:24,566
[MOLTO] My, how you've grown.

83
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,766
<react>

84
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,633
<pleased>

85
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:32,566
Uh... I don't know father,
I've been this tall for a while.

86
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,766


87
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,933
[MOLTO] So...

88
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,933
[MOLTO]
I see we have some visitors.

89
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,366
Do you mind telling me who they
are.

90
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,333
[PINA] This is Sugawara, a
Japanese emissary.

91
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,400
[MOLTO] A Japanese emissary?

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,833
Why would you bring them here at
a time like this?

93
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:56,133
[PINA] Uh well they are well
experienced in the earth
tremors, sire.

94
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,633
[PINA] I thought perhaps they
could offer some advice.

95
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,100
<taken aback>

96
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,300
[MOLTO] <not enthused>
Is that so...

97
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,466
Then I would like to welcome you
Sir Sugawara.

98
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,566
[MOLTO] But unfortunately, as
you can see,

99
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,200
we are in the middle of a bit of
a crisis.

100
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,366
[MOLTO] So I'm afraid a proper
welcome will have to wait.

101
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:16,200
[SUGAWARA] I understand,
Your Majesty.

102
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sure you will provide ample
opportunity

103
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,833
for future negotiations when the
situation improves.

104
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,500
[ZORZAL] Father!

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,566
I'm here father!

106
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,766
Move it!

107
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:32,433
[ZORZAL] Aah. I'm so glad to see
you're well!

108
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:35,033
Now, let's get you out of here
at once!

109
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,966
[PINA] Please wait brother!

110
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,033
I have already summoned the
leading members...

111
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,466
[ZORZAL] This is not the time to
waste on bureaucrats!

112
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:46,966
Noriko says another earthquake
can come at any moment!

113
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,433
[ITAMI] "Noriko"?

114
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,000
[PINA] How would you know
anything about earthquakes?

115
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,733
And who is this Noriko
person you speak of?!

116
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,566
<pained breathing...>

117
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,000
<sobbing>

118
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,766
[ZORZAL] This is Noriko.
Why don't you say hello?

119
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:16,000
She's one of the survivors
we were able to capture
from the other side of the gate!

120
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:25,566
[ZORZAL] Get up. Now! I want you
tell his majesty exactly what
you told me before, okay!

121
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,066
<pains>

122
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,333
[ZORZAL] Start talking!

123
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:32,433
[NORIKO] Please don't hurt me...
please leave me alone.

124
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:33,666
<react>

125
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,100
[TOMITA] She spoke Japanese?

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,600
[MUSTACHE] Your Highness, look
out!

127
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,300
[ITAMI] You son of a bitch!

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,366
[KURIBAYASHI] Are you alright?

129
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:49,433
<whimpering>

130
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,433
[KURIBAYASHI] You're Japanese,
aren't you?

131
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,666
We're the JSDF.
We'll take care of you.

132
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,400
[NORIKO] So I can go... home?

133
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,433
[KURIBAYASHI] Yes. We'll take
you back. Home. To Japan.

134
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,700


135
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:11,633
[SUGAWARA] I can't believe a
Japanese person is enslaved
here.

136
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,233
What's the meaning of this, Your
Majesty?

137
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,266
Why is she here?

138
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,000
[PINA] I'm certain there
must be some kind of mistake!

139
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,566
Please forgive us,
I'm sure we can...!

140
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,733
<laughter>

141
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:30,966
[ZORZAL] I won't bother asking
how you got in here.

142
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:33,933
But it seems that you have
chosen your own destiny.

143
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:37,033
It is a serious crime to attack
a member of the royal family.

144
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,266
A very serious one.

145
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,766
<laughter>

146
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,833
[KURIBAYASHI] I don't like this
guy!

147
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,100


148
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,366
[ITAMI] Tomita. Kuribayashi.

149
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,566
[ITAMI] Weapons free. Do what it
takes.

150
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,733
<react>

151
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,433
[KURIBAYASHI] Roger that!

152
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:00,266
[ZORZAL] Kill them!

153
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:01,933
[TOMITA] Try to be careful
with that thing.

154
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,033
[KURIBAYASHI] That all depends
on these assholes!

155
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,766
<thud>

156
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,533
[ZORZAL] Damn it! What the hell
are you waiting for?!

157
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,600
[ZORZAL] Form a line and take
that bitch out!

158
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,766
<forming a line>

159
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,766
<die>

160
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,466
<more death>

161
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,666
<silence>

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,100
[KURIBAYASHI] Drop your weapons
or suffer the same fate as your
friends!

163
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,700
[KURIBAYASHI] A wise choice.

164
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:53,700
<pain>

165
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,833
[ZORZAL] <anger> Bunch of
goddamn... cowards...

166
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:59,533
[ITAMI] Now, Prince.

167
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:04,366
When you brought Noriko into
the room, you said she's a
'survivor.'

168
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,166
[ITAMI] And what that tells
me...

169
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:10,633
Is that you kidnapped other
people as well. Is that correct?

170
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:14,466
[ZORZAL] I have no obligation to
tell you anything.

171
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,600
[ITAMI] Have it your way.

172
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,033
S'all yours.

173
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,033
[KURIBAYASHI] Thank you sir.

174
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,466
<leather creak>

175
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:31,533
[ZORZAL] <turning teeth>
Okay little girl, do you know
who the hell I am!?

176
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,933
<getting pummeled>

177
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:53,366
<huge punch>

178
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:56,400
[ZORZAL] Please stop,
that's enough little girl.

179
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,766
<final blow>
AUGH!

180
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,500
[ITAMI] Okay. Your highness.

181
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,566
You still haven't answered my
question.

182
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,300
<cowering, blubbering>

183
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,033
[ITAMI] 'Scuse me? What was
that?

184
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,633
I can't understand you without
any teeth!

185
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:20,600
[THULE] Please...

186
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,300
[ZORZAL] Thule...

187
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,466
[THULE] Do not kill the prince.

188
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:28,333
[ITAMI] <settle> Your Highness.

189
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:29,866
I'm going to ask you one more
time.

190
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:32,566
[ITAMI] Did you kidnap more
Japanese people?

191
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,766
[NORIKO] Where's Hiroki?

192
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,500
What did you do to Hiroki?

193
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,500
The two of us were
walking in Ginza together!

194
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,633
Some of the prisoners...
were sold into slavery.

195
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:47,366
Beyond that, I don't know...

196
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,733
[THULE] <react> Your Highness!

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,066
[SUGAWARA] Your Majesty.

198
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,033
I believe the formalites must
wait,

199
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,633
until after our people have been
found.

200
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:00,600
[SUGAWARA] And Princess Pina.

201
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,300
I expect that we'll be hearing
from you on this matter.

202
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,600
About the whereabouts of our
people.

203
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,266
And their safe return.

204
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,766
<react>

205
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:10,666
[ITAMI] Let's go.

206
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:14,500
[MOLTO] The soldiers of Japan
are certainly strong.

207
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,600
But I fear you have also
revealed a tremendous weakness.

208
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,833
[SUGAWARA] A weakness?

209
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:23,933
[MOLTO] You are hindered by a
crippling love for your people.

210
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,700
[MOLTO] Ultimately it will
create

211
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,266
much suffering in the future.

212
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:29,866
[MOLTO] We have already seen
large and advanced

213
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,333
civilizations grow brazen in
their power...

214
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:35,133
Only to be hacked down and
slaughtered by barbarians.

215
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:38,833
[MOLTO] I'd keep that in mind if
I were you.

216
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,133
[SUGAWARA] That weakness of
ours...

217
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,000
Just so happens to be our
national policy.

218
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,533
[SUGAWARA] And to protect it and
our people,

219
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:46,800
we have the JSDF.

220
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,966
Though I ask.

221
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,233
Would you like another
demonstration?

222
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,900
[MOLTO] Hmph. No.

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,500
We cannot resist your advanced
firepower.

224
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,700
[MOLTO] You may begin the peace
negotiations.

225
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,133
[SUGAWARA] Your Majesty.
As I'm sure you are very well
aware...

226
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:07,233
Peace is simply a time to
prepare for the next war.

227
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,333
Our nation and our world outside
that gate

228
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:13,033
has been forged with a long
history of blood,

229
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,800
much worse than your Empire has
ever endured.

230
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,400
So keep THAT in mind.

231
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,600
[ITAMI] That will be all for
now.

232
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
[ITAMI] Let's go.

233
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,766
<sads>

234
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,833
<earthquake recovery>

235
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:56,266
<jet engine howl>

236
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,166
<notices something>

237
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:10,339
[SABER] Saber here. Target is
lit.

238
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:11,872
[KAMIKODA] Drop...ready...

239
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:12,939
Now.

240
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:18,106
<explosion, screams of alarm>

241
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:22,706
[SABER] Saber to 680. Impact
confirmed. Target destroyed.

242
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:26,106
[KAMIKODA] Roger. Thanks for the
spotlight.

243
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:27,106
[KAMIKODA] Returning to base.

244
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,072
[NATSUME] We've received
confirmation

245
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,972
of the destruction of the
Imperial Senate.

246
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:37,906
And there were no civilian
casualties in the explosion.

247
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:41,272
[KANO] It appears mission went
well, Prime Minister.

248
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,139
[MORITA] <breath> yes sir, but
was it the right move?

249
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:48,672
[KANO] Hey hey it's too late to
start worrying about that..

250
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,839
[KANO] We must focus on moving
forward from here.

251
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:55,272
[NATSUME] Hmmm. Let's just hope
that they understood

252
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:57,106
our message loud and clear.

253
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:00,606
[CASEL] I have a question for
you, Your Majesty!

254
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:02,106
According to Lord Cicero,

255
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:04,472
the Japanese emissary
wanted to make peace,

256
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:05,672
[CASEL] And several meetings

257
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,439
have been scheduled with that in
mind.

258
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,406
[CASEL] But if that's truly the
case,

259
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:10,839
then how do you explain this?!

260
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,772
Why would they launch
such attack?

261
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:19,406
Well if you can't say,
then I will say it for you.

262
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,339
[CASEL] This is a direct
response

263
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:22,739
to us kidnapping civilians

264
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,439
from the other side of the gate
before the war!

265
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:26,772
[SENATOR BALD] Wait what?!

266
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:29,839
[SENATOR BLUE]
And just what are you implying?!

267
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:32,672
[CASEL] As soon as they
discovered what happened to
their comrades,

268
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:36,172
[CASEL] They immediately went
after Prince Zorzal!

269
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:39,039
[CASEL] And why is that?!

270
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,006
[PINA] It is because they value
the lives of every single one of
their citizens.

271
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:48,439
[PINA] No, not just their own
citizens.

272
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,439
[PINA] Even the prisoners they
take.

273
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:51,972
They don't kill or enslave them.

274
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:54,039
[SENATOR HOGAN] How is such a
thing even possible!

275
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:55,839
[SENATOR GOATEE] It's not theirs
to judge!

276
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:57,739
Do they think they're gods or
something?

277
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,939
[PINA] They simply love their
people!!

278
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,872
[PINA] And by comparison I'd go
so far as to say

279
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:03,372
they treat their prisoners well.

280
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:05,272
[PINA] They don't even hold them
for ransom.

281
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:07,372
Not even their worst enemies.

282
00:16:07,472 --> 00:16:09,472
[PINA] It's no great plot or
scheme,

283
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:11,906
it's simply who these people
are.

284
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,006
[PINA] So when they witness
their own people

285
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:17,172
being treated as slaves and
tortured,

286
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:18,639
it's an affront to them.

287
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:21,039
[PINA] And this is the
consequence.

288
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:24,539
[ZORZAL] Why does my sister
side with them so?

289
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:34,806
[THULE] Here your Highness.
This should ease the pain.

290
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,506
[ZORZAL] Agh! S'not cold!
Go get me some ice!

291
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:39,206
[THULE] Uh yes, right away.

292
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:42,739
[ZORZAL] <pain recline>

293
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,539
[DIAVO] It's a shame what
happened to you dear Brother.

294
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,606
[ZORZAL] Ugh... Diavo...

295
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:51,172
[DIAVO] Now the majority of
the Senate is pro‐peace talk.

296
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:54,206
At this rate, it's the
same as accepting
unconditional surrender.

297
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,606
In order to avoid it...

298
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:57,139
[ZORZAL] You sneaky little
thing.

299
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,572
[DIAVO] You disagree?

300
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:01,706
[ZORZAL] How the hell am I
supposed to know?

301
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:05,239
I'm not all clever like you are,
brother,

302
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,972
I'm just the fool remember?

303
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:10,972
It's how I keep from getting
killed, like Khati.

304
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,906
[DIAVO] Our father was young
then.

305
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:17,439
That's why he feared the
previous Emperor's son.

306
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:20,972
And now our father is getting
beyond his years.

307
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:23,272
[ZORZAL] I heard that you're
pulling strings

308
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:27,806
to become the next Emperor while
I was playing the mindless dolt.

309
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,639
[ZORZAL] But no matter
what you do,

310
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:34,806
I'm the one in line to be
appointed as the next Emperor.

311
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:37,839
[DIAVO] I'm not sure our father
has much faith your ability...

312
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:40,139
[ZORZAL] That's exactly why he'd
pick me.

313
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,506
In order to end this war,

314
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:44,206
the Emperor will be forced to
resign.

315
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:47,872
But our father will never
give up on having the power.

316
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:49,272
He thinks I'm easy to control,

317
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:50,639
so he'll make me the Emperor

318
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:52,906
and keep the control of this
nation from behind.

319
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,739
[DIAVO] But that's
irresponsible of him!

320
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,072
[DIAVO] What would happen to the
Empire if father dies?

321
00:17:57,172 --> 00:17:58,339
[ZORZAL] Thule talk to me!
[DIAVO] What would happen to the
Empire if father dies?

322
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,706
[THULE] Yes, your highness.

323
00:17:59,806 --> 00:18:02,439
Two more people were captured
along with Noriko.

324
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,272
They were both sold as slaves
for mining,

325
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:08,606
but one of them died from an
accident.

326
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:11,272
[ZORZAL] What about the one
named Hiroki?

327
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:13,106
[THULE] He's the one who has
perished.

328
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:17,006
[ZORZAL] Huh, what an
inconvenience.

329
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:20,539
Okay, whatever. It is what it
is. Bring the survivor.

330
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,306
[THULE] Certainly.

331
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:25,139
[DIAVO] So you're taking the
initiative to give them back
the slaves

332
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,472
to make them believe that you
are FOR the peace talks?

333
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:29,739
[ZORZAL] If I knew this would
happen,

334
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,672
maybe I should've treated Noriko
a little better.

335
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:37,306
[THULE] No, sir. She would've
been a plaything for the
soldiers if it weren't for you.

336
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:39,472
Not only was she rescued from
that fate,

337
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:42,039
she was also given mercy of the
next Emperor.

338
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:44,206
She should feel honored, if
anything.

339
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,706
[ZORZAL] Diavo. It's about time

340
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:48,306
you decide who you're siding
with.

341
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:50,072
Me, my father, or Pina...

342
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:54,339
Oh wait. I guess she could be
considered a traitor now.

343
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:57,772
[THULE] Oh, Your Highness!
Your injury...

344
00:18:57,872 --> 00:19:01,072
[ZORZAL] Don't you worry about
that.

345
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,272
<rustling and giggling>

346
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:10,063
[KURIBAYASHI] Do you want this?

347
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:12,463
[NORIKO] Th‐Thank you very much.

348
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,563
[KURIBAYASHI] We're almost
there.

349
00:19:17,363 --> 00:19:21,163
[NORIKO] I can go back...for
real...

350
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:34,097
[DOCTOR] You must be Noriko
Mochizuki.

351
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:35,363
[NORIKO] Y‐Yes!

352
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:37,097
[DOCTOR] Come this way!

353
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:41,163
<sigh>

354
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,830
[YANAGIDA] You made a big mess
again.

355
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:49,630
[YANAGIDA] You're something,
Itami,

356
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,197
starting a mass shooting at the
Imperial Palace.

357
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:54,463
Not only that, you rescue an
abductee.

358
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:56,730
Am I supposed to scold you, or
praise you?

359
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,297
[ITAMI] So what's gonna happen
to me?

360
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,963
I think you're lucky
if you only get a pay cut.

361
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:01,930
<ugh>

362
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,730
[YANAGIDA] How‐ever!

363
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,530
Huh?

364
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,030
The government is trying to

365
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,730
use this incident to increase
their popularity rating.

366
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,397
Rescuing a Japanese citizen from
the enemy is great PR.

367
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:14,763
But in order to do that,

368
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:18,230
they can't punish the key player
of the incident.

369
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,730
Lieutenant General Hazama is
torn up

370
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,030
because he has no idea what to
do with you.

371
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,097
[ITAMI] Please Lieutenant
General, don't kill me.

372
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:29,530
[YANAGIDA] And about the family
of Noriko Mochizuki...

373
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,530
[ITAMI] How's it going?

374
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,730
[NORIKO] <foley> I feel much
more relaxed now.

375
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,097
[DOCTOR] Keep pressing here.

376
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,530
[NORIKO] Oh, OK. Well...

377
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,230
[NORIKO] My family must be
worried,

378
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,663
so I'd like to make
a phone call.

379
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:47,930
[KURIBAYASHI]
Oh? OK. Well then...
[ITAMI]

380
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,330
[KURIBAYASHI] Uh...

381
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,797
[ITAMI] Sorry, Noriko.

382
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:54,830
But we don't have a civilian
phone line set up yet.

383
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,597
[ITAMI] You have to be
quarantined for a while

384
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:58,063
before you can cross the Gate
anyway,

385
00:20:58,163 --> 00:21:00,997
so you'll have to wait to
contact them a bit longer.

386
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,130
[NORIKO] Okay...

387
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,297
[YANAGIDA] After she went
missing,

388
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:07,963
her family was giving away
flyers

389
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:10,530
asking for information about her
in Ginza.

390
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,497
[ITAMI] Are you saying...?

391
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:13,563
[YANAGIDA] Yeah, they were there

392
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:14,997
the day everything went down.

393
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:25,797
[ITAMI] Do me a favor and don't
tell her yet.

394
00:21:25,897 --> 00:21:26,830
[BOTH] OK.

395
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:29,563
[ITAMI] Noriko, you alright?

396
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,797
[NORIKO] Itami and Kuribayashi.

397
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:35,397
I should've told you this
a while earlier, but...

398
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:38,530
I cannot thank you enough for
saving me.

399
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,463
[YANAGIDA] Hey.

400
00:21:57,563 --> 00:21:59,163
[ITAMI] What do you want now?

401
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:01,630
[YANAGIDA] I have something
I think I should tell you.

402
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,030
[ITAMI] You never have any good
news, Yanagida.

403
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,963
[YANAGIDA] You'll regret it if
you don't hear it.

404
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:13,563
[TUKA] Uh... Oh please father...
Where are you?

405
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,130
[LELEI] Next in the Gate:

406
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,830
Tuka Luna Marceau.
