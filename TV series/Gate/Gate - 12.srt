1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,333
(roar)

2
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:04,400
(screech)

3
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:07,333
(screams, fearful reax)

4
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,400
(roar)

5
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,400
[ELDER] This is disastrous.

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,466
[ELDER] The moon...
It has gone full cycle since our
troubles began.

7
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:33,566
Since the flame dragon chose our
forest

8
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,733
to be its feeding ground.

9
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,200
[ELDER] He has brought death

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,533
to all our people who chose to
challenge it

11
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:41,366
and equally to those who went
into hiding.

12
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:45,800
[ELDER] If this continues,
not a single soul from our tribe
will survive.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,633
[ELDER] It shall be up to you.

14
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:49,166
[ELDER] The only course of
action that remains

15
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,233
is to implore the ones of
legend,

16
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,200
the ones said to have actually

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,600
taken one of the flame dragons
arms in battle.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,866
[ELDER] The green ones.

19
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:02,066
[ELDER] It is you...
Yao Haa Dushi, the daughter of
our people...

20
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,133
With the greatest skill, wisdom,

21
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,833
and ability to direct the
spirits.

22
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,066
[ELDER] You who have faced

23
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,600
grave misfortune and hardship,

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,033
and has now lost your fiancé
and best friend to the beast.

25
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:18,400
[ELDER] Yet, even among such
devastation and pain you never
lost your way.

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,200
[ELDER] We entrust the destiny
of the Dark Elves to your hand.

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,633
[ELDER] Endowing upon you the
greatest treasure of the tribe.

28
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:30,600
[ELDER] I assume you understand
why you ‐ as a woman ‐ were
chosen to be the emissary.

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,033
[YAO] Of course, Master.

30
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,533
[ELDER] Then be on your way!

31
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:36,966
[ELDER] And return to us with
the green ones to help us!

32
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:41,600
[YAO] Master! I will find these
green ones and bring them back!

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,200
And if my body is the price for
the head of the dragon...

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,166
[YAO] ...so it shall be!

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,733
(run efforts)

36
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:01,424
[YAO] Oh! They're dressed in
green! That has to be them!

37
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,457
[YAO] Excuse me gentlemen but I
have a dire request to make!

38
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:10,224
[YAO] I'm certain you are the
people that the elders spoke of!

39
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:12,690
I need your help...
my people need your help!

40
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,890
[YAO] My name is Yao Haa Dushi!
And I'm with the Dark Elves of
the Schwartz Woods!

41
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,090
[YAO] A few months ago, a flame
dragon appeared in our village

42
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,390
and now my tribe is close to
extinction...

43
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,690
You're the only ones powerful
enough to vanquish such a beast.

44
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,124
[YAO] I'm begging... please!

45
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:28,690
(uneasy reax)

46
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,124
[SOLDIER] (uneasy) Za... Zaval.
Halu uguluu?

47
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:33,890
[YAO] <react>

48
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,324
(shopping/street buzz)

49
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,024
[SOLDIER] Uh, how ya doin?...

50
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,190
[SOLDIER] Um gimme just a second
here uh...

51
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,924
[SOLDIER] I can make your
talk... I am a friend.

52
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:44,457
[SOLDIER] Agulagullu.

53
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:47,857
[YAO] Un‐be‐lievable...

54
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:49,124
[YAO] Dammit, nobody here

55
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:51,424
understands a single word that
I'm saying.

56
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:52,824
[YAO] Now, wait a minute.

57
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:54,957
The pervert with the teenager in
the Inn last night

58
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:57,024
was wearing the same thing!

59
00:02:57,124 --> 00:03:01,324
[YAO] And he seemed to
understand every single word I
spoke to him.

60
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:03,457
[YAO] Who is he ... I need him.

61
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:05,790
[TODO] Itami! On your right!

62
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:15,524
[TODO] Now they're leaving.

63
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:17,657
[YOJI] Probably just screwing
around.

64
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:20,390
[YOJI] Fly boys... they must
love it out here.

65
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,424
[TODO] Uh... Why would you think
something like that?

66
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:25,424
[YOJI] Well! There aren't any
airliners or any traffic up
there.

67
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:28,790
[YOJI] Yep! Nothing but wide
open skies to explore!

68
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,824
[YOJI] Except for the dragons
and wyverns of course.

69
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:33,124
[TODO] Yeah. Guess so.

70
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:34,724
(whining/running)

71
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:36,157
(hit reax)

72
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:40,490
[YAO] Hmph. What am I supposed
to do with this?

73
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,990
[YAO] Did he just mistake me for
a prostitute?

74
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,657
Wretched toad. Uh?

75
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,157
Hey sister, hear you wanna talk
to the green people.

76
00:03:47,257 --> 00:03:48,924
[YAO] Can you translate for me.

77
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:51,357
[MAN] Yeah. Over here. (laugh)

78
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,357
(nasal exhale)

79
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:55,490
(whining/running)

80
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:58,524
[YAO] (sigh) Seriously?

81
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,390
[MAN] Well hello there...

82
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,857
I haven't seen you here before.

83
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:05,057
I'll show you a real good time.

84
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:07,457
I promise to make it
worth your while.

85
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:10,690
[YAO] Hm Honestly from this
perspective

86
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,457
I highly doubt that.

87
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:12,457
[MERC] Huh?!

88
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:13,857
[MAN] What's going on, sexy!

89
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:15,624
Got an itch that needs a
scratchin?

90
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:17,224
(street buzz)

91
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,957
[YAO] Uhhh...This is very
disappointing...

92
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:22,324
All the men around here are
either depraved or
incredibly useless.

93
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:23,657
[YAO] I have got to find a way

94
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:26,290
to get the green ones to listen
to me.

95
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:34,224
[YAO] Oh! Uh... What's this?

96
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:45,490
[YAO] What a wonderful market!

97
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,424
There are so many goods here!

98
00:04:47,524 --> 00:04:49,590
[MEIA] You have discriminating
taste there, soldier!

99
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,024
[MEIA] And it's on sale right
nyow!

100
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:53,624
[SOLDIER] Well, then let me get
one!

101
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:54,457
[SOLDIER] Me, too!

102
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:56,357
Thanks you so much, gentlemen!

103
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:57,457
(gasp)

104
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,557
[YAO] She's actually able to
talk to them!

105
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,657
[MEIA] Myake sure you come by
and see me again okay.

106
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:04,224
<react!!!>

107
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:05,790
[YAO] I'm sorry! Please talk to
me...!

108
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,957
[MEIA] Huh?! I remember you
from the bar last night.

109
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:10,457
[YAO] Just now! Were you
speaking

110
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,357
in the language of the green
ones?

111
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:16,624
[MEIA] Oh, Japanese? Iiiiit's
right here in the red book!

112
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:17,624
[YAO] Uh... red book?

113
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:19,524
[MEIA] Yeah "Conversational
Japanese"!

114
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:22,924
All employees here at the
military exchange get a
copy for free.

115
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:25,990
It's the same book all
the school children are using
too.

116
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,257
[YAO] Please sell this book to
me!

117
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:28,990
[MEIA] I'm sorry but I can't do
that...!

118
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,424
Mwe're not allowed to sell them!

119
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:33,190
[YAO] But please! I have got
to learn their language,

120
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,024
I desperately need to
speak with them!

121
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:38,424
I've been trying to talk to
these warriors since the moment
I got here!

122
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:40,890
But none of them can understand
what I say.

123
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,657
[YAO] Please, I'm begging you!

124
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:47,390
[YAO] I cannot fail my tribe...
! They'll all die...!

125
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,890
[MEIA] Yeah I am super sorry...

126
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,124
but y'know I really don't feel
like losing my job today.

127
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:53,257
[MP] Hi Meia.

128
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:55,690
So how're things
holding up for ya?

129
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,157
[MEIA] Hey there! Things're
pretty good!

130
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,124
[MP] Caramel skin. Silver hair.

131
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:05,157
Tall female with elf ears.
Wearing leather armor...

132
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:06,057
and a long dark cloak.

133
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,557
<react>

134
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:10,290
[MP] Definitely matches the
description from the report.

135
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,224
[MP] Yeah she does...

136
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,957
Hello there ma'am...
you got a minute?

137
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:17,824
We really need to talk to you
about a few things, ma'am.

138
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:20,557
[MEIA] The soldiers are saying
they want to talk to you.

139
00:06:20,657 --> 00:06:21,790
(gasp)

140
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,824
(exhale/inhale)

141
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:29,124
[YAO] You... wanna talk?

142
00:06:29,224 --> 00:06:31,990
[MP] Um Arvaloo...We'd like to
hear your story...

143
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,624
(shrieks, delighted)
(surprised reax)

144
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:36,357
[MP] Uh... Will you come with
us...Mangala.

145
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:38,190
[YAO] Yes! Definitely!

146
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,757
[MP] Right this way, please.

147
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,857
[YAO] Uh‐huh!

148
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,157
[MEIA] That girl needs a lotta
help.

149
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:45,590
(joyous sigh)

150
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:03,290
(OM breath catch)

151
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:20,557
[KATO] Hmph! That was
magnificent, Lelei...

152
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:21,857
No wonder you're my...
Waaughhhhh!

153
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,957
[LELEI] When I visited the other
side of the Gate...

154
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:28,857
I found several books about
philosophy.

155
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:30,224
They've done a lot of research.

156
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,124
(gacking) (gasp)

157
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:33,990
[KATO] You're growing fast.

158
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,590
I don't have the words.

159
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,090
I'm impressed, Lelei.

160
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,657
Your use of these new
philosophies will create

161
00:07:39,757 --> 00:07:42,024
all sorts of unimaginable
uses for magic.

162
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:45,057
[KATO] You had to go to a
different world to find some of
these philosophies,

163
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:49,624
but all the research you've done
with them shall make you a
Master Wizard in no time.

164
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:51,857
[LELEI] Maybe...but it's not
strong enough.

165
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:54,057
[LELEI] Oh?

166
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:55,990
[KATO] Looks like we have a
guest.

167
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,624
[MP] Sorry to just show up
unannounced.

168
00:07:57,724 --> 00:08:00,457
But we were hoping you could do
some more interpreting for us.

169
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,524
[MP] She's here because someone
matching her description

170
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:08,724
was supposedly strong‐arming men
out of their money.

171
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,557
[MP] The complainant's stories
and hers aren't exactly matching
up,

172
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,957
so we thought you might be able
to make some sense out of this.

173
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:18,257
[MP] Plus, she keeps saying
something about being attacked,

174
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:21,390
and that's all we can figure out
with the red book, anyway.

175
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,757
[MP] So, you think you can help?

176
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,490
[LELEI] Yao Haa Dushi. Hello.

177
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,257
[LELEI] They've asked me to talk
to you. Okay?

178
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:41,724
[YAO] Who are you?

179
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:43,057
[LELEI] My name's Lelei.

180
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:45,257
I'm able to communicate with
them.

181
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,157
[MAN] Good god, they're still
swollen!

182
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:48,957
[MUTY] Excuse me!

183
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:51,157
[MUTY] I need to talk with you
for a sec.

184
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:53,590
[MAN] M‐Me?

185
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:56,057
[MP] Seems like Romeo out there

186
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:57,657
filed a false police report.

187
00:08:57,757 --> 00:09:01,824
[MP] It looks like we're talking
to the real victim here.

188
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:02,924
He'll be on his way to
Italica...

189
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,090
he won't be doing that anymore.

190
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,190
[LELEI] So does that mean she
can...

191
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,257
[MP] Uh‐huh...

192
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:08,090
[LELEI] They're letting you go.

193
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,357
There's no reason to hold you
any longer.

194
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:13,557
[YAO] Uh! But I can't leave!

195
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:16,257
My tribe is still being
attacked by a flame dragon!

196
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:17,257
[LELEI] A flame dragon?

197
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,590
[YAO] It's injured!

198
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,057
He's missing an arm!

199
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:21,490
I really need to talk to them
okay...

200
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,224
[YAO] I need to talk to the
green ones!

201
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:26,190
[YAO] Please!

202
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,757
[YAO] I have to!

203
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,857
[LELEI] Do you want me to tell

204
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:40,624
the Japanese you need their
help?

205
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:41,690
(gasp)

206
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,790
[YAO] Yes, please!

207
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,524
[LELEI] Is there anything else?

208
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:45,357
[YAO] Huh?

209
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:47,524
[YAO] From the looks of things,

210
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:49,690
it seems you have some influence
over them.

211
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,257
[YAO] I'd appreciate it if you
could say something.

212
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:54,857
[LELEI] I'll talk to them.

213
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,757
[YAO] That's all I can ask.

214
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:04,390
[HAZAMA] Miss Yao Haa Dushi.
Sorry... but... we cannot help
you.

215
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,557
[YAO] Lelei what did he say?

216
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:09,324
[LELEI] He says he can't help...
Yao.

217
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:10,124
(gasp)

218
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:11,090
[YAO] No what do you mean?!

219
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,290
[HAZAMA] The problem lies

220
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,690
with the geography of where
you live.

221
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,024
The Schwartz Woods are in the
country of Elbe...

222
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:18,324
And that's beyond the borders of
the Empire.

223
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:20,157
[HAZAMA] As a military
organization

224
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:22,057
we cannot cross that border
right now.

225
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:26,190
It would be considered an act of
aggression.

226
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,957
[HAZAMA] And that is simply
something we cannot risk

227
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:29,590
at the moment. I hope you
understand.

228
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,424
[LELEI] You should probably let
it go.

229
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:33,124
The General does have his
reasons.

230
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,490
[YAO] It's... not like we need
an "army" or anything.

231
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,890
I heard that it was only, maybe
ten of your soldiers

232
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,357
who defeated it and drove it
away!

233
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:40,390
[YAO] That's all we need!

234
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,824
[HAZAMA] Out of the question!

235
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:44,857
I will not put my men in such
extraordinary danger!

236
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:46,190
[HAZAMA] These beasts are
deadly,

237
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,024
it's pure luck they survived the
first time.

238
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:49,190
(exhale)

239
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:56,224
[HAZAMA] Look it gives me no
pleasure to refuse to help
you...

240
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:57,757
but I have no choice in the
matter.

241
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,424
[LELEI] He's very sorry.

242
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:01,357
[YAO] My village...

243
00:11:01,457 --> 00:11:03,257
[ELDER] To your sincere way of
life

244
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:05,857
that didn't get lost even
with those misfortunes,

245
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,024
we will entrust the destiny of
the Dark Elves of the Schwartz.

246
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:13,624
[ELDER] Then go! And come back
with the green ones to help us!

247
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,290
(reax)

248
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,690
[YANAGIDA] Lieutenant Itami..
might be up for it.

249
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,924
[LELEI] He says Lieutenant Itami
might do it.

250
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:44,190
[YANAGIDA] If it was up to him,
he'd save every last one of
you...

251
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,290
and put you in a display case...

252
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:58,490
[YOJI] Here we are!
[TODO] Amazing you managed
to put a landing strip here!

253
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,657
[YOJI] Yeah right?... we had to
pick a location

254
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:03,190
the Empire didn't know very much
about.

255
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,557
[YOJI] Take a look at that.

256
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,857
That's gonna be our ride to meet
with the locals.

257
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,557
[YOJI] A little further down...
We'll be meeting a contact.

258
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:15,957
[TODO] Oh? Is it someone you
know from the Capital?

259
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:19,090
[YOJI] Yeah. A friendly named
Hamilton will be there with

260
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,757
her subordinates to help us make
quick an exchange.

261
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,357
[PINA] Hello Itami! Sorry for
the trouble!

262
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:27,924
[YOJI] Hey... No sweat...

263
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:29,357
(giggle)

264
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:32,057
[TODO] And who is this?

265
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:33,724
[YOJI] Pina Co Lada.

266
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:36,657
[YOJI] Happens to be the third
princess of the Empire.

267
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,790
[TODO] <react>

268
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,990
[PINA] It's been a while.

269
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,790
The first time since we came
back?

270
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,190
[YOJI] So what is it that brings
you all the way out here?

271
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,990
[PINA] Well, now... Sugawara
said something about

272
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,757
another diplomat dropping in on
us.

273
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:51,557
[PINA] And I thought I'd make
his acquaintance.

274
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:54,657
[PINA] Mmm... and uh... (ahem)

275
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,357
[PINA] You know...

276
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:01,824
I think you might be carrying
something, yes?

277
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:03,057
[YOJI] Mm? Carrying what?

278
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,990
[PINA] Boses gave you a package
for me!

279
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,057
[YOJI] What do you mean?

280
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:07,957
[PINA] Whatever you know 'what'!

281
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:09,190
[YOJI] Oh yeah!

282
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,024
I remember now.

283
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,390
(gasp!)

284
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,490
[PINA] This is it!

285
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,190
This is what I've been waiting
for!

286
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,224
[TODO] What did you get exactly?

287
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:23,657
[PINA] A work of fine‐art!

288
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,490
[BOSES] We finished translating
the first batch...

289
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,324
They were sent to Princess Pina
in today's shipment.

290
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:40,490
[PANACHE] And so now... all we
have to do is find out

291
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,457
what books will be in the second
package.

292
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:45,924
[ROSE] Oh, please!
You must allow me do the next
translation!

293
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:47,290
[PANACHE] You need to wait your
turn.

294
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,890
[PANACHE] We will assign what
job

295
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,824
everyone is to do when the time
comes.

296
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:52,690
[NISHINA] Ladies.

297
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,890
The new tea leaves came in to
the café just today.

298
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,524
We think you'll like it.

299
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,957
[ROSE] Oh, this is good! What
are these pastries?

300
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:04,090
[NISHINA] It comes from Aoyama
in Japan...

301
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,324
and it was created by a famous
confectioner.

302
00:14:06,424 --> 00:14:08,457
[NISHINA] The pastry is known as
a Napoleon.

303
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,457
[BOSES] This is so wonderful.

304
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:12,124
[BOSES] I hardly believe it!

305
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:14,224
You have taken something so
tiny...

306
00:14:14,324 --> 00:14:15,557
And you've turned it into

307
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,857
an amazing piece of edible
artwork.

308
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,257
[ROSE] It's deliciouus!

309
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,690
[PANACHE] Sure is.

310
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,790
[NISHINA] 'Scuse me.

311
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,790
(breath catch)

312
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:31,657
[NISHINA] What are they reading
that for?!

313
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:34,624
And how the hell am I going to
enter this into my report?

314
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:39,024
[KAMO] So Nishina's the one
keeping an eye on them...

315
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:40,290
[KENGUN] He's on butler duty?

316
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,757
[YOGA] I got some chatter that
Yanagida

317
00:14:41,857 --> 00:14:44,024
sent him to a certain restaurant
in Ikebukuro.

318
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:46,057
[KAMO] What a pain in the ass.
Ugh.

319
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:47,924
[TSUGE] Hey take a look over
there?

320
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:49,857
[DELILAH] Here you go!

321
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:55,757
[LELEI] It's an herbal tea made
from St. John's wort.

322
00:14:55,857 --> 00:14:59,557
[LELEI] It is said to remove
anxiety and depression.

323
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,690
[LELEI] Try it.

324
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,890
[LELEI] Uh.. have some more.

325
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,590
(sip)

326
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,490
[YAO] It feels like...
Like I've been living in a
never‐ending nightmare.

327
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,024
None of this feels real to me
anymore.

328
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:30,824
[YAO] All I hope.. is that it's
all a dream.

329
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:35,257
[YAO] Please tell me this isn't
really happening.

330
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:37,590
Tell me you misinterpreted what
the General said.

331
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,357
[LELEI] I didn't misinterpret
anything.

332
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:43,590
[LELEI] Everything that I told
you... and what you saw...

333
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,324
Everything was real.

334
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:47,390
[YAO] No you made a mistake!
Uh...

335
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:55,490
(inhale, into sob)

336
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:58,124
(sob/gasp)

337
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:03,024
[YAO] Please... (gasp) Tell me
it was a mistake...

338
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:05,290
[YAO] Why...can't they do it?

339
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,457
[LELEI] I'm afraid the
General...

340
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:09,224
already explained that to you.

341
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:11,824
[YAO] But my people...

342
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:14,024
my... people... (exhales)

343
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:15,457
(tavern/restaurant buzz)

344
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,190
[DELILAH] What in the hell...

345
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,624
[DELILAH] It's like we're at a
funeral or something.

346
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:22,490
[GASTON] Yeah I heard about the
dark elf...

347
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,024
Supposedly the General told her

348
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:25,957
that he can't help her with the
flame dragon.

349
00:16:26,057 --> 00:16:28,657
[DELILAH] Think it has something
to do with pissing off Rory?

350
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:29,757
[GASTON] I doubt it.

351
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:32,357
I don't think that group had
much say in it.

352
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:35,090
[DELILAH] So it came down from
the top then.

353
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,524
[DELILAH] And here they are
sitting upstairs about to talk
all about it.

354
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,690
[DELILAH] I really need to start
working on my Japanese

355
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,424
so I can understand what they're
saying.

356
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:45,424
[GASTON] Delilah... I'm really
not gonna say anything

357
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:47,324
about this "side" gig of
yours...

358
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,590
but I really don't want to lose
this job, alright?

359
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,824
[GASTON] If anyone starts asking
around...

360
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,890
I'm telling 'em what you're
doin'.

361
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,824
[DELILAH] You do what you gotta
do.

362
00:16:57,924 --> 00:16:59,590
But I'm not screwin' this up.

363
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:04,924
[KENGUN] So, Yoga. Isn't there
something we can do?

364
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,257
[YOGA] Eh? Unfortunately no.

365
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:07,590
Ichigaya says...

366
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,557
we can't do anything that could
be considered

367
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:11,257
a provocative act
to the opposition.

368
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:13,024
[TSUGE] What do politics have to
do

369
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:14,157
with a damn dragon, huh?

370
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:15,390
[YOGA] Well, uh... actually

371
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,890
we were called before the Diet

372
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,024
to talk about fatalities

373
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:19,290
from the last dragon attack.

374
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,890
[KAMO] If we did do something,

375
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,957
it could go real bad.

376
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:22,957
They might even call

377
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:24,024
a vote of no‐confidence

378
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:25,057
against the Cabinet.

379
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:26,424
[YOGA] Morita's Cabinet

380
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:28,624
isn't exactly full of hawks,
either.

381
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:32,124
[KAMO] What about the big hero?
Itami?

382
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:33,357
[KAMO] 'Cause you know...

383
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:35,557
that guy might be up for doing
something.

384
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:38,590
I mean... he already testified
at the Diet didn't he?

385
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,124
[YOGA] Yeah, he did. He saved us
a lot of grief.

386
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:43,257
He and the three girls he took
made us look

387
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:45,957
pretty decent in the eyes of the
politicos.

388
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:47,990
(reaction)

389
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,657
[KENGUN] That doesn't help
anything.

390
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:51,824
[KENGUN] A little girl's crying
over there.

391
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:53,224
[KENGUN] We should be able to
use

392
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:54,557
just a minimum of force...

393
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,657
and quietly take care of that
dragon for good.

394
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:58,424
[KENGUN] I mean it shouldn't be
that hard.

395
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,457
[KAMO] What if we send in an
F‐4?

396
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:02,357
[YOGA] Based on the reports
you'd need to send

397
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,257
a whole squadron after something
like that!

398
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:06,490
[YOGA] One Phantom won't cut it.

399
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,057
[YOGA] If it were up to me...

400
00:18:08,157 --> 00:18:09,490
I'd use the F‐4 to harass it

401
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,390
and drive it down close to the
deck, about 20 meters.

402
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,424
[YOGA] Then we get the artillery
batteries to lob in

403
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,390
H‐E rounds while it's trying to
regain altitude.

404
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,357
[YOGA] Then, hit it with TOW
missiles from our Cobras!

405
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,357
[YOGA] And you know, a few sabot
rounds

406
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:23,857
from our tanks wouldn't hurt,
either.

407
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:27,024
[YOGA] After that, we put some
boots on the ground to confirm
the kill.

408
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:29,057
[YOGA] Might throw in some high
explosive

409
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:30,757
to finish it off. Just in case.

410
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:32,690
(disgruntled reax)

411
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,157
[KENGUN] That's kinda overkill,
don't you think?

412
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,345
[LELEI] I have something to do,
so I need to go.

413
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:45,245
If you don't have a place to
stay,

414
00:18:45,345 --> 00:18:48,845
make your way to the Co‐op
office.

415
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:52,478
[YAO] If these officers
have their reasons to
refuse help to me...

416
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,578
What do I do...?
How do I change their minds

417
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:58,545
and convince them to reconsider
this?

418
00:18:58,645 --> 00:19:01,711
[YAO] Perhaps I can persuade
a lower officer?

419
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:05,211
Using money...
Or do I try and seduce him.

420
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:12,678
[RORY] Hey there... not finding
what you need at the bar?

421
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,011
[YAO] Um excuse me.

422
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:17,845
[TUKA] <react>

423
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,811
Oh! Lelei told me all about
you...

424
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,045
You must be Yao.

425
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:23,011
[YAO] Yes.

426
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,245
[TUKA] Just gimme a minute

427
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:25,878
and I'll show you around the
place, okay?

428
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:33,678
[YAO] Tempt his pockets.. or
tempt his loins?

429
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:35,678
Perhaps I should try both.

430
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:37,845
What was his name...?

431
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:39,811
[LELEI] He says Itami might do
it for you.

432
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:42,445
[YANAGIDA] Lieutenant Itami...
might be up for it.

433
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:44,111
[KAMO] He might be up for doing
something.

434
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:45,278
[YAO] Itami...

435
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:47,945
[TUKA] Oh...? What did you just
say?

436
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:51,411
[YAO] Itami...

437
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:52,745
[YOJI] Take care Your Majesty.

438
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:54,145
We'll catch up with you later

439
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:55,678
at the palace if that's all
right.

440
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,678
[PINA] Yes. Yes, Lieutenant.
Thank you for your time.

441
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:00,478
[YOJI] Nah. It's not like the
only reason

442
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:03,378
I came here was to deliver your
artwork!

443
00:20:03,478 --> 00:20:05,145
[PINA] Right, sure, I know that!

444
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,211
I think it's safe to say
that your objectives are
the same as mine.

445
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:11,578
Both of us want the exact same
thing out of this conference...

446
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,978
[BOTH] To get everyone to sit
down for a peace summit!

447
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,078
(half laugh)

448
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:23,011
Right... and now it's time for
us to head back home.

449
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:25,611
[HAMILTON] Princess Pina, this
was a lot of trouble.

450
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:28,711
You could've had it delivered
with everything else.

451
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:30,878
[PINA] Just look at it.

452
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:32,478
[HAMILTON] Ehhh...

453
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:34,211
[PINA] Uh? NO no I don't mean
that!

454
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:35,845
It's what's on the inside!

455
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,411
[HAMILTON] Is that...

456
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:39,978
...a record of what he's done?

457
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:42,611
[PINA] Yes... They did this for
me as a little favor

458
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:44,078
while they were translating it.

459
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:46,711
[HAMILTON] The hero who
prevented an invasion...

460
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:49,278
and saved the people of Japan
from the Empire?!

461
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,378
[HAMILTON] Sir Itami did that?!

462
00:20:51,478 --> 00:20:52,811
[PINA] He did.

463
00:20:52,911 --> 00:20:54,645
Apparently, he was also
in the army

464
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:57,511
that crushed the Allied
Kingdom's Forces at Alnus Hill.

465
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,378
[PINA] And the same group that
saved

466
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:01,578
the Coda Village from the flame
dragon...?

467
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,878
He was there too.

468
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:05,378
[PINA] Oh and... He commanded
the forces

469
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:07,645
that fought with us at Italica.

470
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:13,445
[PINA] Who's this man, Itami?
Who is he?

471
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:14,511
[KURATA] Omigod omigod!

472
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:15,711
You heard about it, right, sir?

473
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:17,645
In the Imperial Capital, there
are

474
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:20,078
a bunch of beast girls and bird
girls too!

475
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,211
[YOJI] Yeah?!

476
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:22,711
[YOJI] But I thought that you
were

477
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:24,311
partial to cat girls all this
time.

478
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:27,111
[SHINO] You guys are the biggest
dorks ever! Cut the chatter!

479
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:28,878
[BOTH] Nooo!
Nu‐uh..

480
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:30,678
[YOJI] This is important stuff
we're talking about here!

481
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:32,978
[KURATA] Damn right it is!

482
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:34,311
[MARI] Lieutenant.

483
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:36,745
I forgot... the children
of the refugees from

484
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:39,245
Coda Village stopped by to see
us before we left.

485
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:40,411
[YOJI] They did?

486
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:42,078
[MARI] Yeah... they wanted to
say...

487
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:44,945
thank you for all the
kindnesses we've shown them.

488
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:46,778
[MARI] And they wanted us to
know...

489
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:48,778
they're glad we brought them
here.

490
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:50,345
[YOJI] They speak Japanese?

491
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:52,711
[MARI] Yes... kids are some
quick learners...

492
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,678
pretty impressive right?

493
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:59,978
[KURATA] OW!
Geez, Lieutenant! What
was that for? Oww...

494
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:10,611
[YOJI] Peace cannot get here
fast enough.

495
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:12,978
[LELEI] Year 687 on the Imperial
Calendar.

496
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:18,145
[LELEI] The year that brought
the Empire war and destruction.

497
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:20,578
And it was only half over.
