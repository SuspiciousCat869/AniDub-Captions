1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:11,633
[rotor drone]

2
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,000
[HAZAMA] Gentlemen... Third
Recon just relayed a request

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,366
from Princess PINA of the
Empire.

4
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:18,533
As commanding officer
in the city of Italica,

5
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:20,900
she'd like us to help reinforce
their positions inside the city.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,300
[KAMO] Allow my unit handle it!

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,833
[TSUGE] My First Combat Team's
ready to go anytime!

8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:26,166
You just give the word, sir!

9
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:27,966
[KENGUN] Nonsense!
[TSUGE] Uh...

10
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:30,000
[KENGUN] A ground assault
will be too slow!

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,000
Italica needs help right away!

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,066
[KENGUN] General... send
in my airborne unit, sir!

13
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,333
[YOGA] I installed the speaker
system. It's ready.

14
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:39,866
We've got a CD with Wagner
and we're good to go. Ah...

15
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,900
[KENGUN] I like your thinkin'
Colonel.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,400
[YOGA] Seemed appropriate sir!

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,033
[HAZAMA] We're going with the
airborne option this time.

18
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,266
The situation needs a quick
response.

19
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:51,400
But I will need the rest
of you standing by.

20
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,333
[HAZAMA] Here we go...
these knuckleheads

21
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,700
have waiting a long time for
something like this.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,533
[HAZAMA] But the last thing
we need is a bunch of crazy
meat heads.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,900
(war cries)

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,900
(hack effort)

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,233
(slashed)

26
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,033
[NORMA] Keep fighting them,
keep fighting...!

27
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,533
They're overrunning us!

28
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,033
(thrust effort)

29
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,233
(hit; grunt)

30
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:11,866
[BANDIT BOSS] Chamberlain Co
Igloo is dead!

31
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,566
(cheers)

32
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:17,766
[BANDIT BOSS] Everyone!
This is war! This is death!

33
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,066
[BANDIT BOSS] For what was lost
for us at Alnus!

34
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,566
For what was forever sought
and never achieved

35
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,566
[BANDIT BOSS]! We shall have...!
Forever!

36
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,033
[BANDITS] YEAH!!!!!!!!!

37
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:31,300
[BANDIT BOSS] Our lives, and
every life we take with us

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,133
will guide your salvation!

39
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:34,600
[BANDIT BOSS] Our lives will be
given

40
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,033
as our final tribute to Emroy,
the Dark Lord of War!

41
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,000
(cheer!)

42
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,266
[BANDIT BOSS] This is it...!

43
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:44,266
Offer your souls to destiny...
to Emroy!!!

44
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:46,666
(cheer!)

45
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,033
[MESSENGER] Master Norma is
dead, Your Highness!

46
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:52,433
(helpless/seething)

47
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:55,466
[HAMILTON] Norma is gone.

48
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:56,866
[MESSENGER] The East Gate
has fallen!

49
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,233
Italica's militia
is overwhelmed,

50
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,000
Milady, they're
asking for more men!

51
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,933
[PINA] We don't have
anyone else to give them!

52
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,200
(hyper aroused sound)

53
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,133
[RORY] No! No! I can't hold it
back! I can't! AHHHHHHHHH!

54
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:12,100
[RORY] I can't...
stop it! I can't...!

55
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,366
[RORY] Ah make it stop...!

56
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:18,600
[RORY] Help me!
I'm losing my miiiind!

57
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,566
(curious)

58
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,066
(gasp) (breath catch)

59
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,500
[YOJI] What's up with Rory?

60
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,033
[LELEI] Rory's body acts as the
doorway to death...

61
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,100
whenever soldiers fall in
battle...

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,533
they go through her to Emroy.

63
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,966
[LELEI] And each passing soul
creates a somewhat

64
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,233
...pleasurable sensation.

65
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,633
[SHINO] Doesn't seem
pleasurable.

66
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,933
[YOJI] Lelei... can we do
anything to help her?

67
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:40,566
[LELEI] Only she can allow
herself to surrender.

68
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,566
[YOJI] Any word yet from the
East Gate?

69
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,366
[KUWABARA] Not a thing.

70
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:48,700
[YOJI] We still need to
tell them what to hit
when they get there.

71
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,266
(warcries)
(Pina stunned)

72
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:51,500
[MILITIAMAN] We need help...!

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,666
Where are the warriors
in green anyway...

74
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:56,133
[MILITIAMAN] We need to fall
back! Someplace sa...

75
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:05,166
(roar)

76
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:06,700
[MESSENGER] At the rate they're
going,

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,633
they'll have the framework
of the gates down any moment!

78
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,500
And if that happens they'll
reach the inner city.

79
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,133
We need to sound the evacuation
while people still have a chance
to leave!

80
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,966
[PINA] If I could only get
my knights here faster...

81
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:18,800
[YOJI] Kuribayashi!

82
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,700
[SHINO] Sir!

83
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,833
[YOJI] I'm sorry...

84
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:21,933
but can you stay with Rory
for now?

85
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:23,633
(orgasmic sounds)

86
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,800
[YOJI] Sergeant Major. I'm
leaving you in command here.

87
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,800
[KUWABARA] You got it.

88
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,966
[SHINO] OK come on Rory...

89
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:30,000
stick with us... hang in there.

90
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:44,566
[KUWABARA] Damn... girl.
[YOJI] We're following her...

91
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,900
come on! Now!

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,266
[YOJI] Four‐zero‐one. This is
Third Recon.

93
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,333
[YOJI] The enemy is attacking
the East Gate.

94
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:54,133
[YOJI] I say again. Aggressors
are at the East Gate.

95
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:57,100
[YOJI] Will mark the target with
a white flare. Over.

96
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,600
[COBRA] Copy. We're still five
mikes out.

97
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,366
[YOGA] Ok, roger that.
We've got reports of friendlies

98
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,833
engaging the enemy inside
Italica's East Gate.

99
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,200
[KENGUN] Bring us in
at 10 o'clock...

100
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,433
and make sure everyone's ready
to hit 'em hard.

101
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:16,266
[YOGA] Copy that.

102
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:19,366
All units, go to weapons free.

103
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,100
[KENGUN] Keep the
sun at your six.

104
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,166
Let's go ahead and set the mood,
colonel.

105
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,266
It's time to make some noise.

106
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,233
What in the hell are you doing
sitting on your helmet?

107
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,733
I wanna hang onto my
testicles thank you!

108
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:29,533
[YOJI] Kuribayashi.

109
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,666
[SHINO] Uh... Sir!

110
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:32,733
[YOJI] Go ahead and take off
your night scope.

111
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,000
[SHINO] Why, Lieutenant?

112
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,866
[TOMITA] Because
you tend to break things.

113
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,433
[SHINO] I'll break your face!

114
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:39,533
[YOJI] The sun is already
starting to come up.

115
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,033
Would you please just
do us all a favor...

116
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,066
and save us the ass‐chewing from
the brass.

117
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:49,366
[BANDIT BOSS] Don't leave any
survivors! No one lives!

118
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,733
[BANDIT] Who wants that guy to
lead us?!

119
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,666
(leap, giggle, sigh, land)

120
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:01,766
(stopped)

121
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:04,466
(grunt?)

122
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,433
(lusty giggle)

123
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:15,500
(whokk)
(Hrrh?)

124
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:20,233
(giggle)

125
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:22,400
(ragdolled)

126
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:29,666
[Rory] Hmph.

127
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,400
(silence)

128
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,266
(explosion and screams)

129
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,200
[OSCAR ONE] All units...
This is Oscar One.

130
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,233
We've got friendlies
inside the city gate.

131
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,266
Engage outside the walls only!

132
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:51,766
(run efforts)

133
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:55,766
[BANDIT] I need
your spear over here!

134
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,166
[BANDIT] Yeah!

135
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:59,066
[OSCAR ONE] AAA emplacements
at the gate. Watch it!

136
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,433
[OSCAR ONE CO‐PILOT]
They're not loaded yet.

137
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:03,133
[KENGUN] Hunter One.
Take that target out.

138
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,166
[HUNTER ONE] Hunter One. Copy
that.

139
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:10,200
[KENGUN] Outstanding!
Get you a case of beer
for that one.

140
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,200
[SOLDIER] Sight alignment, good.

141
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,900
Stock pressured to the shoulder.

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,666
Cheek welds, okay.

143
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:17,233
Just drop it in softly.

144
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:27,200
[TUKA] That was really big...
are they using magic?

145
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,600
[LELEI] They're not.

146
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:30,733
[MARI] Hey wait.

147
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,833
Where are you going?

148
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,400
[LELEI] I'd like a closer look.

149
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,366
[BANDIT] What is that?!

150
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,833
(frightened)

151
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,000
[BANDIT BOSS] Emroy's oracle.

152
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,066
[YOJI] Bayonets, men!

153
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,033
[SHINO] Alriiight!

154
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,600
[TOMITA] That dumbass!

155
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,833
[YOJI] Let's go!

156
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:10,466
[YOJI] Watch the alleys! Fire!

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,266
(giggles)

158
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:14,400
(slashed)

159
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:15,366
(hit)

160
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,533
(giggles)

161
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:20,300
(giggles) (gasp) (giggles)

162
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
[BANDIT] Lock your shields!

163
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,833
(giggles)

164
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:27,433
(thrust effort) (thrown)

165
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,700
(impact)

166
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
(giggle)

167
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,500
(exultant laughter)

168
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,433
(throw effort)

169
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:44,533
(war cry)

170
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:48,333
(shot)

171
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,166
(breath catch)

172
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,733
(chokk)
(gasp)

173
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,900
[SHINO] Ah... Oh crap...!

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
[BANDIT BOSS] Fall back!
Everyone in formation!

175
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,166
[BOTH] Ehehh!!!

176
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,666
(breath catch)

177
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,500
(impaled)

178
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:25,766
[YOJI] Jesus Christ.
Those two are getting way too
into this.

179
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:27,100
[TOMITA] What do we do?

180
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,266
[YOJI] Do whatever you can

181
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,033
to keep the enemy in front of
them.

182
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,100
Cover their rear!

183
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,266
[TOMITA] Got it!

184
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,300
(seething) (gasp)

185
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,333
(impaled)

186
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,200
[BANDIT BOSS] I am not beaten...

187
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,066
This battle isn't a real
battle...

188
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:54,366
They have no honor... they have
no honor Oracle.

189
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:58,333
You know it to be true. Please
Oracle!!

190
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,666
[BANDIT] The oracle killed him!

191
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,166
[BANDIT] Don't stand there!

192
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,900
We still have a battle
before us you cowards!

193
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,233
[HUNTER ONE] Third Recon. Hunter
One here!

194
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,633
You've got ten
seconds to clear the area

195
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,466
and then we're gonna execute
a cleanup of the engagement
zone.

196
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:19,566
[HUNTER ONE] I say again.
We're starting the cleanup of
the engagement zone.

197
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,900
You need to bug out, now.

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,266
[HUNTER ONE] 10, 9, 8,

199
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:25,633
[HUNTER ONE] 7, 6, 5, 4,

200
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:26,966
[SHINO] Put me down, dammit!

201
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:28,266
I can run on my own, asshole!

202
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:29,733
[HUNTER ONE] 3... 2... 1.

203
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,566
(multiple shots, death screams)

204
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,200
(minigun zipper)

205
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,400
[HAMILTON] It's a monster.

206
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,166
[PINA] A flying horse of steel.

207
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:00,500
How can this even exist?

208
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,766
No soldier or army can match
such a level of force.

209
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,500
[PINA] A power that can
eradicate everything.

210
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,200
[PINA] No pride, No glory...
nothing is left in its wake.

211
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,233
[LELEI] The battle is over.

212
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,700
[TUKA] It got every last one of
them?

213
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,600
[PINA] Does the goddess really
think this low of us?

214
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,400
[PINA] Are we really so small?
So... insignificant?

215
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,500
[SERGEANT] GO! GO! GO!

216
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,200
[SOLDIER] Keep your head on a
swivel!

217
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,766
Find a staging area
for the POWs!

218
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,133
And another one
for the survivors!

219
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,300
[SOLDIER] Hey, sarge!
I found one!

220
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,800
[YOGA] Colonel. Yoga here.

221
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,433
No more enemies on‐site...

222
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:44,000
looks like we got a clean sweep.
I'm out.

223
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,366
[KENGUN] All right.

224
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,133
[YOJI] Looks like we're done.

225
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,533
[MILITIAMAN] Thank you.

226
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:51,233
We're all safe thanks to you,
the men in green...

227
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,500
but I must ask, who are you
where do you come from?

228
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:59,100
[TOMITA] We're from Japan... The
self defense force.

229
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:03,233
[PINA] They completely wiped
them out...

230
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,033
All of them... every single one.

231
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,233
(breath catch/shivers)

232
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,400
[RORY] Oh...

233
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,766
[RORY] Hmph...

234
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,900
[YOJI] Hunh...?
[RORY] Ehee!

235
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,833
[YOJI] Oh...? Eheh...

236
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,133
<PUNCH>
[YOJI] Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

237
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,133
[GREY] Well, it's done.

238
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:55,766
[PINA] At the very least,
we can say the bandits are gone.

239
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:57,400
[HAMILTON] Yes. It's a victory.

240
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,700
[PINA] No it's not.
It's Rory, the apostle of Emroy,

241
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,600
and the foreign soldiers who won
victory. Not us.

242
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,966
[PINA] And the others...

243
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,966
They're the one's still
occupying Alnus Hill...

244
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:10,700
They're still our enemy.

245
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
[PINA] All I wanted to do was
save Italica...

246
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,100
but I fear I may have brought
a fate even worse than defeat.

247
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,500
[PINA] Their flying weapons of
steel and dark sorcery

248
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,733
obliterated a hoard of hardened
bandits in seconds.

249
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,700
[PINA] If they were to turn that
power against Italica...

250
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,400
Even I'd be...

251
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,600
[PINA] Princess Myui
would be forced to give up

252
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,966
her position and be taken
as their prisoner.

253
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,700
[PINA] And this place, a vital
crossroads of the

254
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,066
Imperial Capital would be in the
hands of the enemy.

255
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,466
[PINA] Our citizens taken as
their slaves.

256
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:50,433
[HAMILTON] But they'd never...!
[PINA] Are you sure of that?

257
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,000
You think they helped
us rescue this town

258
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,233
just to give it back?

259
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,266
[PINA] I don't have the power to
refuse

260
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,566
if that's what they demand...

261
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,000
I might have to throw myself
at their mercy.

262
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:05,633
[PINA] ... and lower myself to
kiss their feet.

263
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:08,966
[HAMILTON] To show our
appreciation

264
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:09,966
for your assistance here...

265
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,100
...we'd like to negotiate

266
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,333
a fair and equitable
compensation.

267
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:16,233
[HAMILTON] Article Two,
is regarding all envoys...

268
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,700
and their safe passage,

269
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,166
as well as all their expenses...

270
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:20,733
[HAMILTON] And Article Three
is regarding

271
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,133
the trade privilege with
shopkeepers on Alnus Hill...

272
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,633
tariffs are hereby waived.

273
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,000
[HAMILTON] However, we would
like to make it clear

274
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,600
that we possess
the right to captives.

275
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,833
[LELEI] We understand that human
resources

276
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,766
are necessary for Italica's
recovery.

277
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,166
[LELEI] However...
they want assurance

278
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:38,166
the captives are
treated well... yes.

279
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,366
[HAMILTON] Treat captives well?

280
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,500
[LELEI] Like a friend...
or a relative...

281
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,200
like someone familiar ...
not treated as animals.

282
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,133
[HAMILTON] Would friends and
relatives attack...?

283
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,000
Taking up arms against a
peaceful town

284
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,033
completely unprovoked, looting
and butchering them?!

285
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,666
[LELEI] This is their
requirement.

286
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,100
[HAMILTON] Hmm Very well then...

287
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,166
that will be all regarding
treatment of the captives.

288
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:02,633
[HAMILTON] The rest of the
provisions address conditions
for withdrawal of your troops.

289
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,233
[LELEI] No objections as it's
been written.

290
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,033
(query)

291
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,666
[HAMILTON] Then the terms have
been agreed upon.

292
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,100
(sigh)

293
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,800
[GREY] So how did it go?

294
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,100
[PINA] They're taking a few
captives...

295
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,833
We're picking up the expenses,

296
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,233
and providing security for their
envoys...

297
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,700
And we're giving them tax‐exempt
trade in the city.

298
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,366
[GREY] I'd be waiting for their
true intentions to be revealed.

299
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:31,300
I'm assuming they'll be leaving
some soldiers here for a while?

300
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,133
[PINA] Mm‐mm... They said they'd
be pulling their forces out.

301
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:34,633
[GREY] That's ridiculous, Your
Majesty!

302
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:36,266
You don't win a battle like this

303
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:37,833
and not have any demands.

304
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,366
This whole thing feels odd.

305
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,233
[PINA] Right? Goes against
everything

306
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,366
you taught me about negotiating
victory...

307
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:45,833
It just doesn't make any sense.

308
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:48,566
[PINA] I'd like to know the kind
of magic Hamilton used.

309
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,633
(consternation)

310
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,566
[YOJI] Yep. Her... and her.

311
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,100
[YOJI] And I think she might be
able to help too.

312
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,366
[SHINO] The girl with the
feathers on her head?

313
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:59,533
[YOJI] Yeah.

314
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:01,200
[MARI] What a surprise,
they're all girls.

315
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,100
[YOJI] That's just a
coincidence.

316
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,466
[SHINO] Uh huh... I'm so not
buying this.

317
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,266
[YOJI] Well it's still just a
coincidence.

318
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:07,800
[MARI] Of course... Sure.

319
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,566
[YOJI] Great! Glad we all agree!

320
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,233
[MARI] Well... obviously we
can't simply

321
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,300
leave these women behind enemy
lines.

322
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,266
(rotor noises)

323
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:21,000
[CIVILIANS] Thank you!
Thanks for everything!

324
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,400
[TOMITA] So... should we be
heading out too, sir?

325
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,400
[KURATA] Uuh. Don't we still
need the girls?

326
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,933
[YOJI] They're in negotiations,

327
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,433
why they came here in the first
place.

328
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,500
[TOMITA] Oh right I almost
forgot about that.

329
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,166
[YOJI] Yeah... we did come here
for a reason.

330
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,600
And instead, we wound up dealing
with

331
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,733
a buncha jerks trying to tear
the place apart.

332
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,513
[LELEI] We were hoping to sell
these.

333
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:59,580
[RYUDO] Well... a splendid
dragon scale you've got there.

334
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,413
[RYUDO] At first glance...
looks like it's from a wyvern.

335
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:05,613
[LELEI] That's right.
[RYUDO] So how many do you have?

336
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:07,880
[LELEI] 200.
[RYUDO] 200?!

337
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,680
[LELEI] Also, the Empire has
given us

338
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,980
a traders' tax exemption inside
the city limits.

339
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,013
[RYUDO] Aha! Privileged merchant
status isn't easy to come by.

340
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:21,113
Well, I'd normally give you 200
gold and 4000 denari silver for
such a prize.

341
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:24,080
The thing is... what with the
battle we just had in the city,

342
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,680
silver coins are kind of scarce.

343
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,246
[RYUDO] I can only give you
a thousand denari at the moment.

344
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:33,480
[LELEI] And the rest?
[RYUDO] I can make out a draft
for 2,000 right away...

345
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,880
but that's about it I'm afraid.
Hmm?

346
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:38,580
[LELEI] That'll do... we'll give
you

347
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,146
a discount for the other
thousand ...

348
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,413
[LELEI] But I'd like to get some
information from you

349
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:44,613
that would be worth that price.

350
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:48,146
[RYUDO] Oh is that right...
information?

351
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:49,380
[ASSISTANT] Really?

352
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,146
They thought that was worth a
thousand?

353
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:54,946
[RYUDO] That's the beautiful
thing about the trade business
my boy.

354
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:56,280
[RYUDO] One man's rubbish

355
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,446
is but another man's treasure,
right?

356
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:01,980
[RYUDO] And I trade in all sorts
of rubbish...

357
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:11,180
[YOJI] Good grief I'm worn out!

358
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,646
[KURATA] You are not kidding,
sir

359
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,113
... that was rough out there.

360
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,313
[YOJI] And I didn't get a

361
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:16,613
whole lotta sleep last night
anyway...

362
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:18,046
you can just kill me now.

363
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,180
[KURATA] We got more smoke on
our two, Lieutenant!

364
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,946
[YOJI] Again are you kidding me?

365
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,046
[YOJI] Is it coming this way?

366
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,446
[YOJI] Can't get a clear enough
view to tell what it is.

367
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:35,880
[KURATA] Oh... think I got it!

368
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,446
[YOJI] What do you see?
[KURATA] Ah! A tiara! Uh...

369
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:39,746
[YOJI] Yeah, sure okay...
A tiara?!?

370
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:41,580
[KURATA] Looks like a blonde!

371
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,580
[YOJI] There's a blonde? Hey...
[KURATA] WITH RINGLETS!

372
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,946
[YOJI] I love ringlets...

373
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:46,513
[KURATA] Confirmed. A blonde
with sweet ringlets!

374
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,080
A hottie in men's clothes,

375
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,746
followed by even more hotties!

376
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:52,546
And roses?

377
00:20:52,646 --> 00:20:54,380
[KURATA] AND ROSES!

378
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,613
[YOJI] Three different kinds of
roses.

379
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,146
[YOJI] Must be the Order the
princess was talking about.

380
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:02,813
[KURATA] I've never seen a real
set of ringlets before.

381
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:04,280
That's awesome!

382
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,913
[YOJI] I'm assuming that that
one has got to be the Yellow
Rose.

383
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:09,646
And the one next to her
must be the White Rose.

384
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,046
[KUWABARA] Look sharp, people.

385
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,546
[YOJI] Hang on, Top.

386
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:15,813
We do not need to
start anything here.

387
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:18,213
Let's try not to screw up the
treaty, okay?

388
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:19,246
[KUWABARA] Wilco.

389
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:20,546
[PANACHE] Where are you from?

390
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,380
[TOMITA] We're... uh, ugala
Italica to home.

391
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
[PANACHE] Where's "home."

392
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,580
[TOMITA] Aluunus Ulu.

393
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,880
[PANACHE] What do you mean Alnus
Hill?

394
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,413
[YOJI] Remember what I said,
Top. No shooting, okay?

395
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:37,046
[BOSES] It's you! You are one of
them!

396
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:39,146
[YOJI] Whoa, hang on.

397
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:42,513
Hey there... my guy didn't just
offend you now, did he?

398
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:46,046
[PANACHE] Don't even move!

399
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:50,113
[YOJI] Hey... just take it easy,
okay? I'm sure we...

400
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:51,113
[BOSES] Silence!

401
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:52,813
[KUWABARA] No! Don't shoot!

402
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:56,313
[YOJI] Wait! No don't! Get outta
here! Go! Now!

403
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:57,913
Go to the checkpoint!

404
00:22:07,613 --> 00:22:10,080
[YOJI] Eh ‐ eheh?

405
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:15,546
So uh... uh... how ya doin?
Good, I hope...

406
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:50,480
[LELEI] Next time on "GATE:"
Princess' Decision.
