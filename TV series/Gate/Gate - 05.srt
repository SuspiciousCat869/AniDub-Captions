1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,466
[LELEI] The Self Defense Force
was sent to the Special
Region...

2
00:00:03,566 --> 00:00:07,333
[LELEI] ...where they created
shelter for refugees from the
Coda Village.

3
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:09,566
[LELEI] In order to support
themselves,

4
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:13,033
the refugees decide to sell the
valuable scales of wyverns

5
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,133
slaughtered at the Battle of
Alnus.

6
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:16,366
They set off to Italica,

7
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,800
along with the 3rd
Reconnaissance Unit

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,000
led by Lieutenant Yoji Itami.

9
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:32,300
[KUWABARA] We're on Thessalia
Way right now.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,833
[KUWABARA] And so I'm guessing
this over here must be Italica.

11
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:39,666
[KUWABARA] You're wondering
what this is, right?
[LELEI] Mm‐hmm!

12
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:43,066
[KUWABARA] It's a compass...
[KURATA] They used to call him
drill‐sergeant‐from‐hell.

13
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:47,000
Now he's going all grandpa over
a cute little witch with silver
hair.

14
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,200
[RORY] Interested huh?

15
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:05,933
[RORY] That's the kind of girl
you like, isn't it?

16
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,400
[YOJI] What are they doing back
there?

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,666
[KURATA] Sir.
[YOJI] What's going on?

18
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:12,500
[KURATA] We've got a plume of
smoke on our two, Lieutenant.

19
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:21,733
[YOJI] OK... does the road take
us anywhere near

20
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,233
where the smoke's coming from?

21
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,733
[KURATA] Yes it does...
we're gonna go right through it

22
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:26,966
if the map's correct.

23
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,166
[YOJI] Alright so this
is the second time

24
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:30,200
we're running into
a column of smoke.

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,500
[KUWABARA] That should be
Italica.

26
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:38,000
[YOJI] Heads up everybody

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,000
let's be sure to keep our eyes
open.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,966
[LELEI] Smoke's black... must be
trouble.

29
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:43,400
[YOJI] D'you know what it's
from?

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,266
[LELEI] Looks like it's...
man... made...

31
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:47,666
It's a...? It's a flower.

32
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:48,800
[KURATA] A flower?

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,800
[YOJI] I think she means
"fire..."

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,066
"Fi‐re."

35
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,500
[LELEI] Fi‐re...

36
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:58,100
[YOJI] Let's all stay awake out
there people and keep moving...

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,033
And remember... watch the sky as
well as the ground.

38
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:04,100
[SHINO] Three‐two, wilco.

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,733
[YOJI] What's your deal?

40
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,666
[RORY] There's blood in the
air...

41
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:57,266
[PINA] Their middle's weak!
Break it, now!

42
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:05,166
[BANDITBOSS] Son of a bitch...!
Re‐treat!

43
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,800
[PINA] Norma! Hamilton!

44
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,466
Are you alright?!

45
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:19,200
[HAMILTON] Alive and
accounted for, ma'am!
[NORMA] Uh‐huh...

46
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,766
[GREY] Hey well what about me?

47
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:23,833
You didn't even bother to ask
whether I was injured or not.

48
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:24,833
Hurts my feelings.

49
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:25,966
[PINA] After all these years

50
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,700
I know you better than that
Grey.

51
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,766
[HAMILTON] Your Majesty...

52
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:37,166
why did we come
all the way out here

53
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:40,033
to fight a bunch of crazed
blood‐thirsty bandits?

54
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,266
[PINA] We didn't have a choice!

55
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,566
They raised the alarm...
letting everyone know

56
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,900
they had armed forces trying to
storm the walls!

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,933
I thought it was the army from
the other world!

58
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:49,900
[PINA] We did what we were
supposed to:

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
rush to their defense!

60
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,133
And what did we find?

61
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:55,233
Soldiers from the other
kingdoms turned rogue!

62
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:59,833
[PINA] Listen to me! You don't
have time to lie about!

63
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,400
The bandits will be coming back!

64
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,900
It's time to bury the bodies...
and reinforce all the gates!

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,433
[PINA] The rest of my people are
coming!

66
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,100
But they're still three days
away.

67
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,766
If you can hold out that long,
the Order of The Rose

68
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,733
will avenge your fallen in
battle!

69
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,266
[PINA] Three days!

70
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,700
[BARTHOLOMEW] Your Highness...

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,133
With all due respect...

72
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,866
[PINA] What is it?
You want to surrender?

73
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:25,166
[BARTHOLOMEW] 'Course not.

74
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:26,833
Still... I'm hoping there's

75
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:29,100
a way to settle this without
bloodshed.

76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
[PINA] There certainly is...

77
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,733
open the gates and let them in.

78
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:37,300
[PINA] And after that... prepare
to give them everything.

79
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,133
[PINA] Let your men be shackled.

80
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,466
Let your women get raped.

81
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,166
[PINA] Leave all the decisions
to them

82
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,566
and allow them to do as they
please.

83
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,666
Just let them ravage and enslave
everyone...

84
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:49,833
It'll be the first step toward a
beautiful relationship.

85
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,366
[BARTHOLOMEW] You speak
facetiously.

86
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:54,333
[PINA] Of course I am, I'm
trying to illustrate a point.

87
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,333
[PINA] I know it's not an easy
thing to think about...

88
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,966
But pretending it's not as bad
as it really is...

89
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,733
will not help you...
you will lose everything.

90
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,666
[KAINE] I hope you enjoy.

91
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,433
[PINA] Hmm. It lacks in flavor
and sufficiency.

92
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:14,666
[KAINE] When one is physically
spent...

93
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,266
eating extremely rich foods

94
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,600
can actually shut the body down.

95
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,100
[PINA] Oh really?
You've dealt with a situation
like this before?

96
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,466
[KAINE] Of course. I am a native
of the city of Rosa.

97
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:28,700
Which is now a loyal part of the
Empire.

98
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,433
[PINA] Very well.

99
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,366
I shall be resting in
your guest room.

100
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:37,866
[PINA] Bring me any urgent
messages right away.

101
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,233
[KAINE] As you wish, Your
Majesty.

102
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:43,100
[PINA] Oh and uh... what will
you do

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,133
if I don't wake immediately?

104
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,266
[KAINE] I have a nice cold
pitcher of water

105
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,600
to pour on you if it comes to
that.

106
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,333
[PINA] Fine, that should work.

107
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,700
[PINA] There aren't many true
soldiers here.

108
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,233
The bravest militiamen are
always among the first to die.

109
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,166
Morale is getting low.

110
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:05,733
[PINA] My first battle should
have been glorious...

111
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:10,033
[PINA] But this... this is
pathetic.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,433
[YOUNGPINA] Listen!

113
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:16,466
Today... all of you are members
of the order!

114
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,633
Knighthood is a privilege!
Nothing less than an honor!

115
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:21,066
Live up to your title with your
heart and soul!

116
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,733
[GIRLS] Yes ma'am!

117
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,233
I'd like to introduce the man
behind our training.

118
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,966
He is Master Grey Co Aldo.

119
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,133
[YOUNGPINA] Well, sir...?

120
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,466
What should be our first course?

121
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:33,000
[GREY] Now let me see... I'd say
we begin with

122
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,066
the basics, which would be the
march.

123
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,300
[YOUNGPINA] Left and right and
left and right and left

124
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,766
and left and right and left and
right and left and right

125
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:45,600
[YOUNGHAMILTON] Oh. Oh?

126
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,000
[YOUNGPINA] Hamilton! If you
can't march,

127
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,800
then maybe you need to find
something else to do!

128
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,000
[YOUNGHAMILTON] Let me try
again!

129
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,733
[YOUNGPINA] Yeah, yeah. Fall
in.

130
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,366
[YOUNGHAMILTON] Yes, ma'am.

131
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,333
[YOUNGPINA] Good grief.

132
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:02,233
[GREY] It's only her first day,
Highness.

133
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,933
[GREY] So tell me something...

134
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:05,100
Are you truly serious about

135
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,966
making this an order of
knighthood?

136
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,266
[YOUNGPINA] Of course, I am.

137
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:10,233
Now I'm aware something like
working with me

138
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,833
must be beneath you and all.

139
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,466
[YOUNGPINA] I know my father
ordered you,

140
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,100
I'm sure you have better things
to do

141
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,766
than babysit the concubine's
princess.

142
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,866
[GREY] A concubine huh...?

143
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,000
Well... My birth wasn't
glamorous either...

144
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,300
if you don't mind my saying so
Princess.

145
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,700
Perhaps you and I have more in
common than you think.

146
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,566
I guess it's good to have
company.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,733
[YOUNGPINA] Master Grey...

148
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,166
Hmm! All right then.
Wear us out!

149
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,633
[YOUNGPINA] Train us like you
wanna kill us!

150
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,200
[MOLTO] In the name of Emperor
Molto Sol Augustus ...

151
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,166
The Order of the Rose is hereby
called into duty.

152
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:10,000
[PINA] Damn it!
Honor guard, honor guard.

153
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,200
Time and time again, that's all
we ever do!

154
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,600
[PINA] Goddamn him...
we have to be more than just
ornamentation for his parades!

155
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,300
[GREY] Patience Your Majesty.

156
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,100
Someday... we'll need to be
ready

157
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,600
when your father calls upon the
Order.

158
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,666
[MOLTO] Why don't we try this?

159
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,733
Take all of your knights

160
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,000
from the Order of The Rose and

161
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,533
go scout the situation for us.

162
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:33,433
[PINA] But... Your Majesty?
Scout the battlefield for you?

163
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,566
[MOLTO] And why not?

164
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,300
You've been longing to prove
that your knights

165
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,200
are doing more than just
marching and color guard.

166
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,533
So... here's your chance.

167
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,700
[PINA] Consider the mission
done... Your Majesty.

168
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,033
[PINA] My Order of The Rose

169
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,033
is finally sent to the
battlefield. And yet...

170
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,166
[PINA] The enemy?!
They're here?!

171
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,366
[GREY] We're not entirely sure
of what's going on out there.

172
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,500
[GREY] You might want to take a
look.

173
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,000
[PINA] What the hell's that?

174
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,766
[HAMILTON] Whoa... What's that
carriage armored with?

175
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:22,733
[PINA] Is that...... made of
iron?

176
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,066
[NORMA] Identify yourselves!

177
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,300
If you're not our enemy come
into the open now!

178
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:31,933
[PINA] That staff of hers...

179
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,200
only a Lyndon Wizard can wield
one.

180
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,933
[PINA] And an elf...?

181
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,866
If they know how to combine
their powers

182
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:41,333
it could end up being a serious
problem.

183
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,566
[PINA] Rory Mercury's with
them?!

184
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,000
[HAMILTON] Ehhh?!?

185
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,833
[GREY] Rory the Reaper.
That's definitely not good.

186
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:55,466
[PINA] I... I saw her performing
her rituals a few weeks ago.

187
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,833
[GREY] Why would an apostle of
Emroy

188
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:00,066
choose to join a band of
brigands?

189
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,400
[PINA] Well. It wouldn't really
surprise me much.

190
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,166
[GREY] What?

191
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:04,800
[PINA] The Gods' decisions

192
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,033
seem to be acts of whimsy
sometimes.

193
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,733
[GREY] I wouldn't say that
around the Oracle

194
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,166
if I were you, Princess.

195
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:16,233
[PINA] Perhaps. But even the
Gods can be damn fools.

196
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,433
[GREY] (groan) Oh holy hell
I did not just hear that!

197
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:22,066
[HAMILTON] So what're we going
to do? They're on their way.

198
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,233
[PINA] If these bandits already
have Rory the Reaper on their
side...

199
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,666
then we need to consider the
city already lost.

200
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:33,533
[HAMILTON] That's true...

201
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:34,666
[PINA] That being said...

202
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:37,666
we still don't know if they're
truly our enemy.

203
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,066
[PINA] What do we do?!

204
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:48,133
[PINA] Okay... if this group is
not our adversaries...

205
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:50,500
[PINA] ...we certainly want them
to join us!

206
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:53,233
[GREY] <reaction>

207
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,700
[PINA] Welcome to Italica,
friends!

208
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,600
[PINA] Ah, ah...!

209
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,766
Oh did I... that was me huh?

210
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,166
[GIRLS] Uh‐huh.

211
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:11,833
[KUWABARA] Lieutenant.

212
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:15,266
You there? Lieutenant!
Lieutenant! Come in!

213
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,700
[TUKA] What is wrong with you?

214
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,733
What kind of a person just
shoves a door open without even
looking?!

215
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,933
[PINA] Eh?! Uhhhh...
[TUKA] Even dwarves and pixies
are more careful!

216
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:34,233
[TUKA] What are you? Some kind
of goblin?

217
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:39,466
[RORY] Hello there... you're not
dead yet, are you?

218
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:46,933
[YOJI] OK, then... I guess they
decided to let us in.

219
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,933
[KUWABARA] 3‐1, Chief!

220
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,566
Are you there?! Come back.

221
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,933
[YOJI] Uhh... 3‐1.

222
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:55,800
[KUWABARA] <relaxes> Glad you
finally woke up...

223
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,633
I almost decided to move in.

224
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:02,233
[YOJI] Yeah... gimme a minute
before you do anything crazy.

225
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,733
I need to look around.

226
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,966
[KUWABARA] You got it.

227
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:10,066
[YOJI] So uh... Which one of you
fine folks is in charge here,
anyway?

228
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,500
[PINA] Wha...?! Wait what...!?

229
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,900
[HAMILTON] Everyone! You are in
the presence of Her Majesty...

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,766
the Third Princess Pina
CoLada...

231
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,600
Show some respect!

232
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,866
[YOJI] Huh?

233
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:26,133
[LELEI] The Princess?
[YOJI] Pina Co Lada?

234
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:30,333
[PINA] This is the fortified
city of Italica,

235
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:32,666
where the Thessalia and Ahppian
Ways come together.

236
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:36,366
[PINA] Which makes it extremely
vital for trade.

237
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:38,633
[PINA] This city and the
surrounding area was governed

238
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,766
by the family of Count Folmar
for generations.

239
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:43,866
However, the Count took ill
recently and passed away,

240
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:47,200
leaving a political power
struggle between his daughters.

241
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,800
[PINA] The two oldest were
married into other families,

242
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,600
but there was still a custody
battle.

243
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,133
They had a third sister Myui.

244
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,600
She happens to be the only

245
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,900
legitimate successor of the
Folmar family throne.

246
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,566
[YOJI] I guess that kinda thing
happens here in your world too
then, huh.

247
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,766
[LELEI] Itami... wait

248
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,800
did you just understand what she
said?

249
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,966
[YOJI] Uh yeah a little...
I'm starting to pick up bits
and pieces of your language...

250
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:11,200
here and there anyway.

251
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,833
[YOJI] Maybe I got special
powers when I hit my head...

252
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,400
[PINA] And then...

253
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,300
the Empire decided to send their
divisions through the Gate.

254
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,466
[PINA] All of our nobles
were ordered to send troops

255
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:22,833
from their kingdoms to join the
Empire in the fight.

256
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,733
In the end none of them made it
back here.

257
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,166
[PINA] Public order in the city
has deteriorated.

258
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:30,466
With no soldiers or anyone
skilled

259
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,666
in public service, it's complete
chaos.

260
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,933
[PINA] The Mistress of The
Folmar Fiefdom

261
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:38,533
is sitting on the other side of
this door.

262
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:42,000
She is Princess Myui... Folmar's
Countess.

263
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:47,000
[YOJI] Oh? That kid?

264
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,866
[LELEI] If I remember
correctly...

265
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:50,600
she'll be eleven this year.

266
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,800
[PINA] She may be the head of
the family...

267
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,066
but she's never been taught

268
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,633
the violent art of leading an
army.

269
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:58,933
[PINA] So for now...

270
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,766
I'm commanding what's
left of her militia...

271
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:01,733
until she can.

272
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,433
[YOJI] Okay I understand.

273
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:05,600
[PINA] Let me get this
straight...

274
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,166
You are offering to help us
defend the city.

275
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,566
[YOJI] Yeah... I don't think any
of the merchants here

276
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,533
are in the mood to buy dragon
scales right now.

277
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:18,733
[PINA] Very well then...
I'll assign your forces to
occupy and guard the South Gate.

278
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:19,600
[KUWABARA] Fall out!

279
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,266
[ALL ] Roger!

280
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:25,133
[HAMILTON] So they're the "men
in green"
we've been hearing about.

281
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,000
The ones who defeated the flame
dragon.

282
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,700
[PINA] Looks like they are.

283
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,133
[HAMILTON] Are you sure it's
safe?

284
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,233
Should we let the rest of them
inside the walls?

285
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,433
[PINA] We're not in a position

286
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,233
to be picky with our allies
right now.

287
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,866
[PINA] If they say they're here
to help

288
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:38,266
then we must believe them.

289
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:39,766
[HIGAKI] What are you talking
about!

290
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:42,433
You've got orders to get back
here, dummy! Right now!

291
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,133
[YOJI] Yeah... but it looks like
we're

292
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,100
getting caught up in a little
squabble, sir.

293
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,333
[HIGAKI] And who the hell
authorized you to do that?!

294
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:51,100
I need you back here, without
getting shot!

295
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,900
[YOJI] It's funny you should say
that...

296
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,033
So if it isn't too much trouble
I've got a teensy favor to ask,
sir.

297
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:01,666
[YOJI] See what I see?

298
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,966
[KUWABARA] Yeah. Scouts from the
looks of 'em.

299
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:06,200
Two battalions behind
'em, too.

300
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,133
Not sure if they're comin' here,
though.

301
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,766
[YOJI] Yeah I doubt they're
bringin' the party to us.

302
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:12,266
[KUWABARA] Probably not...

303
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:15,766
600 guys isn't enough to attack
the whole city at once.

304
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:16,966
And they'll stand out against

305
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,800
that limestone on the northern
cliffs.

306
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,366
I'd say the best concealed
routes...

307
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:23,633
are gonna be on the way to the
west or the east gates.

308
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,800
[KUWABARA] And of course...

309
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,166
you know where that puts us,
dontcha.

310
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:29,000
[YOJI] Yeah... just sittin' here
on our butts.

311
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,833
[YOJI] We are playing the decoy.

312
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:36,533
[YOJI] This gate was already
damaged during their prior
engagement.

313
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:38,066
So, her assumption is that if
they see

314
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,366
just the twelve of us here,
they'll attack.

315
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,500
And then run into her secondary
line

316
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,500
once they get past us.

317
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,500
[YOJI] That's what her plan is
anyway.

318
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,433
[KUWABARA] Do you really think
that they would go for that,
Lieutenant?

319
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:50,433
[YOJI] Well this is where
the Princess wants us for now.

320
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,233
So we'll just sit here, twiddle
our thumbs

321
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,066
and see who's dumb enough to
drop by.

322
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:58,100
Oh, yeah... Tell her we don't
need that bonfire, either.

323
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,633
[TOMITA] Is that the last one?

324
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,066
[MARI/KURATA] Yeah, Top!

325
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,466
[SHINO] Lieutenant. [YOJI] Hm?

326
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:05,166
[SHINO] Here... it's getting
dark.

327
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:07,266
[YOJI] Thanks...
You're the best.

328
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:08,966
Furuta. See what we can
do

329
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:11,233
about keepin' the bad guys on
the other side.

330
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,666
[FURUTA] You got it, boss.

331
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,366
[RORY] Itami, dear?

332
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:16,600
[YOJI] Huh?

333
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,000
[RORY] Why are you helping the
princess of an Empire

334
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,366
that attacked your homeland?

335
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:22,933
[YOJI] To protect the people of
this town Rory.

336
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,400
[RORY] You really meant that.
Wow.

337
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,600
[YOJI] Of course I did. I mean
why wouldn't I?

338
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,100
[YOJI] Dammit! C'mon get on
there!

339
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,700
[RORY] Let me have a look at
it...

340
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,233
I'll keep it steady.

341
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,666
[YOJI] I'd appreciate that.

342
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:44,000
Do you care about
what's going on?

343
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,033
[RORY] Emroy is a god of battle,
you know?

344
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,600
Where death and destruction

345
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,266
come with the territory.

346
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:51,000
[RORY] But there is... motive...

347
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,933
It is the most important thing.

348
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,833
[RORY] If your purpose isn't
righteous...

349
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:57,600
...then deception will sully
your soul.

350
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:04,233
[YOJI] Well since I wasn't lying
when I said I want to help

351
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,766
I guess there's no problem.

352
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,600
But I do have another reason.

353
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,833
[RORY] Hmm?

354
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,466
[YOJI] I wanna show them
different way...

355
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:14,466
that we're not this big enemy of
theirs...

356
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:18,166
I want the Princess to
understand she can talk with us.

357
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:22,433
[RORY] I like it!
I really really like it!

358
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:24,033
[RORY] Your fear!
[YOJI] Huh? Fear?

359
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:25,500
[RORY] I can feel it
coming off of you!

360
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,033
You'll burn into her soul I just
know it!

361
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:34,100
[RORY] I am wholly looking
forward to helping you
in the upcoming battle, sweetie!

362
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,633
[RORY] It's been so long since I
could let loose...

363
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:39,300
this should be superb! (giggle)

364
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,633
[YOJI] That's not exactly
what I meant.

365
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,833
[NORMA] Here it comes!
Flame arrows inbound!

366
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,700
[NORMA] Archers! Counter‐volley!

367
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,666
Get a message to the Princess!

368
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:15,200
We've made contact with the
enemy at the Eastern wall!

369
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,666
[PINA] They're at the East
Gate?!

370
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:19,333
[RORY] Why way over there?!

371
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:22,966
[RORY] We were supposed to
fight them right here! (pouty)

372
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:24,433
[KURATA] I got 0311...

373
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,866
they couldn't have timed it out
any better could they.

374
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,566
[KUWABARA] Those bandits out
there

375
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,700
used to be regular Army...

376
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,066
they still know a thing or two.

377
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,200
[YOJI] Has anybody from the East
Gate asked for us?

378
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,700
[KUWABARA] Nope. Nothing yet.

379
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,400
[YOJI] Oh‐kay...

380
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,933
[NORMA] Pick them off the wall!

381
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:43,566
Don't let an arrow go to waste!

382
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,833
[NORMA] It's a magic user!

383
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,033
[FARMER] I got this!

384
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,566
[BANDIT] I gotcha!

385
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,600
[BANDIT] Y'like that! The rest
of this should be easy!

386
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,000
[NORMA] Did these fools come
here

387
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
just to die in a meaningless
battle?

388
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,000
[PINA] So this is war.

389
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,366
[PINA] I've imagined its reality
so many times ‐

390
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,633
but I had no concept of it's
true horror.

391
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:45,533
[BANDIT] Get it open!

392
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,766
[PINA] Stay calm...

393
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,033
[NICOLA] You...
You sons of bitches!

394
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:28,266
[PINA] Someone...! Stop him!

395
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:30,033
[GUY] Follow Nicola...!

396
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,133
Kill them all!

397
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:37,466
[GREY] No!

398
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:42,100
[PINA] It can't be... this has
to stop!

399
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,400
[WOMAN] Where are all the
others?!

400
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,433
[WOMAN] Where are the men in
green?!

401
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:48,166
[PINA] Even if I were to call
for them they'll never come.

402
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,766
[PINA] I already put them at the
South Gate

403
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:53,200
as a sacrifice for the rest of
us!

404
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,866
[KUWABARA] Well? Boss?

405
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:59,266
[YOJI] Yeah, I know. I know.

406
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,466
[YOJI] C'mon Princess...

407
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:05,466
What're you gonna do?

408
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:45,600
[LELEI] Next time on "GATE":

409
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,633
Ride of the Battle Goddess.
