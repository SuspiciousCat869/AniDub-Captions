1
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:04,500
Lelei:
Yoji Itami. Age 33.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,066
He and all around him agree,
he's a hopeless fanboy.

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:09,366
This is his story:

4
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:12,833
My hobby is the most important
thing I have in my life.

5
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:16,633
So know this, if gonna ask me
to make some sorta choice,

6
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,033
the answer is the same.

7
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:21,333
Itami:
My otaku life always
comes first.

8
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:25,166
Good to see
you back, sir!

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,500
So. Everybody
alright back there?

10
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:29,163
Yeah!

11
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,096
Itami:
Hey‐hey! Good
to see ya Chief.

12
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:33,396
Again, we are saved
by the men in green.

13
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:34,596
We are very grateful.

14
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:35,196
(laughs)

15
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:38,129
It's just part of
the job description

16
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:39,863
Oh!

17
00:00:39,963 --> 00:00:41,463
It's been
a while, sir

18
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:43,529
I just made contact
with Alnus.

19
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:45,229
They said they would
be able to accept all

20
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,663
the people you picked
up along the way.

21
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,263
I appreciate the help.

22
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:49,929
S'not important.

23
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,229
Now, we need to move on
and discuss the purpose

24
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,463
of your visit.

25
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:54,963
As I'm sure
you're well aware...

26
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:57,996
we have just conducted a
large‐scale rescue mission.

27
00:00:58,096 --> 00:00:59,229
So it will be
very difficult

28
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,296
to get support for
another mission publicly.

29
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,763
That's not a problem. This is
a personal request of Grey's.

30
00:01:04,863 --> 00:01:09,063
He's Pin's subordinate.
And I've accepted the task, sir.

31
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:10,963
Looks like you've
already made up your mind

32
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:13,096
with or without our
help haven't ya.

33
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:14,463
Come in!

34
00:01:14,563 --> 00:01:14,663
Huh?

35
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:15,696
Reporting!

36
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:17,096
Uh...
ah! Uh...

37
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:18,163
Reporting!

38
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:18,629
Reporting!

39
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:19,929
Reporting!

40
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,296
It's good to see
you back... soldier!

41
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:23,896
What the heck's
going on?!

42
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:24,329
Aw!

43
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:25,496
You didn't think
you were going

44
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:26,863
on this mission
without us did ya?

45
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:30,163
I'm a little hurt
I didn't get a call

46
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:32,029
when you were about
to get into a fight. ,/
Remember, I'm always
here to help.

47
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,196
Just let me know
what I can do okay?

48
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:36,463
We're here to assist
wherever you need us

49
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,429
You know you can
always count on us, sir.

50
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:40,296
Aw.. you guys're
the best!

51
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:41,196
Let's do this!

52
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:42,329
Ah...

53
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:46,029
Alright. So here's
what we're gonna do.

54
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:48,029
We need Rory and Lelei
in the Palace.

55
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,696
I will disguise
myself as a footman

56
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,396
and walk them through
the front gate.

57
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:55,163
Kurata and Kuribayashi follow
Tuka, and infiltrate the rear.

58
00:01:55,263 --> 00:01:57,896
Tuka, I want you to
use your slumber magic.

59
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:00,563
Tomita, you and the old man
will cover our escape.

60
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,163
No problem, chief

61
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:04,763
Kurokawa and Yao
will try to find the Emperor.

62
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:06,696
I'm sure he will need
some medical attention.

63
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:08,696
Got it, how are we
supposed to get inside?

64
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,896
Heh. You are going to be
hiding inside the wagon

65
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:12,863
that I will be pulling.

66
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:15,029
Once inside, we'll
split into groups.

67
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:17,596
One for the Princess,
and one for the Emperor.

68
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:19,696
Once they're safe we're
gonna meet with Kurata,

69
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:21,996
and then we'll all drive
like hell outta there.

70
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:23,763
And to cover the guards
at the palace exit...

71
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:25,163
we'll have Tomita
and the old man.

72
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:28,196
We should probably
take an LAV for this.

73
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:29,496
Yes, it has an M2.

74
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:31,163
I can handle the
hand‐to‐hand combat!

75
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:35,229
Heh. Well, the
main objective will be
to rescue the prisoners, but...

76
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,696
If that dumbass prince
does something stupid again,

77
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:38,896
have at it.

78
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:40,196
(growls)

79
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:41,163
Yes, sir!

80
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:43,596
But, Sir. Why would
they let you in?

81
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,096
Even with Rory and Lelei
accompanying you.

82
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:49,529
I'm sure they must be watching
out for the JSDF presence.

83
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:50,729
Oh they won't...

84
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,096
I won't be going in
as a man in uniform.

85
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:54,796
Itami:
They won't even see us comin'.

86
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:56,663
It'll be a walk in the park.

87
00:02:56,763 --> 00:03:01,463
Itami:
(struggling)

88
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:03,296
(engine revving)

89
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:07,129
I never said...
that I would push this thing...

90
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,896
all the way by myself!

91
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:11,063
Man... you guys are worthless!

92
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:13,363
My grandmother could
push harder than this.

93
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:15,729
And she's been dead
for thousands of years.

94
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,863
I thought this thing was
supposed to feel lighter

95
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:18,963
with the
engine running?

96
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:20,496
Well we can't
move too fast,

97
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:22,063
or it end up
looking suspicious.

98
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,129
You don't have
to worry about that!

99
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:25,396
Uh hey there, skinny.

100
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,196
That looks like
a pretty heavy load.

101
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:27,529
Where you headed?

102
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,196
We have been summoned by the
Prince to the Imperial Palace.

103
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:33,729
Villager:
So you carrying some
precious cargo or something?

104
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,296
That's gotta be
some rough work.

105
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:36,429
Itami:
You have no idea...

106
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:37,463
(giggles)

107
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:38,663
State your
business.

108
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:40,496
Guard 1:
The Palace is
under strict guard.

109
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,296
Guard 2:
We cannot allow anyone
through without permission.

110
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:46,929
I am Lelei la Lalena‐
I'm from the Coda Village.

111
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:49,063
The Prince has requested
our presence here.

112
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:50,296
Please tell him
we've arrived.

113
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,629
We've been told he
would like to speak to us

114
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,363
about defeating
the flame dragon.

115
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:56,129
Oh, so you're
the ones?!

116
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:57,929
Please... Please
excuse us, my ladies!

117
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,329
Here's our
invitation.

118
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,896
Right!
Right!

119
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:01,329
Guard 1:
Hey, footman!

120
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:02,163
Don't be an idiot.

121
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:04,196
You can't leave your wagon
blocking the gate!

122
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:05,363
Bring it inside!

123
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:07,129
Yes, sir! But I...

124
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,496
Come on in, please!
Right this way!

125
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:10,329
Make yourself
at home.

126
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:11,296
Rory:
Thank you,
darling.

127
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:13,296
Hey! You guys?!

128
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:13,963
(groans)

129
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:17,436
Do I still have to drag this
by myself? Who's plan was this?

130
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:20,563
Hang in there.
You got this, chief.

131
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:29,307
Ahh! Ahh!

132
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:30,273
Ah!

133
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:36,407
What do you
want from me?

134
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:40,040
I think you already
know that, Princess.

135
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,373
The Order of the Rose
were only following the orders

136
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:44,207
given by the
Emperor himself.

137
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:46,607
So are you saying that allowing
the enemy to get inside

138
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:49,640
the Imperial Capital
was the Emperor's idea?

139
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,207
Huh?

140
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:52,940
Helm:
Are you feigning
ignorance?

141
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,840
(hysterical laughter)

142
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,273
What's so funny?
Your knights helped the enemy
infiltrate our lands.

143
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:03,407
You created the
situation we're in!

144
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:06,807
If that isn't treason,
then what is?!

145
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,207
Tell me, if they're
not guilty,

146
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,740
then why would they
flee the Capital?!

147
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,640
Helm:
They're running away because
they have something to hide!

148
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,440
(laughs)

149
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,007
Do I really need to
spell it out for you?

150
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,140
It's because they know
that if they stay,

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,040
they'll be treated
like this.

152
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,907
If you run away, you're a
traitor.

153
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:24,907
If you don't, then you're just
a traitor who's up to something.

154
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:27,707
You're arrogance
won't change anything!

155
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:31,507
You have given us
up before we've even
gotten started, Princess.

156
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:34,340
Prince Zorzal.
What do we do with her?

157
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:46,940
Rory:
They look so peaceful.
Almost... dead.

158
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,007
Lelei:
Every guard in the hallway
should be out for awhile. ,/
This is Itami.
We're inside.

159
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:50,840
Itami:
How's it going
over there? Over.

160
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,407
This is Kuribayashi.
We have made it into the Palace.

161
00:05:54,507 --> 00:05:56,773
Shino:
Tuka put the guards
to sleep. Over.

162
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:59,107
(chuckles)
Hello...

163
00:05:59,207 --> 00:05:59,507
Who are you?!

164
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,307
I do apologize for just
showing up like this.

165
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:04,940
I am a dark elf
from Lordom Valley.

166
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,873
I have a bit of business
with the Emperor.

167
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:09,640
Hold it, how'd you
get in here?

168
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,140
Don't come any closer
or I will use force, lady.

169
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,807
(chuckles)
Oh... is that so?

170
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:17,605
Mari:
Freeze.

171
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:17,973
Ha!

172
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:21,040
I'm sure you realize what
happens if I pull this trigger.

173
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,573
I guarantee you
it's not pretty.

174
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,473
Drop your weapons
if you want to stay alive.

175
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:29,240
Very good.

176
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:32,473
What am I do with you?

177
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:35,106
I have complete faith that you
would never even think about

178
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:36,740
abandoning the Empire.

179
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,373
But it is a fact that the Order
of the Rose assisted the enemy.

180
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:42,506
I know nothing of that!

181
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:45,406
That's enough. ,/
That's not even what
I care about anymore.

182
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,740
My priorities have
recently changed.

183
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,506
What I want now is
to defeat our enemies!

184
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:52,473
And be an
all‐powerful ruler!

185
00:06:52,573 --> 00:06:54,373
If they wish to proceed
with the peace talks,

186
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:56,206
they will have
to come here.

187
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:57,406
Zorzal:
So don't worry.

188
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:59,840
Until then, I will
need you alive.

189
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,473
And by the time they arrive
we will have regrouped...

190
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:04,873
and prepared ourselves
a counterattack for them!

191
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,706
We've been taming a giant ogre
just for the occasion!

192
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:10,673
They can attack us whenever
they please. Bring it on!

193
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:11,073
Rory:
Oh really?

194
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:12,740
Oh!
Rory:
Oh really?

195
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,640
(gasps)

196
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:19,906
Rory:
(giggles)

197
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,306
Hmm...

198
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,306
(horrified scream)

199
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:28,206
It's been a long time,
Crown Prince Zorzal.

200
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:29,040
(gasps)

201
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,840
Itami, you're here!

202
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:37,906
Princess Pina. We are here
to rescue you.

203
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,140
Oh! Stay Away! ,/
You there! What are
you guards doing?!

204
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,340
Do not let them
come anywhere near me!

205
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,073
Your elite
soldiers outside

206
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:50,873
decided to take a
little nappy poo.

207
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:54,340
Right now, the only people who
can protect you are right here.

208
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,506
Rory the Reaper...

209
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:57,906
is ready to accept whichever
one of you is up for it.

210
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:00,106
(excited giggles)

211
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:01,440
Hey.

212
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:04,440
You have some
wise soldiers.

213
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,840
(growls)
You are going to die!
Ogaaaare! Get in here!

214
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,840
Come and tear
these bastards apart!

215
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,073
(monsterous breathing)

216
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:16,140
Huh?

217
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,273
Huh?!

218
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:17,373
Ah!
Huh?!

219
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:19,206
Zorzal you've lost
your mind!

220
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:20,973
I no longer
have a choice.

221
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:22,906
Zorzal:
Kill them!

222
00:08:23,873 --> 00:08:27,340
(thunderous roar)

223
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,506
(roaring continues)

224
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:41,806
(pained roar)

225
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,906
(excited giggle)

226
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:47,373
(ecstatic moan)

227
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:50,573
The bigger the foe
the better it feels!

228
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:52,173
(angered roar)

229
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:54,173
(maniacal laughter)

230
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:55,406
Grr... ah!

231
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:56,906
(pained roar)
(ecstatic moan)

232
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:57,840
(pained roar)
Mmm...

233
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,440
(pained roar)

234
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,340
(agonized roar)
(giggles)

235
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,740
(agonized roaring continues)

236
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:15,540
Looks like it's
almost time.

237
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,173
Your Highness,
We'll be leaving now.

238
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:19,006
Guh!

239
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,006
Um one more thing.

240
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:21,440
Our objective for today,

241
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,173
involves making sure
you and your men

242
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:25,240
never go after
Lelei again.

243
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,806
Oh and to rescue
the royal princess.

244
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:32,806
Come on. Time to go.

245
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,506
Itami, I...

246
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:38,840
Heh. Remember we're the
self defense force that cares.

247
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,440
The good guys.

248
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:46,106
Hold it! It's not over
between you and me!

249
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:46,940
Let's go! Just the two of us,
I'll take you all by myself. ,/
Wha‐

250
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,173
No matter where you are,

251
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,206
you'll always be
within our sights.

252
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:54,940
You step out of line
and we will drop you.

253
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,640
Itami:
I'll say it again.
You will stop going after Lelei.

254
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,773
And you'll give
us Princess Pina.

255
00:10:01,873 --> 00:10:05,306
Otherwise, next time,
a bullet is going right
through your skull.

256
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,940
Do you understand what
I'm telling you?

257
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,740
Uh...

258
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,973
Alright... let's go.

259
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,985
Hey Chief!
You need a ride?!

260
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:32,385
Right on time!

261
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:36,018
Uh Rory... You don't
have to sit on my lap!

262
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:37,585
Plenty of room
in the back!

263
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:38,485
Oh. What?

264
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:41,218
But we'll be picking up some
other people too, right?

265
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:42,585
I don't like
being crowded.

266
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,785
Oh come on! I see nothing
has changed has it?!

267
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:47,285
I am not enjoying this!

268
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:49,685
Now. What's the status
of the others?

269
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:50,485
Okay so...

270
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:53,252
Kuribayashi's already
engaged in a firefight.

271
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,018
There aren't really
all that many of them,

272
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:57,785
but Tuka's magic
won't last much longer.

273
00:10:57,885 --> 00:11:01,552
Kurata:
And as for Kurokawa...

274
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:03,685
This is Kurokawa.
We have the Emperor with us. ,/
His vitals
are looking good!

275
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:04,818
Roger that!

276
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:06,285
(battle cries)

277
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:07,152
Get out of the way!

278
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,218
(battle cries)

279
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,552
Move it you dummies! ,/
Getting hit by a
car really hurts!

280
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:16,218
Ahhh!

281
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:21,818
Tuka, Kuribayashi!
Get in the back!

282
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:22,352
Kurata!

283
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:24,352
Kurata:
Moving out!

284
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:27,552
Itami:
Kurokawa. We just collected
Tuka and Kuribayashi.

285
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:28,918
We're on our way
to get you.

286
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:30,818
Mari:
Roger that.

287
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:33,718
When they get here, we'll be
able to move the Emperor.

288
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,952
I understand!

289
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:36,252
It's my
greatest honor...

290
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:38,952
to protect Princess Pina
and Emperor Molto.

291
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:41,218
If necessary,
I will gladly be the bait!

292
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:43,118
There won't be
any need for that.

293
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:45,785
You can trust we will
take care of them.

294
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:48,252
Great! Everyone's here!

295
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:50,085
Hang on this is
gonna be close!

296
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:51,585
(nervous groan)

297
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:53,218
All:
(scream)

298
00:11:54,052 --> 00:11:56,352
(screaming continues)

299
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,452
Kurata:
Aagh! We're not gonna make it!

300
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,452
Ahh!

301
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:05,452
Grr... what WAS that?!

302
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:09,218
Gotta clear passage
for you, Chief!

303
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:12,518
(panicked panting)

304
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:14,118
Don't shoot on the city streets.

305
00:12:14,218 --> 00:12:16,985
We don't want any of the stray
rounds to hit the civilians!

306
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:19,752
Tomita:
If we can get through the castle
gate, then we can stop them.

307
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,918
Kuwabara:
Well... then we better make it.

308
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:22,885
You hear that?!

309
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:23,818
Yes, sir!

310
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:24,318
Hooah!

311
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:26,252
Sweeper:
Don't let them through!

312
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:30,185
Dammit! They're
moving too fast!

313
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,152
Tomita:
We're at the west gate!

314
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,352
Keep advancing.

315
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:35,785
Itami:
Copy!

316
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:38,185
(battle cries)

317
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:39,918
These guys don't ever give up!

318
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,485
Special Forces:
Ready to fire.

319
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:45,285
Archer:
Fire!

320
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:48,318
(soldiers screaming)

321
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:54,852
(struggling)

322
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:56,652
That took care of 'em!

323
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:57,385
Yeah we did it!

324
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,018
I love it when a
plan comes together!

325
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:01,552
(relieved sigh)

326
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:02,885
Princess Pina.

327
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:04,385
Hi, Hamilton.

328
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:07,585
I'm so glad you're safe.
Your Highness...

329
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:09,985
If anything awful would have
happened to you,

330
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:12,118
I would have just died!

331
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:14,352
I'm sorry if
I frightened you.

332
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:18,285
Pina:
Oh father...

333
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:19,585
I appreciate this.

334
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:22,518
I can't thank you enough
for rescuing the Emperor.

335
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:25,252
I take it ‐ he was
the top priority.

336
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:28,018
I guess it's blind luck
you found me as well.

337
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:29,185
Not at all.

338
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:30,818
My primary objective
of this mission

339
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:34,185
was to get you out and
someplace safe, Princess Pina.

340
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:36,418
After that, if we were able
to find the Emperor,

341
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:37,585
then we were
to extract him.

342
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:39,385
Saving the Emperor
was secondary?!

343
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,285
Itami:
Yes. That came as a
direct order from my boss.

344
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:45,318
That if we're going in
to save the princess,

345
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:47,985
then we would need to rescue
the Emperor, as well.

346
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:49,385
What's the
ulterior motive?

347
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:51,152
We need to be seen
as an alliance.

348
00:13:51,252 --> 00:13:54,052
If you are joined by
the Emperor and the
pro‐peace representatives...

349
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:58,352
Then we can show that there is
only one traitor within
the Imperial regime.

350
00:13:58,452 --> 00:13:58,985
Your Majesty!

351
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:00,018
Father!
Your Majesty!

352
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:01,952
Are you all right...
Your Highness?

353
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:05,185
Yes. Despite the
exceedingly bumpy ride.

354
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:08,052
I do believe that
I'm doing rather well.

355
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:09,452
I'm glad you're OK.

356
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:13,885
And the Senate representatives
have all been successfully
evacuated to Italica.

357
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:17,552
Itami:
At our current speed,
we should get there tomorrow.

358
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:20,352
On horseback that always
took us several days,

359
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:23,252
but with this contraption
our world has gotten smaller.

360
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:24,652
Truly incredible.

361
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:25,185
Father!

362
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:28,418
Zorzal is trying to create mass
confusion within the country.

363
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:31,818
Stop him! Please speak with him
and make him listen to reason.

364
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,352
There's no point in my
going back to the capital.

365
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:39,318
Your brother won't even
pretend to listen to what
I have to say anymore anyway.

366
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:43,285
No, I think it's best if we go
along with Japan's plot.

367
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:45,118
What plot?

368
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,418
Civil war is
now inevitable.

369
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:51,818
Pina... I'm making you the
Crown Princess of the Empire.

370
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:53,818
What? You want me?

371
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:54,718
Yes, my dear.

372
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:57,918
I want you to be
the voice to establish
a legitimate government,

373
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:00,585
And to lead the opposition
against your brother.

374
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:03,152
No, father! I cannot
go against him!

375
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:04,352
It will be up to you.

376
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:07,452
The choice will be yours
to do what you think is best.

377
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:09,352
Molto:
You can seek to
make peace with him,

378
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:12,452
or you can divide the
Empire in two.

379
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:18,852
The time is now. You are
the one to decide our future.

380
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:37,452
Tell me... where are we
planning to go, Your Highness?

381
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:40,618
To the Northeast for now.
We'll figure out the rest later.

382
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:44,085
But, sir. If we leave
the Imperial Capital,

383
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:46,052
We will lose control
of the country.

384
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:46,818
(growls)

385
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:47,852
Shut your mouth!

386
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:48,618
(gunshot)

387
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:49,918
Oh!

388
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:51,252
(whimpers)

389
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:57,318
It's Furuta here.

390
00:15:57,418 --> 00:16:01,252
Prince Zorzal is escaping
with the nobles and the
pro‐war representatives.

391
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:04,285
He's leaving the capital.
I'm not sure where yet.

392
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:06,618
Following them will be too risky
so hang tight for now.

393
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:09,385
I'm going to keep
my distance. Over 'n out.

394
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:11,785
What she up to?

395
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:14,718
Thule:
I endured the life
of a prisoner

396
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:18,618
to take revenge for my
country that they destroyed.

397
00:16:19,618 --> 00:16:22,485
No matter what
the cost may be.

398
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:25,518
I vowed the Empire be
obliterated.

399
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:29,585
That was my only wish,
and I have finally achieved it.

400
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:32,852
But.. why?

401
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:37,818
Why is it that
I can't stop crying?

402
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,418
Godammitah...

403
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:42,752
This cannot be
happening to me...

404
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:43,585
(gunshot)

405
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:44,385
(cowers)

406
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:48,985
I swear to you...
I will have my revenge!

407
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:53,252
Lelei:
Ten days later, a grand
ceremony was held in Italica.

408
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:55,818
Princess Pina was named
the Crown Princess,

409
00:16:55,918 --> 00:17:00,352
and a new, legitimate
government of the Empire
was officially founded.

410
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:41,018
My dearest daughter Pina,
From this day forward...,
I do hereby...

411
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:44,085
entrust the Empire's
government to you.

412
00:17:44,185 --> 00:17:46,452
The realm is yours to rule.

413
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:50,718
Take good care...
of our country.

414
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:53,018
Your time is now... Pina.

415
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:54,685
(fighting tears)

416
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:58,985
My heart and soul...
are true to the Empire.

417
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:03,252
And I swear... I will lead
this country to prosperity,

418
00:18:03,352 --> 00:18:05,452
in peace with Japan!

419
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,018
This is so great!

420
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:24,685
I was hoping
for a happy ending!

421
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:28,018
Are you actually crying?
Not cool dude!

422
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:30,852
Huh? Whatever, this is
the greatest day ever!

423
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:31,885
(sobbing)

424
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,518
Hey, baby...
Are you ok?

425
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:34,718
Yeah.
Well, what is this?

426
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:35,552
Well, what is this?

427
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:36,385
Oh!

428
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:37,452
(chuckles)

429
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,352
We've been seeing
each other...

430
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:43,318
We're kinduv a thing now ‐
Ever since I was sent back
to Japan awhile back.

431
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:47,218
I couldn't say anything before,
but we're expecting a baby...

432
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:50,385
And... we've recently gotten to
know each other as well.

433
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:53,185
We kinda overcame uh...
the language barrier.

434
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:56,018
You got hurt because of
my personal vendetta.

435
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:57,385
Yes, I did.

436
00:18:57,485 --> 00:19:00,218
You better take care of me...
until I get better.

437
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:01,085
I think I can do that.

438
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:04,918
The love between Sugawara
and I... will last forever!

439
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,518
Yeah, uh... And it will
all be totally legal I swear!

440
00:19:07,618 --> 00:19:10,218
What?! When did
all this happen?!

441
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:11,185
This is
not fair!

442
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:14,485
Hey! Why does everybody suddenly
have a sweetheart except me?!

443
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:17,118
Because you're easily fooled
and a little bit nuts.

444
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:19,552
That wasn't niiiice...

445
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:20,385
Oh... Wait!

446
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:23,052
I just realized the chief
isn't here to celebrate.

447
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:24,718
Where... is he?

448
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:25,485
Yeah he's not here.

449
00:19:25,585 --> 00:19:26,518
Uh... No shit.

450
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:27,585
Okay soo...

451
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:31,318
You know how he feels
about all his otaku
hobbies and everything?

452
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:33,918
Well he sorta
had somewhere to be.

453
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:40,818
Yeaaaahhhh... I'm back, BABY!

454
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:44,252
It's been too long.
Can't believe it's been a year!

455
00:19:44,352 --> 00:19:48,885
Finally the event
I've been dreaming about!

456
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:50,818
OHHHH! I love you!
(kisses the cover) ,/
Sorry, Princess Pina!

457
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:53,752
I just... I just could
nots let an opportunity

458
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:54,918
like this pass me by!

459
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:59,852
Event Staff:
The doujinshi exhibition
and sales is cancelled!
Itami:

460
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:04,585
Hoo‐hoo‐haa‐haah!
I'm finally here!

461
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:06,552
And if we don't put
an end to it right now...

462
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:09,318
THEY'LL SHUT DOWN
THE COMIC'S CONVENTION!

463
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,818
Man, I things have been
a little bit crazy lately.

464
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,718
But I'll just leave
that in the past.

465
00:20:13,818 --> 00:20:17,852
Because what's really
important... is the future!

466
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:19,885
Guh! Ahhh!

467
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:24,452
That hurt...!
Why are you guys here?!

468
00:20:24,552 --> 00:20:27,485
It's not very fair if you're
the only one having fun, Daddy.

469
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:30,452
Itami, will you please
take me to the bookstore?

470
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:31,352
How did you get here?!

471
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:35,752
We asked the delightfully
mustachioed Hazama for
permission to visit.

472
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:39,185
But only under the strict
condition, that you would
take care of us.

473
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,718
Uh What?! Why does
he hate me?

474
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:45,118
Look here. I'm sorry but
I have some important business.

475
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:46,985
Please, just go
back to Alnus.

476
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:48,285
(crowd chattering)

477
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:49,952
Male Bystander 1:
Is that who
I think it is...?!

478
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:50,852
Male Bystander 2:
Oh my gosh!

479
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:51,952
Hey Rory!

480
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:52,985
They're really real!

481
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,518
Hey!

482
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:55,052
Hey there!

483
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,285
Wow, that's really Rory!

484
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:58,252
Gotta get her autograph!

485
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:02,185
(crowd intensifies)

486
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:05,252
Hey look over here!
Lemmie get a picture!

487
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:07,185
There are so many
people here!

488
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:08,818
And the crowd is growing.

489
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:09,852
Of course it is,

490
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:13,152
I'm sure we'll get lots of
attention everywhere we go.

491
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:16,518
Oh God... This is going
from bad to worse...

492
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:18,418
Hey! You there!
What's going on?!

493
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:21,252
Wait! This is
just uh... I swear!

494
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:23,618
Whatever it is, you're gonna
have to come with me!

495
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:24,218
Huh?

496
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:25,452
Don't worry, son.

497
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,152
Uh... I'll take
ya someplace safe, 'kay?

498
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:29,752
Uh yeah, no thanks.

499
00:21:29,852 --> 00:21:33,252
Officer:
Just get in the car.
You're gonna be fine.

500
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:34,685
Is this Hell...?

501
00:21:34,785 --> 00:21:39,018
When I, feel low!
One place to‐

502
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:40,018
AAAAAAHHHH!

503
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:40,652
Eh...?

504
00:21:40,752 --> 00:21:43,518
(panicked whimpers)

505
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:47,685
Is that you?! What in the
world are you doing in there?

506
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:50,785
Itami:
(sobbing)

507
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:55,352
I just... all I wanted to do was
buy some doujinshi comics!

508
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:58,485
Itami:
(sobbing)
WHY!

509
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,485
Lelei:
This is the story
of two worlds...

510
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:04,085
mysteriously connected
to one another.

511
00:22:04,185 --> 00:22:07,418
And the path that brought
those two worlds together.

512
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:09,752
A path that
was to be know as...

513
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:11,518
All:
The Gate.
