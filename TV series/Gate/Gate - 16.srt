1
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:02,566
[LELEI] Japan's Self Defense
Force

2
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:05,000
was dispatched to the
mysterious Special Region.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,433
Where peace talks were
interrupted by an earthquake.

4
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:12,566
Itami and his team rescue
Noriko, a Japanese girl enslaved
by Prince Zorzal.

5
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,566
[LELEI] Now, Itami, hoping to
save Tuka's sanity,

6
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:21,200
embarks on a quest to slay the
flame dragon that killed her
father.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,233
[DELILAH] la‐la‐la‐la‐la! Out in
the city I roam.

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,200
Alnus is my favorite place!

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,300
Everything is so easy!

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,366
And the food is so tasteee!

11
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:35,300
The sun up in the sky... it's
shining down on me.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,166
Come and feel the glow of Alnus

13
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:43,066
It's the place to be!

14
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,400
[DELILAH] Thank you!
[CROWD] Wow! [CROWD] Bravo!

15
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:48,766
<happy giggle>

16
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,166
<notice>

17
00:00:57,866 --> 00:00:59,766
[DELILAH] From Italica?

18
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,366
What? Japanese?

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,700
Why would she order such a
thing?

20
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,833
<exhausted sigh>

21
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:51,600
Here I sit, the great queen
of the proud Voglia bunnies

22
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,066
How long must I suffer at the
hands of that monster?

23
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,200
[BOULO] <lascivious laughing>

24
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,566
I am here for you,
as always, Thule

25
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,766
[THULE] How did it go?

26
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,700
[BOULO] Letter was delivered

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,566
[THULE] Good. You can go.

28
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,166
[BOULO] As you wish.

29
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,100
<evil laugh>

30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,800
[THULE] Now the Folmar's spy
embedded in Alnus will be
killing Noriko for us.

31
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,166
And the traitorous voglia, who's
after my life, will be none the
wiser.

32
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,133
If I make it look like Pina
ordered it,

33
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,233
then the relationship between
Japan and the Empire

34
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,766
will fall apart, and war will be
inevitable.

35
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:32,366
[THULE] And Prince Zorzal, the
prick who destroyed my tribe,

36
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:35,200
Will go down in agony, along
with this God‐forsaken Empire.

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,166
[DELILAH] Gods and apostles
that protect us from on high.

38
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:46,333
I dedicate this prayer and
sacrifice all I have to you.

39
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:50,200
I give myself to the flames of
your will.

40
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,600
Emroy, God of War, Hardy, God of
Hades,

41
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,933
Deldote, God of Pact, Palapan,
God of Vengeance.

42
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:04,000
My body is your sword of
retribution, that will take the
life of my enemy.

43
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,333
Until I have my revenge on Queen
Thule,

44
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:09,600
who threw away her pride as a
voglia and betrayed us all,

45
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,633
[DELILAH] I shall not die!

46
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,166
[HIGAKI] So, let me get this
straight,

47
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:16,333
First Lieutenant Itami received
intel

48
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,600
about an underground
natural resource.

49
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,000
[HIGAKI] leaving Sergeant Major
Kuwabara in charge

50
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,066
while he went alone to
investigate.

51
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,700
Is that what you're telling me?

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,500
[YANAGIDA] Yes Sir... The
Ministry is anxious for

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,733
information on any strategy
resources.

54
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,266
[YANAGIDA] Considering the
situations surrounding us,

55
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:35,666
we must find as many locations
as we can before things get
worse.

56
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:37,900
[HIGAKI] I heard there are
dragons in that area.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,100
[YANAGIDA] I'm quite sure he's
aware of that.

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,533
[HIGAKI] Then why would he
choose to go in all by himself?

59
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,533
[YANAGIDA] Because he's an
idiot, sir.

60
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,766
<groan>

61
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,200
[YANAGIDA] Well... That's... all
the groundwork...

62
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,333
I just need the approval from
the lieutenant general.

63
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,066
[YANAGIDA] <nervous>

64
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,066
[HAZAMA] Uh...what in the holy
hell is Itami thinking?

65
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,166
[YANAGIDA] Sir...The letter
5‐304 from the Ministry.

66
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:14,766
Entitled "Strategy Resources in
the Special Region"

67
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,766
is what caused Itami to take
action!

68
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,233
[HAZAMA] Yes yes but... that's
just his official purpose.

69
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:23,633
[YANAGIDA] Official or not,
First Lieutenant Itami
went to search for resources!

70
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,466
[HAZAMA] Hmm... I see.

71
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,566
Well gentlemen, it seems we have
a dumbass among us.

72
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,533
But we can't just watch him die
can we.

73
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:42,766
[KURIHAMA] No matter what kind
of soldier he is... he's still
one of us, after all.

74
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,933
[HAZAMA] You're damn right
soldier. He's our dumbass!

75
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,933
Colonel Kamo!
[KAMO] Sir!

76
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,200
[HAZAMA] Put the 1st Combat Team
on standby.

77
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,233
Wait for the Air Self‐Defense
Force's contact.

78
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,600
And support based on their
intel.

79
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,233
We need to back up their search
for resources.

80
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,900
Lieutenant Colonel!
[KAMIKODA] Sir!

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,700
[HAZAMA] I am requesting
air reconnaissance.

82
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,533
You're on C. A. P. Prepare to
encounter a Special Region
Class‐A Vermin.

83
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:05,233
That is all.

84
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,066
[SOLDIERS] Understood!

85
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,100
[SOLDIERS] Let's go, Kurihama.
Alright let's do this.

86
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
[KURIHAMA] Let's get to it

87
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,466
[YANAGIDA] How can they just...
prepare a strike so easily?

88
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:16,600
[HAZAMA] You don't happen to
speak the special region's
language, do you?

89
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,533
I have someone that I would like
you to meet.

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,766
After you close your mouth, of
course.

91
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:24,966
<OM ‐ gasping>

92
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:25,766
<knock knock>

93
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:27,000
[DURAN] Enter.

94
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,566
[YANAGIDA] Good evening, Sir.

95
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,766
<eating noises>

96
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:36,000
[DURAN] I've been waiting for
you to come and see me.

97
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,133
[DURAN] I'm Duran, King of the
State of Elbe.

98
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,166
[YANAGIDA] It's nice to meet
you.

99
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:45,900
[DURAN] In my country, a dauphin
is supposed

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,800
to administer the government.

101
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,366
[DURAN] I bet they're relieved
I'm out of the picture.

102
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:52,300
If you would...

103
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,133
Could I trouble you
to send these

104
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,666
to Duke Clemson and Count Watt.

105
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:59,833
[DURAN] In order to get the Elbe
back in my hands,

106
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,300
[DURAN] I need them to bring
together

107
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,433
the powerful nobles throughout
the area.

108
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,700
[YANAGIDA] We want no part of
your family feud.

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,466
[YANAGIDA] You can ask that kind
of favor of the Empire.

110
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:13,066
[DURAN] Hmph... I'm done with
the Empire.

111
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,966
<conniving smirk>

112
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:17,200
[YANAGIDA] So if we were to help
you with this,

113
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,766
what do you have to offer us in
return?

114
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,433
[DURAN] If you were to back
me...

115
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,933
You may cross our borders in
order to fight the flame dragon.

116
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,266
[DURAN] How's that sound?

117
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:28,933
<smug react> I'm pretty sure we
wouldn't have

118
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,933
any trouble getting permission
from the Prince.

119
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:34,700
If we sent your head pickled in
a jar.

120
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,633
[DURAN] How delightful of you.

121
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:41,033
[DURAN] I've heard rumors of one
of your men willing to fight the
flame dragon...

122
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,433
So what is it you want?

123
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,266
[YANAGIDA] Underground mining
rights, and tax exemptions.

124
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,133
[DURAN] Gold and copper are the
sources of our nation's wealth.

125
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,666
[DURAN] Can't give you those.

126
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:52,900
[YANAGIDA] Then everything
except for the gold and copper.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,100
[DURAN] Wait a minute! Are you
saying that there are other
valuables buried there?

128
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,733
[YANAGIDA] F'you don't know,
it's like they never existed.

129
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:03,066
Or should I go ahead and start
preparing the salt brine?

130
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,533
[DURAN] Uhhh... Hmph! Fine have
it your way then.

131
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:10,500
All underground resources
save for those used as currency.

132
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,666
[DURAN] Will that do?

133
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:15,000
[YANAGIDA] And don't forget the
tax exemption.

134
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,966
[DURAN] You are a canny man.

135
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:20,933
[YANAGIDA] Thank you. The JSDF
will provide protection for your
safe return.

136
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,433
It's on the way to the flame
dragon. So it'll be no
inconvenience.

137
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:29,600
[DURAN] Hm.. In that case, I
hereby give you permission to
cross our borders.

138
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,333
I am pleased we were able to
reach an agreement.

139
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:36,133
[YANAGIDA] Hm. Well as long as
you can keep up your end of the
bargain,

140
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:40,233
Japan will uphold a friendly
diplomatic relationship.

141
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,800
<sigh>

142
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,033
[YANAGIDA] Damn it!
This is not at all turning out
the way I had planned.

143
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,833
Lieutenant Hazama and Lord Duran

144
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,233
are both working to help Itami,

145
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,666
[YANAGIDA] And now so am I...

146
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,000
[YANAGIDA] That lazy slack!

147
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,233
I hope it rains on his stupid
girl parade!

148
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,300
[ITAMI] It's really coming down.

149
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,966
[RORY] I guess that's a problem
isn't it?

150
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,866
[YAO] The ground is unstable
enough already.

151
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,566
We should probably get out of
this area

152
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,200
before it gets any worse.

153
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
[ITAMI] I think you're right.

154
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,200
[SOCIAL WORKER] I am very sorry.

155
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,533
We've been looking for your
family since Ginza.

156
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:30,633
[SOCIAL WORKER] We assume that
they were also

157
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:33,500
victims of the tragedy that
befell us that day.

158
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,133
[NORIKO] <surprised> Mom, are
you there?

159
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,566
[PHONE] The number
you have dialed

160
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,900
has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,666
Please check the number and...

162
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,400
[NORIKO] Dad... Mom...

163
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,466
Hiroki...

164
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:52,400
[NORIKO] <breath>

165
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,433
Maybe it's time for me to die as
well.

166
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:58,466
[DELILAH] Really.

167
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,133
[NORIKO] Who're you?

168
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,100
[DELILAH] I would feel sorrow

169
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,300
ending someone's life who wishes
to keep it,

170
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,100
[DELILAH] but if that is truly
your desire,

171
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,833
then I shall be doing you a
favor.

172
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:15,133
[NORIKO] You're going to...kill
me?

173
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:18,333
[DELILAH] Yes...you shall get
what you wish.

174
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:22,300
[NORIKO] So be it.

175
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
[DELILAH] I'm sorry. I honestly
have no choice.

176
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,733
[NORIKO] I really wouldn't like
to feel pain though.

177
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,833
[DELILAH] <react> Hmm.

178
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,266
[DELILAH] How should you like it
then?

179
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,833
I don't think I know how to do
this

180
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:37,233
without it hurting at least a
little bit.

181
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,566
[NORIKO] <giggle> You remind me
of a slave I knew.

182
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,166
Her name is Tyule.

183
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:47,133
[DELILAH] <anger‐react> What did
you just say?

184
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,466
[YANAGIDA] You!

185
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,300
Get away from her!

186
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,766
<gasp>

187
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,100
<scream>

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,866
<panting>

189
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,300
<panting>

190
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,300
[SOLDIERS] What was that? It was
outside.

191
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,333
Over there!

192
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,166
<MP whistle>

193
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:19,666
<scream>

194
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,300
[YANAGIDA] <scream>

195
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,433
[YANAGIDA] Aagh!

196
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,866
[YANAGIDA] God dammit..

197
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,033
[YANAGIDA] <pained manic
breathing>

198
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,200
[YANAGIDA] Die! You! Damn!
Bitch......

199
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,100
[YANAGIDA] Ach... ooh...

200
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,533
Dammit... aah...

201
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:00,433
[MUTY] Ahhhhh! Oh my god!

202
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,266
[MEIA] What's the matter with
you?

203
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:06,700
[MUTY] It's Delilah... She
stabbed Yanagida!

204
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:29,907
[KIKUCHI] Chef Gaston, can you
confirm that Delilah was indeed
a spy?

205
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:34,074
[GASTON] I... tried to talk her
out it, but she wouldn't listen.

206
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:36,674
[KIKUCHI] I understand. Thank
you for your time, sir.

207
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:38,907
[GASTON] Um Excuse me
[KIKUCHI] Yes?

208
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:42,307
[GASTON] I guess this means
we're going to be shut down
and banned from the village.

209
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:46,041
[KIKUCHI] Nonsense.
You have nothing to do with
this terrible incident.

210
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,574
<sigh of relief>

211
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:53,341
[KIKUCHI] What is this?
Was she in the middle of some
kind of ritual or somethin'?

212
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:54,974
[MP] Sir.
[KIKUCHI] Uh‐huh.

213
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,607
[MP] I found this. I
thought it might be important.

214
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:01,841
[KIKUCHI] The Folmar's family
crest.

215
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:06,541
<sounds of torture>

216
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,307
[KAINE] We already know that you
sold

217
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:14,941
the great family's parchment on
the black market.

218
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,141
[BARTHOLOMEW] That's not true!

219
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:18,374
I don't know anything about
that.

220
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:19,907
[YOGA] Take a close look at
this.

221
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,074
We've discovered two sets of
fingerprints on this paper.

222
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:26,407
[YOGA] The one circled in red
belongs to Delilah,

223
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:28,207
[YOGA] And the other...care to
take a guess?

224
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,641
[BARTHOLOMEW] <fear react>

225
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:34,841
[PERSONNEL] Folmar's butler...
has confessed.

226
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:37,307
[PERSONNEL] Those trying to
prevent peace talks

227
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,441
framed the Folmar family

228
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,941
and tried to kill Noriko
Mochizuki

229
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,107
[PERSONNEL] And the one who both
knows of her

230
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,374
and benefits the most would
be...

231
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:45,741
Uh..it's Prince Zorzal

232
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:48,307
It takes around 10 days to get
to the Capital.

233
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,441
They will not be aware of their
failure yet.

234
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,174
[IMAZU] So what do you suggest?

235
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:53,774
[PERSONNEL] We should inform the
Folmars

236
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,241
the assassination attempt failed
and our team is en route.

237
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:58,874
There we should be able to find
out the source of the leak.

238
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:01,674
We need to investigate the
people closest to Zorzal.

239
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,307
The 3rd Recon Unit is in the
Imperial Capital right now.

240
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:06,574
[HAZAMA] That's perfect.

241
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:08,274
I want you to send new orders to
the unit,

242
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:11,907
have them infiltrate Zorzal's
camp and start sweating him out.

243
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:14,107
Someone deceived those under our
protection.

244
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,341
They have spilled one of our
men's blood and they're going to
regret it!

245
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,007
[ALL] Yes, sir!

246
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,741
[ZORZAL] Hey!

247
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,041
[ZORZAL] So! Who in the hell

248
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:30,441
cooked this ma nuga meat?!

249
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,141
<Uneasy react>

250
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,041
[ZORZAL] It was you wasn't it?!

251
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,241
[ZORZAL] You are an artist!

252
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,941
[ZORZAL] You must be the same
chef from Pina's party the other
day huh?

253
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,207
[ZORZAL] I could never forget

254
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:50,474
how incredible that meal was.

255
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:51,874
[FURUTA] That was me.

256
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,141
[ZORZAL] Well excellent...

257
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,741
In that case I have an important
job for you my friend.

258
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:59,341
[ZORZAL] Come on by the palace
tomorrow. You got it?

259
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:04,507
<notice>

260
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,307
[FURUTA] Who's that?

261
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,707
[MAID] I don't know who she
thinks she is?

262
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:12,474
But I bet she's the prince's
favorite plaything.

263
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:14,774
[MAID] She sure seems proud of
herself.

264
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:18,707
<jet engine roar>

265
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:23,307
[KURIHAMA] Current altitude:
11,000 feet. 10 minutes to the
border.

266
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:28,274
Cruising at 280 knots. Revised
heading of 1‐9‐0.

267
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:29,074
[KURIHAMA] Turning now.

268
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:30,374
[KAMIKODA] Copy.

269
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:37,907
[KAMIKODA] It's been three days.

270
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:39,374
We should've seen it by now.

271
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:40,507
[KURIHAMA] Well when you do,

272
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,841
don't just start shooting at it.

273
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,341
The goal here is to evaluate its
capabilities.

274
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:45,607
[KAMIKODA] I know.

275
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:47,207
[KURIHAMA] That thing's one
tough mother.

276
00:15:47,307 --> 00:15:50,507
According to the report, it has
armor as strong as a tank.

277
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:53,541
[KURIHAMA] And neither the 7F
nor 20mm can penetrate it.

278
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:55,374
[KAMIKODA] We should've asked
Daddy‐o

279
00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:57,107
to let us bring an ASM or a
rocket launcher.

280
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,541
[KURIHAMA] Yeah well
the thing moves as fast
as a fighter plane.

281
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,907
There's no way we can hit it
with stuff like that.

282
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:08,207
[KAMIKODA] Ok. We got our bogie!
[KURIHAMA] Confirming target is
a dragon,

283
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:09,774
Special Region Class A vermin.

284
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:11,341
[KAMIKODA] If I shoot, I can hit
it.

285
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:13,174
[KURIHAMA] Easy.
20mm rounds won't do anything.

286
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:15,407
We don't want to show
our hand just yet.

287
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,007
[KAMIKODA] Roger.

288
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:25,007
[KAMIKODA] Uh oh. It's mad at
us!

289
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:27,307
[MIZUHARA] Look how quick it is.

290
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:29,141
That thing can turn on a dime.

291
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:30,674
[NISHIMOTO] It can bend its body
freely.

292
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:32,941
We don't want to find ourselves
in a dog fight with it.

293
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,774
[KURIHAMA] Check it out. It has
hover capabilities, too.

294
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:55,307
So it can move like a plane or a
chopper. Not bad.

295
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:56,941
[KAMIKODA] Are you finished
assessing it yet?

296
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,574
[KURIHAMA] Yeah, I think I get
the general idea.

297
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:03,541
[KAMIKODA] Good ...Then it's my
turn!

298
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:10,441
[KAMIKODA] Let's see what you
got.

299
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:13,841
[HEAD OF MAINTENANCE] Real nice
job, ladies.

300
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:15,107
Urk!

301
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,807
[HEAD OF MAINTENANCE]
Did you want it to disintegrate

302
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:18,974
in midair or what?

303
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:20,841
We don't always have these
parts in stock y'know.

304
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,607
[KAMIKODA] A flying lizard was
trying to kill me

305
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:24,107
with its fire breathing mouth.

306
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,907
[KAMIKODA] That is not a fair
man's fight if you ask me!

307
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:28,207
[HEAD OF MAINTENANCE] Oh shut
up! That big dumb monster

308
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:29,707
doesn't know what a fair man's
fight is!

309
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:32,341
[HEAD OF MAINTENANCE]
And besides it could be a girl!

310
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:35,341
[KAMIKODA] Uh yes of course,
sir.

311
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,007
[ITAMI] I think this is where we
are now.

312
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:45,207
We've passed through Tongut,
Hebrae, and Gremina.

313
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:47,307
[ITAMI] And this morning we left
Metabal,

314
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,307
so... yeah we must be at the
Telilia Plain.

315
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:50,374
[RORY] Why did you take

316
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:52,207
such a strange path to get here?

317
00:17:52,307 --> 00:17:53,374
[YAO] Yes I'm sorry.

318
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:54,774
I was following the rumors I'd
heard

319
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,641
about the movements of the green
ones.

320
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,341
[LELEI] This is the way through
the Korlo Mountains.

321
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:00,641
The road is wider, but steep.

322
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:02,941
[LELEI] And this goes by the
Gurban River.

323
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,507
It's longer, but more flat.

324
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,207
[ITAMI] Either way, the road
conditions are not great.

325
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:08,641
<restless sleeping>

326
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,841
[ITAMI] Lelei, would you help us
out?

327
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:18,874
[RORY] How much longer will the
magic work on her?

328
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:23,041
[ITAMI] Yao. The dragon has been
showing up

329
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:24,574
in the Schwartz Woods, hasn't
it?

330
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:26,907
[YAO] Mostly in the southern
region including the forest.

331
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,641
[YAO] But, if you really want to
find the flame dragon,

332
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,541
we should make our way to the
Lordom Valley.

333
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:32,941
[ITAMI] Remember our purpose

334
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,941
is for Tuka to get revenge for
her father's death.

335
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,074
[ITAMI] I'm sorry but we did not
come here to save your people.

336
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:41,507
[YAO] But there's someone there
who can tell us exactly where
the dragon lives.

337
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:44,474
[ITAMI] <hmm> Well that could
help us.

338
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:46,374
Then I guess... we should start
heading

339
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:47,907
towards the Lordom Valley.

340
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:49,607
[ITAMI] But let me make one
thing clear.

341
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,607
We're not fighting that thing in
the valley.

342
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:54,707
[ITAMI] Not interested in being
at the bottom of a kill box.

343
00:18:57,241 --> 00:19:00,107
[LELEI] Here we are. Lordom
Valley.

344
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,374
[YAO] Wait here for a minute.

345
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,774
I'll let my people know we have
arrived.

346
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:07,107
<yawning effort>

347
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:09,174
[TUKA] So... Is this it?

348
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,441
[ITAMI] Yeah...
How was your nap?

349
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,674
[TUKA] It was just lovely.

350
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,674
Why would they choose to live in
a place

351
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,607
where's there's hardly any green
around?

352
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:24,407
[ITAMI] I don't know. But there
must be some reason for it.

353
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:28,274
<arrow slide>

354
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:30,441
[RORY] <react> Dark elves?!

355
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:33,974
[KUROW] Who are you and what are
you doing here?!

356
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,107
<gasp>

357
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:41,107
<breathing>

358
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:48,507
<swoosh of wings>

359
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:55,107
<fear>

360
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,341
<growl>

361
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:15,841
[ITAMI] Tuka, run!

362
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:22,541
[ITAMI] Can you hear me?! Run!

363
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:25,574
[ITAMI] You need to get away
from here now! Go!

364
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:30,107
<OM battle cry>

365
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,107
<gasp, scream>

366
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:06,874
[RORY] <laughing> That was quiet
impressive.

367
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,474
[ITAMI] Tuka. That's the flame
dragon.

368
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:12,574
That's the beast that murdered
your father.

369
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:16,607
[TUKA] <react> You're a liar!
My father is not dead!

370
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:18,141
Because you're right here,
Daddy...

371
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:20,507
[ITAMI] I am not your father,
dammit!

372
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,107
[TUKA] You're not?

373
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:29,107
[RORY] If it's on the ground, I
can get to it!

374
00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:31,474
[KUROW] Don't hesitate! Keep
shooting!

375
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:39,941
[LELEI] Come on. Can't get my
aim down.

376
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:40,941
<whimpering>

377
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,074
[ITAMI] Tuka!

378
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:44,141
That dragon is your enemy.

379
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:46,907
Put that bastard in the cross
hairs, and pull the trigger.

380
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:48,407
[TUKA] No!!!!

381
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,907
[ITAMI] Open your eyes! Look!

382
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,107
<whimpering>

383
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:58,541
[ITAMI] Pull..the..trigger!

384
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:47,707
[LELEI] Next time on Gate:

385
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:49,107
The Battle.
