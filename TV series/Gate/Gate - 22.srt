1
00:00:01,989 --> 00:00:03,172
Lelei:
Japan's Self Defense Force
was dispatched

2
00:00:03,272 --> 00:00:04,939
to the mysterious
Special Region.

3
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:08,006
In Japan, the Prime Minister is
forced to send a rescue mission

4
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:10,639
to save Japanese delegates
and the pro‐peace nobles,

5
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:12,372
from the hands
of Zorzal's army.

6
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:13,872
The Order of the Rose
is outnumbered,

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,006
facing 1000s of their former
allies at the Jade Palace walls.

8
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:20,072
Meanwhile, Itami and his friends
are targeted by an assassin

9
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:23,272
known as the piper, who is deft
at manipulating people's minds

10
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:25,539
to do his deadly bidding.

11
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,806
Ruflus:
Our enemies before us
are nothing more

12
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:04,772
than a group of women
dressing up in knight costumes.

13
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:08,272
They are merely amateurs
who are playing make believe!

14
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:09,339
Put them in their place!

15
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,772
(battle cry)

16
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:13,606
Do not back down,
no matter who the enemy is!

17
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:17,139
Today we battle to protect
the honor of the Empire!

18
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,472
Turn them away!

19
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:19,839
Right!

20
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,706
Why do we have to fight
against our own comrades?

21
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:26,772
Be quiet. If the enforcers
of the Oprichnina hear you,

22
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:29,172
they will most
certainly kill you.

23
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:31,306
It wasn't meant
to be like this...

24
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:33,139
Attaaaack!
Now!

25
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,572
(battle cry)

26
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:47,739
Hmm...

27
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:51,606
Nola:
Hello there.

28
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,506
Are you from
the Hotel Shokai?

29
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:56,639
Her?

30
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,439
You are the only person
that they haven't seen yet.

31
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:02,239
That's why I would
like you to spy on them.

32
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,206
Listen...

33
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:07,439
I will be acting as if I have
been manipulated by the piper,

34
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,872
and attack Lelei on the day
of her big presentation.

35
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:12,506
I would like you to share
this information with her,

36
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:16,006
so that she will know to wear
armor underneath her robes.

37
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:17,806
Then what is
she supposed to do?

38
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,639
Lelei will need to lie still
and play dead for a while,

39
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,239
So that the piper
will finally show himself.

40
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,339
He'll need to confirm if his
target is actually dead. ,/
That's brilliant!

41
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,806
And then we can finally
catch this creepy creep!

42
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:30,806
Mmm‐mmm!

43
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:31,672
You do remember...

44
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:34,139
what his face looks like,
don't you, boys?

45
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,272
Yeah of course, we do!

46
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:37,639
We could never
forget it!

47
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:39,872
Heh. Very good.

48
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:42,972
Nola:
You can repair your
reputation if I can trust you

49
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:44,139
to do this right.

50
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,972
Of course, we will!

51
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,406
I can't believe they were
fooled again so easily.

52
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:53,839
Goodbye. Be sure
to follow the plan, fellas.

53
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,706
Bye bye!

54
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,272
Are you ready
in there?

55
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:19,906
Rory:
Yes.

56
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:25,206
Hey, I see you
have a new robe.

57
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:30,006
The other one still
has a stain on it

58
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,372
from her fight with Arpeggio
and it won't come off. ,/
It's nice.

59
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,972
Itami:
And this one looks
good on you too.

60
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:35,239
Mm.

61
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:40,606
Um excuse me.
It's been four days
since we last saw Shandy.

62
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:44,706
But it's still probably a bit
too early for us to lose hope.

63
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:46,006
Hmm.

64
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:47,072
I'll ask around.

65
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:48,839
There might be someone
in the market area

66
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,406
who knows where
she could be.

67
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:53,872
Oh God that
was faaar!

68
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:57,339
(panting)

69
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,006
Rory:
Shandy?

70
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:01,939
Wa‐Water...

71
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,406
Sorry, It took so long.

72
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:07,172
I was following a woman named
Nola, hoping to find the piper.

73
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:08,372
Is everything alright?

74
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:10,706
You could have, at least,
tried to contact us you know.

75
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:13,439
I never really
got the chance to.

76
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:16,106
So I take it, the porters
came by and offered you

77
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:17,839
some new
information, right?

78
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:22,239
Yes. They said that Lelei needs
to wear armor under her clothes.

79
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,739
As I am sure you
guys can guess,

80
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,839
Nola is just another one
of the piper's many instruments.

81
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:28,739
I thought as much.

82
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,872
We don't know when
he will make his move,

83
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:34,039
so wearing some sort of armor
is probably a good idea.

84
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,006
And if that
woman shows up,

85
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:37,306
we will need to get a hold
of her before she's able

86
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:39,706
to get anywhere
close to Lelei.

87
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,606
I guess you're right...

88
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:42,606
By any chance...

89
00:05:42,706 --> 00:05:44,739
Did you happen to see what
the piper really looks like?

90
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,439
Yes. He looked just like
the porters said,

91
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,739
He's a scary
bounty‐hunter type.

92
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,572
I followed him all the way
to the town of Pyran, but...

93
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:55,906
when I turned away for just
a second I lost sight of him.

94
00:05:56,006 --> 00:06:00,039
That trip can take even
the most seasoned traveler
two days each way.

95
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,072
Can't really blame
her for that.

96
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:03,406
Thank you for
the effort, Shandy.

97
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:07,506
But all we really needed you
to do was to keep a close eye
on the three porters.

98
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:09,506
And see who made
contact with them.

99
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:13,072
What?! So you mean I just wasted
four days for no reason at all?!

100
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,739
Uhhhh.. Well, no,
no, not exactly

101
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,539
You were able to find and
confirm what the piper
truly looks like...

102
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,739
that's big!

103
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,406
Bet you're hungry.

104
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:24,206
Why don't you get yourself
something to eat.

105
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:26,072
Sure! Yeah!

106
00:06:26,172 --> 00:06:28,406
(squeals in excitement)

107
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:31,339
Do you think, we should tell
the porters about this?

108
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,139
No. Let them think what
they think for a bit longer.

109
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:38,472
I believe they'll be much
more useful to us that way.

110
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,006
What we need
to do right now‐

111
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:44,306
is figure out when and where
the piper is planning to strike

112
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,972
at the conference. ,/
There are so
many people.

113
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:54,172
It's very possible that someone
else among us is being currently

114
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:55,806
manipulated
by the piper.

115
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:58,839
We need to make an effort to
stay aware of our surroundings.

116
00:06:59,351 --> 00:06:59,669
Yeah.

117
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:04,136
Arpeggio:
Yoohoooo!
Over here you guys!

118
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:06,869
Um so why did it take you
so long to get here?

119
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,236
I'm not late, sister.

120
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,736
There's still plenty of time
for me to check in.

121
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:13,903
As always, you and your
incessant stubbornness.

122
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:14,803
Oh.

123
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,036
So... I see you
got a new outfit.

124
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,503
Oh my oh dear, Arpeggio.

125
00:07:21,603 --> 00:07:22,503
(giggles)

126
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:25,669
What do you want,
Master Mimoza?

127
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:28,603
Wellll.. ,/
I was curious to see if she
was able to get a new outfit

128
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:29,336
ready in time.

129
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:31,469
I know you were up all night
hemming your old robes

130
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:33,169
so she'd have
something to wear.

131
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,969
Gah!
Seriously, Mimoza!

132
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:36,236
I thought I told you
never to mention

133
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:38,136
anything about
that, come on!

134
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:41,436
Oh my dear girl...
I'm so very sorry!

135
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,369
Conference Staff:
If you are already registered,

136
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:46,736
then please go ahead
and get in line.

137
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:48,169
So Arpeggio...

138
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,103
How many people will be
receiving their degrees

139
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,703
at the end of
this ceremony?

140
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:53,869
Not sure. Every year
is a little different,

141
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,069
sometimes everyone passes
and sometimes no one does.

142
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,469
Why d'you
wanna know?

143
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,336
I suspect the piper might try to
manipulate someone into thinking

144
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:04,236
they need to get rid
of the competition

145
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:06,536
in order to secure
their own degree.

146
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,403
Oh that's not going
to happen here.

147
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:11,503
All of these people aspire
to become honored specialists

148
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:13,503
in each of their
chosen fields.

149
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:16,736
They are our most valued
and respected magicians.

150
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:22,736
What if the research you
had been working hard on

151
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,469
for so many years was
stolen from you...?

152
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:27,736
and not only that, but that
the perpetrator was going to

153
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:30,736
present it to the community as
if it were their very own?

154
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:31,303
Uh?

155
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:33,436
Itami:
Furthermore, what if
that thief was standing

156
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:37,103
right in front of you as if
nothing was happening?

157
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:40,803
Well, I would... I would
beat that fraud to a pulp...

158
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:46,903
It's time to put an end to this!

159
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:48,536
Itami:
Hold it right there.

160
00:08:57,736 --> 00:08:59,203
You don't understand!

161
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:03,336
That little swindler,
she stole all of my research!

162
00:09:03,436 --> 00:09:05,636
Old Sage:
There's no way
a little girl that age

163
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:11,203
is ready to be a master
of the magic arts!

164
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:14,436
She's taken everything
I've worked so hard for! ,/
I think there's some information
you may not be aware of.

165
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:15,969
Will you please take
this gentleman away

166
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:19,203
and explain that he has been
fooled along with everyone else?

167
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,269
It would be my pleasure.

168
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:24,236
Old Sage:
Wh‐what's going on?

169
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,403
Where are you taking me?
Lelei:
You saved me.

170
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:29,503
Thank you very much.

171
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,469
Hmm. Sure.

172
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:35,303
We'll be on top of the security,
so don't worry about it.

173
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:40,503
Good luck!
You can do this.

174
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:47,336
Presenting Sage:
And uh, well, uh, therefore,

175
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:50,403
the uh, data shown on this
particular chart explains

176
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:53,103
the cause of the retrograde
movements of the planets

177
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:54,636
Old Master:
Oh shut up!

178
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:54,969
(scream)

179
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,869
Which backwoods
camp‐town are you from?!

180
00:09:56,969 --> 00:10:00,036
I heard that crap
from my great grandpappy!

181
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,003
Mokri's ridiculous
theory of the sun

182
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,703
is more convincing
than that, you imbecile!

183
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,303
Get out of here you
good‐for‐nothing amateur!

184
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:07,803
Go work in
the stables!

185
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:09,869
You embarrassed
us and yourself!

186
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,203
(high‐pitched screaming)

187
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:16,203
Oh, now I see.

188
00:10:16,303 --> 00:10:18,769
The white robes do give the
presenters ample opportunity

189
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,369
to be humiliated.

190
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:20,903
Mm.

191
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:21,503
Mm.

192
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:22,103
Hm?

193
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:25,169
I'm going to
be just fine.

194
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,936
Good. I'd much rather protect
you in clean robes anyway.

195
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:31,369
Presenting Sage 2:
That being said, if we can solve
the cause of the distortion,

196
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:34,136
We will be able to finally
uncover the secret origin

197
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:35,069
of our world.

198
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,036
Thank you for your time.

199
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,369
Ah. Very good.

200
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:44,236
Well. Guess that means
it's your turn, Lelei.

201
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:00,803
(crowd whispering)

202
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:12,336
Damn. Couldn't they have waited
'til after the presentation

203
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:21,103
The porters sending her signals,
so that means it must be Nola.

204
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:33,536
I'm too late!

205
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:37,203
(gasps)

206
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:39,136
Nola:
(screams)

207
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:53,569
Uh... how did they all know
to use their magic?

208
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:56,736
Uh, their was a rumor
going around town

209
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:59,036
that Lelei was being
targeted by an assassin.

210
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,803
So everyone was
ready‐and‐waiting
to take immediate action.

211
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:03,469
(chuckles)

212
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:07,603
Aw... Man I wish the SDF
could do stuff like that.

213
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:10,669
Alright then...
well, now that it's safe.

214
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:13,136
Best of luck
with the rest.

215
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:40,369
Ah!

216
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,603
Itami:
Lelei!

217
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:50,703
Helm:
Princess Pina.

218
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,836
What are you doing in here?
Leave me alone.

219
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:57,669
I have some bad news
I'm afraid.

220
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:00,836
The Crown Prince would like you
to change into your...

221
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:02,636
new clothes.

222
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,236
(gasps)

223
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:25,303
Kengun:
(frustration‐building groans)

224
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:26,536
What is the hold up?!

225
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:30,236
Jade Palace is going
to be taken before
we can do anything to help!

226
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:33,169
Do you think that
I don't know that?

227
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,469
We just need you
to hold back.

228
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,403
Hazama:
I'm sure we will
get the order soon.

229
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:52,469
They have only 300 people,

230
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:55,303
Most of which are women,
children, and the elderly.

231
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:59,103
Yet, you sit here coddling
your sad beleaguered army,

232
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:01,369
while our enemy
celebrates in comfort?

233
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:03,736
Yes. I apologize,
mistress.

234
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:07,236
But the morale... of the
Imperial soldiers has soured.

235
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:07,736
And I'm afraid that‐

236
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:11,536
I'm not here to listen to your
sad and feeble excuses.

237
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:13,303
Prince Zorzal is
eagerly waiting

238
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:15,403
to hear the news
of your victory.

239
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:15,969
Understood.

240
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:19,303
If you need to gather
more soldiers, then do so.

241
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:21,336
But if you continue
to allow these traitors

242
00:14:21,436 --> 00:14:22,936
to act freely any longer,

243
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:27,236
You will be branded a coward
of impotence and dishonor.

244
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,103
Do you understand?

245
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:39,103
Our soldiers are beginning to
show serious signs of fatigue.

246
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:40,936
How much food do we have left in
stock?

247
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:44,169
We never imagined we
would have to barricade
ourselves for so long.

248
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:50,569
There can't be much
in there to sustain us.

249
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:53,503
Our rations are thin.
We can use the well in Jade
Palace for drinking water, ,/
but I'm afraid we
will soon be out of food.

250
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:56,436
Boses. What are
we to do?

251
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:59,436
If we can somehow
convince Japan,

252
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:02,103
Then we will take everyone
we have and force our way

253
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:03,403
through the enemy line.

254
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,236
If we do survive,
where would we go?

255
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:07,769
Italica.

256
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:08,769
(gasps)

257
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:09,936
Good idea!

258
00:15:10,036 --> 00:15:13,436
The Yellow Rose Unit and the
foot soldiers are already there.

259
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:16,536
If we join them, we would
have a chance of turning
this thing around.

260
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:19,136
Yes. But I'm
worried about Pina.

261
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:21,336
She's at the mercy
of her brother.

262
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:22,169
Huh?

263
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:23,369
He couldn't harm her‐

264
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:25,403
she's a protected member
of the royal family!

265
00:15:25,503 --> 00:15:27,869
If we're going to leave
the Imperial Capital,

266
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,469
Then we will need to make sure
we can rescue Princess Pina

267
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:32,569
and get her
to safety.

268
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:36,403
But sneaking into the
Imperial Palace is no easy task.

269
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,736
I mean do we even know exactly
where she's being held?

270
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:44,736
We don't. We have to wait
for Hamilton to make contact.

271
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:48,736
Yellow Rose Soldier:
They're attacking!
The enemy's attacking!

272
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:50,336
(scattered commands shouted)

273
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:52,503
They're not giving us
any chance to recuperate.

274
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,503
It's tough for
the enemy as well.

275
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:56,603
Until we make contact
with the Princess,

276
00:15:56,703 --> 00:15:59,336
we must do what
we can to stay alive!

277
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:01,703
Right... I understand.

278
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:07,069
(struggling)

279
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:10,069
Stop it! Stop it!

280
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,003
Are you listening to me?!

281
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:14,336
(struggling continues)

282
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,603
Don't leave me here!

283
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:40,103
You have repeatedly
ignored the advice

284
00:16:40,203 --> 00:16:42,069
your brother has
graciously given you.

285
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,536
Instead choosing to interfere
with his royal activities.

286
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:50,869
Thule:
Therefore, you are to be
judged... by Oprichnina law.

287
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,269
You're nothing but
a Voglia bunny!

288
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:56,403
I don't really care what
you think of me, Princess.

289
00:16:56,503 --> 00:16:58,836
Did you know that's
the exact same room

290
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:01,136
where I was
once held captive?

291
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:04,069
I think it's a very
nice room Princess.

292
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,669
And it will suit
you perfectly!

293
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,403
Oh! And. Yes.

294
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:11,469
I have a message for you from
the great Prince Zorzal.

295
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,403
He has something very
important to tell you.

296
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:20,003
(chuckles)

297
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:20,969
(door creaks, slams)

298
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,103
Zorzal:
You lose, Pina

299
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:29,369
Lelei. Lelei.
Hey are you alright?

300
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,303
Huh?

301
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:37,669
(sighs)

302
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:38,069
Huh?

303
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:38,836
(gasps)

304
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,403
What the?!

305
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:46,169
N..NO! She's wearing
armor underneath?!

306
00:17:47,036 --> 00:17:48,469
Hmph.

307
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,236
What did they say?

308
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:57,536
Her thesis went well,
but there's just too
much drama, right now.

309
00:17:57,636 --> 00:18:00,369
So they informed us
that they're going to be
holding on to her degree

310
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:02,603
until everything else
settles back down.

311
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,969
Huh... That's too bad.

312
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:08,569
Did you see anyone at
the conference that
may have been the piper?

313
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,536
Mm‐mm. No I did not.

314
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:11,169
And besides‐

315
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:13,069
whoever Shandy
says she saw,

316
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:14,803
may not be the
actual piper anyway.

317
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:19,069
Most likely, he would have kept
himself well hidden from view.

318
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:20,703
I don't believe you!

319
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:22,969
If she was going to wear
armor under her clothes,

320
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,936
you should have
let me know about it!

321
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,036
But‐ you're the
one who told us

322
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:29,003
that she would need
to wear armor, remember?

323
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:30,436
That was all you.

324
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:30,736
Oh?!

325
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:33,103
I would like you share this
information with her,

326
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:36,503
so that she will
know to wear armor
underneath her robes.

327
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:37,369
Uh?

328
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:38,203
Uh...

329
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:40,203
Oh, I'm such an idiot!

330
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:43,969
It's a good thing that
the person fooled was
a fool themselves, huh?

331
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:48,536
I mean why would we not do
anything when we knew she was
going to be attacked?

332
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:51,336
Because knowing what's
coming is your best defense.

333
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:54,503
It was rather foolish of you
to not go for her neck.

334
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:56,569
Uh, Tuka...!

335
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:56,903
(whimpers)

336
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,736
Shandy...
why would you try to do
something like this?

337
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:03,803
It is what must be done to save
the life of Princess Pina!

338
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:04,469
Huh?

339
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:04,669
Hm?

340
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,369
How would attacking Lelei
possibly do anything
to save the Princess's life?

341
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:13,769
Because Prince Zorzal wants
Lelei out of the picture‐

342
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:15,536
he wants to
see her dead.

343
00:19:16,803 --> 00:19:17,736
Mmm.

344
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:20,736
So I guess I thought that if I
were to offer him Lelei's head,

345
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:24,903
then it would demonstrate
Princess Pina's
allegiance to him.

346
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:26,769
I see what he did.

347
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:29,836
He used your loyalty toward
Pina to manipulate you.

348
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,769
Look I didn't need to be
tricked or manipulated, okay?

349
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:35,303
I know more than anyone
the incredible danger

350
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:37,169
that Princess Pina is in.

351
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:40,936
Prince Zorzal's dictatorship
has gone out of control!

352
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:42,603
Shandy:
I just...

353
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,769
(fighting tears)

354
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:47,203
I fear for
her very life.

355
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:54,836
I cannot believe that they would
actually attack Jade Palace.

356
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:56,636
If we don't do
something quickly,

357
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:59,836
Princess Pina will be
judged by the Oprichnina.

358
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:00,669
Knight‐Lieutenant Grey,

359
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:03,369
if you feel as indebted
to Princess Pina as I do,

360
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,636
you would kill Lelei yourself!

361
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:08,836
Why the hell would I do that?

362
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:12,769
That's an absurd way
to try to fix things.

363
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:15,936
And besides... even by
a pure tactical viewpoint,

364
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:19,969
Rescuing the Princess is
a much more plausible
approach to all this.

365
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:22,969
There's no way we'll be able
to just sneak into the Palace

366
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:25,003
without confronting one
of the royal guards.

367
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:26,036
Now listen to me.

368
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:27,669
If we want to
stop the piper...

369
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,669
Then we must do so by finally
putting an end to the man

370
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:31,636
who's pulling
the strings.

371
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:34,203
You seriously want us
to kill the Crown Prince?

372
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:36,303
If you want to
save Princess Pina,

373
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,569
this would be the most effective
way of getting it done.

374
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:43,736
By the way, Itami.

375
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:47,036
Were you ever able to get
in touch with your military?

376
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:48,403
I should be able
to get a signal

377
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:50,369
if I go to the
outskirts of Rondel.

378
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:52,936
But... it hasn't
been working very well.

379
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:54,703
We need to stay
one step ahead.

380
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:57,669
So I took advantage
of the newly repaired bridge.

381
00:20:57,769 --> 00:20:59,336
And called for a messenger.

382
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:00,403
Messenger:
Excuse me, sir!

383
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:02,603
Aaah! What do you
have for me?

384
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:04,669
Messenger:
Something terrible has
happened to the Princess!

385
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:05,769
Grey:
What?

386
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:06,803
(gasps)

387
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:19,406
Yessir, I Understand.

388
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,272
Huh?

389
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:26,672
Let's do it!

390
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:30,906
Squad Leader:
About face.

391
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:31,839
Soldier:
Yes, sir!

392
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,439
Squad Leader:
Prepare for inspection.

393
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:34,972
Chute, secure!

394
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:36,639
Equipment secure!

395
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:38,006
Weapons check!

396
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:39,506
Ammo check!

397
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:40,772
Automatic wire...

398
00:21:40,872 --> 00:21:41,872
Soldier:
Automatic wire, check!

399
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:45,072
Squad Leader:
Alright. That's it,
gentlemen! All green!

400
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:46,606
Get on board!

401
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:51,639
Radio:
To all units in
the Special Region...

402
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:52,772
this is from Headquarters.

403
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:56,339
At 06:03 tomorrow morning,
the Dispatch Joint Task Force

404
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:58,572
will be parachuting down
to the southwest Empire,

405
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:00,472
and initiating
an airborne assault.

406
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:05,339
Our goal is to rescue the
Japanese delegates residing at
Jade Palace and asylum seekers,

407
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:08,406
harboring the seeds
of peace with the Empire.

408
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:14,339
We have to hurry...
to the Capital!

409
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:49,739
Lelei:
Next time on Gate:
Paratroopers
