1
00:00:01,066 --> 00:00:02,433
[DELILAH] Here you go.

2
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:06,133
[ITAMI] So? What did you wanna
talk to me about?

3
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:10,066
[YANAGIDA] While you were away,
we were approached by a very
interesting visitor.

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,400
She asked if we would kill
a flame dragon for her.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,300
[ITAMI] Huh? We can't do
something like that...

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,033
[YANAGIDA] Just hear me out.

7
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:19,833
[ITAMI] I see. So it
destroyed her home village.

8
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:21,766
Of course that's a real tragedy.

9
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:24,666
But her request was denied by
the Lieutenant General, right?

10
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,333
What else is there to talk
about?

11
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,000
[YANAGIDA]
The dragon showed up

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,400
within the territory of the
Native State of Elbe.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,233
An area that is apparently rich
in oil deposits.

14
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,500
As well as very large uncut
diamonds.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,400
[ITAMI] O‐kay. When am I
supposed to give a crap?

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,533
[YANAGIDA] How'd you like
to go on a scouting mission?

17
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:41,366
[ITAMI] Huh?

18
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:43,066
And just like before it's the

19
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,266
kind of mission that offers
you a great deal of freedom.

20
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:48,366
You'd be able to take actions
outside of the initial scope.

21
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,233
<react>

22
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,366
[ITAMI] What are you suggesting?

23
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:51,800
[YANAGIDA]
Look I'm just saying...

24
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,966
That you might find
yourself

25
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:54,300
on the other side of
the border...

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,066
[YANAGIDA] And you might
encounter a dragon.

27
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,500
[YANAGIDA] And you might have to
kill it and come back

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,133
with some samples of a few
resources you found.

29
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,833
[YANAGIDA] If something
like that were to happen

30
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,066
I doubt there'd be too much
trouble.

31
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,300
[ITAMI] Yes there would!

32
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,300
You never saw that thing okay,
and I did.

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,266
[ITAMI] It was goddamn
terrifying!

34
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:10,300
[ITAMI] Look if it's an order,
then I'll follow it,

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,633
I don't have a much of a choice.

36
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,133
But if I do... I'm not getting
my team killed.

37
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:16,566
<snooty chuckle>

38
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,100
[YANAGIDA] You might want to pay
a little visit

39
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,700
to your blonde elf friend.

40
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,100
[ITAMI] Tuka?

41
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,233


42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
[ITAMI] You okay?

43
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,233


44
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,233
<more crying...>

45
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,766
[ITAMI] What's the matter?

46
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:21,933
[TUKA] Father!

47
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,000
[ITAMI] <react> What?

48
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,000
[TUKA] Oh Daddy!

49
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,166
[ITAMI] Uh... Tuka?!

50
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:29,066
[TUKA] You see he DID come back!

51
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,633
Can't believe you would take
such a sick joke that far!

52
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:33,866
[ITAMI] Tuka?

53
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,600
[TUKA] You're not going to
believe this.

54
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,000
You know what she said?

55
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,433
[TUKA] She said.... She said
that you were dead!

56
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:43,000
[TUKA] She told me that you
were...

57
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,600
killed... by a flame dragon.

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,233
[LELEI] This will allow her to
rest for a while.

59
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,000
[ITAMI] What the hell happened?

60
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,033
[RORY] It was Yao.

61
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,666
<small breath>

62
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:00,366
[TUKA] What did... you say...?

63
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:03,433
[YAO] I said that your father
is no longer among us in this
world.

64
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:05,033
No matter how far and wide you
look,

65
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,200
you are never going to find him.

66
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,566
[YAO] You remember
what happened.

67
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,366
Your village was attacked
by the flame dragon.

68
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,933
And you're the only survivor.

69
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,000
<ELVEN PANIC AND DEATH>

70
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,200
[YAO] Everyone else was killed.

71
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,966
[TUKA] You're lying.

72
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:22,666
[YAO] You need to wake up!

73
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,300
Tuka your father is dead!

74
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,833
He was burned and devoured
by a flame dragon.

75
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,233
<react>

76
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,600
<react>

77
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,333
[TUKA] <scream>

78
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:45,933
[RORY]
Yao told Tuka... the truth.

79
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,733
[RORY] The truth that we've all
been

80
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,466
trying to avoid this whole time.

81
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:53,166
[LELEI] And because we
never did, Tuka never
stopped looking for him.

82
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:56,066
[RORY] She's been wandering
aimlessly around town.

83
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,366
Sometimes forgetting to eat, or
sleep

84
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,033
[RORY] So every now and then...

85
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,733
we've been using this spell to
help her get some rest.

86
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,500
[ITAMI] Jesus Christ.

87
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,066
[ITAMI] Why would you tell her
that?

88
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,766
[ITAMI] We've worked very hard
to handle this delicately.

89
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,433
What you did was totally
uncalled for.

90
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:16,833
[YAO] Oh it was uncalled for
was it?

91
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,766
All I did was tell her
the truth.

92
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:22,966
I understand that you especially
caring toward her and your other
friends here.

93
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:25,000
[YAO] That you're an
extremely loyal leader.

94
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
And that you're willing to break
a few rules

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,633
in order to protect them.

96
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:29,866
Well knowing that fact

97
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:31,700
I decided to take
advantage of it.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,966
[ITAMI] Is that right... There
are lines you just don't cross!

99
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,866
[YAO] Don't speak to me like a
child!

100
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,233
[YAO] I went to your people

101
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,700
and asked them to kill the flame
dragon.

102
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,366
I begged for their mercy.

103
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,333
[YAO] I offered them
anything they could possible
want in return!

104
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:48,833
[YAO] But they... but
they turned their backs
on me and my village.

105
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,466
They told me they can't do it.

106
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:51,733
<react>

107
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,800
But then... a few of them also
told me something else.

108
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,766
They told me you might help!

109
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,166
That is why I broke her heart!

110
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,100
And if you want to save her.
If you want her back.

111
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,700
You must tell her that her
father

112
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,066
was murdered by a flame dragon.

113
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,633
[YAO] And exact revenge for her!

114
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:12,133
[YAO] So what are you going to
do man in green?!

115
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,800
[YAO] Are you going to
abandon your friend?

116
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,900
Or are you going to take up arms
and make things right?

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,500
[YAO] If it were a person and
they had killed your loved
ones...

118
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,466
You would hunt them down to the
ends of the earth

119
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:23,166
and make them pay for what
they've done.

120
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,566
[YAO] But, this is a flame
dragon isn't it?

121
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,933
The rules aren't the same!

122
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,933
[YAO] No one can just go out
there and catch it.

123
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:29,900
No one can punish it.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,833
[YAO] So what do we do?

125
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:31,866
How do we seek justice?

126
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:33,200
Where do we focus such anger?

127
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,300
[YAO] Where am I supposed to
direct this hatred

128
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,466
for the thing that took the ones
I love?!

129
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,500
<sob>

130
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,266
[YAO] I know I'm being selfish.
I know that.

131
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,866
I'll give you anything.
I'll give you everything.

132
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:47,066
My heart, my soul. Whatever it
takes.

133
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,700
[YAO] I just thought...

134
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,400
Even if you did it for her,

135
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,233
my people could be saved as
well.

136
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,466
<react>

137
00:06:57,266 --> 00:07:00,233
[DIAVO] What?! They're making
Zorzal the Crown Prince?!

138
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,766
[PINA] Yes. His succession to
the throne

139
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:03,933
has been announced.

140
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,100
[DIAVO] Damn it! But why do it
now?!

141
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
[PINA] I don't know.

142
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,400
[DIAVO] Our idiot brother has
lost his mind.

143
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,666
He's going to rise up against
our father!

144
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:15,066
[DIAVO] He told me I had to
choose which side I was on!

145
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,966
[PINA] He really said that?

146
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,966
[DIAVO] But who would give him
such an idea?

147
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,533
Who put such a stupid thought
into his head?

148
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:24,000
[DIAVO] Pina...
always remember something.

149
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,166
A giant fool with small ideas is
very dangerous.

150
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,600
[DIAVO] They will destroy
themselves

151
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,733
and everyone else around them in
the process.

152
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:35,300
[DIAVO] My dear sister.
It's time for you to start
thinking about your future.

153
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,433
[PINA] I only want one thing...

154
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:43,166
peace between the Empire and
Japan... Brother.

155
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:54,933
[BOULO] <noise>

156
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,166
[THULE] What do you want?

157
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:57,933
[BOULO]

158
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:00,366
I have received a most
interesting report

159
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:03,533
from one of the spies I sent to
Alnus Hill.

160
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:07,233
[THULE] I'll read it later.
Just leave it somewhere okay.

161
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:07,966
<grunt>

162
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:10,400
[THULE] Oh, your reward.

163
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,033
<hairy foot love>

164
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,166
[BOULO] If Zorzal is truly the
crown prince,

165
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:17,233
we both know that the end of The
Empire is imminent.

166
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,033
[THULE] Well it wasn't easy.

167
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,966
I had to stroke his...
ridiculous ego.

168
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:23,300
[THULE] He's a buffoon.

169
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,333
[THULE] Nothing more
than a mindless teenager

170
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:28,566
who thinks the entire world
revolves around his tiny
little existence.

171
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:33,066
[THULE] 
That moron will do
whatever I tell him to.

172
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,066
[THULE] There will be no peace
with the other side.

173
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,333
[THULE] It's coming...

174
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,333
The full force of my wrath has
just begun.

175
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,400
[BOULO] Then why do you
keep the slaves?

176
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,400
Simply get rid of what's left of
the Japanese captives

177
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,966
who still sully our great
Empire?

178
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,433
[BOULO] It seems they care about

179
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:51,266
their people above anything
else.

180
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:52,866
[BOULO] They would be outraged

181
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,933
and almost certainly attack the
Empire.

182
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,333
[THULE] For their people, huh...

183
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,666
[THULE] That's not enough,
Boulo.

184
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:02,133
[BOULO] Then what do you think
it will take my dear.

185
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,533
[THULE] It's simple.

186
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,633
Noriko was in the exact same
situation as me,

187
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,900
Yet she was offered refuge.

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,100
[BOULO] And who will be
the one to kill her?

189
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
[THULE] <laugh> Pina will do
nicely.

190
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,700
[YOUNG ITAMI] How could you do
this? You killed dad?!

191
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:37,066
<breathing...>

192
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,833
[YOUNG ITAMI] <breathing...>

193
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:41,966
She's gone. She's delusional.
She's sick.

194
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:45,266
She has to be put in the
hospital.

195
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,633
[YOUNG ITAMI]
They're gonna take her away.

196
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:51,033
There's nothing I can do.
There's nothing...

197
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,566
<waking>

198
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:00,966
<notice>

199
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,133
[ITAMI] It's good to
see you awake.

200
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,066
[TUKA] Hey. <giggle>

201
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,833
[TUKA] What's the matter with
you, father?

202
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:13,866
[ITAMI] Huh? Ah...oh nothing.

203
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:17,000
[TUKA] It's OK.
You don't have to tell me.

204
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,266
[TUKA] It's good to have you
back.

205
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:29,066
[ITAMI] It's good to be back,
Tuka.

206
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,233
<STREET mumbles>

207
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:40,433
[TUKA] Hey! I'm over here,
Father!

208
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,533
<nervous chuckle>

209
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:46,833
[TUKA] <laughter>
So where do you want to go
today Daddy?

210
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,566
[ITAMI] Oh, I don't know...

211
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:18,733
[KURATA] I heard Itami's been

212
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,533
pretending to be Tuka's father.

213
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,633
[TOMITA] Yeah. He's been coming
to work

214
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,000
from her house each morning.

215
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,866
[KURATA] Whoa is she really in
that bad of shape?

216
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:28,633
[SHINO] It's bad enough that
when she looks at him she sees
her real father.

217
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,833
[TUKA] Well I know a great place
we should go, Daddy.

218
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:32,700
[ITAMI] How can I say no to you?

219
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,400
[KURATA] Holy crap.

220
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,733
[ITAMI] So Tuka... where do you
wanna go today?

221
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:43,133
[TUKA] It doesn't matter...
as long as we're together I'm
happy!

222
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:45,266
[ITAMI] Well that doesn't
help me much.

223
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,133
[TUKA] Love you Daddy.

224
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,866
[HIGAKI] Need you to go
to the Imperial Capital again
tomorrow.

225
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:55,633
[ITAMI] Am I moving there?

226
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:56,866
[HIGAKI] Yes.

227
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,066
I need you to do some
more interpreting.

228
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,033
And this time it might
take a little while.

229
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:04,533
[HIGAKI] Is there a problem?
You've spent a lot of time
there, you know the place.

230
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:10,700
[TUKA] Okay so... We
told the children that
we're going out of town,

231
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,200
and they got really excited!

232
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,233
[ITAMI] Huh... Yeah?

233
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,666
I told them it was dangerous,

234
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,666
but they didn't care.
Either way it should make for

235
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,033
a great change of pace for them
don't you think?

236
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,733
[ITAMI] I'm sure it will be.

237
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,833
[TUKA] <notice>

238
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:25,100
[TUKA] Okay father. What's the
matter?

239
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,266
[ITAMI] <react> Everything's
just fine.

240
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:32,466
[TUKA] <skeptic>
So! When's your next day off?

241
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:35,866
I wanna go out again! Just the
two of us.

242
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:37,033
[ITAMI] Yeah... about that...

243
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:38,466
[TUKA] <react>

244
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,933
[ITAMI] Sorry. But that'll have
to wait for awhile.

245
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:45,966
[TUKA] Huh?

246
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,766
[ITAMI] I don't have a choice.

247
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,266
I have a job to do.

248
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,500
<miffed> Since when are you such
a hard working employee?

249
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,266
[ITAMI] Hey don't say that. I
feel bad about it.

250
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:56,333
[TUKA] I'm not so sure.

251
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:59,533
[ITAMI] So Tuka. I need to tell
you something important.

252
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:00,400
<react>

253
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,100
[ITAMI] I have to go away again,

254
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,000
and it could be for quite a
while.

255
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,033
[TUKA] <react>

256
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,800
But there's no need to worry.

257
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,933
I promise I'll be back.

258
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,500
It's just that...

259
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,700
I wanted you to know you'd be
here on your own.

260
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,566
<pained>

261
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,466
[ITAMI] Tuka? Are you...?

262
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:19,200
[TUKA] No, I'm fine, it's okay,
I can do this.

263
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,433
You just do your job alright?

264
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,233
<STREET murmur>

265
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,100
[ITAMI] You're still here I see.

266
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,566
[YAO] You always a jerk this
early in the morning?

267
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,200
[ITAMI] <grunt>

268
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,033
[YAO] She's been suffering from
headaches, hasn't she?

269
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:37,833
[ITAMI] <react>
[YAO] That poor girl is
teetering on the edge right now.

270
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,033
She's so close.

271
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:40,833
It won't take much to send her
over

272
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,300
and plummeting into the depths
of insanity.

273
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
[ITAMI] I know what I'm doing.

274
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,200
[YAO] Ah yes playing
the role of her father.

275
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,300
A twisted ploy so she doesn't
have to face her father's death.

276
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,633
[YAO] But you don't know a thing
about Hodrew.

277
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,233
YAO] You can pretend to be
her father all you want,

278
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,866
but every little inconsistency
you create

279
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,200
only adds to the crippling
confusion

280
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,366
spiraling through her mind.

281
00:13:58,466 --> 00:13:59,833
That's what's causing
her headaches.

282
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:01,733
[ITAMI] I fully aware of that.

283
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:04,900
[YAO] This can't go on forever.

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,133
The end is coming soon
and you know it!

285
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:12,033
[YANAGIDA] So Itami.
How long are you going to keep
playing the family man?

286
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,233
[ITAMI] Leave me alone.

287
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,300
[YANAGIDA]
I'm fine with it if you are.

288
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,266
Anyway, the first group of war
prisoners will be returned soon.

289
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:19,700
[ITAMI]
What about the abductees?

290
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,166
[YANAGIDA] That will have to
wait until next time.

291
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:24,100
First we need to show
Princess Pina

292
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,400
we've kept our part of the deal.

293
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,633
The rest will involve
further negotiations.

294
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,500
[ITAMI] Alright then. Well I
hope it goes well.

295
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,266
[YANAGIDA] Hey. Are you doing
alright Itami?

296
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:34,866
[ITAMI] On top of the world.

297
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:36,533
[YANAGIDA] Yeah... right.

298
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:41,266
[ITAMI] <Uugh...> I'm sorry. No
I'm not alright.

299
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:43,133
[ITAMI] Feel like my head is in
a tailspin.

300
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,400
[YANAGIDA] There's a simple
solution for all this.

301
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,100
You could kill the flame dragon.

302
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,700
[ITAMI] And get my subordinates
killed at the same time?

303
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,033
No thanks, Yanagida.

304
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,566
[ITAMI] A mission is one thing.

305
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,533
[ITAMI] But I can't risk other
people's lives

306
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:56,433
for personal reasons or some
shady agenda.

307
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,800
[ITAMI] The only life I have to
risk is my own.

308
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,166
You undertand that right?

309
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,766
[YANAGIDA] Whatever.

310
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:05,133
Itami... You let me know when
you change your mind.

311
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:07,866
[YANAGIDA] I'll be happy to do
all the boring paperwork.

312
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:09,233
<react>

313
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,533
[KURATA] Alright there he is!

314
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,000
[TUKA] <happy> Oh...

315
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,633
[ALL] Cheers!

316
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:28,133
[RORY] So tell me, how does it
feel to have a daughter who's
older than you?

317
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:29,900
[ITAMI]
Kinda complicated actually.

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,200
[RORY] I imagine so.

319
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,766
[LELEI] You must be under a lot
of distress.

320
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:36,533
[ITAMI] Well... I'm glad she's
taken a liking to Kurokawa.

321
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:40,000
[ITAMI] At least I know that
somebody'll take care of her,
y'know.

322
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,066
[TUKA] Hi Daddy!!

323
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,633
[SOCIAL WORKER]
You're asking if taking revenge
can be good for a person.

324
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:53,833
Well, the natural impulse to
share one's pain can extend to
seeking retribution.

325
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,866
[ITAMI] But that doesn't mean
getting that revenge
fulfills anything.

326
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,500
[SOCIAL WORKER]
It may not be rewarding.

327
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,566
But some are reaching for any
sort of moment,

328
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,300
no matter how unfulfilling, just
to move on.

329
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,233
<react>

330
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:23,566
[DURAN] S'cuse me lad... is
there room for an old man?

331
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:26,100
[ITAMI] Yes of course.

332
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,566
[DURAN] <pleased>
That's very cordial of you.

333
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,900
I like to come to find myself
here every night.

334
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,533
[DURAN] Just so you know.

335
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:36,000
[ITAMI] Uh‐huh...

336
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,066
[DURAN] What is it that
has you looking so glum?

337
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,500
[ITAMI] Not again...

338
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,700
[DURAN] You don't have to tell
me your troubles, lad.

339
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,333
[DURAN] But I beg your pardon

340
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:47,200
if I can't tell you one of mine.

341
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,600
Is this how your people
fix things?

342
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,000
[ITAMI] Yeah.

343
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,966
[DURAN] They did tell me
I'd be able to run again.

344
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,800
[ITAMI] With some of
the legs they make,

345
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,666
you can run faster
than you did before.

346
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,866
[DURAN] Is that so? Aahh...

347
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:03,066
<thoughtful chuckle>

348
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,266
[ITAMI] What?

349
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:06,500
[DURAN] Oh nothing.
I'm just thinking.

350
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,466
You sure you've got
nothing to say?

351
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:11,000
<react>

352
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,433
[DURAN] Oh‐ho...!

353
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,366
I'm certain
they will feel better

354
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,933
after exacting their vengeance.

355
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,533
But their enemy is pretty
formidable.

356
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:21,966
Given the location
I can't bring a very large unit.

357
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,266
It just wouldn't work.

358
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:27,366
And if... If I go in small, then
we'd all get obliterated.

359
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:30,700
[ITAMI] No matter what I do,
I lose something.

360
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,000
[DURAN] You listen here lad.

361
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,366
I think you're forgetting
something very important.

362
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:37,500
[ITAMI] What?

363
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,466
[DURAN] What you feel in your
heart.

364
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,066
[ITAMI] If I could make
decisions like that

365
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,600
then I don't even have to think
about it.

366
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,566
[DURAN] <laugh>

367
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:49,433
Sometimes in life... you must
not make a decision at all,

368
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:52,166
and just go with what you feel
is right.

369
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:53,833
[DURAN] I know in your heart

370
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,300
you've probably already decided.

371
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,900
[ITAMI] C'mon don't give me that
look.

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,200
[TUKA] Okay...

373
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,300
[ITAMI] I'll be back in no time.

374
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,433
[TUKA] Yeah.

375
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,466
[TUKA] And when you are...

376
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,200
[TUKA] Everything... everything
will be normal again!

377
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,000
[PILOT] Ready for dust off.

378
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:44,866
[TUKA] Everything...

379
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:47,233
everything will be
normal again !

380
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,300
[ITAMI] Sorry old man!
I'm not making this trip!

381
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,566
[KUWABARA] <react> What?!

382
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,533
[ITAMI] Tukaaa!

383
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,200
[TUKA] But father...

384
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:08,700
[ITAMI] I decided I'm going to
stay by your side.

385
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,033
[TUKA] Can you... do that?

386
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:16,133
[ITAMI] Sure. Tuka.
We're going together.

387
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,766
[YANAGIDA]
What the hell... Itami...

388
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:23,433
You unbelievable ass!

389
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:26,400
You abandon your mission
to go dragon hunting with
one elf girl!

390
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,333
[YANAGIDA] What the hell
am I supposed to tell the brass

391
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,600
to make this absurd
decision of yours sound
half‐way reasonable?!

392
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,300
[ITAMI] I thought that was
kinda your specialty.

393
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,366
You listen to me. You are going
to rejoin the team.

394
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,266
[YANAGIDA] You are going to
finish your mission,

395
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,900
and then take your troops to
hunt the dragon.

396
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,133
Maybe that way, I can...

397
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:43,600
[ITAMI] Yanagida,
I've already decided.

398
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,166
[YANAGIDA] <anger> Goddamn it
what do you need?

399
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,733
[ITAMI] A transport vehicle,
some backup fuel,

400
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,900
weapons and ammunition,

401
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,300
And probably some food.

402
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,533
Enough to sustain two people for
a week I guess.

403
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,566
[YANAGIDA] One week rations for
two people...

404
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,000
Are you sure that's all the food
you want to bring along?

405
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,600
[ITAMI] Yeah.

406
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,933
[YANAGIDA]  Sure about
that?

407
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,900
[ITAMI] Yeah...
Of course I'm sure.

408
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,333
Everyone else is already...

409
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:12,566
<land>

410
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,700
[ITAMI] Uh Rory?!

411
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,266
[RORY] If you wanted to ask a
girl

412
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:16,833
to fight a ferocious beast,

413
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,300
all you had to do was ask.

414
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,266
[ITAMI] Uh... We're talking
about a flame dragon here.

415
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:25,333
Oh don't get me all worked up
before we've even left!

416
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,000
Unless you're just planning on
losing before you even start.

417
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,066
[ITAMI] Uh no...

418
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,733
[RORY] Then you may ask me.

419
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,566
[ITAMI] Well... <foley>

420
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,566
[ITAMI] Okay okay I'll ask you!

421
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,333
[ITAMI] <settle> Rory. Will you
come with us?

422
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:43,566
[RORY] Fine, but it'll cost you.

423
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,000
[ITAMI] M'sure it will.

424
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,200
I'm not sure how I can pay you
back though

425
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,733
I've got something in mind.

426
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:56,100
[ITAMI] <mucho pain> What are
you doing?!

427
00:20:57,366 --> 00:20:59,666
[RORY] <lick> Signing our
contract.

428
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:00,800
[ITAMI] Our contract?!

429
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
Now if you should go
and die on me,

430
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,533
your soul will be mine.

431
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:05,600
[ITAMI] Wait what?!

432
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,666
Yanagida.

433
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,633
Add another person to the menu.

434
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:09,833
[LELEI] Make that four.

435
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,166
[ITAMI] You too, Lelei?!

436
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:13,200
[LELEI] To increase your chances
of survival...

437
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,700
you'll need some magic.

438
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,000
[YAO] Henceforth my fight and my
body are forever yours.

439
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,866
Just tell me what you need.

440
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:21,633
[ITAMI] I guess I should have
expected you.

441
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:24,933
Ah well we could always use a
guide along the way.

442
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,166
[YANAGIDA] So that brings up

443
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,766
the total to five people, yes?

444
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:30,133
[TUKA] I don't understand
why SHE has to come with us?!

445
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,666
[ITAMI] Don't be like that.

446
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:35,000
She's on her way home, we're
just giving her a ride.

447
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,300
[TUKA] <ugh!>

448
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,533
<FAREWELLS>

449
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,266
[YANAGIDA] You'd rather be
screwing around...

450
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:46,666
and work when it's convenient.

451
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:49,933
[YANAGIDA] And somewhere in that
mixed up logic...

452
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:52,000
[YANAGIDA]
You're surrounded by people...

453
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,733
who volunteer to follow you.

454
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,133
[DURAN] That's a good lad.

455
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:06,633
[YAO] I'm coming... We're all
coming!

456
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:08,733
[YAO] Hope is on the way!

457
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,566
[TUKA] Let's go Daddy!
Step on it!

458
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,366
[ITAMI] Ha! You got it!

459
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,900
[LELEI] Next time on Gate:

460
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The Flame Dragon Once Again.
