1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:03,133
[TOMITA] Who is she?

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:05,633
[YOJI] Oh, this is Risa...

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,833
[YOJI] She's my ex‐wife.

4
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:08,766
[SHINO] She's your...

5
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:10,533
[TOMITA] Your ex‐what?!

6
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:12,766
[ALL] What?

7
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:13,666
[RISA] Huh?

8
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:14,933
[SHINO] Oh c'mon now!

9
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,366
What kinda weirdo marries
a guy like him?!

10
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:17,866
[RISA] Hey! Who're you calling
weird?

11
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:18,700
[SHINO] You, you little
wack‐job!

12
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,700
(surprised reax)

13
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,066
[SHINO] Then again.

14
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,733
You guys do kinda seem like
you belong together.

15
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:04,033
[RORY] Oooh no... !

16
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:07,000
She's followed me here to this
place too?!

17
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,166
[LELEI] Books. So many books...

18
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:12,266
[PINA] Wow. This is also a book?

19
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,566
[BOSES] I've never seen a
book... like this before.

20
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,133
[PINA] Yeah.

21
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:17,500
[YOJI] And that's...
why I'm here.

22
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,266
[RISA] Coming here's an awful
idea...

23
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:21,166
Okay.

24
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,733
[RISA] There's nothing about
this

25
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,866
to justify getting me mixed
up in something so dangerous.

26
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:26,266
[TOMITA] That's right, sir...

27
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:28,633
she might be your ex, but she's
still a civilian.

28
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,033
[TOMITA] On top of that... it
probably wasn't

29
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,200
a good idea to lose the Bureau
guy.

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,066
[YOJI] Yeah well. We keep
running into all these problems

31
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,966
whenever that creepy dude's
around.

32
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,000
[TOMITA] So then you think he
might be the leak?

33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,266
[YOJI] Meh I dunno about that,

34
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:43,200
but maybe one of the guys with
him.

35
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,200
[TOMITA] Or he might've been
followed.

36
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,733
[YOJI] If something were to
happen to us

37
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,166
while he's in the hospital we
can assume it's not him.

38
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:53,400
[YOJI] But if everything's quiet
from now on then I guess we'll
know otherwise.

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,866
[RISA] Excuse me...
[YOJI] Hm?

40
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,133
[RISA] I'd kinda prefer it

41
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:58,800
if nothing kooky happens
here at my house?

42
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,766
[RISA] I have got a
deadline to meeeeet!

43
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:02,200
(snoozies)

44
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:08,566
[TOMITA] Miss Risa.

45
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,600
[RISA] Hmm?

46
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,933
[TOMITA] So it's true...

47
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,033
you were actually married to
Lieutenant Itami.

48
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,466
[RISA] I was...

49
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,700
I suppose we're friends now.

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,966
[TOMITA] The two of you were
able to remain friends

51
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,333
even after getting a divorce?

52
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,800
[RISA] Hmmm... Other folks might
have a problem.

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,533
[RISA] However... It's not like

54
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,966
we were mad at each other or
anything.

55
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:33,933
The two of us weren't exactly
what most people would call a
classic normal married couple.

56
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,466
[RISA] We're both kinda
freaks...

57
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,733
and realized it works out better
this way.

58
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,633
[TOMITA] Fair enough.

59
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,833
[RISA] So then you agree that
we're freaks?

60
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,600
[TOMITA] Uh... well... I...

61
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,800
(OM surprised/aroused)

62
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,100
[PINA] It's amazing such art
exists in a place like this.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,500
[BOSES] My lady, we're in a
different world.

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,366
[PINA] Oh right.

65
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:55,966
[BOSES] I think I'd really like

66
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,666
to take those language classes.

67
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:58,733
[PINA] Yeah, I'm sure you would.

68
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,633
(roused reax)

69
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,366
(snoozy sounds)

70
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,833
[YOJI] Huh? Mmmm... Oh well...

71
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,366
(snoozies)

72
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,000
[YOJI] All right! Time to have
some fun!

73
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,933
[SHINO] Huh? You've gotta be
kidding me.

74
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:25,733
We don't have time to screw
around!

75
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,333
[YOJI] Listen.
My motto is you gotta live hard
and play even harder ...

76
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:31,633
And of course... probably eat
and sleep in between.

77
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,300
[YOJI] Besides... if we end up
going exactly where

78
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,200
we're supposed to, then the
threat will still be there.

79
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,966
[YOJI] We might as well go where
the people are,

80
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:40,333
there's more witnesses that way.

81
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:43,166
[RISA] Itami is right!
It's time to go shopping!

82
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,800
It's for our own safety!

83
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,266
[YOJI] Yeah something like that.

84
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:47,733
[RISA] Plus I'm sure you all
need

85
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,466
to replenish your fashion
supplies!

86
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:53,066
[RISA] Right?
[SHINO] Well, when in Tokyo
you might as well shop.

87
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,100
[BOSES] Uh...
[TOMITA] Hunh?
[BOSES] Actually...

88
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,400
[YOJI] And I'll do some recon
at the manga store.

89
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,000
[RISA] What?!?

90
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,100
[YOJI] SHUT! UP!

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,266
What about you?

92
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,733
[TOMITA] The ladies here...

93
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,300
they've asked to go to a
library...

94
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,133
to examine some documents.

95
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,233
[YOJI] Well, all right then.

96
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,966
Risa's team is going shopping.

97
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,266
And Tomita's team is going to a
library.

98
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:14,166
[YOJI] Right! It looks like
we've got our marching orders...

99
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,966
And at fourteen hundred we'll
meet up at Shinjuku Station

100
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,166
[YOJI] and head over to the hot
spring.

101
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,533
[RISA] All right! Woo!

102
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:21,633
Huh?

103
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:22,700
[YOJI] Rory...

104
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,066
Uh don't you wanna go shopping?

105
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,866
[RORY] I don't need to.

106
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,433
[RISA] You're going, right,
Tuka?

107
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,333
[YOJI] Do you want to go along
with them?

108
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:30,666
[TUKA] Yeah.

109
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:31,933
[RORY] I happen to be wearing

110
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,166
the formal apparel of Emroy's
Oracles...

111
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:37,166
Anything else would be an insult
to my Lord okay.

112
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,133
[RORY] Ahhhhhhhhh!

113
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,666
[RORY] Oh my God that's
gorgeous!

114
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,200
[GAL] May I help you, ladies?

115
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,366
[RISA] Wow! Ohhh... ohhohhoh!

116
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:57,033
[RISA] You're so cute I could
just eat you guys up!

117
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:59,433
[RORY] Really? You think so?

118
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:00,566
(giggles)

119
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,533
<amazed>

120
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05,833
[PINA] I cannot believe place
could exist

121
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,866
with so many books available to
anyone!

122
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,866
[BOSES] Miss...we're in a
different world.

123
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,233
[PINA] Oh yes of course.

124
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,166
[TOMITA] So...what kind of books
you looking for?

125
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,766
[BOTH] Slice of life!

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,133
[KANO] It's been 20 years

127
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,500
since we last stumbled into each
other.

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,366
[YOJI] Yeah.

129
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:32,866
[KANO] I'd just lost an election

130
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:34,700
and found myself lookin' for
work.

131
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,900
[YOJI] I was... in Junior High.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,166
[YOJI] So... you okay out
here?...

133
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:39,733
you should probably have
security.

134
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,166
[KANO] I don't need a guard.

135
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,700
I'm with the baddest badass
in Tokyo. Right?

136
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,533
[YOJI] I wouldn't really be
counting on me if I were you.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,966
[KANO] Heheh... You look fine to
me.

138
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,066
[YOJI] So do you, sir.

139
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,266
[KANO] That kid I knew is now
all grown up

140
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,200
and he's got a life of his own
now.

141
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,533
[YOJI] And that old honorable
politician has a cabinet job.

142
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:06,266
[KANO] "Honorable..." I'm not so
sure that fits me Itami.

143
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,666
[YOJI] I remember the time you
got me interested

144
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:09,800
in my very first manga...

145
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,000
[YOJI] We always found the time

146
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,133
to come here and talk about em.

147
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:16,066
[KANO] Glad I had someone to
share 'em with.

148
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,466
[KANO] And of course, I made
sure

149
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,533
to take a look at everything you
recommended.

150
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:23,400
[YOJI] Me too...
some of that old timey stuff has
a real heart to it.

151
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,366
[YOJI] Like the shootout in that
old ghost town

152
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:27,733
between the rugged old gunman
and the little kid...

153
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,566
That was beyond cool, man!

154
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,900
Bang!
[KANO] Better believe it...!
It's a classic!

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,600
[YOJI] Oh... got something here.

156
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,333
[YOJI] For you...

157
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,866
[KANO] You're a gem...

158
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:40,366
The "Honorable" Mister Kano
can't

159
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:43,133
go to manga shops anymore...it's
too risky.

160
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,433
(exhales)

161
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,466
There are far too many people
out there

162
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:51,366
who are looking for any way to
take advantage of this.

163
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:52,900
[KANO] Not to mention the ones

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,133
who're just interested in
joining the party.

165
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,200
[KANO] In reality I'm left in
the dark guessing

166
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,966
where our guests of honor went.

167
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,600
(laughs)

168
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,800
[KANO] So... are your visitors
enjoying Japan?

169
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,166
[YOJI] Yeah.

170
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,600
[KANO] That's good to hear.

171
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,000
[KANO] Well now that you've
given me the good news

172
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,133
like a good lad, I guess it's
time.

173
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,933
[KANO] Lieutenant Itami...

174
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,433
Stick to the operation plan...

175
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,833
you are to relocate to the
rendezvous point...

176
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:20,300
As Minister of Defense and as
the Minister assigned to the
Special Region

177
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,533
I'm ordering you there
immediately!

178
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:24,200
[YOJI] Yes, sir!

179
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:31,933
[RISA] I think I may have gone
overboard here.

180
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,500
[TUKA ] I found the most
beautiful bow.

181
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,066
[LELEI] Books are everything to
me.

182
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,766
[RORY] They actually have
tailors,

183
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:38,766
it's literally fit for an
apostle!

184
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,433
(sigh)

185
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,266
[YOJI] What is it?

186
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:46,233
[TOMITA] They said "slice of
life..."

187
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,166
So I showed them statues and art
and paintings and stuff.

188
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:53,366
[TOMITA] But I suppose, I didn't
actually understand.

189
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,566
[YOJI] Hm? I'm guessing the
slice of life those two were
looking for...

190
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,733
wasn't at a traditional library
was it?

191
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,600
[YOJI] Right! Let's head to
the hot spring everybody!

192
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,733
[ALL] Yeah...

193
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,100
[TOMITA] Yeah...

194
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,133
[RYUZAKI] Minister... Good
morning.

195
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:09,300
[KANO] Ah... good morning,
Colonel.

196
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,366
[RYUZAKI] Hello my name is
Colonel Ryuzaki...

197
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:13,133
I am the head of Special
Operations.

198
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,200
Good to meet you.

199
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,066
[KANO] Yes... pleasure's all
mine, Colonel.

200
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:23,500
[SOLDIER] Archer.
Three heat‐signatures bearing
three‐one‐five,

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,866
distance one‐five‐zero.

202
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:27,833
Designated Targets: Alpha One,
Two and Three.

203
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30,866
[ARCHER] Archer copy...
sighted Alpha One Two and Three.

204
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:32,833
[SOLDIER] Zero three ready...
copy?

205
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,500
[SOLDIER] Lancer...
Move to point Tango.

206
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,533
[SOLDIER] Archer.
Neutralize Targets: Alpha One,
Two and Three.

207
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:40,900
[KANO] Tell you what; it's a
little unsettling

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to see war all neat and tidy.

209
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,633
[RYUZAKI] It's a new world, sir,

210
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,100
fourth generation warfare
combines police and guerilla
tactics.

211
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,366
And it can be a delicate balance
between the two.

212
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:50,000
A great deal of it is contingent
on

213
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,966
how well prepared we are before
going in.

214
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,333
[KANO] Okay.

215
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,633
[RYUZAKI] And well, we've done
our homework.

216
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:56,700
Put it up on the screen.

217
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,366
[SOLDIER] Yes sir.

218
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:59,833
[RYUZAKI] This is Hotel Sankai.

219
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,633
A hot springs resort mostly
known

220
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,633
for its beautiful scenery...

221
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,400
[RYUZAKI] This is where
we'll be engaging today.

222
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,566
Ah... And they've just arrived.

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,933
[SOLDIER] Archer. Move to Point
Romeo.

224
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:24,733
Keep tracking your bogies.

225
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,600
[SOLDIER] Saber. Heat source
detected at Point Delta.
Check it out for us.

226
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,366
[RYUZAKI] We called in our
Elite Special Forces...

227
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:32,733
our tightest unit... the best of
the best.

228
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,833
[KANO] I heard Itami used to be
with them. Is that right?

229
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:38,300
[RYUZAKI] Yes. Yes, he was.

230
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,566
(breath catch)

231
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:47,233
[SHINO] Something wrong?

232
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,700
[RORY] Felt like I was being
watched.

233
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,966
[SHINO] Huh?!
[RISA] Wha‐?!

234
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,266
[SHINO] Lieutenant!
You little ingrate!

235
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,933
[SOLDIER] What's going on out
there Archer!

236
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,066
We just got a cardio‐spike.

237
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,733
[ARCHER] I just made eye contact
with Target Black.

238
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,233
Swear she looked right at me.

239
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,466
[SOLDIER] Negative, Archer.

240
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:11,266
Target Black is bearing 450
meters away.

241
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,400
[ARCHER] I know but
somehow she saw me.

242
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,633
And she had a sick look in her
eye.

243
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:18,700
This is not good... my
position's compromised.

244
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,266
[SOLDIER] Copy. Expedite your
move to Point: Kilo.

245
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:24,166
[SOLDIER] I'll have our inside
operator

246
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,666
keep an eye on the bath and the
locker rooms.

247
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,733
[TUKA] AAAaahaah!

248
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,033
[TUKA] How is all of the water
from the spring so hot?

249
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,333
[LELEI] I can honestly say

250
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,600
I've never seen this much hot
water before.

251
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,833
[PINA] They actually created an
indoor bathing pond!

252
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:40,000
With all of our magic

253
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,733
why have we never come up with
this?

254
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,466
[BOSES] Princess, we're in a
very different world.

255
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:45,833
[PINA] Yes I know.

256
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,466
[SHINO] Ehehehe! Cool, right?

257
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:53,800
[SHINO] Whoa hold up!
Demigod or not,
you gotta shower first!

258
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,233
[RORY] Let me go! Get off!

259
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,166
[RYUZAKI] Looks like they're all
there.

260
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,233
Informing all servants.
The Holy Grail has been filled.

261
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,200
I say again. The Holy Grail has
been filled.

262
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,433
(breath catch)

263
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,905
[YOJI] Phew. This is really...
nice.

264
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:38,105
[TOMITA] It sure... is.

265
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:41,435
[YOJI] And we're all alone.

266
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:43,368
[TOMITA] Yes, we are.

267
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:48,650
[TOMITA] Uh... Whoa whoa whoa,
easy sir!

268
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,583
[YOJI] Oh whatever get over
yourself!!!

269
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:52,183
[RISA] Hey, Kuribayashi?

270
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:54,116
I bet you got some good dirt
huh?

271
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:55,583
C'mon let's hear some gossip.

272
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:57,550
[SHINO] Well, lemme think
here...

273
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:01,283
Looks to me like Tomita's
got the hots for you girl...

274
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:03,116
[BOSES] Uh...? What do you mean?

275
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,516
[SHINO] What d'you think of him?

276
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:05,750
[BOSES] Well, I...

277
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,983
[SHINO] I'm sure
you've seen him staring?

278
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:10,516
[BOSES] Uh... That kind of thing

279
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:13,516
happening in the order is
absolutely forbidden...

280
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:14,883
And my lineage...

281
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:17,816
one's status must be considered
in such matters.

282
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,450
[PINA] Oh don't be such a stick
in the mud okay?!

283
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,250
[BOSES] But Princess Pina, I
can't!

284
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,050
[PINA] Well.
I am saying you can.

285
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,550
I've always been dying to know

286
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,550
what kind of man our little
Yellow Rose is into!

287
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,483
[BOSES] Oh God please forgive me
for what I'm about to say.

288
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,816
[RISA] Oo‐oooo!!!

289
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,516
This is totally the plot
of one of my stories!

290
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,516
[RORY] So tell me, Risa...

291
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:39,916
[RISA] Yeah? What is it?

292
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:42,316
[RORY] What's the story
with you and Itami?

293
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,550
[RISA] What do you mean?

294
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,550
[RORY] You split up.

295
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,616
[SHINO] Yeah, yeah!
What do you see in that guy?

296
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:49,816
Why would you even marry
a d‐bag like that?

297
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,116
[RISA] Well... He and I have
been good friends

298
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:53,716
since we were in junior high
school,

299
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:55,050
and... we know a lot of stuff

300
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,450
about each other
and our families.

301
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,016
[SHINO] Gotta be more than that.

302
00:13:58,116 --> 00:13:59,250
[RISA] I was in a rough spot.

303
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,716
And the SDF gave him a steady
income...

304
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:02,483
and that sorta looked like the
chance

305
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,683
that both of us needed.

306
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:05,250
[RISA] So then I told him...!

307
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,016
You have a job so take care of
me.

308
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:08,816
And we can get married.

309
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,683
[SHINO] Well okay then.
Why get divorced?

310
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,316
[RISA] The whole thing with
Ginza was pretty intense,
y'know.

311
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,450
[SHINO] Mm‐hmm.

312
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,850
[RISA] I found out he was
going...

313
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,850
and that he had actually
volunteered for the job.

314
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,083
[RISA] When I asked about it,
he said if anything happened

315
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:25,083
insurance would take care of me.

316
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:28,016
God... I thought to myself
he really doesn't get it.

317
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:32,116
[RISA] He doesn't care what I
think... or anyone else for that
matter.

318
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,183
[RORY] And that's the reason you
got divorced.

319
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:39,283
[RISA] Figured a fresh start

320
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:41,116
was the best thing for us both.

321
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:42,450
(gasp)!

322
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,450
[ARCHER] Archer here... I've got
visual on my target, over.

323
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,950
[SOLDIER] Action 03. Copy?
[ARCHER] Roger.

324
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,116
[KANO] Gotta give you guys some
credit... and Itami did this?

325
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:55,016
[RYUZAKI] Y'see...
not all of our members
have a combat background.

326
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:59,116
Some in special operations are
recruited because of "special"
abilities.

327
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:00,383
[KANO] And what are those?

328
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,416
[RYUZAKI] Well... he's kinda
uniquely adept

329
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:04,216
at getting himself out of
trouble.

330
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:05,783
Whether it's danger or
responsibility

331
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:08,050
he somehow finds
his way out of it.

332
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,050
[KANO] So you're telling me
that he's so good at

333
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,216
avoiding and evading things that
he can't be caught.

334
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:15,516
Or are our Special Forces
really that bad?

335
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,550
[YOJI] Waaughh!!! I wanna stay
here till the end of the year!

336
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,650
I wanna forget about work
and get all wrinkly in the bath!
I don't wanna go...

337
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,516
[TOMITA] And we both know you
can't...

338
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,116
[YOJI] Tomita!

339
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:25,983
[TOMITA] Right!

340
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:30,950
(annoyed sounds)

341
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,316
[SHINO] (drunken) Okay, guys!

342
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,116
You better get your asses
in formation pronto!!!

343
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:35,716
[RORY] (drunken) Asses, NOW!

344
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:37,783
[BOTH] Huh?!

345
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,316
[SOLDIER] Enemy group Alpha
casualties

346
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,883
are now over ten... They're
falling back.

347
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,783
[SOLDIER] Group Bravo is
retreating now.

348
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:47,283
[SOLDIER] Group Charlie is still
holding position.

349
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:48,383
[KANO] Whatever those
guys're doing

350
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:49,950
it's not very goddamn bright.

351
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,616
They know we're waiting for 'em,
do they want an invitation?

352
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:55,750
[RYUZAKI] Either they didn't
expect our defenses
to be this good...

353
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,583
or we've got at least three
different forces out there, sir.

354
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:00,750
[KANO] Well I don't have any
idea what they're doing...

355
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,516
no one's declaring any
intention.

356
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:06,316
[KANO] Tch! Can you figure out
who they belong to...

357
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,516
'fore it gets worse?

358
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:10,416
We have no idea
what we're up against.

359
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:14,583
[SABER] Looks like Kryptek's
latest camouflage...

360
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,716
Pretty high end for a buncha
guys playing Airsoft.

361
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:18,216
[LANCER] Other than the guns,

362
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:19,783
you can get the rest of this
stuff in Akiba.

363
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:21,383
[SABER] Seriously?

364
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,083
[RYUZAKI] Light 'em up
if you need to.

365
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,350
But only briefly.

366
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:30,183
[SABER] Saber here... Americans.

367
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:32,150
One white, one black.

368
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,716
[KANO] Get me Motoi on the line!

369
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:36,983
[MOTOI] How did this get into
your possession?

370
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,016
[DIRRELL] A better question
might be how did

371
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:41,416
we manage to get it before one
of your rivals?

372
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:43,616
According to the folks who dug
this up for us...

373
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:45,916
your party is nuts deep in
corrupt contributions...

374
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:49,116
There're a lot of companies on
the naughty list Mr Motoi.

375
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,950
[MOTOI] Uh thank you.... for
letting me know.

376
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,116
[DIRRELL] Oh no, Just one friend
helping out another.

377
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:58,516
But now, I need you to give me a
little help, in return.

378
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:00,083
[MOTOI] What kind of
"help" exactly.

379
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:01,583
[DIRRELL] I just happen to know
that

380
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:03,650
you have some guests in Tokyo
from the Special Region.

381
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,316
I would just love to show 'em
around Washington for a couple
of days.

382
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,583
[MOTOI] Ahhh... I understand...

383
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:11,216
I'd be happy to
pass on your invitation...

384
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:12,850
[DIRRELL] Uh, not quite. What I
mean is

385
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,516
I'd like to have our agents meet
with them directly.

386
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:17,916
[DIRRELL] Now I know your guards
are pretty good.

387
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:19,916
So in the name of 'friendship'
whaddya say

388
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,383
you let your boys take a little
break for awhile?

389
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:23,550
[MOTOI] "Friendship"?

390
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,883
[DIRRELL] Absolutely.

391
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,283
[MOTOI] Here's the thing...

392
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:28,883
I can promise to tell

393
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,683
the security force watching them
to simply forego their duties.

394
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:33,416
[MOTOI] But what happens
if they refuse...

395
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:34,916
if our guests decide they don't

396
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:36,850
want to go to Washington with
your men, it's not on me.

397
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,216
[DIRRELL] I wouldn't do
that to you 'ol pal!

398
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:41,550
But my guys're pretty good, too.

399
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:47,583
[KANO] We're done?!
You want us to stop the mission
just like that?

400
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:48,783
What is going on here Motoi?!

401
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:51,216
[MOTOI] I need you to be
patient, Kano.

402
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:52,616
There's nothing
I can do about it ‐

403
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:54,483
when they have this much
information

404
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,383
about this many Cabinet members.

405
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:57,916
[KANO] Yes but still..!

406
00:17:58,016 --> 00:18:00,916
[MOTOI] I only promised
to stop the security detail.

407
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:05,083
I didn't promise to allow
them to take custody
or even leave the country.

408
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,150
(exhales, disgusted)

409
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,750
[MOTOI] Think about it this way.

410
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,416
I step down...
The Cabinet steps down with me.

411
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:12,383
The Americans will have nothing.
Nothing of value.

412
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:17,616
[KANO] But Motoi...
you'll never be able to run for
office again if you do that!

413
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:19,150
[MOTOI] It is what it is.

414
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,383
If I'm going to do this,

415
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:22,283
let's make it one for the
history books.

416
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:23,483
(exhale)

417
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,383
[MOTOI] And one other thing,
my friend.

418
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:29,416
Japan needs you... more than me.

419
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,483
[KANO] Stupid bastard...

420
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,983
[YOJI] Um...uhhhh...

421
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,583
[YOJI] This... is not my room.

422
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:56,250
[YOJI] Guess we had
a good time last night.

423
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,283
[YOJI] Ehhh! What the...!

424
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:59,683
(snore)

425
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,416
[YOJI] Nice right hook, sarge.

426
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,716
[ice clinking in glass]

427
00:19:03,816 --> 00:19:05,116
<sigh>

428
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,416
(giggle)

429
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:17,850
(grabbed)

430
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,483
(snoozy sounds)

431
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,483
[YOJI] It's really too bad you
know.

432
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:32,983
I bet you would've been quite
the knockout in your twenties.

433
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,650
[RORY] In another thirty years I
will leave this body...

434
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,216
And I'll make myself look
however I please...

435
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:45,516
But by that time... I'll have
lost the desires and pleasures
of the flesh.

436
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,850
[RORY] Ahhh...!

437
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,616
[YOJI] Uhhh?

438
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:55,783
[RORY] There's a battle
going on out there...

439
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:58,483
and I feel that they're
extremely close.

440
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,683
Because of all the bloodshed,
I just can't sleep.

441
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,816
You need to do something about
it.

442
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,416
[YOJI] I'm... not sure what
you're getting... at. Huh?

443
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:10,083
[RORY] My urges are in limbo ...

444
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:13,583
I need you to let me kill
them...

445
00:20:13,683 --> 00:20:16,983
[RORY] Or... you are going to
have to satisfy me instead!

446
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,716
[YOJI] Satisfy you... uh...

447
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,450
[RAMIREZ] It's an ambush!

448
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,683
[HEIDEGGER] Ramirez!
Watch yer muzzle flash!

449
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:31,016
Shit these SFGs are really
something else!

450
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:33,650
I was in Force Recon and I can't
even touch 'em!

451
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,050
[CHUCK] Just worry about
keeping your head down
Heidegger.

452
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,050
[GOLDMAN] Mike!
[CHUCK] Goldman, what
happened to Mike, is he okay?

453
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,616
[GOLDMAN] No sir... son of a
bitch got 'em with a head shot.

454
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:45,516
[ROGER] Shit...! I thought these
freakin guys were amateurs!

455
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:47,350
[HEIDEGGER] I've never
seen such precision...

456
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,650
we gotta get the hell out!

457
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,450
[CHUCK] Screw that.
We're not running away.

458
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,583
[RYUZAKI] The Grail is broken. I
say again...

459
00:20:57,683 --> 00:21:00,016
[RYUZAKI] The Holy Grail is
broken.

460
00:21:00,116 --> 00:21:01,516
All operators abort the mission

461
00:21:01,616 --> 00:21:04,350
and make your way to the
extraction point.

462
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:06,383
[CHUCK] Roger.

463
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,616
Right... Nothing's changed,

464
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,083
we're still doing the pickup.

465
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:10,550
[CHUCK] Now quit being bitches.

466
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,516
We have a job to do.

467
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:12,983
[ROGER] Are you kidding...

468
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,483
after getting our ass shot off?!

469
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,550
[HEIDEGGER] Cut the bullshit,
Roger...

470
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,950
it's still hot out here.

471
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,550
[HEIDEGGER] And you need to take
it easy too Chuck.

472
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,616
As long as their negotiating
got worked out we'll be fine.

473
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:24,683
Let's go!

474
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,483
(giggle) <breathing> (aroused
sound)

475
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,783
No no wait wait wait! We have
some morals in this country,

476
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,316
and some Child Safety Laws you
know?!

477
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,216
I mean I shouldn't even be
thinking

478
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:46,250
of doing this sorta stuff with
you!

479
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,383
[RORY] Really? I'm a child, am
I?

480
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:50,683
Sure about that?

481
00:21:50,783 --> 00:21:53,050
[YOJI] No uh, well uh...
you sure look young.

482
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,616
[RORY] Are you positive?

483
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:57,216
[YOJI] (aroused/hating it)
Seriously!

484
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,750
We really just... shouldn't!

485
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:07,016
[RORY] I don't believe you...

486
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:08,350
So tell me...am I a child?

487
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,616
(fighting temptation)

488
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,216
[LELEI] Next time on "GATE:"

489
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:49,683
Hope and Despair
