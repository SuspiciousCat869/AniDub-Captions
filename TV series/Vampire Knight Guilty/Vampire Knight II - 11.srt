00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:10,066
ZERO (VOICEOVER): If at any
time I lose the human part of me

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,133
and go out of control, use this.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,033
-Zero.

--[laughing] Fighting amongst
themselves for control

6
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:07,568
and power.

7
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:11,537
That is the true
nature of vampires.

8
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:24,871
ZERO (VOICEOVER): But as long as
Rido exists, he will not stop.

9
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:27,304
He will keep coming
to devour her.

10
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:40,437
You want to pretend like
you haven't noticed,

11
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:43,904
what you have so willingly
taken inside yourself,

12
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,171
has begun to pulsate.

13
00:02:58,937 --> 00:02:59,404
-Ichiru.

14
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:09,204
-The time has come, Zero.

15
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:19,971
-Rima.

16
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:37,404
I heard you.

17
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:40,804
When you called out to me
back there, I heard it.

18
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:44,937
-Idiot, letting someone
take over your body.

19
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:47,237
What are you doing?

20
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:49,271
You really need to
love yourself, Senri.

21
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:54,337
-Thank you, Rima.

22
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,937
-You're such a pain in the neck.

23
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:08,512
Perfect.

24
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:18,637
I've got a bad feeling.

25
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,104
-Something strange has
entered the Academy.

26
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:24,537
-Is the man who possessed
your body behind it?

27
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:26,137
-Probably.

28
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:27,037
-Where's Takuma?

29
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,537
-He has gone to do
what has to be done?

30
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:17,137
-Ruka, are you all right?

31
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:18,204
-Yes.

32
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:18,704
-Ah!

33
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:27,471
-I only get attacked by men,
that's not nearly as much fun.

34
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:28,671
-Hanabusa.

35
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,071
-I believe your job is
to protect Princess Yuki.

36
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:35,571
-Uh, yeah, she seems
to have disappeared.

37
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:37,171
-How did you let that happen?

38
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,704
You realize that she's
the one they're after?

39
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:44,371
-The dorm president is going
to kill you for sure this time.

40
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:46,337
-Listen, don't worry.

41
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:47,604
It's all gonna work out.

42
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:50,004
-And just what
makes you so sure?

43
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:52,704
-Because the enemy
is a pureblood.

44
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:56,704
If he's really serious, he
won't just keep attacking us.

45
00:05:56,737 --> 00:06:00,404
What I'm trying to say is he's
either totally underestimated

46
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:03,571
our strength, or--

47
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:05,704
-You think that he's got
something bigger in store.

48
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:13,404
-Today, we're celebrating
my resurrection.

49
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,737
Ensure yourselves.

50
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,104
Don't hold anything back.

51
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:26,937
-I don't believe it.

52
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,971
The crowd keeps coming.

53
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:30,637
That aura.

54
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:31,571
It's him.

55
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:38,771
-What's going on?

56
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:40,104
-Why can't we go--

57
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:41,471
-Silence!

58
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:45,771
No on is leaving this hall until
the headmaster says we can.

59
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:48,204
I am just as in the
dark on this as you are.

60
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:55,737
-May I help you,
Association President?

61
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:59,271
-That's a very dangerous
weapon you have there.

62
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:02,304
I believe you once vowed never
to carry that thing again.

63
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:08,271
-I'll do whatever is necessary
to protect my students.

64
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:13,271
-All I want is for you to
hand Zero Kiryu over to us.

65
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:16,104
-Sorry, I won't do that.

66
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:17,637
-I see.

67
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,637
Fine then.

68
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:32,837
That was very foolish.

69
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:35,871
You just wasted
your last chance.

70
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:37,504
Now, say hello to hell.

71
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:47,104
-Sorry, but I'll
decide my own fate.

72
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:56,537
-We come together, and
then we take what we want.

73
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:58,971
That is what vampires do.

74
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:12,071
So many are coming,
all to congratulate me.

75
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:18,704
Those people and
those people too.

76
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:22,071
Won't you be coming as well?

77
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:28,137
I so want to be entertained
by you, Zero and Ichiru Kiryu.

78
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:34,771
-The time has come.

79
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,871
You must play the part
you are meant to play.

80
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:39,471
This is why I let you live.

81
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:41,804
It's all been for Yuki.

82
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,804
-Ichiru, you're not--

83
00:08:59,337 --> 00:08:59,804
-Zero.

84
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:26,071
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I know
the smell of this blood.

85
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:33,937
That's Zero.

86
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:50,974
-You're becoming a problem.

87
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,899
I'm guessing you want to
go and see Zero, correct?

88
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,166
-Kaname, I just--

89
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:07,499
-Zero is in the process
of resurrecting himself.

90
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:11,466
I did it to protect you, Yuki.

91
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:13,166
-What are you talking about?

92
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:20,232
Rido Kuran.

93
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:22,799
-In order to protect
you from that man,

94
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:25,566
I'm afraid that I
had to use Zero.

95
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:27,032
There's more.

96
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,899
I also killed Shizuka Hio.

97
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,799
Please, forgive me, Yuki.

98
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:45,732
In trying to protect you, all
I've done is hurt you the most.

99
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:50,399
Sorry.

100
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:03,599
-Why were we born
as separate beings?

101
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:11,399
I wanted to be born
as one with you, Zero.

102
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:15,632
If I knew I'd be born
incomplete like this.

103
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:20,266
I just-- I'm sorry.

104
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:24,299
-Ow, you made me hit my head.

105
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:25,799
-I'm sorry, Ichiru.

106
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,299
I'm so sorry.

107
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,266
-It was only a little bump.

108
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:31,199
There's no need to
apologize, Zero.

109
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,166
It isn't that bad.

110
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:37,666
ICHIRU (VOICEOVER): I
know, yet I say this to him

111
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:41,632
because I know how
Zero will react.

112
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,966
I felt I could be Zero's
other half only in moments

113
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:49,166
when I hurt him.

114
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,899
You already realize it, Zero.

115
00:11:57,332 --> 00:12:00,832
ZERO (VOICEOVER): I don't
know what to do, Ichiru.

116
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:03,499
Even if I understand
how Ichiru feels,

117
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:07,066
I don't know what
I can do for him.

118
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:11,066
Or what I should do for him.

119
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:14,232
Ichiru has been
sickly since birth,

120
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:20,799
and it's probably-- I stole
something from my other half

121
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:22,699
while we were in
our mother's womb.

122
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:24,699
I stole it and made it mine.

123
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:29,432
-Zero?

124
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:32,066
Hey, what are you
thinking about?

125
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,466
Shall I guess what it is?

126
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,832
You get too worked up.

127
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,499
You're never going to become
a cool strong hunter acting

128
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,699
like this.

129
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:47,599
Zero, there are things
we can't tell each other

130
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:50,399
because you and I are so close.

131
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:55,732
-That's why, little by little,
little by little, the wheel

132
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,232
starts to turn.

133
00:12:57,266 --> 00:13:02,032
-Ichiru, you haven't
taken your medicine yet.

134
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,099
It's all right.

135
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:06,032
For some reason, I seem
to feel much better

136
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:07,332
when you're with me, Zero.

137
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,999
-I made up my mind to do
whatever Ichiru wanted.

138
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:16,532
-I'm home.

139
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,632
Sorry for being late.

140
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,366
Sleep well, Ichiru.

141
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,399
Sleep well, Zero.

142
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,799
ZERO (VOICEOVER):
Stop it, Mother.

143
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:34,899
The love that mother gives
us equally belongs to Ichiru.

144
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:39,366
Let Ichiru have her love,
because I stole his ability

145
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,366
to become a hunter.

146
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,332
And I--

147
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:53,266
-Zero, don't let
your mind wander.

148
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,932
Look at me.

149
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,299
You've meekly allowed
yourself to be imprisoned.

150
00:13:58,332 --> 00:13:59,899
You were always
demeaning yourself

151
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:01,766
back when we were kids.

152
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,266
Is this how you
atone for your sins?

153
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:06,932
You couldn't
possibly have thought

154
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:09,832
your acts were of
comfort to me, could you?

155
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,599
The only thing your
actions have done

156
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:16,232
is force me to realize that
you would have been free

157
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:19,666
if I had never existed at all.

158
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:24,032
However, this is no consolation
for having Shizuka taken away

159
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:24,999
from me.

160
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,066
-Don't worry.

161
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:31,999
My naive pursuit of
atonement is long gone now.

162
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:36,399
I let it go when I saw
you smiling that night.

163
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:42,399
How could you smile at the
murder of mother and father?

164
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:53,366
-So then, are you about
to lose control now?

165
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,666
Just so you know, I didn't
wish for them to die.

166
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,266
Our parents were
the ones who hunted

167
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,666
and killed Shizuka's lover.

168
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,066
Her lover also happened
to be a former human.

169
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:07,332
He had yet to fall to a
level E, but still his name

170
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,699
was on the hunters'
execution list.

171
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:12,599
Our parents were not at fault.

172
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:16,899
They were just following
orders, but when Shizuka told me

173
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:20,999
what happened, I was disgusted.

174
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:25,799
On the day they executed
Shizuka's lover,

175
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:29,999
they held us with the same
arms they killed with.

176
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:32,532
ICHIRU'S FATHER: We have to
report it to the Society,

177
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:35,466
that Ichiru is unfit to
become a vampire hunter.

178
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,299
ICHIRU'S MOTHER: You're right.

179
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:42,999
Ultimately, Ichiru won't
be able to stay with Zero.

180
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:45,799
-And I found it painful that
they looked at me from time

181
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:50,732
to time with the eyes of the
Association's watch dogs.

182
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:55,032
-Ichiru, one last question.

183
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:59,799
Why are you hurt so badly?

184
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:05,032
-All I wanted was to
fulfill Shizuka's wish.

185
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:08,366
He was my only target.

186
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,266
The one who imprisoned
Shizuka and interfered

187
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:17,866
with the execution
list, Rido Kuran.

188
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,066
-Shall I ask you just
why you're doing this?

189
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:23,599
-I'm here to
retaliate for Shizuka,

190
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,932
whose life was ruined
because of you.

191
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:28,232
I wanted to deliver
the final blow.

192
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,932
That's why I've been here this
whole time eagerly awaiting

193
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:33,766
your resurrection.

194
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,566
-Flee.

195
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:37,732
I have no use for the weak.

196
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:48,099
-Even though I did all I
could, I knew that in the end

197
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,299
I couldn't do much.

198
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:56,199
I'm so useless.

199
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:59,699
Was there anything else
that I wanted to say?

200
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,432
-Ichiru.

201
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:06,999
-I-- I feel so sick.

202
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:10,066
This place reeks of our blood.

203
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,566
It must be tempting
for you, Zero.

204
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,999
I'm surprised you're still sane.

205
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:25,499
You've become a different being
now, but for whatever reason,

206
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:29,432
I still feel
comfortable next to you.

207
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:37,232
It's proof-- proof that
we were once one embryo.

208
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:42,766
Zero, I want you to devour
what remains of my life.

209
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,099
-What are you saying?

210
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,899
-You already know.

211
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,699
If you devour me, you
can regain the powers

212
00:17:49,732 --> 00:17:52,399
you were meant to have at birth.

213
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:54,632
Then you'll be able
to control yourself.

214
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,499
You can control those urges.

215
00:17:56,532 --> 00:17:57,966
-I won't.

216
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:01,832
I can't do something like that.

217
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:04,932
-Yes, you will.

218
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,199
it was meant to be.

219
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:09,866
Why do you think I shot
you with a bloody rose?

220
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:11,132
You have to, Zero.

221
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,732
-I won't do it.

222
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:14,132
Please, don't die.

223
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,932
I don't want to
lose anybody else.

224
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:22,432
-Hearing that,
makes me so happy.

225
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:26,366
I thought I was
already dead to you.

226
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,366
-Maria wanted to
see you, as well.

227
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,232
-She did, huh?

228
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:35,666
-Father and mother, they
watched over you too,

229
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,366
and they did love you.

230
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:40,266
I promise.

231
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,666
-I know, Zero.

232
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:46,032
You don't have to
forgive Shizuka,

233
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:50,266
but don't hold a
grudge against her.

234
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,832
Shizuka, she truly cherished me.

235
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,899
I know she did.

236
00:18:55,932 --> 00:19:00,299
That's why I don't regret
what's happened to me.

237
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:01,199
And soon--

238
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:02,732
-Ichiru.

239
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,032
I can't do this.

240
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:05,766
It's wrong.

241
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,932
-Is it really?

242
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:12,999
If that's what you truly
believe, then live.

243
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:16,732
Live, Zero, and
do what I cannot.

244
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:19,366
Live, Zero, do it for me!

245
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:48,799
-If I gave the rest of my life
so that Yuki could have hers,

246
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:50,299
I'd have no regrets.

247
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:07,932
-Soon I will become
one with Zero again.

248
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:25,399
-Ahhh!

249
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,632
-What's wrong, Zero?

250
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,732
I Come on out.

251
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,832
I want to play.

252
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,966
If you don't hurry
that Kuran princess--

253
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:47,332
-I can't do this.

254
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:48,566
This is wrong.

255
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:54,299
-If that's what you
truly believe, then live.

256
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,299
Live Zero.

257
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:18,399
-The time has come.

258
00:21:18,432 --> 00:21:22,266
I must go and do what I must do.

259
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:26,532
And you, Yuki, must
do what you must do.

260
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:15,666
-Lord Kaname.

261
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:22,466
-Believe what you
will, your turn

262
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:28,432
will come next, Zero Kiryu.

263
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:35,688
