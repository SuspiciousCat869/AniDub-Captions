KANAME (VOICEOVER): Every
era must come to a close.

2
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:17,466
Burdened by the weighted
of its own ugliness,

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,900
that world is reduced
to ash, washed away

4
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:25,733
in a sea of fiery red.

5
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,233
YOUNG YUKI: Isn't
it pretty, Kaname?

6
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:31,366
Can we touch a sunset?

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,500
Or maybe it would
be too hot to touch.

8
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:36,533
Is that what it is, Kaname?

9
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:38,500
-Yes, it's too hot.

10
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:41,066
-Well, maybe I could just try
and touch it a little bit,

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,166
then.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,833
I mean, why wouldn't
you want to touch it?

13
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:45,800
It's so pretty.

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,233
-Yuki, I desperately
want to tell you

15
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:56,366
that what is beautiful
is not this world

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,633
but rather the way in
which your eyes see it.

17
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:04,100
That is what's truly beautiful.

18
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,600
[theme music]

19
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:45,836
And you, Yuki, must
do what you must do.

20
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:50,264
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
What I must do.

21
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:58,497
-I want you to be
the one to kill me.

22

[screaming]

23
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:13,430
-Hey, what are you doing?

24
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,630
Why didn't you try to use
your Artemis Rod on them?

25
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:21,830
-I can't use that right now.

26
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:23,064
-Huh?

27
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:25,030
-Well, then it's
best you stay hidden.

28
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:27,630
After all, you've
only just awakened.

29
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:30,330
Trying to fight right
now is reckless and rash.

30
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:32,830
-That may be true, but
still I want to fight.

31
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:35,397
-Fine, then let me put
it to you another way.

32
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,064
Princess Yuki, I
implore you, please

33
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:39,830
stop behaving with
such petulance.

34
00:03:39,864 --> 00:03:41,230
It is not helping.

35
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,164
-Ruka, I didn't mean to.

36
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:46,997
-Our master has given us orders.

37
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,330
We are to protect you from
Rido Kuran at all costs.

38
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:55,530
-Yuki, I do not want to
see any ugliness reflected

39
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:57,130
in your eyes.

40
00:03:57,164 --> 00:04:01,597
Rido Kuran's awakening has
set in motion the most violent

41
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,397
of atrocities.

42
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,030
-You taste like trash.

43
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:13,130
I really should
have expected this.

44
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:15,330
Cheap blood doesn't
do it for me.

45
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:20,297
There is only one thing I
will find truly satisfying.

46
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:24,164
And Juri, that is the
taste of your blood.

47
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,130
-Just let me go, please.

48
00:04:27,164 --> 00:04:30,197
KANAME (VOICEOVER): If a vampire
tries to attack a pureblood,

49
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,697
their powers will become sealed.

50
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,464
That's why in order
to protect Yuki,

51
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:41,830
it was necessary for me to
create a pawn to oppose it,

52
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,464
someone who would
never betray her.

53
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:48,464
My plan progressed perfectly.

54
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,430
Everything was on track.

55
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:55,730
But then, for the
first time, my heart

56
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:58,964
was overwhelmed with
an intolerable pain.

57
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:02,864
-You are the focus of Rido
Kuran's objective, princess.

58
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:05,764
Please, do as we ask
and leave here at once.

59
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:06,930
-I understand.

60
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:08,830
But that's exactly why I--

61
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:10,664
-Will you please stop this?

62
00:05:10,697 --> 00:05:12,230
Look at the state
you're in right now.

63
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:13,564
You aren't even--

64
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:16,330
-This is going to be a
long, difficult battle.

65
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:18,164
-Hanabusa.

66
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:20,130
-You do know what you're
getting into, right?

67
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:25,964
[gunfire]

68
00:05:25,997 --> 00:05:29,164
-It's from the main gate.

69
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:31,930
-This is a losing
proposition-- trying

70
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:35,130
to keep Yuki Cross
from getting hurt.

71
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:37,630
-I disagree.

72
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:40,430
If someone Lord Kaname
cares about gets hurt,

73
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,797
then he's going
to suffer as well.

74
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,930
And the last thing I want is
to see Lord Kaname suffer.

75
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,164
-Well, if that's the
case, then perhaps

76
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:51,530
the person I should
be protecting

77
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,630
is Dorm President Kuran.

78
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:54,130
-Akatsuki?

79
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:03,397
[gunfire]

80
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,530
-Damn, out of ammo.

81
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,564
I should have brought
my sword instead.

82
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,664
-Mr. Yagari.

83
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:23,930
-Well, well, you know when your
teacher's getting beaten up,

84
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:27,130
the least you can do
is get here sooner.

85
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:28,097
-Are you all right?

86
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,564
Did you get hurt?

87
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,297
-Just who are they?

88
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,530
-They're ours.

89
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:35,264
It's one of the Hunters'
Associations dirty secrets.

90
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:37,630
They breed their own Level E's.

91
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,597
They're here now.

92
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,030
-Headmaster?

93
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:48,797
-Sorry that I'm a little late.

94
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,564
So tell me, are
they back yet, Yuki?

95
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:57,064
The memories that you have
of Juri, your real mother.

96
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:59,564
Very well.

97
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:02,097
Everyone, protect Yuki.

98
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,097
Or rather, Cross Academy.

99
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:08,997
This is as far as
I'll allow you to go.

100
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:23,230
Leave these ones to me.

101
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:25,097
-No, that's crazy.

102
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,430
-He can't take on that
many of them alone.

103
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:29,930
-Headmaster.

104
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:34,464
-It's not Headmaster.

105
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,597
It's father.

106
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,897
-You're right, father.

107
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:46,630
Father, no!

108
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:56,697
-Your father sure is
one crazy old man.

109
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,064
-Everything he's done is
to protect this Academy.

110
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:03,930
Let's go.

111
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:06,430
Let's find Rido Kuran.

112
00:08:06,464 --> 00:08:07,930
-Are you sure?

113
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:09,797
-This is not a matter
of what I want.

114
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,197
This is a matter of what
I have to do in order

115
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,764
to protect this Academy.

116
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,830
-You may not be blood related,
but you are his daughter.

117
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:23,964
You're just as stubborn
and reckless as he is.

118
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,297
Don't worry.

119
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,197
I won't let the old
man fight alone.

120
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:33,364
-You guys are way late.

121
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:35,164
-Have you found Rido?

122
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:37,197
-We didn't even need to look.

123
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,930
He has really bad taste.

124
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:44,064
-He is just way too obvious.

125
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:47,397
ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT:
Sir Ichijo-- blood, I

126
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,764
have come to get blood.

127
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,030
-Oh?

128
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:55,030
And just what do you have
to offer me in return?

129
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:59,230
-Well, Kaien Cross is
a very obstinate man,

130
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:02,197
but I'm doing my best
to force him to comply.

131
00:09:05,364 --> 00:09:07,730
I've ordered every Level
E the Association has

132
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:10,330
to descend upon that Academy.

133
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:12,530
It's just a matter of time
before it's completely

134
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:14,130
destroyed.

135
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:16,130
-Very well then.

136
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:19,030
-Sir Ichijo, my reward.

137
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,897
-There's no need to rush.

138
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,130
-But I need the
vampire blood now.

139
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:25,930
It's the only way a
human can rejuvenate.

140
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:27,497
Sir Ichijo, please.

141
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,797
This was the agreement.

142
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,230
This is what you promised,
my chance at eternal beauty.

143
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:35,730
-You sold out your friends
for your own personal gain.

144
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:39,264
A person like you has nothing
in common with beauty,

145
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:43,118
nor do you have any right
to ask for blood when

146
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:44,118
you are just a human.

147
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:49,351
-Blood, blood-- hurry.

148
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:51,618
-You disgust me.

149
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,718
[cracking]

150
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,485
-Wow, bummer.

151
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:24,551
-That smell has--

152
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:42,818
-I've been waiting
for you, Juri.

153
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:49,718
You've grown to be
so beautiful, Yuki.

154
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,951
-What are you--

155
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:56,751
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
You've become so strong

156
00:10:56,785 --> 00:11:00,751
and refined that it's blinding.

157
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,385
MALE SPEAKER: Lord Kaname--

158
00:11:03,418 --> 00:11:04,818
-I'm sorry, Kaname.

159
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:10,818
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
You've made me happy.

160
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:14,951
nothing has given me more
joy than seeing you grown up.

161
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:15,985
Thank you.

162
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:18,218
-We need to report
this to Lord Ichijo.

163
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:23,085
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
Fly high, Yuki.

164
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:28,418
And no matter how
far you fly away,

165
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:32,051
you will always be
the most precious girl

166
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,218
in the world to me.

167
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:44,432
-I'm so glad you came, Juri.

168
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:47,571
Are you ready to
become one with me?

169
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:50,932
-You'll have to come
through us first.

170
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:52,852
-And we'll reduce you to ash.

171
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,991
-Such fools.

172
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:02,252
-Why can't I use--

173
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,852
-You are all vampires.

174
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:06,952
You cannot lay a
hand on a pureblood.

175
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:12,952
This is a special
night, and I don't

176
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:15,552
want to ruin it by behaving
like a selfish cad.

177
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:18,552
So why don't you guys
have a bit of fun now?

178
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:27,586
-No!

179
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:28,552
That's enough.

180
00:12:28,586 --> 00:12:29,552
Rido, stop.

181
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:36,352
Let go of me!

182
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:40,019
-You know, you smell
exactly like Juri did.

183
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:40,486
-No!

184
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:58,619
YUKI (VOICEOVER): At this rate,
what I-- what I must do is--

185
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,052
-Let her be!

186
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,686
-Artemis, it worked!

187
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:17,286
-But how is a pureblood
princess able to wield

188
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:18,786
a vampire hunter's weapon?

189
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:23,286
-You see, I am a guardian.

190
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:27,819
And no matter what, I will
protect this Academy, and not

191
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:30,352
just the day class students.

192
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:34,986
I am here to protect the
night class students as well.

193
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,686
-That's the Juri I know.

194
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:40,352
No wait, that's Juri's daughter.

195
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,852
-And as for the rest of you,
step away from those students

196
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:43,386
right now.

197
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:54,752
-You seem to have a lot
more pluck than Juri did.

198
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:58,652
Juri was a lot more
docile than you are.

199
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:02,852
Indeed, the very first time
I had a taste of her blood--

200
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,452
-Let go of her!

201
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:17,419
This has gone far enough.

202
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:19,819
I won't--

203
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:20,352
-Hanabusa!

204
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:25,186
-Come on, cry out for help.

205
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:27,386
It's all right.

206
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:29,119
Juri cried for help too.

207
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:31,086
She begged for
someone to save her

208
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:33,019
when I first drank her blood.

209
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:37,019
Muffled by her tears, she
pleaded for Haruka to save her.

210
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,186
It was absolutely brilliant.

211
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:39,819
-What are you--

212
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:43,952
-Give it a try.

213
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:46,952
Call out the name
of the one you love.

214
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,952
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
The one I love?

215
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:51,419
[gunfire]

216
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:03,852
-Zero.

217
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,252
-Get your filthy hands
off of her right now.

218
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:29,086
-Where are you going?

219
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,786
-I was thinking I
would try and escape

220
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:38,252
while I still had the chance.

221
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:39,119
-I see.

222
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:40,452
A wise move.

223
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,352
-It would be a little
premature to turn me

224
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:44,919
into ash at this juncture.

225
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:46,652
-If you're going
to find your god,

226
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:48,619
I think it's safe to
say that he's already

227
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:51,719
been torn to shreds by the beast
that I have so carefully been

228
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:52,952
nurturing.

229
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,152
-God, is it?

230
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:56,719
-What's the matter?

231
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:59,452
Did you not find me
suitable for your purposes?

232
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,019
-That wasn't the case at all.

233
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:03,819
The only reason we didn't choose
you was because you're a person

234
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:04,686
we cannot control.

235
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:10,352
Rido Kuran is nothing
more than a fool.

236
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,686
As long as you manage to satisfy
his appetite, controlling him

237
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,619
is rather easy.

238
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:16,619
But still--

239
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:18,552
-Let's end this
conversation here.

240
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:41,986
-Please, allow me
to handle this one.

241
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:44,252
-Takuma.

242
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:48,586
-As a vampire, I
have betrayed you.

243
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:52,286
However, as your
friend, you have my word

244
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:54,686
that I will never do it again.

245
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:57,586
Now please, allow me
to prove that to you.

246
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:21,386
Thank you, Kaname.

247
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:32,652
-Takuma?

248
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:40,886
Come, now.

249
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,586
Do you honestly intend to
point that blade at me?

250
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:48,452
This is not an attempt
to beg for my life,

251
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:52,519
but I had always hoped that you
would follow in my footsteps,

252
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:58,719
and one day you would take
over my place in the Senate.

253
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:01,586
-Let's put an end to this.

254
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,352
Let's draw the curtains on
the Ichijo family together.

255
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,986
KANAME (VOICEOVER): In any plan,
there is always the unexpected.

256
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:28,986
Pawns, positioned to
protect to hold dear.

257
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:33,986
That is all I had expected
of them-- nothing more.

258
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:38,519
Yet these pieces performed in
ways that I could not predict.

259
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,152
They gave far more
than I asked of them.

260
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:45,052
They shined far brighter than
I ever dreamed they would.

261
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,586
My battle is over.

262
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:00,819
Now, have you fulfilled
your duty, Zero Kiryu?

263
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:04,819
-Zero!

264
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:18,952
Zero, what did you do to Ichiru?

265
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:22,786
-So dangerous.

266
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:23,452
-You monster.

267
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,219
-Zero!

268
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:35,552
-What's wrong?

269
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:38,152
-I don't think he has any
idea how to control his power.

270
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:39,452
-Zero!

271
00:19:39,486 --> 00:19:43,319
-This is bad,

272
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:45,252
[screaming]

273
00:19:57,252 --> 00:19:57,719
-Zero!

274
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:04,686
-This is what happens when a
former human devours his twin.

275
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,186
-Rido.

276
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:10,986
-There is now far more
power in your human vessel

277
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,886
than it is able to contain.

278
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,852
You can't master all
that strength so quickly.

279
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:16,352
-Zero!

280
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:28,919
-Yuki--

281
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:30,186
-What are you--

282
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:34,219
-Use your Artemis and cut me.

283
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:34,986
-Zero.

284
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:36,852
-Are you out of your mind?

285
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:39,352
-There isn't any other
option right now.

286
00:20:39,386 --> 00:20:41,752
His power is out of control.

287
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,086
It's the only way to stop it.

288
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,252
-But Zero, if I use the
Artemis Rod on you, then--

289
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,419
-Don't worry, Yuki.

290
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:49,086
That isn't a weapon
that can kill me.

291
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:55,452
Remember our promise.

292
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:57,419
ZERO (VOICEOVER):
One day, if I'm

293
00:20:57,452 --> 00:21:01,019
about to lose control, I
want you to be the one.

294
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:04,986
-Zero!

295
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:20,786
ZERO (VOICEOVER):
This pain is proof.

296
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:24,852
-Live, Zero, and
do what I cannot.

297
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:29,552
Proof that Ichiru still
lives on inside me.

298
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:34,052
-Zero!

299
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,152
-He has the Bloody Rose.

300
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:42,852
-Finally, Ichiru,
you and I are one.

301
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:50,219
-(CHUCKLING) Interesting.

302
00:21:50,252 --> 00:21:51,352
All right, fine.

303
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:53,619
If you want to play, I'm game.

304
00:21:53,652 --> 00:21:56,186
Kill me as often as you want.

305
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:58,886
And I will resurrect every time.

306
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,686
-I choose to keep on living.

307
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,086
-Zero, what have you done?

308
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:23,352
-That light is not in harmony
with a vampire knight.

309
