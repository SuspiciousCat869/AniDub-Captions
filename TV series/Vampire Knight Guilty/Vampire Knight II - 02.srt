It's nothing.

I'm not myself.

6
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,066
Just woke up from a nightmare.

YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I'm sure that's it.

8
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,266
I mean, Zero's been
through so much lately.

YUKI (VOICEOVER): So much.

10
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,733
YUKI: Until you see
Zero is innocent,

11
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:37,800
then I-- I won't ever
speak to you again!

(GROANING)

00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,966

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,533
-Oh!

15
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,766
It's nothing!

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,766
We better hurry before
they lock the gate!

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,333
Did you lose your mommy?

-(CRYING) Take me to my mommy!

-Hey, Yori, I'm going to help
this boy find his mother.

23
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,366
Can you head back to
the dorm without me?

-Will you be OK by yourself?

25
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,100
-I'll be perfectly fine.

26
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,133
So, shall we go?

It's a written order
from the Association.

You are to monitor
tonight's Vampire Soiree.

I don't foresee any problems.

00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,100
It's a gathering of
moderates, so there

33
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,433
shouldn't be any trouble.

34
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:25,233
-Got it.

35
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:25,900

-This is so annoying.

44
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:26,026
I hate gatherings that
are filled with grownups.

45

-Well, it can't be avoided.

46
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:31,093
Just put up with it
for a little while.

00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:31,593
-Oh.

48
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:40,793
-Hanabusa, the Aido family is
the one putting on this event

00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:41,793
tonight.

00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:43,293
MOTHER: And your
father is coming, too,

51
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:46,426
so try to cheer up a little bit.

52
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,993
-That is why I'm not keen on it.

53

ICHIJOU: I've
decided that we shall

54
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:55,493
overlook yesterday's
disturbance.

55
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,426
Zero Kiryu will not to
be dealt with as long

56
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,859
as you are at Cross
Academy, Lord Kaname.

57
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:05,626
-I do appreciate that, Ichijou.

58
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:08,893
ICHIJOU: I must admit, I find
the fair and impartial way

59
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:10,693
you vouch and defend
your schoolmate

60
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:12,559
to be quite admirable.

61
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:15,093
Fitting behavior for the
head of the Kuran family

62
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:18,226
who paved the way for the
pacifism we practice today.

63
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:22,426
-Actually, Ichijou, I
would like for the Senate

64
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,426
to grant me a specific request.

65
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:27,726
Going forward, I ask
you not to interfere

66
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,426
with the affairs
at Cross Academy.

67
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,326
Like my late
parents before me, I

68
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,759
have no desire to be a
part of anymore bloodshed.

want to leave you alone,

so I'll stay until
your mom comes.

is lying here unconscious.

to rather quickly.

sure how this happened!

-Thank you.

96
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:22,859
KANAME: I thought that you
weren't speaking to me.

97
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:27,326
-Um-- I, I just meant that if
you would stop suspecting Zero,

98
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,259
then I--

99
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:33,193
KANAME: I've already told you.

100
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,593
I have no intention of
turning Zero into a criminal.

101
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:40,759
However, until we know for
sure who the real murderer is,

102
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:44,159
Zero is someone
I can't rule out.

103
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:47,593
YUKI: Well, I
understand that, but--

104
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:50,159
-One more thing, Yuki.

105
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:53,526
When I heard you say
that to me, did you

106
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,193
think it wouldn't anger me?

107
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:57,559
-Yes, but you have to
remember it was your fault

108
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:59,126
I said that, Kaname.

109
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:03,259
-Don't you know you
made me act that way?

110
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,093
KANAME: I sensed your
heart skip a beat,

111
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:11,959
so clearly you do
understand a little.

KANAME: All right.

114
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:15,893
Come in.

115
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,693
-You're here, too, Takuma?

116
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,826
-Yuki, you're awake.

117
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,393
Thank goodness.

118
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:26,193
You gave me quite
a scary, seeing

119
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,359
you lying there in the entryway.

120
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:30,359
What happened to you?

121
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:31,593
-I'm not sure.

122
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:33,926
I took a lost child to what
looked like an abandoned

123
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,026
building.

124
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:39,359
He kissed my cheek to
thank me, and then--

125
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:42,659
-Well, he was most likely a
child of one of the guests.

126
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:47,326
You see, a vampire child can
suck in your life energy.

127
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,126
You're in an
underground mansion that

128
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,426
was built beneath an
abandoned building.

129
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,226
This place belongs
to the Aido family.

130
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,193
And tonight, there's
a soiree for vampires

131
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,293
who live in this vicinity.

[music playing]

133
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,693
TAKUMA: There are many
aristocrats here right now.

134
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:08,326
-I must admit.

135
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,226
I didn't expect to see
Ichijou at this event.

136
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,059
-Yeah, I know.

137
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,526
That is a bit of a rare sight.

138
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,593
Hanabusa, I wouldn't
let him bother you.

139
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:20,726
-And look, a soiree like this
is being observed by a hunter.

140
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,659
It's an agreement so
the two sides get along.

141
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:25,726
HANABUSA: But why did they
send him of all people?

142
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,393
ZERO: Cut it out, Master.

143
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:33,693
-Hello, dumb pupil.

144
00:08:33,726 --> 00:08:35,526
-Why did you come here tonight?

145
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,493
-Because I got an order, too.

146
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,126
-I don't need your
help, you know.

147
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,226
I can handle this on my own.

148
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,926
Will you quit touching me?

149
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:44,759
-Huh.

150
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,259
I have such a heartless pupil.

151
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,959
KAIEN: You didn't get an order.

152
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:51,093
Don't worry.

153
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,059
The vampires who are
gathering at this event

154
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:56,259
are empathetic as they wish
to coexist with humans.

155
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:59,793
-Your instincts are
completely out of touch.

156
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,493
Do you honestly mean to
just sit here in that chair,

157
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,693
and watch from the sidelines?

158
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:07,526
Huh, Kaien Cross?

159
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,526
MAN: Ichijou's here.

160
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,359
Why would an old Senate member
come to something like this?

161
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:16,259
WOMAN: It must be
because of that incident.

162
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:18,259
-Empathetic vampires, huh?

163
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,593
KANAME: Listen.

164

00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:48,631
KANAME: Humans are
fleeting beings.

330
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:51,831
Their lives rushing through what
is only a moment for vampires.

331
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,164
Will you become a vampire?

332
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:04,964
Will you become a monster
that devours blood?

333
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:08,764
And live the long flow
of time with me, Yuki?

334
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,197
-I will.

335
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,631
-Sorry.

336
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:32,364
I took this too far.

337
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:33,497
I won't do anything.

338
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,697
-I apologize for
frightening you.

339
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:47,631
-Kaname, I-- I
thought that you--

340
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:48,364
-Come now.

341
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,297
What's with that face?

342
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:51,964
I hope you've
learned your lesson.

343
00:19:51,997 --> 00:19:55,264
Don't get yourself into
dangerous situations anymore.

344
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:58,164
All right?

345
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,464
Your ride home should
be here by now.

346
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:04,897
-Welcome back, Yuki.

347
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:05,731
-Thank you.

348
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:08,131
I'm sorry that I made you wait.

349
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:12,564
-It's snowing.

350
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:17,664
-White snow.

351
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:21,064
Reminds me of red blood.

352
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:25,097
That snow ten years ago
splattered with blood.

353
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:30,364
The beautiful boy who extended
his bloodstained hand to me,

354
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,997
and I held it.

355
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:39,297
YUKI (VOICEOVER): As long
as Lord Kaname is with me,

356
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:42,197
there's nothing
that I'm afraid of.

357
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:46,931
I can do anything for him.

358
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:51,497
-And live the long flow
of time with me, Yuki.

359
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:53,897
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
Somewhere in my heart,

360
00:20:53,931 --> 00:20:57,097
I had been longing
to hear those words.

361
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,664
I never thought I
would hear them.

362
00:20:59,697 --> 00:21:03,564
So I got all confused, and
my feelings turned to tears.

363
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:08,264
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
What you asked of me,

364
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:14,464
Kaname, even if you weren't
serious-- did my reaction let

365
00:21:14,497 --> 00:21:15,397
you down?

366
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:27,864
[students talking loudly]

367
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:29,864
GIRL: The holiday
starts tomorrow!

368
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,331
We won't be able to
see Aido for so long!

369
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:34,364
I'm going to miss you so much!

370
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:35,697
-Ruka!

371
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:38,431
There is a fire in my heart
that I absolutely must--

372
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,231
ZERO: Shut up!

373
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:41,564
-Zero!

374
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:46,531
-Why don't you quit daydreaming
and actually do your job?

375
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:47,031
-Sorry.

376
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:54,797
[students screaming]

377
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:55,797
-All right, everyone!

378
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:58,264
Get back!

379
00:21:58,297 --> 00:21:58,764
-Ruka!

380
00:21:58,797 --> 00:21:59,264
Ruka!

381
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:04,997
-I hope you do realize, Yuki.

382
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:08,697
I know what you told
me was the truth.

383
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:12,164
So please, stop worrying.

384
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:12,664
BOY: Ruka!

385
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:34,529
