-That's him.

He's still here.

-No.

you haven't noticed,
dawn is upon us.

It's time for our

actually draw that curtain?

Wow, that does hurt.

19

But you know, those

-You realize you're
next, Kaname Kuran.

You didn't think that
everything would go exactly

36

as you planned it, did you?

37
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:56,121
-I did wonder.

38
00:04:56,155 --> 00:05:00,921
I knew all too well, once you
gained this unrivaled power

39
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:03,755
and finished Rido off
for good that chances

were you would most
likely come after my life.

However, I also knew that you
wouldn't pull that trigger.

Kaname, what are you--

-Yuki, listen, it will
be time to leave soon.

46
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:55,521
Yes, I knew it all
along-- every bit of it.

47
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:01,955
-We did it.

48
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,688
We protected her.

49
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:07,421
-Hanabusa, you tried hard
to be chivalrous back there.

50
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:10,755
It was quite amusing.

51
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,855
-I did no such thing.

52
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:15,288
That's more apt for Seiren.

53

You said Dorm
President Kuran ordered

54

us to protect Yuki Cross.

55
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:21,688
Who knew even someone
like you could lie?

56
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:28,255
-I've decided to put
an end to all of this.

57
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,921
From here forward, you
can do as you wish.

58
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:32,721
-Huh?

59
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:34,988
-Lord Kaname, what are you--

60
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:40,788
-You were all pawns that I had
gathered here to protect Yuki.

61
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,988
I'm sure you can sense
it, this presence.

62
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,755
There is someone else
now who can protect Yuki.

63
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,788
You are dismissed.

64
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,521
I have no further use of you.

-But Lord Kaname--

66
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,488
[chuckling]

67

-I'm fine.

72
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:13,055
Ecstatic, actually.

73
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:15,588
If he really did
think of us as pawns,

74
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:18,321
then he would have sacrificed
us and we'd be dead.

75
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,721
-But in the end, that
isn't what Lord Kaname did.

76
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:25,021
HANABUSA: No, he saw
us as individuals.

77
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:28,188
And that was his way of
acknowledging each of us.

78
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:29,955
Nothing's changed.

79
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:34,288
I still like Lord Kaname.

80
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:37,455
-Hanabusa, he sounded
pretty passionate, huh?

81
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:39,188
-To the point that it
was kind of creepy.

82

-Hey!

83
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,088
I can still hear you, you know.

84

-All right, then.

85
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:45,155

-The battle is finally over.

88
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:50,821
Dorm President Kuran has
released us to do what we want.

89
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:57,055
-Following my master
is the only path I see.

90
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,788
-All right, guess
which hand it's in.

91
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:10,655
-Huh?

92
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:12,221
-Guess which hand it's in.

93
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:14,355
If you get it
right, then-- then I

94
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:16,221
will follow Dorm
President Kuran.

95
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:25,221
Choose already.

96
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,355
-We already know what
you're going to do.

-Will you hurry up?

98
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,388
-Such a philistine.

99
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,488
-Why couldn't you just say
that's what you wanted?

100
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,388
HANABUSA: Shut up!

101
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,521
-What are your plans?

102
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:46,821
-Well, I'll go with him.

103
00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:51,921
I want to end this
curse with my own hands.

104
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:53,821
So are you in as well?

105
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:04,421
-Yo, good work.

106
00:09:04,455 --> 00:09:06,821
-Yagari, you're still alive.

107
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:08,321
-Hey, that's my line.

108
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:10,055
That trusted sword
of yours finally

109
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:12,488
gets to see the light
of day, and you treat it

110
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:13,688
like an old man's cane.

111
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:20,021
-It's time for it
to sleep once again.

112
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:21,621
Forever this time.

113
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:29,155
-So bright.

114
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:32,721
-Yes, it was bright.

115
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,788
I used to watch
you from up here.

116
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:37,021
-Zero.

117
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:40,688
-I'd watch you as you
watched Kaname Kuran.

118
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:48,588
Whether you were with
him or anybody else,

119
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:53,555
you always had a
smile on your face.

120
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:56,688
Even when I did something
that was unforgivable,

121
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,755
that smile was still there.

122
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:06,755
I was perfectly willing
to sacrifice my whole life

123
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:08,621
for you.

124
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:16,521
That's what I was prepared to
do-- to give up everything.

125
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:20,388
So you're going to
leave now, aren't you?

126
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:34,821
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
I wonder why.

127
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,821
-Yes.

128
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:42,888
-I thought so.

129
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:53,255
-You once asked me
to kill you if you

130

become a vampire, remember?

131

-I do.

132
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,721
-But what if I become a vampire?

133
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:10,155
-Well, I'm still not
sure if I believe

134
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:12,355
that you really are a vampire.

135
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:13,788
There's no proof.

136
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:14,888
-But Zero, come on.

137
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,755
That's just--

138
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:21,755
-All right, if you really are
a vampire, then drink my blood.

139
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:36,555
If you truly are a vampire
that I should hate, go on.

140

YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm sorry.

Kaname, I'm-- so, so sorry.

142
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:07,388
-I know that you are.

143
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:14,888
-I can taste Zero.

144
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:17,588
It's like what he once said.

145
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:22,088
-Your blood had that taste.

146
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:23,055
-I understand now.

147
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:37,021
-Yuki, Yuki, Yuki, Yuki.

-Zero's feelings
are flowing into me.

-You're right.

150
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:51,688
You are a vampire.

151
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:55,188
This means we can no longer
live in the same world.

152
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:02,555
But someday in
the future, I will

153
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:06,021
come after you to kill you.

154
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:14,521
-I'll be waiting.

155
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:42,696
-No matter what, we will
always be best friends.

00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:43,262
-Thank you.

[door opening]

158
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:53,896
KANAME (VOICEOVER): In
trying to protect you,

159
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:57,962
all I've done is
hurt you the most.

160
00:13:57,996 --> 00:14:00,062
Why is that?

161
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:02,996
For some reason,
my feelings for you

162
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,529
always have the opposite effect.

163
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:11,096
I wonder why that is.

164
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,729

I'm so sorry.

00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:27,596
I am the one who hurt
this man the most.

167
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:32,662
For 10 years I made
him wait alone.

168
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,562
And I never even knew.

169
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:37,862
I mean it, Kaname.

170
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:40,729
I'm so sorry.

171
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:44,396
Now listen, you must do
what you must do, Yuki.

172
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,462
-We'd better get going
before the sun gets too high.

173
00:15:01,496 --> 00:15:02,762
-Yuki.

174
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:05,262
-I'm sorry that I'm
running a little late.

175
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:07,929
My bags are kind of heavy.

176
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:10,396
-Tell me, why did you come?

177
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:11,596
-Huh?

178
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,529
Because you said that
it's almost time to leave,

179
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,729
didn't you?

180
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:20,229
-Yes, but you're free now.

181
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:24,129
-Well, that may be true,
but the only reason I'm free

182
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:27,596
is because of everything
you did to save me.

183
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:28,896
-I see.

184
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:29,662
So it's gratitude.

185
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,496
-Huh?

186
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,196
-You needn't force
yourself to come.

187
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:36,429
You said there were people
you wanted to protect.

188
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:37,396
You're free to do that.

189
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:43,896
-Yes, there are people
I want to protect.

190
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:47,496
And you, Kaname, you will
always be one of them.

191
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:55,429
-That makes me happy.

192
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:56,862
But if you're going
to protect me,

193
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:59,229
Yuki, you will have
to be very strong.

194
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:06,062
-My feelings always have
the opposite effect.

195
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:10,162
I want to protect you,
but I hurt you instead.

196
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:13,229
I want to cry and
somehow I laugh.

197
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:18,462
-You haven't changed a bit.

198
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:19,429
-Lord Kaname?

199
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:26,129
-Do you remember?

200
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:27,396
Before you lost your memories.

201
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:38,196
-Don't cry.

202
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:38,696
-Yuki.

203
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:42,496
Don't worry.

204
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:43,229
I'm not crying.

205
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,796
-It's OK.

206
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,296
Good boy.

207
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,596
Good boy.

208
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,196
I am here for you.

209
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:03,662
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
Even then, you

210
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:06,496
were able to see into my heart.

211
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:11,629
From the very beginning, you've
been there protecting me.

212
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:12,462
Only you.

213
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:18,896
You have always been
the most precious thing

214
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:19,929
in the world for me.

215
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,629
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I
want to protect him.

216
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,396
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
Don't you need

217
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,929
to say goodbye to the
headmaster before we go?

218
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:48,429
-No.

219
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:52,029
I'm afraid that he might
start crying if I do.

220
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:54,029
KAIEN: Of course I will cry!

221
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:55,029
Come on!

222
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,529
Let me have a good cry!

223
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:59,329
Yuki!

224
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:03,696
Oh, I won't be able to
experience this feeling again

225
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,029
for a long time.

226
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,629
-Headmaster?

227
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:08,062
-Don't say that!

228
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:10,462
You were calling
me father earlier!

229
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:13,896
-I can't breathe!

230
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:19,162
-Yuki, you are going of
your own free will, right?

231
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:21,829
-I am.

232
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:23,162
-All right.

233
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:28,062
Kaname, if you ever hurt Yuki,
I will never forgive you.

234
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:36,596
-Thank you.

235
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:38,996
I'm going now, father.

236
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:53,329
-Let's be clear.

237
00:18:53,362 --> 00:18:55,729
We are not pawns for
you to play with.

238
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:59,962
So even if you disapprove, we
are still going to follow you.

239
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:00,696
That understood?

240
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:05,029
-You may do as you please.

241
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:13,829
-Watch it.

242
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,196
-Hey, are you trying
to cut in front of me?

243
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,896
-Come on, that wasn't
my intention at all.

244
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:21,196
Listen, just because
I have longer legs--

245
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:22,896
-What did you say?

246
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,062
-Grow up.

247
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:26,829
Will you get out of my way?

248
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:27,696
-Here we go.

249
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:33,629
-Yuki is my child.

250
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:37,429
And all that I want
is for her to grow up

251
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:39,462
like a normal human girl.

252
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:43,329
I want her to be free from the
fate of a pureblood vampire.

253
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:45,896
I want her to smile.

254
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:54,962
-Juri, in the end, Yuki chose
not to run away from her fate.

255
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:57,996
But I want you to
know that she still

256
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,429
smiles like a normal human girl.

257
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,829
Goodbye, everyone.

258
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:08,229
-Yo, you do have other
students here, headmaster.

259
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:10,596
Did you forget about them?

260
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:11,096
-Oh!

261
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:17,062
-It's not my fault
if you get sunburned.

262
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:19,196
-Uh-huh.

263
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:20,896
-I wonder how they're all doing.

264
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:26,596
-This belongs to Takuma.

265
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,362
-Do you think he really is gone?

266
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,329
-So not you.

267
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:42,596
-Yeah.

268
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:45,129
But it doesn't
really need to be.

269
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:48,362
This is Takuma's after all.

270
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:50,562
-Where are you going?

271
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:53,896
-Well, to give this
back to Takuma.

272
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:55,896
-Give it back?

273
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,996
-There must be some
kind of reward for it.

274
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:01,362
-Oh.

275
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:02,296
I'll come too.

276
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:06,529
-Hm?

277
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:09,729
-Someone has to feed to you.

278
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:10,229
Here.

279
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:19,496
-I'm sorry, everyone.

280
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,462
The danger has passed.

281
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:23,596
You're all safe.

282
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:26,362
-Yuki.

283
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:27,262
-Bastard.

284
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:29,362
He created this mess.

285
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:31,562
He's the one who should
clean it up, not me.

286
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:38,962
Glad you're here.

Aido, please come out.

Ruka, look over here.

Please look this way.

Huh?

Zero, are you trying
to skip out on work?

Come on, hurry.

298
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:03,062
Get over here.

299
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:14,296
-Yuki, one day.

300
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:19,596
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I'll be waiting, Zero.

301
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:23,562
Until then.
