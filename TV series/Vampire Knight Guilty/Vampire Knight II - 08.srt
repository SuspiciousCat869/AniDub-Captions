-However, if I were truly
born her older brother,

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,333
then I would have
been much happier.

4
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:16,833
-What do you mean?

5
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:19,333
-Yuki is without a doubt
a pureblood daughter

6
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:22,133
of the Kuran family.

7
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:27,866
Even a pathetic vampire like you
should be able to sense that.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,066
But then, you're also
something that hunts us.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,066
What will you do?

-Why isn't big brother back yet?

12
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:18,573
-Don't worry.

13
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,114
He should be coming
home any minute now.

-Yuki, you really love
your brother, don't you?

00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:24,959
-Yeah!

Welcome home, Kaname!

19
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:33,293
-Good to be home, Yuki.

20
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:40,293
I went to see a rare rose
that blooms only once every 10

21
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,259
years.

22
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,759
But I couldn't bring
it back with me.

23
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:44,759
It withers as soon
as you pick it.

24
00:02:44,793 --> 00:02:48,459
The next time it blooms, I'll
have it encased in resin.

25
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:50,826
-Was it really pretty, Kaname?

26
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:57,959
KANAME: How long does Yuki have
to stay here in this basement

28

-Kaname--

29
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:05,726
-It seems nowadays
the Senate isn't

30
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,893
trying to control the
power of our blood.

31
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:10,793
They want to control our
very existence as well.

32
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:11,993
-Yuki's still young.

33
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,593
I don't want her to have
anything to do with them.

34
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:19,893
I know we're being selfish,
but we want to protect Yuki.

YUKI: I'm fine, I promise.

36
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,626
So you don't have to look
so scared, Kaname, OK?

37
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:33,893
-I will always be
with you, Yuki.

38
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,893
-I'm surprised you were
able to make it here

39
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,593
under the watch of the
Senate, big brother.

40
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:52,826
-I came to get your
daughter you've

41
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,159
been so carefully hiding.

42
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:58,093
-You bastard.

43
00:03:58,126 --> 00:04:01,844
You're targeting my child again!

44
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:04,164
-It's all right.

45
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,064
I will stay with you.

46
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:08,663
-I can smell lots of blood.

47
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:11,797
-It really hurts me to
see you scared like this.

48
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,430
Maybe I have just been
reveling in these happy times

49
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,063
and avoiding it.

50
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,497
But I have made up my mind now.

51
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,797
I will create a
place for you where

52
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,697
you won't have to live
in fear ever again.

Mother, where's father?

-I see.

I'm so sorry.

59
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,930
I should have taken care
of things with Rido myself.

Please keep taking
care of Yuki for us.

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,830
All right, Yuki.

63
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:55,897
Come with me.

64
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,397
-What about Kaname?

65
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:58,897
Kaname!

Kana-- Kaname!

67

-Yuki, I'm going to seal
all your vampire genes

68
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,530
and turn you into a human.

69
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:19,730
-Mother, Kaname
is-- mother, there's

70
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:23,063
something scary outside too.

71
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:25,097
-Listen to me very
closely, Yuki.

72
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,297
Once I use this spell, I'm
afraid I cannot be with you

73
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,697
anymore.

74
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,597
But I'm so happy I'm
able to do this for you.

75
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,563
I don't want you to hate me for
making this decision for you.

76
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:39,930
But--

77
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:40,430
-Mother?

78
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:47,497
-When you wake up, Yuki,
you won't remember anything.

79
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:05,363
-Yuki--

80
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:10,763
-That girl.

81
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:14,563
It can't be.

82
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:28,330
-That's enough.

83
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:31,263
Stop, or you'll kill her.

84
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,730
-You showing
compassion for a human?

85
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:37,430
So then, is that part
of Kaname's idealism?

86
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,463
-Yes, it is.

87
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:45,930
The smell of that blood.

88
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:51,697
-So she is finally awakened.

89
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,063
Kaname has restored that girl
to a vampire without pain.

90
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:57,497
But I have a feeling she
would have been happier

91
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,330
if she had instead drunk the
blood of Kuran as a human

92
00:07:00,363 --> 00:07:03,263
and then gone insane
upon her awakening.

93
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:15,464
-So it turns out that Yuki
Cross is a pureblood vampire.

94
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,397
-She's your sister, then?

95
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:31,430
-Hanabusa, no daughters were
ever born to the Kuran family.

96
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:36,130
-Actually, Yuki is the true
daughter of Haruka and Juri.

97
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:41,797
And she is the child who
was born to become my wife.

98
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,264
But that depends on Yuki.

99
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:47,564
If she still wishes it so.

100
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,597
Why are you surprised?

101
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,530
It is not uncommon in a
pureblood lineage for siblings

102
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:55,564
to marry.

103
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:57,564
-No, it's not.

104
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:59,664
-So the source of this
threatening atmosphere

105
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:04,030
throughout the Academy
is coming from the person

106
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:06,264
who's after your sister.

107
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:09,597
-You're not going
to ask who it is?

108
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,330
-We don't obey you simply
because you're a pureblood.

109
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:14,497
We'll keep watch no
matter who the enemy is.

110
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,330
-I'm taking
advantage of you two.

girl is Lord Kaname's--

Yuki is without a doubt

-Zero Kiryu, Ichiru's
twin brother.

115
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,497
-Yuki is a pureblood.

116
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,197
-Ichijo, you know the curse on
twins born to vampire hunters.

117
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,197
-I do know how the hunters
came into existence.

118
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,030
-Well, if those two
keep going at each other

119
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:24,764
like they have been, it may
not even matter in the end.

120
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,064
You look unhappy, Ichijo.

121
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:29,464
You don't want me to
sacrifice that girl in order

122
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:31,097
to resurrect myself?

123
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,164
Or perhaps it's because
you have betrayed Kaname.

124
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:36,664
Or is that look a
response to the fact

125
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:39,864
that I've taken
Senri's body hostage.

126
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:40,964
-Please, stop.

127
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:48,064
-(CHUCKLING) There's no reason
to keep hiding up there.

Just come on down, Rima.

129
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:54,464
-So just who are you?

130
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,730
I won't stand by and let
you get away with it.

131
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:08,964
-My body is burning up.

132
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:12,364
My throat is parched-- so dry.

133

You don't have to hold back.

136
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,797
-It's all right.

137
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,264
I know what you want to do.

138
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,030
-I want--

139
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:56,830
-Yuki, I'm sorry.

140
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,430
I'm sorry I've brought you
back into this hateful smell

141
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:02,297
of blood.

142
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:02,930
-I only want--

143
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:27,185
-Yes, deeply.

144
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:31,218
Yuki.

145
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:34,246
Don't cry.

146
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,180
Perhaps I honestly did
yearn for this day to come.

147
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:45,046
YUKI (VOICEOVER): This man's
blood is permeating my body.

148
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,713
I can't tell where
our boundaries are.

149
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,146
What is that?

150
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,946
A fragment of memories.

151
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:07,513
-You see it?

152
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:09,480
-Yes.

153
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:12,513
It was a frightening creature.

154
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:16,113
But I'm-- but I'm not
a human either, am I?

155
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:23,913
I remember now, that night.

156
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:27,613
Mother sacrificed her life and
then cast a spell to seal me.

157
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,813
Father said he'd protect
me from the bad people,

158
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:32,346
and then he left.

159
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:39,046
They were both strong people.

160
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,213
But now they're gone.

161
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:43,813
But why?

162
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,980
Why'd they do it?

163
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:48,513
What exactly were they
trying to protect me from?

164
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:49,046
-Relax, Yuki.

165
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,580
Calm down.

166
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:03,380
-I did that?

167
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,346
-Yuki, don't deny
your existence.

168
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:16,180
And most of all, don't ever
question their love for you.

169
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,813
For 10 years I've
watched over you

170
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:23,946
in place of those two, the Yuki
who'd forgotten everything.

171
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:33,513
-Kaname-- Kaname, I'm afraid
that something is wrong with

172
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,280
me.

173
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,980
-Why is that?

174
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:42,113
-Because this whole time I've
been in love with my brother.

175
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,313
-What's wrong with that?

176
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:58,146
-Yes, but I've been living
as a human for so long now.

177
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,480
-And so what?

178
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:04,413
It doesn't change the fact
that you're still my fiance.

179
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:07,313
-You and I, we're going to
be like our father and mother

180
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,813
when we grow up.

181
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:12,880
-Do you really mean it, Kaname?

182
00:14:12,913 --> 00:14:17,313
YUKI: Father and mother
were siblings as well.

183
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:20,280
But Kaname, you realize
that's something only--

184
00:14:20,313 --> 00:14:24,713
-Something only beasts would do?

185
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:26,680
Exactly.

186
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:29,280
We're not human, Yuki.

187
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:33,880
Or will you leave
me alone again?

188
00:14:33,913 --> 00:14:40,180
-Alone-- that smell, what is it?

189
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,580
Blood?

190
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:43,413
But whose?

191
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:46,746
-Yuki, yes.

192
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,146
Enjoy the smell of blood.

193
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,146
And by doing so,
you will eventually

194
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,880
come to understand where
it is you truly belong.

195
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:02,280
Stay here, Yuki.

196
00:15:02,313 --> 00:15:03,246
I'll be back soon.

197
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
-Whose?

198
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:15,780
I sense something unpleasant
and the smell of blood.

199
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:16,780
It's not Zero.

200
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:24,746
-Rima!

201
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,113
-Whoever you are, I won't
let you get away with this.

202
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,046
[chuckling]

203
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:46,080
-Injuring a model's
face is pretty low.

204
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,913
-I'm relieved.

205
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:51,446
It wasn't Zero's blood.

206
00:15:55,846 --> 00:16:01,646
But I no longer have any
right to worry about him.

207
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:08,780
-At times like this,
I'm glad I'm a vampire.

208
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:09,880
I heal quickly.

209
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:17,313
-Rima, please be careful.

210
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:19,013
-Takumo, what are you--

211
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,580
-Please stop.

212
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,413
You shouldn't be
using Senri for this.

213
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:24,246
You've already made your point.

214
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,480
-In time, I will destroy
anyone who defies the Senate.

215
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:31,713
Exactly as Ichijo
wishes me to do.

216
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:33,280
-Lord Rido--

217
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:35,246
-So annoying.

218
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,813
Just because you're
in Senri's body

219
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:40,546
doesn't mean you can
act superior, OK?

220
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,746
Whoever you are,
I'll drive you out.

221
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,446
Now get ready.

222
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,313
-Hmph.

223
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:51,046
You won't find that easy to do.

224
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,546
-Rima!

225
00:16:58,846 --> 00:17:00,646
-I missed.

226
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,013
Don't interfere, Ichijo.

227
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,680
-Lord Rido!

228
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:10,046
-Senri-- idiot.

229
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,013
Letting someone
take over your body.

230
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:15,813
What are you doing?

231
00:17:15,846 --> 00:17:19,580
You really need to love
yourself more, Senri.

232
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:36,746
-Do not defy me, Senri.

233
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,413
-Just a little longer.

234
00:17:46,446 --> 00:17:50,046
Come on, hurry, Yuki Cross.

235
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,813
-I am a pureblood vampire.

236
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,346
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Yes, you

237
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,880
are the very thing
that Zero despises.

238
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:05,880
You're a monster.

239
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,013
-It's over.

240
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:15,280
I can't be near him anymore.

241
00:18:15,313 --> 00:18:18,680
I've been deceiving
Zero this whole time.

242
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:21,613
And on top of that, I
let him drink my blood

243
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:24,513
while telling myself
that I was saving him.

244
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:26,313
What was I thinking?

245
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:30,046
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
Such a hypocrite.

246
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,880
-And still-- I can't help it.

247
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:37,446
I still want to see Zero.

248
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,213
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): And then what?

249
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,846
-I need to talk to him.

250
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,980
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
What could you possibly

251
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:46,913
say to him now?

252
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,946
-I want to see Zero.

253
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,146
-Hey, Hanabusa.

254
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,980
She seems to be escaping.

255
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:07,946
-Hold on, Yuki Cross.

256
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,013
I mean, Lady Yuki Kuran.

257
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:15,213
Lord Kaname has given us orders
to stay here and protect you

258
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:16,913
no matter what happens.

259
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:22,346
-Please step aside now,
Hanabusa, Akatsuki.

260
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,746
-We can't do that.

261
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,846
-Please just go back
to your room, Yuki--

262
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,346
-Out of my way.

263
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:37,980
You two--

264
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:40,013
-Huh?

265
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,146
-If you want to avoid being
reprimanded by Kaname,

266
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,213
then I suggest you
come along with me.

267
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,380
-Seiren, dawn is coming.

268
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:54,213
Gather those who can
move during the day

269
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:56,580
and have them
guard the Sun dorm.

270
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,180
And don't let the day
class students outside.

271
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:00,413
-Understood, my lord.

272
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:01,680
I'll take care of it.

273
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,583
-Lord Kaname.

274
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:10,516
-Ruka.

275
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:13,849
-By the smell of blood in
the air and by her presence,

276
00:20:13,883 --> 00:20:16,283
I know what has happened.

277
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,183
-So if you understand
what has happened,

278
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,383
then why do you
look so apologetic?

279
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,283
-I have behaved
like a fool who was

280
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:26,716
incapable of dealing with the
burden of her own emotions

281
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:31,516
until now, when the truth
was thrust before me.

282
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:33,583
I will go to the Sun
dormitory and be useful.

283
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,816
-And Ruka, I am sorry.

284
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:48,849
-No, I was merely
dancing by myself.

285
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:53,516
Please don't
apologize, Lord Kaname.

286
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:54,516
-All right.

287
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:56,583
Instead, Ruka, I
will say this to you.

288
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:00,949
I'll say something very cruel.

289
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:05,549
I trust you fully, Ruka.

290
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:12,716
-Thank you for saying that.

291
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,116
-Akatsuki, I'm glad you're here.

292
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:22,483
Dawn is going to break soon,
but you should both continue

293
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:25,116
to guard the Sun dormitory
for the time being.

294
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:26,816
Day classes are canceled.

295
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:29,349
Make sure you don't
let anyone outside.

296
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:33,649
-Hey, Ruka, are you all right?

297
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:38,283
-I want to be able
to show him that I

298
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:41,949
am a cool, dependable woman.

299
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:48,580
Besides, from now
on, I'm not the one

300
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:49,947
who will suffer the most.

301
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,547
-The time has come, if I
still have the strength.

302
00:22:00,513 --> 00:22:03,613
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I made
up my mind to come here.

303
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:08,747
But--

304
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,147
-It sounds as if
you're desperately

305
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,280
saying that you
really do need me.
