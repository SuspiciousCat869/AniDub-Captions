-Mm.

331
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:09,488
I've decided that I'm going
to confront Kaname tonight.

332
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:12,788
For 10 years now, Kaname
has been a consistent part

333
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,088
of my life in one
form or another,

334
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:16,888
and I've always
felt that I wouldn't

335
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:20,322
mind if one day he betrayed me.

336
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:23,088
But I was also afraid
to ask him about it,

337
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:26,255
and it took a long time
to gather my courage.

338
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:27,888
I know I've taken
the moral high ground

339
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,322
and lectured you a lot, Zero.

340
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:32,422
But I really like Kaname.

341
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:34,855
I've liked him for 10 years now.

342
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,222
-What brought all this on?

343
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,022
-I already know.

344
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:42,055
I know that Kaname is
hiding something from me.

345
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:45,888
But still, I don't care.

346
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:46,755
I need to go.

347
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:00,455
-Forget it.

348
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:01,755
You should just go.

349
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,155
YUKI (VOICEOVER): When
I first opened my eyes,

350
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:17,188
both the world and my
memories were pure white.

351
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:21,622
But your mere existence
instantly colored my world.

352
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:26,122
KANAME: Yuki.

353
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:26,922
I've been waiting.

354
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:34,055
-Please, tell me the truth.

355
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:35,855
I don't want to remain
like a child who's

356
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:40,122
forgiven for not
knowing anything.

357
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,422
-What is it?

358
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,322
-I want you to
tell me the truth,

359
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,188
and don't evade me this time.

360
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:46,588
-Evade you?

361
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:49,888
Ah, like you did when
I said I love you?

362
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:50,788
-Uh!

363
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:52,155
-Hm?

364
00:18:52,188 --> 00:18:54,788
-Um, yes.

365
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:56,522
-That's how I truly feel.

366
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:57,988
You find my love repulsive?

367
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,755
-[gasp] Of course not!

368
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:02,022
I've never felt
that way about you.

369
00:19:02,055 --> 00:19:03,555
I've always loved you.

370
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:05,588
I love you now!

371
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:09,388
YUKI (VOICEOVER): The times
you came to see me each year.

372
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:10,822
-Yuki!

373
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:12,522
-Kaname!

[giggles]

375
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:14,888
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
The arms I could

376
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:17,922
jump into and feel safe in.

377
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:21,922
That beautiful man who
looked at me tenderly.

378
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:25,488
Those things saved me.

379
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:27,155
-After everything
you've done for me,

380
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:30,822
I have absolutely no reason
to try and avoid you,

381
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:33,122
even if you were
the same vampire

382
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:36,088
who tried to devour
me back then.

383
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:37,388
Because you were there, Kaname.

384
00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:39,222
I-- [gasp]

385
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:44,255
-Yuki--

386
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:46,188
-Why does it have to be me?

387
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:48,522
I see the situation clearly now.

388
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:52,222
No matter how hard I try, even
if I reach beyond my station,

389
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,388
I'm just not suitable for you.

390
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:58,422
Kaname, you have something
to do with my forgotten past,

391
00:19:58,455 --> 00:19:59,355
don't you?

392
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:05,955
-Mm.

393
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:08,322
-[gasp] So it is true!

394
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:10,022
Then why won't you
tell me what happened?

395
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:10,988
Please!

396
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:12,855
I have to know what
really happened!

397
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:14,622
I can't stay in the
dark like this anymore!

398
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:15,688
Mean

399
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:17,188
I don't want you to use
this bond between us

400
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:18,422
to avoid the issue.

401
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:21,422
I want to know everything
and grow strong.

402
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:24,355
Please!

403
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,122
-Don't be silly.

404
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:28,922
Let things remain
just as they are.

405
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:33,322
Be happy in this
academy a while longer.

406
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:34,755
OK?

407
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:37,755
Because the truth you seek
might be covered with blood.

408
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:40,322
Even then, would you
still want to know?

409
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:41,688
-Yes, Kaname.

410
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:47,988
-To be honest, I've
been afraid, wondering

411
00:20:48,022 --> 00:20:50,388
if the only person
who gives me warmth

412
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:53,288
will change, afraid
that when she finally

413
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:58,722
learns the truth about
everything, she will hate me.

414
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,222
-I wouldn't do that.

415
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:02,055
I will never hate you.

416
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:03,555
-All right.

417
00:21:03,588 --> 00:21:05,822
Then prove it to me, Yuki.

418
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:08,888
Be my lover.

Her arm was so thin

00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:17,822
that I thought it would break.

422
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:19,655
Don't go, Yuki.

423
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:24,055
You don't need to know.

00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:26,422
If you know, then you--

YUKI: No!

426
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:35,188
Let me go!

427
00:21:35,222 --> 00:21:36,988
You think I'll back
down if you say that?

428
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:38,455
Let me go!

429
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,388
Stop dodging the issue!

430
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:43,055
-Yuki, if you prove
it to me, then I

431
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:45,488
promise I will tell
you everything.

432
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:47,455
That's all that I
am asking of you.

433
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:48,522
-You're lying.

434
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,522
-I'm not.

435
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:52,888
If you want to know the
truth, hear what I'm saying.

436
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:56,755
YUKI: Why?

437
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:02,222
-That's a good girl.

438
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:04,155
-Why?

439
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:04,655
Kaname.

440
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:13,622
-You needn't look at us with
such worried eyes, Zero.

441
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:16,788
From now on, this is my domain.

442
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:21,922
I will watch over and protect
Yuki as my lover, all right?
