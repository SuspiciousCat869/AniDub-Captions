to play in this.

168
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,250
-Yes, but what if he tries
to do something to Yuki--

169
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:57,717
I mean Lady Yuki?

170
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,117
-That's why I have asked
you to guard her well.

171
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,684
-If that is what
Lord Kaname wishes.

172
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:05,184
And--

173
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:08,050
[knock]

174
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:09,984
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER):
About Ruka--

175
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:11,417
KANAME (VOICEOVER): I see.

176
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,250
She still hasn't left her room?

177
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:16,284
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER): Yes.

178
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,850
She hasn't left
since-- since she

179
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,650
heard that Lady
Yuki is your lover.

180
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:24,350
-Don't worry about it.

181
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:26,617
Just let her be alone
for now, all right?

182
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,284
-Very well.

183
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:29,217
-Hanabusa.

184
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,350
-Uh?

185
00:10:31,384 --> 00:10:34,550
-Regarding Yuki, I
really am grateful.

186
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:36,850
-Uh-- any time.

187
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:47,050
-I won't let you use
this wretched blood

188
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:50,150
to fulfill your
wicked ambitions.

189
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,184
[poof]

190
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:04,874
[bell ringing]

191
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:06,268
CROSS: I wanted to talk to you.

192
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:11,088
-So have you decided
on a punishment for me?

193
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:12,967
CROSS: Punishment?

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,708
-That's not what this is about?

195
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:15,909
Then what is it?

196
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,242
-There's something
I need to tell you.

197
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:22,442
Ichiru, please come
to dinner tonight.

198
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:25,442
Zero and Yuki will
both be there as well.

199
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,676
I know a lot has happened, but
that doesn't change the fact

200
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,042
that you and Zero
are still twins.

201
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:33,409
Listen, I think if
both of you tried,

202
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,376
you two could have a
different relationship.

203
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:36,509
[tiny bell rings]

204
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:37,776
-But that choice is yours.

205
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:44,009
[slams door]

206
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,509
[sigh]

207
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:59,876
HANABUSA: Lord Kaname doesn't
intend to punish you this time.

208
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:02,042
But you should remember this.

209
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:05,009
I won't let you lay a
hand on Yuki Cross again.

210
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:10,876
-Fine with me.

211
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:11,376
-Uh?

212
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,076
[knock]

213
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:19,109
ZERO: Yuki, can I come in?

214
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:20,709
-Y-yeah.

215
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:22,209
-Classes are over now.

216
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,142
Do you think you
can eat something?

217
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,242
-Presidential Kuran
has asked for you.

218
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:27,109
Come with me.

219
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:27,809
-Huh?

220
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:29,442
-Zero, you too.

221
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,942
[whispers all around]

222
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:36,409
HANABUSA: So, Yuki, you've
lost your memories of the past,

223
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:37,409
have you?

224
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:38,376
-Yes, that's right.

225
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:38,942
I have.

226
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:40,076
Why do you ask?

227
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:42,809
-I took it upon myself
to look into the matter.

228
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:43,776
-Huh?

229
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:46,009
Aido, you really
looked into my past?

230
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,976
I didn't ask you to do that!

231
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:48,942
That was awfully--

232
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,842
-You're so wrong!

233
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:54,009
I wouldn't look into your
past if someone begged me to.

234
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:57,176
What I was talking about
is Lord Kaname's past.

235
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,742
-Uh?

236
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:01,676
-I assume you know by now that
Lord Kaname's parents have

237
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,742
since passed away, so I
did some investigating

238
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:06,376
surrounding their deaths.

239
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:09,576
I looked and when I
reached any sort of clue,

240
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:12,876
it'd been deleted or burned.

241
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,976
It was a deliberate
cover-up, just

242
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,609
like what happened
with your memories.

243
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:22,076
And now Lord Kaname has
taken it upon himself

244
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:25,142
to treat a human girl
like you as his lover.

245
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:27,909
Do you know why?

246
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:30,376
Because your new status
means the rest of us

247
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,242
are now forced to protect you.

248
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:35,309
It would seem to me
that Lord Kaname knows

249
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:38,176
that something is
going to happen to you.

250
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:44,842
I'm going to take my leave now.

251
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:47,576
I don't want to hear that
either of you were rude to him.

252
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:58,742
-Yuki.

253
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:02,076
Finally, we have time together.

254
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:02,776
Come here.

255
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:10,042
There's nothing to
hold us back now.

256
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:10,909
Come.

257
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:11,409
-Kaname.

258
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:18,842
No.

259
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:21,542
-Why are you
standing so far away?

260
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:24,142
I guess you still don't
understand, do you?

261
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,542
-You know, you
really didn't have

262
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,809
to come outside during the day.

263
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:33,776
-I'm quite all right.

264
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,642
-I mustn't be swept away.

265
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:37,276
-Ah, I see.

266
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,209
You're taking things
too seriously.

267
00:14:39,242 --> 00:14:40,209
-Uh?

268
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:41,442
-Don't worry, Yuki.

269
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:43,676
I won't ask for too
many things at once.

270
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:44,742
-Now look here!

271
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:46,409
Kaname, I don't--

272
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:47,776
-What is it?

273
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:49,876
You don't like the
snacks that I brought?

274
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:53,876
-You promised me.

275
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:56,076
You said that you would
tell me about my past.

276
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,442
-This isn't the best time.

277
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:00,576
You look so scary right now
that I don't want to tell you.

278
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,676
-I knew you were going to do
this, dodge the subject again.

279
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:05,642
Listen, if you won't
tell me, well, then I'm

280
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:07,842
just going to make
up my own story.

281
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:10,509
[excited whispers]

282
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,442
-Seems you have
nothing to do, Zero.

283
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:15,509
Please shoo away the
Day Class students

284
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:18,676
before they raise a fuss.

285
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,076
[girls scream]

286
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,342
-Thank you, Zero.

287
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:24,709
That's much better.

288
00:15:24,742 --> 00:15:26,709
-Uh-- uh?

289
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,542
-I hear that you weren't
feeling very well today, Yuki.

290
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:30,942
Are you all right?

291
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:31,809
-Uh, yeah, I am.

292
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:32,876
I'm fine.

293
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:36,476
I just-- I have a
lot of my mind lately

294
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,376
and I haven't been sleeping.

295
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:41,342
-Was it me you were
thinking about?

296
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,942
I hope that you were.

297
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:48,676
It'll make me very happy to
know I was on your mind, Yuki.

298
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:55,076
I've decided I'm going to give
the Night Class a few days off.

299
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:56,009
-Huh?

300
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,476
-That'll give you
a small reprieve

301
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:59,376
from the night patrols.

302
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,409
Try to get some rest.

303
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:02,542
-You can't just stop--

304
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:04,909
KANAME: If I don't,
I'm afraid I'll

305
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:07,076
lose sleep worrying about you.

306
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:08,576
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER):
It seems to me

307
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:13,342
that Lord Kaname knows something
is going to happen to you.

308
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:20,142
CROSS (VOICEOVER): I
think if both of you

309
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:22,509
tried, you two could have
a different relationship.

310
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:27,376
-Well, hello, Ichiru.

311
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:29,309
How are you doing today?

312
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:32,176
Look, I've just picked some
vegetables from the garden.

313
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:33,876
They're really fresh.

314
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,942
Come on, let's go inside.

315
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:39,409
KANAME: I've waited
a long time for this.

316
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:40,809
I'm glad this day has come.

317
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,576
YUKI (VOICEOVER): It's
like somehow, we're

318
00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:48,442
playing the part of
the happy couple.

319
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,176
-The sun is setting now.

320
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,742
I hate the thought
of saying goodbye,

321
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:54,076
but I do need to
send you on your way.

322
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:57,242
After all, you really do
need to get some rest.

323
00:16:57,276 --> 00:16:58,876
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
It's like he's trying

324
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:04,142
to enjoy every minute until
the final curtain falls.

325
00:17:04,176 --> 00:17:06,842
Why am I feeling this way?

326
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:10,909
I've wanted nothing more
than for him to look at me.

327
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:13,876
Deep down, I have
always loved him.

328
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:14,709
But--

329
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,876
KANAME: What's wrong?

330
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:20,542
-I don't know why
you're doing this.

331
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:24,476
I don't know why you insist
on behaving this way.

332
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:27,809
I don't get it.

333
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:28,976
-I wish you would understand.

334
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:34,509
CROSS: All right now.

335
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:36,176
Can you mix this for me?

336
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:37,676
And be careful.

337
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:40,442
Don't burn the sauce.

338
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,209
[sigh] Zero eats
anything I cook for him,

339
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:48,042
and yet I still don't know
what his favorite meal is.

340
00:17:48,076 --> 00:17:48,942
Do you know, Ichiru?

341
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,609
YOUNG ICHIRU (VOICEOVER):
Here have it.

342
00:17:54,642 --> 00:17:55,909
You really like it, right?

343
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,076
YOUNG ZERO (VOICEOVER): But
you like it too, Ichiru.

344
00:17:58,109 --> 00:17:59,642
I want you to have it.

345
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:04,909
I'm saying thank you because
you're always so nice to me.

346
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:06,342
-Don't worry if you don't know.

347
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,309
It's all right.

348
00:18:08,342 --> 00:18:09,276
-It's vegetable soup.

349
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:10,576
-Ah?

350
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:11,476
Oh, right!

351
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,442
I almost forgot about the soup!

352
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:17,242
Maybe I'll make
vegetable soup tonight.

353
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:20,709
Let's see, what
kind of vegetables?

354
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:22,076
Hm.

355
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:23,909
I know, tomatoes!

356
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:28,809
Tomato soup is always
good, don't you think?

357
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,009
ZERO: Are you all right?

358
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,409
-Hm?

359
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:36,109
Yes, although I still feel like
he avoided the subject again.

360
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:39,142
Sorry that you had to
come along as well.

361
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:40,076
ZERO: It's OK.

362
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:46,276
Just remember what
I told you before.

363
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:48,609
I will never let you
become a vampire.

364
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:50,642
Never.

365
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:53,042
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Do you think
my heart will grow stronger

366
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:55,576
if I become a vampire?

367
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:59,142
ZERO (VOICEOVER): I will
never let that happen to you.

368
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:01,542
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero's trying
to keep that menacing look

369
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:05,242
of his under control,
but it stabs me all over.

370
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:06,509
It hurts.

371
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:10,309
I can't let Zero suffer
like this anymore.

372
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:12,042
-Come on in!

373
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:14,409
We have a very special
menu for you tonight.

374
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:16,276
-Ichiru?

375
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:19,376
CROSS: I invited him.

376
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,442
-Come on, Zero,
what's the matter?

377
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,442
I mean, you two
are twins, right?

378
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:30,209
Wow, you two are identical.

379
00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:32,909
It's amazing how similar
the both of you are!

380
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,809
When I woke up in the
infirmary earlier,

381
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,609
I was still a bit fuzzy and
I mistook Ichiru for Zero.

382

-Why were you there?

384
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:43,276
What were you planning
to do to Yuki?

385
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:44,209
-It's all right, Zero.

386
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:45,109
Nothing happened.

387
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,442
-Ta-dah!

388
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,576
Sorry to keep you waiting.

389
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:49,676
ICHIRU: I'm leaving.

390
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:51,376
-But dinner is finally--

391
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:52,509
-(QUIETLY) It's useless.

392

It's too late to choose
a different path now.

393

-Huh?

394
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:59,242
You-- what?

395
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:02,042
But what about the
special menu that I made?

396
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,376
-There's nothing to worry about.

397
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:04,309
We'll eat it.

398
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:05,742
I promise.

399
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:06,776
Won't we, Zero?

400
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,509
We'll eat it before
it gets too cold.

-It's fine.

406
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:27,309
-It's because of what I said
tonight that made Ichiru leave,

407
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:28,376
wasn't it?

408
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:30,409
-No, it wasn't your fault.

409
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:35,076
-Yeah, but it isn't
only about that.

410
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,409
Listen, you and Ichiru
too, both of you

411
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:40,876
have had some really bad
experiences in your life.

412
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:42,009
I mean, horrible.

413
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:44,442
So the last thing I want
is for the two of you

414
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,942
to keep hurting each other.

the same thing.

No, it's nothing.

I'm totally fine, honest.

Don't worry about me.

gotten a whole lot worse.
