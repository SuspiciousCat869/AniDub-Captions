-Coming here to talk?

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,266
You don't really think that'll
make a difference, do you?

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,066
Discussing things
like turning humans

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,466
into vampires-- but of course
you transformed from a vampire

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,300
into a human.

7
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,300
On the other side
of this door, I

8
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,866
sense an arrogant pureblood
who does nothing but toy

00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,366
with people.

10
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:48,300
-Yes, Zero.

11
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,533
I'm glad you understand.

12
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:58,300
The Yuki you once knew is
gone because the vampire Yuki

13
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,600
completely devoured her.

I had Ruka fetch them for you.

18
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,300
Hey!

19
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:47,800
Wait!

20
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,578
-There you go, Hanabusa.

21
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:53,999
Follow her.

22
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,399
-Wait up, Yuki Cross.

23
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:02,432
Uh, I mean, Lady Yuki.

24
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:03,532
Don't run around barefoot.

25
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,732
Don't tell me you hurt yourself.

26
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:11,466
-I thought that I
might have gone and cut

27
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:14,632
the soles of my feet.

28
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,932
-Lord Kaname's going
to kill me for this.

29
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,132
Never mind that.

30
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,999
Just get these on, will you?

31
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:24,499
I mean, would you please put
on your shoes, Lady Yuki?

32
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,499
-I didn't think there'd be
a day when you would ever

33
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:33,899
call me "Lady," Hanabusa.

34
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:35,766
It's kind of creepy.

35
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,899
Just call me Yuki Cross or
hey you like you usually do.

36
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:39,999
Either is fine.

37
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:43,032
-Please forgive me for
my former rudeness.

38
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,732
Just get them on.

39
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,366
I mean, please wear them.

40
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,066
Lord Kaname will
be worried if you

41
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,299
don't hurry up and
return to your room soon.

42
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:53,799
Hm?

43
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,066
I've never heard of a pureblood
crying in public before.

44
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,466
-If I'm only allowed to
cry within the confines

45
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:13,399
of my own heart,
then to me that seems

46
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:15,266
like a punishment of some kind.

47
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,366
-This room used to be
Ichijo and Senri's.

48
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,432
Now it serves as Lord
Rido's temporary residence.

49
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:36,099
So what did you come here for?

50
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:39,866
-Ichiru Kiryu, I want you
to open that coffin lid.

51
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,899
Will you do that for me?

52
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:46,866
You are free to disobey
me, if you wish.

53
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,232
-No.

54
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,832
KANAME: You're
like your brother.

55
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:53,632
I can reason with you.

56
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,632
Did I offend you just now?

57
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,299
You see, this is
the first time I've

58
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:59,699
seen a pair of hunter
twins who are both alive.

59
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,432
And because it's so rare,
well, in the hunter lineage,

60
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,932
when a mother is
pregnant with twins,

61
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:08,199
the two embryos will
usually combine,

62
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:11,299
or else there will
be a stillbirth.

63
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:14,232
Driven only by
instinct, the two beings

64
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,799
will attempt to devour
each other while still

65
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:17,799
in their mother's womb.

66
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:27,299
-Shizuka told me that
the hunters deserved that

67
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:30,532
as a punishment for when
our ancestors devoured

68
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:34,599
a founder of the vampire race
to gain powers to hunt them.

69
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:38,266
-Occasionally a twin fetus
will devour the entire life

70
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:40,232
and powers of the
other twin in the womb

71
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:43,332
and be born as one of the
strongest and most depraved

72
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:45,866
of hunters.

73
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:50,032
Your other half didn't
entirely devour you.

74
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:53,199
Your brother was soft-hearted
before he was even born.

75
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:58,732
-There.

76
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,799
The coffin is open.

77
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:02,399
I cannot stop you.

78
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:05,332
Do as you wish.

79
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,899
You want to destroy
Lord Rido, don't you?

80
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:11,199
Yes, of course that's
what you want to do.

81
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:14,666
You demolished Lord Rido,
reduced him to pieces of flesh,

82
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,432
unable to retain
his original form.

83
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,766
You are both purebloods.

84
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,599
If you're that much
stronger, then surely

85
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:25,132
you could have easily
destroyed him completely.

86
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,599
And yet for some reason
you chose not to.

87
00:06:28,632 --> 00:06:33,099
Or perhaps you were
just unable to.

88
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:36,399
-If I had chosen to destroy
this beast once and for all,

89
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:38,299
then Shizuka's fate might
have been different.

90
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,032
All right, Rido.

91
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:46,766
The time you have awaited
eagerly is finally here.

92
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:56,366
-Vampires are selfish.

93
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,266
-Yuki is without a doubt
a pureblood daughter

94
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:02,366
of the Kuran family.

95
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,766
-It's too late.

96
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,399
-The Yuki that you once knew,
Zero, is now gone for good.

97
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:12,399
Because--

98
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,399
-Just shut up.

99
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:19,632
--the vampire Yuki
completely devoured her.

100
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,232
-Go away!

101
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:34,132
-It's good to see
you again, Yagari.

102
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,166
Depending on why
you're here, I may

103
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,332
ask you to leave immediately.

104
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,232
-I've been gone for
quite some time.

105
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:46,932
The air around here reeks
of something unpleasant.

106
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,199
I received an order from
the Hunter Association

107
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:51,199
to kill Zero Kiryu.

108
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:56,499
I'm guessing you're aware of
this order too, aren't you?

109
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:58,799
-So tell me, have
you come back here

110
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:01,432
to be the front
line in this attack?

111
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:04,799
-If so, what will you do?

112
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:09,599
-I will show no mercy,
not even to you.

113
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:11,932
-If you let Zero stay
here, this Academy

114
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,799
will become a battleground.

115
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:16,766
Is that what you want?

116
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:19,532
-I will protect my
son at all costs.

117
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:30,966
-That's the first time I've ever
seen that look in your eyes.

118
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,632
All right, all right, you win.

119
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,699
I value my life far
too much to go up

120
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,566
against the legendary hunter.

121
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,466
I have to say, your
complacency used

122
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,699
to really irritate me at times.

123
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:42,766
I'm glad I saw that look.

124
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,232
Now I know that you--

125
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:45,732
-Zero?

126
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:55,666
-So then, you've
come to kill me.

127
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:57,666
Of course you have.

128
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:00,632
After all, I am a vampire.

129
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,032
Come on.

130
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:13,766
Do it!

131
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,332
-Zero, stop it.

132

[screaming]

133
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,866
-Kaname, what are you doing?

134
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,866
Kaname--

135
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,899
-Why do you seem so
panicked, Ichijo?

136
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:44,766
Everything is going to be fine.

137
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,232
I can tear this man to 1,000
pieces, but unfortunately,

138
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:51,499
I cannot deal him
the final blow.

139
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:55,199
So as a result, I've decided
to resurrect him as he wishes.

140
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,566
Take it, Rido.

141
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,432
You defiled everything in
your relentless pursuit

142
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:06,532
of this-- the purest
blood of Kuran.

143
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:29,107
-Juri, you and I have
lived a very long time.

144
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,774
It has been far
more than enough.

145
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,874
It's been almost 3,000
years since you were born.

146
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:38,807
We were always together.

147
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:40,474
I was happy.

148
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,807
After careful
consideration, we were

149
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:45,074
blessed with a lovely child.

150
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:48,241
And that child is the
fruit of our love.

151
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:51,974
Don't you think that this
may be the time, Juri?

152
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:56,207
What you want to do
for Yuki, I can now

153
00:10:56,241 --> 00:11:00,207
agree to do it-- using
our powers to give her

154
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,007
a different future.

155
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:05,174
-Yes, Haruka.

156
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:14,774
Then I will go now.

157
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,874
Kaname may get angry about this.

158
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:19,641
-Do you think so?

159
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:20,674
He's a bit like me.

160
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:22,207
He hides his feelings.

161
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,574
You've been rather
quiet this whole time.

162
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:38,741
After all, you've come this far
what's holding you back now,

163
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:41,207
henchman of the Senate?

164
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:44,774
I've already turned the
first attackers to dust.

165
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:48,574
-I'm afraid, Lord Haruka,
that you misunderstand us.

166
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,907
You see, we have no connection
at all to the Senate.

167
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:54,174
We are merely servants of
Lord Rido-- nothing more.

168
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,174
-Let's stop this
ridiculous farce

169
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:57,774
and be frank with each other.

170
00:11:57,807 --> 00:12:02,107
You cannot control us, and as
a result, we are in your way.

171
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:06,741
Now you and Rido share
a mutual interest.

172
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:09,407
RIDO: You are correct.

173
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:12,407
You and I are so different.

174
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,441
You always tried to keep your
distance from the Senate.

175
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:18,974
But I, on the other hand,
have been friends with them

176
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:21,241
for a long time.

177
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,941
It's impossible that
you didn't know.

178
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:26,774
Now I think it's
time you confess

179
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:28,841
as to why you had me
imprisoned and kept

180
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,941
under the Senate's watch.

181
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:32,574
-You want to know why?

182
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:35,741
I was trying to keep you as
far away from Juri and me

183
00:12:35,774 --> 00:12:36,907
as I could.

184
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:39,041
It seemed like the
best thing to do,

185
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:41,407
since you stole our first child.

186
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,474
-Oh, that boy.

187
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:46,274
Well, you see, I needed
that child in order for me

188
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,374
to create my ultimate servant.

189
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:53,574
But in the end,
he wasn't enough.

190
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,307
You've always been naive.

191
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,674
This is when you should
let hate overtake you.

192
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:00,274
Go on-- wield your powers.

193
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:02,541
If you crush my
head or my heart,

194
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,641
even an immortal
pureblood will be still.

195
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:08,974
If that happens, I can't
be resurrected so easily--

196
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:13,141
unless I'm giving more
rarefied pureblood blood.

197
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:14,541
-Fine.

198
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:18,607
Instead of your stomach, I'll
go for your head and heart next.

199
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:23,974
I will not allow you to
resurrect, big brother.

200
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:27,107
-My servants, go
get the little girl.

201
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:48,174
-Now it's time for you
to devour your master.

202
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:02,741
-You see, everything has
been for this moment.

203
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:24,674
That sword is-- father, no.

204
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:27,707
That weapon, it's a
vampire hunter sword.

205
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,707
Father, stay back.

206
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,174
-Kaname--

207
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:32,507
-I will take care of this.

208
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,374
It's my duty to
destroy him, not yours.

209
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,607
And besides, I don't want
you dirtying your hands

210
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:40,874
with the blood of
vermin, like him.

211
00:14:40,907 --> 00:14:44,441
He's a vampire, and yet he's
wielding a hunter's weapon

212
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:46,141
when he's fighting
you one on one.

213
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:51,407
-Kaname, you stay back.

214
00:14:54,807 --> 00:15:01,241
Don't destroy my pride as
a parent by protecting me.

215
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:06,907
-No, father, I--
Haruka-- I only--

216
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:08,107
-It's all right.

217
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:11,674
I know you know this,
but I'm saying it anyway.

218
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:14,574
-Haruka, that sword pierced
your heart, didn't it?

219
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:19,041
-Listen to me,
regardless of the past,

220
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:22,174
I want you to know, you've
always been our dear child,

221
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:22,674
Kaname.

222
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:44,474
-Rido, Haruka has already done
serious damage to your head.

223
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:47,207
And if I were to use
this hunter's sword,

224
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:50,807
it would take away
your ability to heel.

225
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:54,241
That head wound you have
now would become fatal.

226
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:56,841
I would prefer it if you didn't
suffer a quick and easy death

227
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,341
by my hand.

228
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:02,007
But for Yuki's sake, I will put
an end to your life right now.

229
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,907
I will use this
sword to kill you.

230
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:14,474
-Your arms cannot move.

231
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,874
Has happiness addled your brain?

232
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:20,807
Don't you know
you can't kill me?

233
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:25,307
You see, even if you regain
your powers and hurt me,

234
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:29,741
you will still be unable
to deliver the final blow.

235
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,207
I shall rest a while.

236
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,841
And when the time comes
to fully resurrect myself,

237
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:39,541
I'll return for the
rich blood of Kuran.

238
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:43,441
And even then, you still
won't be able to kill me.

239
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:46,107
It's such a wonderful feeling.

240
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:50,874
It was I who chained
the strongest monster.

241
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:53,607
-That someone like
yourself could ever be born

242
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:55,307
was a miscalculation on my part.

243
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:01,541
Until that time comes,
I shall secure a way

244
00:17:01,574 --> 00:17:04,541
to destroy you once and for all.

245
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:06,774
But in the meantime, I
think that it's best for you

246
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:09,141
to just lie low.

247
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:12,841
Everything is for this moment.

248
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:16,607
-Kaname, what do you
mean you can't kill him?

249
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:19,241
No, that sounded wrong.

250
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:21,007
Listen, I don't care
what you do to him.

251
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,807
His life is meaningless to me.

252
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,274
But first, I want you
to tell me why, Kaname.

253
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:28,007
Why do you and the
other purebloods

254
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,507
always take such
extreme measures?

255
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,341
Fine, I know you won't
even try to explain to me.

256
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:43,541
But it makes me sad, though.

257
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:51,174
-I put my blood into his
body, so the next night he

258
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:53,541
will no longer need to
use Senri as a host.

259
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:00,507
You see, even in this state,
we can still be resurrected.

260
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,507
We purebloods are
repulsive, aren't we?

261
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,274
Don't worry, unlike us,
you will still turn to dust

262
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:11,374
if your head or heart is crushed
or if you're somehow beheaded.

263
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:12,407
-Kaname, what are you--

264
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:21,674
-Your desire to destroy
Rido still hasn't changed.

265
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:25,341
However, according to
what you just said,

266
00:18:25,374 --> 00:18:27,374
you are unable to
kill him yourself.

267
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,041
But why is that?

268
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:34,474
-Because I am the
progenitor of the Kurans,

269
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:38,407
meaning that Rido is
my master, for he's

270
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:40,207
the one who awakened
me from my coffin.

271
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:44,974
ICHIJO: It is only
a matter of time

272
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:47,941
before Lord Rido obtains
the blood of Kuran

273
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:51,174
and is fully resurrected.

274
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:53,774
After that, I plan
to have him replace

275
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:57,341
Lord Kaname as the head
of the Kuran family.

276
00:18:57,374 --> 00:19:03,474
Once that happens, the Senate
will become even more powerful.

277
00:19:03,507 --> 00:19:06,207
But still, there are
currently hunters

278
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:07,841
who are roaming
free at the Academy.

279
00:19:07,874 --> 00:19:10,674
And I have to admit
that does worry me.

280
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:12,407
-I don't understand why.

281
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:15,007
What is there to worry about?

282
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:19,041
You're well aware that Lord
Rido is no ordinary vampire.

283
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,941
-I know he has lived many
times longer than I have,

284
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:24,541
but in spite of that,
he's still a child.

285
00:19:24,574 --> 00:19:26,841
And it is because of
this insolent behavior

286
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,041
that I find it hard to
understand what he's thinking.

287
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:32,107
As it is, I still
have no idea why

288
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:35,674
he's keeping one of the
Kiryu twins as his pet.

289
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,374
-Well, it could be
for a silly reason,

290
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:43,207
like he has too much
time on his hands.

291
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:45,941
Oh, excuse me.

292
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:48,874
I understand you
have your concerns,

293
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:53,374
but you need not worry about
the other twin, Ichijo.

294
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:56,807
You see, that boy Zero,
he was born a twin

295
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:59,741
in the distinguished
Kiryu family.

296
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:02,874
But he was transformed
into a vampire

297
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:07,774
and drank the blood of the
Kuran lady many, many times.

298
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,374
I thought perhaps
I could use him,

299
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:12,741
but unfortunately
he seems to have

300
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:16,274
no intention of obeying me.

301
00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:22,107
So the hunters have detained
him as a very dangerous vampire

302
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:23,141
under my orders.

303
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:35,941
-It's been a long night.

304
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:47,741
-What are you getting
so worked up for?

305
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:49,974
Who do you think I am anyway?

306
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:52,374
If I wanted to
hunt you down, I'd

307
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:55,407
have done it a long time ago.

308
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:58,907
The Hunter Association President
and the Senate are all in bed

309
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,807
together on this.

310
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:05,041
The Hunter Association,
this Academy-- [scoff].

311
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:08,507
This whole world is rotten.

312
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,574
Don't get me wrong.

313
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:13,174
I still intend to
keep killing vampires.

314
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:15,207
Just not you.

315
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,207
If you're going to sit around
feeling sorry for yourself,

316
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:21,274
then stay in here until
you clear your head.

317
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:23,507
Maybe then you'll
find a solution.

318
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:28,407
I'll just say one more
thing-- you are not a vampire.

319
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:30,074
You are a vampire hunter.

320
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:47,041
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
The Yuki you once

321
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:52,474
knew is gone,
because the vampire

322
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:53,774
Yuki completely devoured her.

323
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:01,607
-Zero!

324
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:02,607
ZERO: Shut up.

325
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:11,241
ZERO (VOICEOVER): Two pulses
that are both similar.

326
00:22:11,274 --> 00:22:14,941
I feel the presence of those
two throughout my body.

327
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:17,774
They're resonating.

328
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:20,974
I can't think calmly.

329
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:35,651
