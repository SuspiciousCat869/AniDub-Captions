1
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,848
[ENTERPRISE] The truth is,
war never changes.

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,311
It's exactly the same, no matter
which era it happens upon.

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,940
[ENTERPRISE]
In the age of discovery.

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,609
Humanity sailed to
oceans unknown,

5
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,694
their hearts hungry
for adventure.

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,697
But soon, those hearts
were filled with a desire

7
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,575
to conquer the seas.

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,662
Unfortunately, a new
enemy appeared.

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,956
One that hailed
from another world.

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,265
[ENTERPRISE]
The Sirens.

11
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,854
[ENTERPRISE] With their vastly
superior technologies,

12
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,775
the Sirens effortlessly pushed
humanity out of the oceans.

13
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,445
There was no longer any place
in the seas for mankind.

14
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,739
To counter this
extraordinary threat,

15
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,492
humanity organized
a global alliance.

16
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,245
It was called Azur Lane.

17
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,582
Their mission was to fight
valiantly against the Sirens.

18
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,294
This grand alliance consisted
of four major camps.

19
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,712
They were:

20
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:32,926
Eagle Union, Royal Navy,
Iron Blood, And Sakura Empire.

21
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,060
[ENTERPRISE] After a prolonged
and desperate struggle,

22
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,980
Azur Lane was finally
successful in repelling

23
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,232
the Siren onslaught.

24
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,693
Which brings us to
the present day.

25
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,834
Is everyone here prepared
for departure?

26
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,130
This could potentially
be a violent battle.

27
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,090
Please use caution.

28
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,596
[ENTERPRISE] The most important
lesson to learn from history is:

29
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:28,899
[ENTERPRISE] New eras may begin,
but war never changes.

30
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,296
[CLEVELAND chuckles] Things're
pretty exciting around here.

31
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,090
I'd describe it as overcrowded.
Look around.

32
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,843
Eagle Union and Royal Navy are
both gathering at this base.

33
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,429
And things don't appear to be
slowing down any time soon.

34
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,849
I bet you can't guess who else
is coming in from my side?

35
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,560

Ah, you must mean the
famous Grey Ghost.

38
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,987
The main forces of our Royal
Navy will also be arriving soon.

39
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,864
Looks like this base
is becoming central

40
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,241
to all of our activities.

41

Where are they currently?

Mm.

[PRINCE OF WALES] If Sakura
Empire is making a move,

76

this base will become one
of the hottest fronts.

77
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,297
Reinforcing it now would
be a logical defense.

True, but why wage such
a meaningless conflict?

To battle is to inflict injury.

Battle also invites injury.

154
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,047
Therefore, a battle is a
mutual exchange of pain.

00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,156
[KAGA] I battle to destroy
my enemies. Plain and simple.

160
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,787
[AKAGI giggles]
Well, excuse me.

161
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,716
Now, then, we've waited long
enough to begin this war.

162
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,801
The Sirens are on their way!

163
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,637
Intercept them!
This is not a drill!

164
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,972
[BEAGLE, BULLDOG]
Right!

165
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,437
[CLEVELAND grunts, gasps]

166
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,314
Why are the Sirens
are attacking now?

167
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,859
What horrible timing.
Coincidence... or not?

168
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:33,902
No.

169
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,281
[CLEVELAND pants]

170
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,535
Cleveland, knight of the seas!

00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,707
[CLEVELAND pants]
Ready!

172
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,982
[CLEVELAND grunts]
How's that?

173
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,443
We were developed as
the ultimate weapons.

174
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,571
Powerful enough to
take you Sirens down!

175
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,625
We've got the abilities of
the strongest warships

176
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,585
embedded in our bodies!

177

[yelps]

178
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,059
In other words, it's over!

00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,778
Javelin, full‐power!

180
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,447

[gasps]

184
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,963
[AKAGI]
It's true.

185
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:21,050
We were created by humanity
to fight against the Sirens.

186
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:25,138
But, unfortunately, a difference
in our beliefs split the four

187
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,516
major camps into
two separate factions.

188
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,767
[gasps]

189
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,602
[KAGA] The first faction
believes in only

190
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,731
using powers that were
created by humankind.

191
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,900
Eagle Union and Royal Navy
fight on this side.

192
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,069
[AKAGI]
As for the second fraction...

193
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,406
I know that emblem!

194
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,161
Their group uses Siren
technology to defeat the Sirens.

195
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,787
They are the Iron Blood.

196
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,832
And there's us, the great
Sakura Empire.

00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,851
And First Carrier Division.
Kaga.

Behold and tremble!

202
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,905
There's no end to them!

203
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,366
Those could be trouble.
Look out.

204
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,875
Interceptors?

205
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,171
Stop being mean to
my friends, right now!

206
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,477
She appears to be a carrier.

207
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,188
At that size, she's not
much of a meal.

208
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,315
But, then, prey is prey.

I knew it was her.

joined forces with Iron Blood

to lay waste to your alliance!

those who wield the most power

can control the future.

A tower of strength.

But, she holds so
much pain inside.

but soon, another will begin.
