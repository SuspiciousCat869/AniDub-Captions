[PRINCE OF WALES chuckles] It's

What could Akagi
possibly be thinking?

Maybe the fact that we couldn't
get the black Mental Cube back

32
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,520
is getting to her. That seems
understandable to me.

Now you can finally rest
in peace, gray phantom.

163
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,085
Your tireless will shall
live on inside the Black Box

Enterprise, what's happening?

171
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,742
[OBSERVER]
So you've awakened?

172
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,495
It seems some things
never change.

173
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,415
You're now the key in this
world as you were in the last.

But why? What did you do?

177
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,723
Kaga!

[QUEEN ELIZABETH]
My goodness! What is that?

182
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,826
Damn it, Big sister.
What did you do now?

183
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,580
Move out of the way, Laffy!

184
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,998
Everyone!

185
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,721
Who are you?
And what do you want?

186
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,479
I won't allow you
to stand in my way!

187
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,032
[AKAGI] This is a
manifestation of my love!

188
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,160
A feeling so strong
it surpasses time!

189
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,245
It even overwhelms the gods!

190
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,749
For Sakura Empire,
and for my dear sister!

So you... you're afraid?

00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:07,743
[ENTERPRISE] Ah.
I understand it now, finally.

198
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:14,792
It's true. I'm afraid...
of the ocean.

199
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:55,434
I've finally found you.
My sister, Amagi.
