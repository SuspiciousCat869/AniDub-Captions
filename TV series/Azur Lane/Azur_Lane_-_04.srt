00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,556
Welcome home, Akagi.

Good to see you. Kako. Furataka.

7
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,185
Did anything important
occur in our absence?

8
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,856
No, not really, although, Nagato
wishes to speak with you, Akagi.

9
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,402
I know, thank you.
I'll report to her now.

00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,861
[FURUTAKA]
Welcome home, Ayanami!

11
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,154
It's good to be back.

12
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,406
[FURUTAKA]
Are you okay?

13
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,157
[SHIGURE]
Hey! Look who's home!

Yay, there you are!

I, the great Yukikaze, have
taken the time to welcome you!

Can you believe
how lucky you are?

00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,833
Go on! Tell us! How many
of 'em did you sink?

Well, it's not like...

They're so childish.

We've returned to you safely.

Excellent work out there.
I'm glad you're in one piece.

Oh, you just wouldn't
believe it, Soryuu!

Our elders were such
harsh mistresses.

Why are our leaders
so demanding?

[HIRYUU] What's wrong, Zuikaku?
Why the long face?

A very good morning,

[ENTERPRISE]
What exactly are we doing here?

[BELFAST gasps]

44
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,220
I prefer to have coffee
in the morning.

45
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,889
A cup of coffee can
be lovely, yes.

46
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,225
But too much may
unsettle your stomach.

47
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,352
Especially if your
stomach is empty.

48
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,522
I've already had
enough to eat.

49
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,981
I think not.

50
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,318
Enterprise, we are going to
improve your way of life.

51
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,822
Maintaining a strict and regular
schedule is the key to leading

a proper and elegant existence.

Why are you so anxious to
interfere with my life?

54
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,377
What could you possibly
get out of it?

55
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,712
I'd like to witness
something special.

[ENTERPRISE]

[NING HAI] The Dragon Empery
detected suspicious activity

95
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,035
by the Sirens. We thought
it might be a sign they were

preparing to launch
a massive attack,

97
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,791
and went out on a scouting

00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,936
Sounds like some
high‐powered Sirens

00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,729
are up to something freaky.

Hornet, please, let's not
forget our manners here.

104
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,821
The Dragon Empery is our
ally and risked great loss

105
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,447
to obtain this information.

106
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,784
We would do well not to take any
of their intelligence lightly.

107
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,745
Maybe the Sirens want to strike
while Red Axis and Azur Lane

108
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,456
are at war. When we're
all distracted.

109
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,129
Increased Siren activity and an
attack from Sakura Empire,

110
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,506
which utilized new technology
giving them control over

mass‐produced Sirens.
Those can't be coincidences.

Thankfully, the Royal Navy
has already launched

113
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,389

[BELFAST] We, the Maid Corps,

[AKAGI]
Yes, but it is only a byproduct.

128

[NAGATO]
Hm.

129
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,155
You see, this Black Box
is a kind of Mental Cube.

130
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,492
The same Mental Cubes that
we warships are made out of.

[NAGATO]
Project Orochi.

Yes. Sakura Empire's hope
for a shining future.

133
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,041
Unfortunately, in order
for it to work,

134
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,085
we were forced to
make the first move.

135
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,586
That was inevitable.

136
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,963
Our clashes with the
Sirens were too frequent

137
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,424
and too destructive
for us not to act.

138
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,427
Humanity is barely
holding on as it is.

139
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,888
[AKAGI] Azur Lane's strategy
isn't feasible.

140
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,558
Sakura Empire's survival depends
on us completing this project

141
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,352
at all costs.

142
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,481
I understand.
You may be excused.

143
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:17,534
[NAGATO] I suppose no matter
the era, war never changes.

144
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,913
[KAGA] She is still hesitating.
Nagato lacks determination.

145
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,832
[AKAGI]
Oh, don't speak too ill of her.

146
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,626
She is driven by a deep,
overwhelming love.

Dear sister, she‐‐

148
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,216
But it's not enough, is it?
My love is strong.

149
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,344
Strong enough to incinerate
the world and burn on.

150
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,893
And that may happen very soon.

151

Wait, you're telling me
this Enterprise woman

154

took out Kaga?
Wow, that's intense.

[YUKIKAZE] If I were in charge,
Eagle Union and Royal Navy

chance against us!

are you kidding?

Those aren't horns,

You must learn to

Mm. Huh.

Why did they have to assign

building something massive.
The question is... where?

216

Shiranui doesn't know
how to treat a cat.

[AKASHI] I have a feline that
this is the Project Orochi ship.

00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,880
It looks just like a Siren ship.

Is it really okay to build

Is that fur real?

At this rate, I'd say
one more, perhaps,

and then we can
really have some fun.

[OBSERVER] The goal of Project
Orochi is not to create

It is, shall we say,

Someone help me!

00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,648
I must apologize, dear sister,
it seems the enemy has escaped.

322
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,276
I see. That's disappointing.

Azur Lane operatives now have
control of the Black Box.

324
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,240
Organize a recovery team,
dear Kaga.

325
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,660
But in truth, this could turn
out to be beneficial for us.

326

How is that?

327
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,498
If Azur Lane is so willing
to nurture the Black Box

328
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,084
on our behalf, perhaps we
should accept their help.

I greatly appreciate your help,
Ayanami, you saved my life.

Don't mention it,

Whoa, Ayanami, we were
so worried that

333
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,641
something happened to you!

334
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,726
Of course nothing happened
to her, she has me,

late to the party again,
