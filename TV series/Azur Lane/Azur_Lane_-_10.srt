That newly repaired

Don't you want it to be Amagi?

[KAGA] There is no place

My sister deserves better.

I have failed. I couldn't
even be a replacement.

But this is not about me.

Dear sister Akagi, whatever you

What are you? Tell me right now!

00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,253
When humanity began,

00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,589
they set sail into the ocean
thirsting for adventure.

177
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,175
But soon, a different
desire took over.

178
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,845
A powerful need to
conquer the seas.

The history of the ocean is full
of tales of war and conflict.

This is what makes up
humanity's true desire.

The drama of what
humanity truly longs for.

The looks you've stolen
are nothing but illusions.

unworthy of their likeness.

You were found unconscious
in the hall. You fainted.

You're not taking

Sure. Fine.

Ah. Good. If you would
eat decent meals regularly,

you wouldn't be so preoccupied
with negative thoughts.

I don't believe you are

You're right.

In truth, I think I might
actually be afraid of the ocean.

[BELFAST] I know. And yet,
you charge into battle.

Because.
