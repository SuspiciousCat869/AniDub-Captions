Hm... What a mystery.

You mean to tell me that
you've never seen this before?

Isn't this a Sakura Empire
secret weapon?

How am I supposed to know
about stuff like this?

[AKASHI] Maybe they got it
secretly from the Sirens?

And if they did, it must be
some seriously bad news!

Scout planes are
still patrolling.

00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,263
It's safe to assume
they have identified us.

we're hiding here.

How dreadful! What do we do?

25
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:51,398
[SHEFFIELD] Not much. The base
already knows our situation.

26
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,984
We should be patient
and wait to be rescued.

27
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,737
Then again, I highly
doubt the Sakura Empire

Do you think if we found
a way to give this back,

32
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,792
they would let us go?

33
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,627
What a terribly
ignorant question.

34
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,879
Please don't let them catch me!

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,339

turn me into a shamisen!

[SHOUKAKU] Hm. How can we
tell if these ships are safe?

What if the enemy takes control?

38
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,443
[ZUIKAKU] According to Akagi,
that's not possible.

39
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,946

is the host, we'll be okay.

That's a lot to promise, huh?

Akagi be plotting, I wonder?

You're suspicious?

they could be doing to her.

Yeah. I can confirm it's them.

What now? Should we plan
to take them out first?

Our only responsibility
is to watch the island.

There is no difference.
