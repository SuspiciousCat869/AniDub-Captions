[AMAZON giggles]

160
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,743
These could be pretty
useful in our classes.

[BAILEY laughs]

162
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,375
It's like a human city.

163
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,711
Well, we are human.

164
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,255
Don't start this
conversation again.

165
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,593
It just doesn't...
Make sense to me.

166
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,637
Please enjoy our fresh flowers!

167
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,932
[BELFAST] Hm. Enterprise,
I believe the best way to learn

168
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,476
is for you to find
elegance in your heart.

169
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,230
Find elegance? I don't
understand that, either.

170
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,275
Are you saying you want me
to become a maid, like you?

171
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,444
Well, now! Are you interested?

172
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,322
I could certainly discipline
you to become a fine maid

173
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,406
suited for any household.

174
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:43,161
[ENTERPRISE gasps]
No, I... That was a...

175
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,290
[giggles]
Maid or otherwise, dear.

176
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,459
You might find
your understanding

177
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,794
in exploring something new.

178
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,757
A hobby, some kind of job,
anything other than fighting.

179
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,386
That's not going to
be easy for me.

180
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,639
Then it's a challenge
worthy of you.

181
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,392
Life is about adventure.
Seek and you shall find.

182
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,562
[ENTERPRISE]
I suppose that might be true.

183
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:14,317
[BELFAST sighs]
Ponder it as long as you need.

184
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:19,197
Because that's how we got here.
It's what makes us truly human.

[LAFFEY]
Ah. Shiny and clean.

188

But...

[JAVELIN] But... I still believe
we don't have to fight!

Wow, where did you get those?

00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,524
[SHIP GIRL J] I want a cute

[UNICORN gasps]

202

[OKLAHOMA] So did you pick up
those skivvies I told you about?

You'll have to show me later!

How did you get all wet?

Oh we were having
a small pre‐soak.

Are you taking a bath, too?
Let's go in together, okay?

Excuse me.

Um...

Oh wow. Those are really nice.

Sheffield, quick question.

00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,465
So uh. Is the fancy
underwear like a cultural thing?

223
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,593
It's not. I usually
tend to do without.

I'm sorry, I think
I misunderstood you.

electricity into the water.

You don't mean that.

very wrong, but...

[JAVELIN]
I don't want to give up on her.

be friends with Ayanami!

Mm! I do, too.

That seems quite
unlike you, doesn't it?

It is. Maybe I'm just feeling
a little emotional right now.

yourself warm out here.

Let me join you
for just one drink.

316
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,657
[KAGA] I decline.
You'll ruin the taste.

317
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,784
[PRINZ EUGEN chuckles]

318
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,703
Always playing hard
to get, aren't you?

319
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:32,374
They took the black Mental Cube.
Are you not at all worried?

320
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,502
What are you and
your sister scheming?

321
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,087
I'm sorry, but that's
none of your concern.

322
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,757
[PRINZ EUGEN]
Are you sure you and Akagi...

323
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,010
...are, in fact,
after the same thing?

324
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,971
[KAGA growls]
That's enough from you!

325
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:54,438
[PRINZ EUGEN] One‐sided love can
be so painful, don't you think?

326
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,067
[PRINZ EUGEN] <i>Guten nacht.</i>
Have a pleasant night.

327
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,443
[grunts]

328
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,912
[AKAGI] Soon, we'll meet
again very soon.

329
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,500
[AKAGI]
My dear sister Amagi.
