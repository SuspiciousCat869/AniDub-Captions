00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:15,390
[YORKTOWN] Look at that.
The ocean is so lovely today.

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,769
I've never felt any form of
beauty when looking at it.

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,564
From the moment we were born,
the ocean was a place for war,

4
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,317
and there is nothing
lovely about that.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,071
Besides, the ocean
is the place where...

What you're thinking is wrong.

Huh?

00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,992
[YORKTOWN] You seem
to forget, darling sister,

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,247
that we are not human.
We are ships in human forms.

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,499
Therefore, the sea
is a part of us.

11
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:44,044
It is engraved deep
within our souls.

Uh...

00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,340
I have faith that one
day you'll remember.

00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:52,010
So many people have placed
their trust in your name.

May Azur Lane be blessed.

[PRINZ EUGEN] I assure you,
it is not. This is Belfast.

The second ship in the Edinburgh
class of light cruisers

33

from Royal Navy.

34
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,638
Und despite her looks,

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,433
she is still a legendary
warrior of the seas.

36

Do not underestimate her.

37

Thank you, Prinz Eugen
of Iron Blood.

38
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,981
Always a pleasure to
cross paths with you.

39
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,858
Though I did not expect
the two of us to be

40
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,443
meeting on this journey.

41
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,404
Neither did I.
But, since we are both here,

42
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,114
it would be good
to settle grudges

43
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,950
away from Iron Blood
and Royal Navy.

44
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,079
I make no objections
to this proposal.

Isn't that?

00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,379
[BELFAST] However, I should
remind you that we never

48
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,007
battle at less than full force.

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,398
It's the main Royal Navy fleet.

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,860
[BELFAST] Well then, let us know
when you've made your decision.

51
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,988
[sighs] I suppose it's best
to quit while we're ahead.

What did I say? And now
I expect apologies from

That's right. You saved me

Thank you.
Sorry for your trouble.

Mm. Miss?

Perhaps you should take a

she rescued the

[JAVELIN exhales] How did I get
stuck with all this stuff?

163
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,954
Javelin, why do you have such
a worried look on your face?

Oh, do I?

00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,589
if I'm being honest.

[HAMMANN gasps] What? Why?
How'd I get in pictures?

Though it does have

I look at it and the roar
of artillery fills my ears.

I can smell gunpowder as
I feel the flame's heat

[ENTERPRISE] Shouldn't you
be with Unicorn?

252
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,892
[BELFAST] It would be
more beneficial for her

to be amongst her friends

[ENTERPRISE] I see. Then tell
me why you're following me.

I was hoping you wouldn't notice
as my queen has asked me

256
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,616
to discreetly look into this.
Unfortunately, I do not possess

257

the skills necessary
to be subtle about it.

[BELFAST] I hope you won't
mind my being blunt.

262
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,049
From what I can tell,
you seem to be growing weary

263
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,260
of fighting with such force.
Meanwhile, you appear to be

264
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,388
unconcerned with your own
safety and survival.

265
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,352
[BELFAST] The way you are
living is completely flawed.

266
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,354
If you remain on this course,

267
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,774
you'll lose sight of the
reason why we battle.

[CLEVELAND]
Sorry about that!

274

It's rough, but we can't
ignore a distress call.

275
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,100
Besides we should be
getting pretty close.

Do you think they lost
their way in the storm?

Yeah, maybe.
Wait a second! Enterprise?

Where did you come from?
How long have you been there?

Your rig hasn't
been repaired yet!

280
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,945
[gasps] Is it standard for
you to begin a mission

281
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,655
in such a weakened state?

282
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,284
Wait! There's something
up ahead! Look.

283
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,753
Sirens! What are
they doing here?

284
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,422
No! Look closer!

285
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,758
[CLEVELAND gasps] They've
already finished the battle.

286
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,511
I know those ships! Did they
send out the distress signal?

287
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,763
Were they battling the
Sirens this whole time?

288
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,016
If that's the case,
then we have to hurry!

289
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,603
But, I don't know how we'll
be able to spot enemies

290
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,314
in this storm.
We have to be careful.

291
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,316
I'll need someone
to cover my flank.

We tracked your distress signal.

305
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,931
Did you defeat the
Sirens out here

306
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,225
and can you tell me
what happened?

How is it still moving?

318
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,397
Go, Ping Hai. Run away!

319
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,775
[PING HAI] No! It's my turn
to protect you this time!

[BELFAST] Hm! I have a
better understanding

327
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,666
of who you are now.

Your exterior is tough,

00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,643
but your heart
is soft, Enterprise.

Let's go.

336
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:16,001
Apologies for making
a personal remark.

337
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,420
But I've made a
few observations.

338
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,421
Have you?

339
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,132
I've much to teach you
if you will allow it.

340
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,136
You have warrior strength.

341
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,640
But I could show you the
decorum expected of a lady.

342
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,812
Huh?
