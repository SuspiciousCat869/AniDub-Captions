I still don't understand,

00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,391
or know the right answer.

3
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:22,147
But so what? I know this
is wrong, and I don't like it!

[BOTH gasp]

[AYANAMI grunts]

6
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,902
[ARK ROYAL] If you're
thinking of leaving, don't.

7
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,447
You're being watched.

8
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,950
Don't worry, we're not
going to bite.

9
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,498
Can you at least tell me
if this is Azur Lane?

10
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,544
You did your research.
Not that I'm surprised.

11
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,505
The battle's over now.

12
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,717
We found you unconscious,
so we brought you back here.

13
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,137
And that means you're
officially a prisoner of war.

14
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,472
[AYANAMI grunts]

15
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,142
What about the other two?
Are they okay?

16
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:44,354
Your two enemies?
Worried about them, are you?

17
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,208
[CLEVELAND] Talk about reckless.
What were you thinking?

18
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,794
So y'all made an
excessive effort

19
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,796
so you could save an enemy?

20
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:37,384
Shoot. Y'ain't tryin to earn
any medals, that's for sure.

21
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,885
I apologize.

22
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,973
No, please, wait. There's nobody
else to blame here but me.

23
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,767
I am the one responsible
for allowing it.

24
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,103
That's noble of you to say.

25
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,565
But we need to send the
right message to the others.

26
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,318
[HORNET]
Well, okay then.

27
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,488
Laffey, Javelin, as a
consequence of your actions,

28
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,574
you're on "prisoner
supervision duty."

29
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,825
[BOTH gasp]

30
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,869
We've got a strict rule
that Prisoners of War

31
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,829
need maximum care.

32
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,164
[JAVELIN]
So that means...?

33
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,582
[HORNET]
We're countin' on you.

34
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,208
Okay!

35
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,963
That was a light punishment.

36
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,549
[CLEVELAND] Well, there's no
need to be overly harsh.

37
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,676
[HORNET]
Yeah she's right.

38
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,345
Just like coffee, tea,
and life in general,

39
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,431
sweetness always helps.

40
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:28,143
I suppose. Anyway,
that's the real problem.

41
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,856
[CLEVELAND gasps]
What's with the Cube?

42
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,691
Ever since the battle ended,

43
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,903
the Cube has been
behaving quite abnormally.

44
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,990
Unfortunately, there's no way
to know exactly what it means.

45
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,535
The Black Mental Cube is
the key to Project Orochi.

46
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,872
I've no doubt that this is
all part of the Sirens' plan.

47
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,248
Well, shoot.

48
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,543
This definitely has something
to do with my sister, right?

49
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,591
What's the update on Enterprise?

50
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,552
We're performing diagnostics
on her body and her gear.

51
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,722
But so far, nothing out
of the ordinary.

52
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:09,226
I always knew her to be
an exceptional ship, but...

53
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,361
[CLEVELAND]
I was afraid of her back there.

54
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,905
She was terrifying.

55
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,629
[VESTAL] Oh my goodness,
there you are!

56
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,340
We still haven't finished
all of your checkups yet!

57
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,634
I really need you to stay put.

58
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,804
Right... Apologies.

59
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,560
Please be honest with me.
Are you okay?

60
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:58,441
I am, but we will have to fight.
For now, we have no choice.

61
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,026
Don't you agree?

62
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,824
Get well soon, Enterprise.

63
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:14,124
I don't understand this.
What does it mean, Yorktown?

64
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,877
The deceptive beauty
of the ocean.

65
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,213
The array of emotions
attached to my name.

66
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,340
Nothing makes sense.

We've so many things to buy.
Let's do that first.

You're going to be living here
for quite a while, right?

That requires lots of "things!"

So, we're going to the shop
first! I just love "things!"

we were just talking about!

As long as I have customers,

I can do business from anywhere
in the world that I want.

Akagi's with the Sirens?
What gives?

She was always a little scary,

but Akagi would never go behind
her friends' back for anything.

She never had a chance.

I can't believe she was
captured by the enemy.

[ZUIKAKU]
I'm so sorry.

135
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,228
There was nothing I could
do to bring her back.

136
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,980
I know. None of this is
your fault, Zuikaku!

137
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,567
[YUUDACHI] I'm so worried.
Is she going to be okay?

138
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,112
Are they going to
bully her over there?

139
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,282
She was never created to be
one of the lucky ships like me.

140
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,535
I'm so sad for her!

141
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,749
It's not right.
I was the rear guard.

142
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,127
But she's the one who saved me.

143
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,505
Quit being so negative!
What's wrong with you?

144
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,508
What if she goes hungry
because they forgot to feed her?

145
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,511
What if she's eating rice
while everyone else has meat?

146
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,055
If only I could've
been a little stronger!

147
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,391
Where is all this gloom
and doom coming from?

148
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,726
None of this is our fault!

149
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,694
[NAGATO] So Akagi has
still not returned to base.

150
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,779
Unfortunately, we did
lose the commander

And the Black Box, it still
remains with Azur Lane.

153
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,954
The situation is quite dire.

154
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,290
[NAGATO] Kaga is currently
making a strong case

155

for pushing forward
with Project Orochi?

156
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,671
Are you suspicious
of her? Be honest.

157
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:15,550
I believe it's too dangerous to
move forward with the project.

00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,553
I never wanted to have
to doubt a friend.

159
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,726
[YUUGURE]
Thank you for being patient.

160
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,982
Things are getting really
serious out here, aren't they?

161
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,027
Sakura Empire's in
a perilous situation.

162
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,946
Maybe this is a good
opportunity for us as allies.

163
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,741
Should we, Iron Blood, take a
chance and help them?

164
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:44,287
Really? You want to utilize this
chaos und attack our allies?

165
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,372
How very sinister of you!

166
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,125
That sounds nothing like
what I said und you know it!

167
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,044
I'm kidding, calm down.

168
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,963
I know you're anxious
to rescue Ayanami.

169
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,217
Yeah, the two of you seemed
uncomfortably close at times.

170
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,219
What? I don't know what
you're suggesting,

171
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,347
but I know you're wrong.
There's nothing personal there.

172
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,558
I agree that if we're going to
make a move, now's the time.

173
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,602
What should we do?

174
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,022
Hi. I thought you might like
something sweet to eat.

175
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,150
[PRINZ EUGEN]
Aren't you a cutie?

176
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,985
I could just gobble you up.

177
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,029
[YUUGURE]
Miss, please, control yourself!

178
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,407
This is kind of important,
can you please stay on topic?

179
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:25,745
Of course. What moves
would you like to make?

180
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,416
What a lovely shot.

181
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,961
So impressive. Brilliant.

182
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,215
[EDINBURGH]
Nice shot!

183
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,638
I still don't understand
those Sirens.

184
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,724
I know they're our enemy
of course, but what else?

185
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,935
Where do they come from
and what do they want?

186
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,312
We've all asked the
question many times,

187
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:55,149
but no one seems to know
how to find the answer.

188
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,529
Why do the Sirens even bother
interacting with humanity?

189
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,490
It doesn't make sense if
their goal is to eradicate us.

190
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,786
They should just do it
instead of wasting time.

191
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:11,708
Project Orochi is the answer
to everything. And her.

192
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,462
Excellent par!

193
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:20,008
[HOOD] Pardon my assumption, but
are you referring to Enterprise?

194
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,217
[QUEEN ELIZABETH]
Mm‐hm.

195
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,429
If so, I was just thinking.

196
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,640
Illustrious always had her
eyes on Enterprise as well.

197
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,558
Of course she did,

198
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,519
I recall she's quite an
uncanny judge of character.

199
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,398
That's why I brilliantly
assigned Belfast to Enterprise.

200
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,610
Oh dear. I wonder if Belfast
sees something in her.

201
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,199
[ILLUSTRIOUS] What we had feared
most has become reality.

202
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,868
[BELFAST gasps]

203
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,953
You must've known the truth.

204
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,331
About Enterprise and
her state of mind?

205
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,623
[grunts]

206
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,128
No matter how much mighty
power fills her body,

207
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:02,925
her spirit is delicate and
she's always been vulnerable.

208
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,304
We all knew she was at risk.

209
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:11,601
There was nothing we could do.
But it comes with a consequence.

210
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,854
Enterprise has no choice
now but to face herself.

211
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,107
I see. Should we
expect her to recover?

212
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,027
[BELFAST]
I cannot say.

213
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,281
[UNICORN] I think Enterprise
is afraid of the sea,

214
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:30,286
but she doesn't like to
talk about it. Or show it.

215
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,205
But even though she
was really scared,

216
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,749
it didn't stop her
from saving me.

217
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,584
[chuckles]

218
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,796
Yes, you are quite correct.

219
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:52,058
[JAVELIN hums]

220
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,937
We're far from the base.
Where are you taking me?

221
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,439
Turns out Akashi already took
care of the necessities,

222
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,608
so we've got some
time to ourselves.

223
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,027
I thought perhaps we
might go to town.

224
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,988
[AYANAMI]
Hm?

225
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,202
Hello! And good day.

00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:15,206
Good day, Illustrious!
Oh, and good day, Unicorn!

This is a surprise.

00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,796
What brings you out this way?

00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,048
Right! We were just
on our way to‐‐

232
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,716
A date.

There's always something
going on out here!

when you said "date?"

want to come play with us?

Bring it. I ain't scared.

[JAVELIN] Hey! Stop fighting!
Don't you have manners?

This is not the time or place!

I mean, honestly.

have learned to have some class.

like in Sakura Empire?

Uh... It's the same.

Everyone sits together,
no matter their age.

They're all nice to each other.
And share delicious meals.

Are you okay?
It's just a shallow cut!

to disinfect it for you!

Uh...

The Orochi contains
everything we need.

It has traveled every ocean.
Collecting wills as it passes.

00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,679
I see.

273

That's right. Akagi's will
is here as well.

let it die, no matter what.

[KAGA] Yes, that's right.

about things.

If Azur Lane is supposed
to be my enemy,

then why are you
all so nice to me?

What is the fighting for?
Is there even a reason?

The more I try to
understand it,

the more confused I make myself.

do you still want to fight?

I don't know that answer.

is that I don't like fighting.
