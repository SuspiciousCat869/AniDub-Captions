1
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,904
[LONDON] I see. When the special
combat zone collapsed earlier,

2
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,699
it caused the rest of the nearby
area to become unstable as well.

3
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,744
Are the Sirens the ones
behind all of this chaos?

4
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,579
It may have to do
with Project Orochi,

5
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,499
or that mysterious event
caused by Enterprise.

6
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,959
Something tells
me they're related.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,337
Whatever the case, If our
goal is to thwart their plan,

8
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:51,885
then we can't let the
Sakura Empire escape.

9
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:55,472
[COLUMBIA] Uh, Big Sis?
Any idea what's going on?

10
00:00:55,514 --> 00:01:00,018
Why would I know?
It's all surprise to me, too.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,480
What the heck is
she doin? Seriously.

12
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,535
[BELFAST]
Enterprise, why?

13
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,094
[LAFFEY whimpers]
So cold outside.

14
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,096
We got separated from
the others somehow.

15
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,807
We have to find a way to meet
back up with the fleet soon.

16
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,350
[BOTH grunt]

17
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,443
It's Ayanami.

18
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,614
[ENTERPRISE] There was once
a time when the world was

19
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:22,202
a simple place. Invaders from
the outside were our enemies.

20
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,539
Battle was the sole reason
for our existence.

21
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,710
In that time, humanity was
backed into a corner.

22
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,087
It was a tough world to live in.

23
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,006
But our mission to
fight kept us going.

24
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,010
Fighting our enemies.
Protecting our loved ones.

25
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:45,308
Those two things were one and
the same. Without contradiction.

26
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,852
However...

27
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,236
[LAFFEY sneezes]

28
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,364
[AYANAMI]
Oh great. This again?

29
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,408
I don't understand
why you won't fight!

30
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,619
Why are you just standing there?
What's the matter with you?

31
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,581
[LAFFEY] We told you before.
We just don't want to.

32
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,124
We want to be friends.

33
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,000
That's right!

34
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,586
Why would we try to hurt someone
we'd rather be close to?

35
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,629
[AYANAMI] Because we were
created to be enemies,

36
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,464
that's why!

37
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,423
[LAFFEY]
Doesn't matter.

38
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,966
What is wrong with you?

39
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,260
We're warships who fight
opposing warships.

40
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,013
How is that so impossible
to understand?

41
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,142
[JAVELIN] You're wrong!
It's not that simple!

42
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,769
There's more to us than that!

43
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:31,980
[LAFFEY]
Watch out!

44
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,861
[YUUDACHI growls]
Stop picking on her!

45
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,116
Yeah! What she said!

46
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,368
[JAVELIN] Please stop!
We don't want to fight with you!

47
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,498
[YUKIKAZE] I hope you don't
think we're falling for that!

48
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,750
[SHIGURE] Why are you aimlessly
staring into the horizon?

49
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,667
Let's go!

50
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,711
[YUKIKAZE chuckles]
Guess we'll have to settle this

51
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,254
another time!

52
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,548
[YUUDACHI] Don't expect
us to go easy on you!

53
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,925
Ayanami, wait!

54
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,719
[LAFFEY]
Javelin!

55
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,185
[BELFAST] Can you hear me?
Are you alright?

56
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,522
I think so.

57
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,025
Then let's go.
It's not safe here.

58
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:31,122
[ENTERPRISE] This world we live
in now is a mystery to me.

59
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,668
I can't figure out how it
ever became so complex.

60
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,338
We all face a common enemy,
but for some reason,

61
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,091
our guns keep getting
pointed toward each other.

62
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:54,229
[ENTERPRISE]
And I... I don't understand.

63
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,943
[KAGA, AKAGI giggle]

64
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,194
[ENTERPRISE]
Hm?

65
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:06,241
[giggling continues]

66
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,460
[AMAGI sighs] It appears
that they're still lost

67
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,548
in their own thoughts.
They go everywhere together.

68
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,885
But when they cry,
they cry alone.

69
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:31,141
They're so clumsy. Both of them.
They remind me of you.

70
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,105
Really? Have we met before?

71
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,815
[AMAGI]
Mm‐mm.

72
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,651
We have not.

73
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,362
Although, we were both
born with the memories

74
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,698
of warships embedded inside us.

75
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,035
A sea of countless emotions
buried deep within.

76
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,121
Beyond the boundaries of time.

77
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,374
Therefore, you carry the
prayers of humanity.

78
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,710
Please do not forget.

79
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,061
[gasps]

80
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,772
[YAMASHIRO gasps]
Look who's finally awake!

81
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,815
[KAGA]
Dear sister!

82
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,278
[ZUIKAKU gasps]
Kaga! Please slow down.

83
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,281
You've already been
severely hurt.

84
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:32,077
What happened?
I'm trying to remember.

85
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,124
The last memory I have was

86
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,502
fighting the Grey
Ghost and then...

87
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,341
My sister. Is she...?
Tell me where Akagi went!

88
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,592
Please!

89
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,972
[ZUIKAKU gasps]
She's um...

90
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,729
What do you think's
gonna happen next?

91
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,482
It's too difficult to
try to understand.

92
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,693
[ISUZU whimpers]
I'm so scared.

93
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,737
There there.
It'll be okay, you'll see.

94
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,240
[SHIRATSUYU] I'm so happy
that you're not hurt!

95
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,284
[SHIGURE] Oh! Thank you.
Do you know what's going on?

96
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:13,952
[KAGEROU]
You know,

97
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,329
I was wanting to ask you
the same question!

98
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,541
It feels like we're being shown
some kind of illusion.

99
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,129
[SHOUKAKU] Why isn't Zuikaku
paying attention to me?

100
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,173
It's no fair. She's always
talking to Kaga!

101
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,842
[HIRYUU chuckles]

102
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,219
[SHOUKAKU] Did she
forget I'm her sister?

103
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,766
We still don't have any leads
that will help us find Akagi.

104
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,311
The rest of the ones who were
separated have been found.

105
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,564
If she's not back by now, well.

106
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,150
Does that mean
Grey Ghost got her?

107
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,443
[SHOUKAKU gasps]

108
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,530
It's too early to be
thinking in those terms.

109
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,657
We're just not searching
hard enough.

110
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,827
You think? What more
should we be doing?

111
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,539
[ISE]
This is a pretty dangerous area.

112
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,125
We should probably get going.

113
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,919
Please wait. There is
one more issue.

114
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,300
It's not moving no
matter how hard I try.

115
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,594
Uh. Did it overheat?

116
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,347
[AKATSUKI] Hm. Could this be
another ploy by the enemy?

117
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,600
I wonder what happened
to all of them.

118
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,396
[ATAGO] The mass‐produced
Sirens have shut down.

119
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,816
Every one of them. Wow.

120
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,402
Well, that's unexpected.
What now?

121
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,451
[ISE] Is this related to the
condition of the ocean?

122
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,913
Maybe it's because of Orochi
and the severed connection.

123
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,791
Losing the Black Mental Cube
was stressful for everyone.

124
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,084
It was a huge loss.

125
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,461
[SHOUKAKU] Yeah, but there were
some balls dropped though.

126
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,921
I mean on the Orochi thing.

127
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,131
What are you saying?

128
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,466
[SHOUKAKU] Just that it all
could've been handled

129
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,759
much differently.

130
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,928
How were we supposed to
know to control the Sirens

131
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,972
with that Cube? None of it
was explained properly.

132
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,392
Now is not the time! It doesn't
matter who's to blame!

133
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,978
[SHOUKAKU] And what's with the
force‐field enchantment stuff?

134
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,189
Or whatever it is Akagi uses?

135
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,442
There are way too many secrets,
don't you think?

136
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:14,030
The 1st Carrier Division elders
have been behaving strangely.

137
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,324
What exactly are they hiding?

138
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,135
[BELFAST] Are you two concerned
about that Sakura Empire girl?

139
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:39,013
[JAVELIN gasps]
Oh. I guess you saw?

140
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,058
[BELFAST] Yes. I wish I
had been there sooner.

141
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,769
I'm sorry that I was
too late to help you.

142
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,314
Um. Aren't you mad at us?

143
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,691
[BELFAST]
Pardon?

144
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,277
'Cause Ayanami is our enemy.

145
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,781
We're supposed to fight her,
but neither of us wants to.

146
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:01,911
We just don't know
how to change that.

147
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,581
[BELFAST] Well then,
you should give it more time.

148
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,748
[gasps]

149
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,168
[BELFAST] We can't let the
way we were created long ago

150
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,587
define our decisions now.

151
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,882
We can move in any direction
we please and that power

152
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,301
should not be taken lightly.

153
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,762
Try to remember, we were
made to fight and defend.

154
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,806
We're not obligated to destroy.

155
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,184
[JAVELIN laughs]
Yeah!

156
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,569
This area is
especially dangerous.

157
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,739
We'll have to move quickly.
Try to regroup with the fleet.

158
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,574
[JAVELIN]
But what about you?

159
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,453
No matter. I have to stay
back and find Enterprise.

160
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,163
I owe that to her.

161
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,957
As a maid, it's my duty
to stay by her side.

162
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,417
I can't let her down.

163
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,502
[LAFFEY]
I want to help you, too.

164
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,256
Do you mean that?

165
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,218
So do I! We'll both help
you find Enterprise!

166
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,762
And then go home together!

167
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,138
[soflty chuckles]

168
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,976
[KAGA] What was that?
Say it one more time!

169
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,520
Kaga, try to control
your temper.

170
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,189
This order's
effective immediately.

171
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,733
We are terminating our
search for Akagi.

172
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,694
All ships, Reconvene back
at headquarters at once.

173
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,780
We'll see you there. Be careful.

174
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,660
[KAGA gasps, growls]
That's unacceptable!

175
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,204
You cannot leave our
flagship behind!

176
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,831
[SOURYUU] Look, you're right,
losing our flagship

177
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,292
was quite unfortunate,
and the mass‐produced

178
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,419
Sirens are not
functional either.

179
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,422
Therefore, it is not advisable
for us to stay in this area

180
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,882
if we don't have to.

181
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,260
Our fleet no longer has
the ability to continue

182
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,637
the operation as it is,
and I am unwilling to

183
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,890
risk the lives of everyone here
to search for just one ship.

184
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,352
[KAGA gasps]
Souryuu!

185
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:57,735
Where is she?
Please come back, Akagi.

186
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,284
I'm so sorry.
What else can we do?

187
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,829
Dear sister Souryuu.

188
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,293
[ALL gasp]

189
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,296
Reporting for duty.

190
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,924
[HELENA] We've tracked
down their main fleet.

191
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,135
Sakura Empire's not far.

192
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,722
So we have to do this?

193
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,934
Yes. The Siren power they
control is too dangerous.

194
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,144
If we let them go now,

195
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,980
the situation is likely
to get much worse.

196
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,362
[HORNET] Nothin' else we
can do. This here's war.

197
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,244
[HIRYUU] They're not willing
to let us slip away freely,

198
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,871
are they?

199
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,165
And unfortunately, we will
not be able to take them

200
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,334
head on in our current state.

201
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,171
[HIRYUU] Then for now I suggest
that I pull the Azur Lane away.

202
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,341
Please Sister,
command the retreat.

203
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,635
[ZUIKAKU] No, don't.
I will be the rear guard.

204
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,220
Zuikaku?

205
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,723
As your elder, I will
not allow you to do that!

206
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,310
This isn't a responsibility
you should take on.

207
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:17,065
I know how she feels.
So do you, I would think.

208
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:22,445
Sisters are special. I can't
imagine suddenly losing you.

209
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,947
I've no doubt I'd
break down, too.

210

[SHOUKAKU gasps]

211
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,206
You don't have to
worry about that.

212
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,917
Your sister will always
be by your side.

213
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,920
Take care of each other and
return to base quickly.

214
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,970
[ZUIKAKU]
Everything is going to be okay.

215
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,099
I may not look like it,
but I'm actually a lucky ship!

Promise you'll look
out for each other.

00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,898
We promise, Shoukaku.

[grunts]

There they go.

220
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,440
[AYANAMI]
I'm feeling very confused,

221
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,151
and I don't know
what to do about it.

222
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,527
About what?

223
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,737
Well...

224
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,001
Dodged that one.

225
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,719
Humans are so entertaining,
and so strange.

226
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,514
They claim to hate war but
insist on fighting each other.

227
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,476
The internal contradictions
are exhausting.

228
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,394
These girls are like mirrors,

229
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,230
reflecting the thoughts and
histories of the humans.

230
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,275
It seems conflict is
the core of humankind.

231
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,735
Well...

232
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:30,364
...the world will change many
times, but war stays the same.

233
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,658
Goodness. You brought that here?

234
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,245
Oh yes, she still has
quite a role to play.

235
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,792
And I'm so grateful
to Enterprise.

236
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,461
Because of her,
the Black Mental Cube

237
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,671
has acquired a huge
amount of data.

238
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,341
I believe it's enough
to start the project.

Yes. At long last.
