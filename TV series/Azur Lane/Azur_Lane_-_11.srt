[NAKA, HATAKAZE pant]

00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,040
[AMAGI]
Huh? What's all this fuss?

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,160
[HATAKAZE] Oh, Amagi!
I'm so glad we found you.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,330
[NAKA] Akagi and Kaga
started fighting again

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,500
and we need your help!

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,660
[AMAGI sighs]
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,290
When are those two
going to grow up?

8
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,950
[EDINBURGH]
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

9
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,700
[laughs]
Seriously?

10
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,200
You're not even gonna try
to make this fun for me?

11
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,450
[grunts]

12
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,620
What?

13
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,250
[gasps]

14
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,870
Siren!

15
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,040
Oh, yay! It's Enterprise!

16
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,830
[gasps]

17
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,790
She did it!

18
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,160
[PURIFIER laughs]

19
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,870
[PURIFIER chuckles]
Alright, that was fun!

20
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,540
Too bad, that's my cue to leave,
but I'll catch you later!

21
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,500
See you ladies at
the final stage!

22
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,370
[SHEFFIELD gasps]
She hit her own ships?

23
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,370
The "final stage".

24
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,620
[ALL sigh]

25
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,370
[BELFAST]
You always do tend to show up

26
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,580
right in the nick of time.

27
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,000
[chuckles]

28
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,450
I've no choice.

29
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,870
I can't just sit by when you're
out here being reckless.

30
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,200
Always the knight
in shining armor.

31
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,120
Thanks for your protection.

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,500
Spare me. That's not it.

33
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,620
[SHEFFIELD grunts]

34
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,500
[EDINBURGH, NORFOLK giggle]

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,540
[BELFAST chuckles]

36
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,250
[TESTER A] We've outrun
the Sakura Empire fleet.

37
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,250
Of course they were
a little too confused

38
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,200
to put up very much of a fight.

39
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,120
We're close now.

40
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,160
[TESTER A] I have to say, this
is quite a magnificent scheme.

41
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,500
Well of course, a battle like
this one needs to be dramatic.

42
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,160
It's only fair. Battles are
manifestations of will.

43
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,870
It is not just power that drives
them and gives them strength.

44
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,000
[TESTER] You know, it's
difficult to understand you 

45
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,910
when you start to
wax poetic like that.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,290
Oh, she knows.

47
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,950
She just loves to be
pretentious, that's all.

48
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,540
[TESTER B] My... Looks like
someone took a beating.

49
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,620
You know I always enjoy a
little bit of roughhousing.

50
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,580
[OBSERVER] Now we begin. Time
to stage an encore of the past.

51
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,290
Or perhaps release our
calculation for perfect future.

52
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,200
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
It's playtime.

53
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,790
Rise and shine, beautiful!

54
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,200
[grunts]

55
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,200
[gasps]

56
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,120
[gasps]
My sister?

57
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,330
[chuckles]

58
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,750
Akagi. My dear sister!

59
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,080
[KAGA gasps]
I'm so glad you're alive!

60
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,540
[AKAGI]
Yes. All as the gods intended.

61
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,330
Look, Kaga.

62
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,620
This is it. The power of Orochi
that we desired for so long.

63
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,000
[DACE gasp]
Huh?

64
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,750
[gasps]

65
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,790
[CLEVELAND]
Wh-what is this?

66
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,750
[HORNET] It's obviously
gotta be a Siren attack.

67
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,580
But, why target a
deserted island?

68
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,750
Perhaps they merely
mean to taunt us.

69
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,080
But they underestimate
our power.

70
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,950
[HOOD] Indeed, Majesty.
But this could be a test.

71
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,450
And if they use whatever did
that to strike this base...

72
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,790
Kaboom! We'll be toast for sure.

73
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,410
[HELENA] I think this
might be what did it.

74
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,700
A few hours before the island
was vaporized, a huge unknown 

75
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,370
vessel took off from the
coast of the Sakura Empire.

76
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,580
Its destination unknown.

77
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,200
Sheffy. That ship.

78
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,540
Indeed. It has to be the one.

79
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,830
It has the characteristics
of the ship hidden beneath

80
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,540
Sakura Empire.

81
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,040
[HOOD] So this is <i>Orochi</i> .
What an enormous beast.

82
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,790
[PRINCE OF WALES] The Sakura
Empire port sustained

83
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,950
heavy damage from the
ship as it departed.

84
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,910
I expect that must
have come as a shock.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,540
To them, and to the
Iron Blood as well.

86
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,750
[ILLUSTRIOUS]
If that's true,

87
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,830
then the Sirens were
always the sole threat.

88
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,410
I suppose that will
end our dealings

89
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,450
with the Red Axis for now.

90
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,660
[ENTERPRISE]
Not quite.

91
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,330
[ALL gasp]

92
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,410
[ENTERPRISE] Think for a second.
This is just the beginning.

93
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,750
We aren't done with
any of them yet.

94
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,540
What next, Miss Enterprise?

95
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,250
[ENTERPRISE]
We go after the Sirens directly.

96
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,160
We're going to put a stop to
whatever it is they're plotting.

97
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,700
[BELFAST]
Hm.

98
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,160
Their impact reaches
far beyond just Azur Lane.

99
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,160
The <i>Orochi</i> is a threat
to all of humanity.

100
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,620
Well then, let's not lay
about and get a move on!

101
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,370
We must brush off the
humiliation of our failures.

102
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,790
A stiff upper lip is
the Royal Navy way!

103
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,330
And the Eagle Union way is pure,
cold payback, so let's do this!

104
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,910
[ALL]
Mm-hm!

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,450
One last fight. Here we go.

106
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,250
[grunts]

107
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,200
[Z1 laughs] Guess you
didn't see that coming.

108
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,700
[PRINZ EUGEN]
Indeed I did not.

109
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,330
Who would have expected such
rash behavior from Kaga?

110
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,790
She's not acting alone, it's
clear the Sirens are involved.

111
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,540
So Akagi and Kaga were working
with Sirens this whole time?

112
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,830
It's foolish that the
entire Sakura Empire

113
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,580
somehow missed
there was a mole.

114
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,580
[PRINZ EUGEN] How do you know
it was only the Sakura Empire?

115
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,910
We may have spies
in Iron Blood as well.

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,410
And, we should consider there
could be Siren influence

117
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,500
in the higher echelons
of all camps.

118
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,620
[Z1]
Is there someone you suspect?

119
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,910
[PRINZ EUGEN]
Nein, never mind.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,540
There's no value in
dwelling on that.

121
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,450
At least for the time being.

122
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,700
[TAKAO] What in the gods'
names have you done, Kaga.

123
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,580
There is no
explanation for this.

124
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,290
[sighs]
I underestimated her.

125
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,830
I never thought she
would go this far.

126
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,660
So, uh. What happens
when we find her?

127
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,750
[FUSOU] If she truly is in
league with the Sirens,

128
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,250
that is a grave betrayal
of the Sakura Empire.

129
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,950
And if worse comes to worst,

130
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,410
we may need to strike her
down along with the <i>Orochi</i> .

131
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,370
No. Please no!

132
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,330
That can't happen,
it's not right.

133
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,370
It's gonna be okay.

134
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,370
[YUKIKAZE] Ayanami, captured.
Akagi missing.

135
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,410
Ever since the start of
this stupid battle.

136
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,080
only horrible things
have happened.

137
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,080
Jeez, pull yourself together!

138
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,620
We don't know for sure yet that
they actually betrayed us!

139
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,910
I know how you feel, but...

140
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,540
[ZUIKAKU] She's the only one
with sense. This is wrong.

141
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,160
We haven't been fighting all
this time to take down a friend.

142
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,910
I know, and yet...

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,580
We're bringing Kaga home,
no matter what.

144
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,080
If she won't listen to us,

145
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,700
we'll just have to slap
some sense into her.

146
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,000
You hear me?

147
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,620
She's our family and we're
not gonna play along

148
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,160
with these Sirens' schemes!

149
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,160
[YUKIKAZE]
Thanks, Zuikaku!

150
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,950
[BOTH gasp]

151
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,000
[TAKAO, ATAGO]
mm.

152
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,500
[YAMASHIRO chucles]

153
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,250
How wonderful it is
to see you all grown up.

154
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,000
It's bittersweet,
but I'm so proud.

155
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,370
Dear sister.
You look like you're--

156
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,540
[AKAGI]
Oh, darling...

157
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,700
You don't have to be afraid.

158
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,000
Everything's fine. I promise
I won't leave you again.

159
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,450
No, wait.

160
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,950
Kaga?

161
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,540
You're lying.

162
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,750
You're not my sister,
so who are you really?

163
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,660
[AKAGI grunts]

164
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,580
You know, you can
be so difficult.

165
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
[gasps]
Amagi.

166
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,790
[AMAGI]
Hm. It's been a while, Kaga.

167
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,750
No. That's wrong, too.
Explain yourself.

168
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,870
I became Amagi because
that is what Akagi desired.

169
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,370
[gasps]
So you're... Orochi.

170
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,450
[AMAGI chuckles]

171
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,330
[KAGA]
Let go of my sister!

172
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,620
Are you sure you want me to?

173
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
After all that Akagi went
through to see me,

174
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,580
you would disrespect
her wishes?

175
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,330
Enough treachery, impostor!

176
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,580
[AMAGI] I'm not the
only fruad here, am I?

177
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,120
[gasps]

178
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,660
Take care of Akagi. Won't you?

179
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,250
Amagi was destroyed,
leaving poor Akagi behind.

180
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,160
Then parts of Amagi were
passed down to another ship.

181
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,660
[KAGA]
Stop this.

182
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,080
[AMAGI chuckles] Surely you
already know this, darling.

183
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,660
[whimpers]
This isn't right.

184
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,330
Aircraft carrier Kaga.

185
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,200
You're a ship that was
retrofitted using

186
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,830
Amagi's secondhand machinery.

187
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,160
[gasps]

188
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,700
[AMAGI] Akagi only ever
loved you because she knew

189
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,790
there was a shadow of her dear
Amagi somewhere inside you.

190
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,750
Of course, that was
just an illusion.

191
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,540
[KAGA]
My sister. That can't be true.

192
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,750
[AMAGI] You were never going
to be her replacement.

193
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,000
You're simply a collection
of decaying parts.

194
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,580
A Ship of Theseus,
broken and unoriginal.

195
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,080
It's a shame you could
never measure up, Kaga.

196
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,950
Are you sure about
your plan, Miss?

197
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,410
Rushing in.

198
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,330
When it appears that you're
as important to the Sirens

199
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,330
as the Sakura Empire.

200
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,040
We may be waltzing
right into a trap.

201
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,370
We'll at least be
prepared this time.

202
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,120
There are no other options.

203
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,540
We can't turn away
from this battle

204
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,500
if we expect to
uncover the truth.

205
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,080
So once again, I will face
off against this ocean.

206
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,080
[BELFAST]
Hm.

207
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,330
As you wish, Miss Enterprise.

208
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,540
My duty, as always, is to see
your convictions through.

209
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
You have my support.

210
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,540
[gasps]

211
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,000
It's gonna be fine!

212
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,160
[LAFFEY] We got this.
It's all good.

213
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,160
[UNICORN] And U-chan
will protect us, too!

214
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,200
[AYANAMI]
Mm. Mh-hm.

215
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,000
[gasps]

216
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,870
Where'd that come from?
Who's shooting?

217
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,910
[CLEVELAND]
Hm. Red Axis, maybe?

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,830
[HORNET]
I suppose. Could be.

219
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,580
But I can't believe they
wouldn't wait for us

220
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,200
before pickin' a fight
with the Sirens.

221
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,790
No problem.

222
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,830
Guess we better get in there!

223
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,750
[YUKIKAZE gasps]

224
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,950
Alright!

225
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,950
Just leave everything to
the famous Yukikaze!

226
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,620
Rawr! I'm gonna bite 'em!

227
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,790
[SHIGURE]
Don't get too far ahead of me!

228
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,160
[shouts]

229
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,910
[YUKIKAZE] What happened?
Was that a cannon?

230
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,160
[YUUDACHI, SHIGURE gasp]

231
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,200
What cute little guests we have.

232
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,080
Let's see what kind of data
we can collect from them.

233
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,870
Battleship Sirens!

234
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,790
[ATAGO, TAKAO gasp]

235
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,790
[YAMASHIRO yells] I've never
seen this many powerful Sirens

236
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,450
at one time before!

237
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,040
That's a problem. We can't even
get close to the <i>Orochi</i> .

238
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,910
Never say never, Shoukaku.

239
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,250
If our path is blocked,
then we'll make our own way!

240
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
[ZUIKAKU gasps]

241
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,450
You're okay!

242
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,410
What is this? Where am I?

243
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,200
You have nothing to
fear now, Akagi.

244
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,080
Your wish has already come true.

245
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,040
Eternal love is
right here with you.

246
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,330
[AKAGI]
My wish. My eternal love.

247
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,910
Dear sister Amagi.

248
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,450
We... Sakura Empire...

249
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,950
You stubborn fool! How can you
show such blatant disrespect?

250
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,120
How dare you?

251
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,370
You're nothing but
Amagi's pathetic lackey!

252
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,200
I can settle all of this
right here and now,

253
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,830
if you think you're ready.

254
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,700
[AKAGI, KAGA growl]

[KAGA groans]

257
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,950
Sister Amagi, she--ow!

258
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,540
How many times have I
told you to play nice?

259
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,540
Fighting won't be tolerated.

260
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,500
Come on, give me your hands.

261
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,000
Now shake and be friends.

262
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,250
[KAGA, AKAGI]
Hmph!

263
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,410
[AMAGI gasps]
Girls. Don't make me ask again.

264
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,080
Be friends.

265
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,250
[KAGA, AKAGI gasp nervously]

266
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,370
I won't allow harm to Orochi.

00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,620
Kaga!

[shouts]

269
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,080
Why are you working
with the Sirens?

270
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,000
You know this isn't right!

271
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,620
My only duty is to make sure
my dear sister Akagi is happy!

272
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,040
[SHOUKAKU]
Hey! Come on!

273
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,620
Where's your cool head,
this isn't like you!

Yuudachi, no!

277
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,870
That looked painful, you ok?

278
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,540
[YUUDACHI] Oh yeah,
I'm totally fine, it's cool.

279
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,330
What do we do now? This is bad.

280
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,500
[gasps]

281
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,080
[PRINZ EUGEN] Okay.
Stay sharp, ladies.

282
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,580
Please pull yourself together.

283
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,040
If you don't concentrate,
you'll make an easy target.

284
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,500
I can handle it!

285
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,620
My, it looks like we have
a full house tonight.

286
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,580
[ADMIRAL HIPPER]
What is your plan now?

287
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,620
Even with our combined forces,
we're still vastly outnumbered.

288
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,080
[PRINZ EUGEN]
Oh, sister.

289
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,200
You must still be waiting for
your optimism to grow in

290
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,290
with your breasts.

291
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,870
[ADMIRAL HIPPER gasps]
I'll slap you!

292
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,080
[PRINZ EUGEN giggles] I joke,
of course. But you are correct.

293
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,500
Perhaps we must now stall
for divine intervention.

294
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,950
Here they come.

295
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,330
New reinforcements?

296
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,250
I would certainly hope so.

297
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,700
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend, after all.

298

Here at last, Azur Lane.
We've been waiting.

299
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,500

Pull yourself together, Kaga!

Can't you see that the
Sirens are just using you?

It doesn't matter.

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,750
Are you here to come between
my dear sister and me?

317
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,120
That's not it. I'm came here
to help save everyone.

318
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,700
[BELFAST gasps]
Miss Enterprise, look. Up there.

319
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,660
[ENTERPRISE]
Mm?

320
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,120
Is that...?

321
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,410
It can't be.

322
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,870
Akagi?

323
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,660
[ENTERPRISE]
Who is that with her?

324
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,000
What did they just activate?

325
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,250
[AMAGI]
Everything's finally in place.

326
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,410
Ready, Akagi?

327
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,410
There. See, you're friends now!
Everything is going to be fine.

328
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,120
The future of Sakura Empire...
is held in these very hands.

329
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,950
Being friends with each other

330
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,830
is the only way to
defeat the Sirens.

331
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,450
Yes...

332
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,000
I think it's about time
we started a real war.
