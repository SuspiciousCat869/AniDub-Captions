They are mysterious crystal

through their battle
against the Sirens.

They are also the foundation
upon which we were created.

Filled with their power,

00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,160
we have the strength
to fight the Sirens.

9
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,996
It is the power of warships.

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,209
Strong enough to tame an
ocean and silence Sirens.

11
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:46,838
Humanity reclaimed the seas with
the help of the mental cubes.

But, it wasn't enough.

One side was called
The Red Axis,

This included the Sakura Empire
and Iron Blood.

16
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,728
Due to their desire to
acquire the Sirens' power

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,316
for themselves, they raised a
rebellion against Azur Lane.

18
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,403
Even when facing our
common threat, the Sirens,

19
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,614
conflict between
human factions continues.

Perhaps they moved too soon.

She fights without hesitation,

315
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,338
[PRINCE OF WALES]
Thank you, Your Majesty,

316
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,674
our allies are currently
under attack.

317
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,176
[QUEEN ELIZABETH] Yes, I know
what's going on, Wales!

318
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,804
And I've already made
my brilliant move!

319
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,266
[BELFAST giggles]

320
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,188
[ENTERPRISE grunts]

321
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,276
[ZUIKAKU]
No you don't!

322
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,194
[grunts]

323
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,571
[ZUIKAKU] Plenty more
where that came from!

324
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,451
I expected you
would be stronger.

325
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,081
[gasps]

326
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,834
[grunts, shouts]

327
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,377
Zuikaku! Please stop!

328
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,628
[gasps]

329
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,173
[gasps]

330
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,175
[grunts]

331
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,768
[ZUIKAKU gasps]
No!

332
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:38,404
[grunts]
You've gotta be kidding!

333
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,251
[gasps] Are we gonna
have to fight them now?

334
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,087
Poor thing. She's morally
conflicted by this.

335
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,340
I can't wait to see
what she decides to do.

336
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,134
What? Hold on.

337
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,139
Hey! What do you think
you're doing now?

338
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:09,268
[LAFFEY sighs]
I'm sleepy. So, never mind.

339
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,729
What? <i>Nein!</i> You're not
allowed to do that!

340
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,647
Quit messing with me or
you're gonna regret it!

341
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,691
[JAVELIN chuckles nervously]

342
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,568
[BOTH gasp]

343
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,862
[ALL gasp]

344
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,659
[gasps]

345
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,328
Zuikaku!

346
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,879
I've gotta hit her
at least once.

347
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,380
It's all over.

348
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,548
[grunts]

349
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,974
[ENTERPRISE gasps]
Why am I reaching my limit now?

350
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,226
[gasps]

351
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,450
[shouts]

352
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,375
[gasps]

353
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,918
You're going down!

354
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,670
[BELFAST]
Pardon the interruption.

355
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,132
[ZUIKAKU, ENTERPRISE gasp]

356
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,054
Are you kidding?
What the...? Who are you?

357
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,809
I'm no one, really.
Just a maid passing by.

358
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,352
