1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,505
[Principal] I want to give
a warm welcome back

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,008
to all the students of
Sakuragaoka High School.

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:12,887
The long summer vacation is now
over and a new school term is
once again upon us.

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,308
I hope that each and everyone
of you had a busy and
productive summer.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,188
It gives me no end of joy to see
all your tanned, energetic faces
here once again.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,526
The experiences that you gain
during high school are
irreplaceable and,

7
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:30,447
are crucial to your development
in your productive citizenry.

8
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:39,414
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

9
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,047
Summer vacation went
by way too fast this year.

10
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,466
[Ritsu] It's not like you
didn't have a lot of fun.

11
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,219
Yeah, well I suppose but...

12
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,890
How could you spend
the time goofing off?
How about college exams?

13
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,102
We did manage to make a lot of
wonderful memories, though.

14
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,312
Natsu Fest and
the summer festival!

15
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,273
Going to that dagashi store!

16
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,816
Good morning!

17
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,778
Hi, everyone! The second term
is starting! Isn't it exciting?

18
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,780
I'm blind!

19
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,408
Second term means the big school
festival! And our live show!

20
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,369
Ah, so that's what you've got
yourself so wound up about.

21
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,830
We have to work hard to get
ready for it.

22
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,083
But first we've got this.

23
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,460
[Yui] A marathon?!

24
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,837
Has its hour at last
come again this year?!

25
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,672
That's it!

26
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,300
I've decided that I'm going to a
college that doesn't have
marathons ever!

27
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,346
Actually, your average college
doesn't have marathons.

28
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,565
I'm off to school!

29
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,151
Oh!

30
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,236
Yui-chan, good morning.

31
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,321
Good morning!

32
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,781
Take care of yourself today.

33
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,992
Okay! I'm cutting it kind of
close, so I have to go!

34
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,786
You have a good day!

35
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,915
[Yui] It's time to eat!

36
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,043
[Mio] Huh? Mugi, you're having
eel and rice for lunch?

37
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,296
[Tsumugi] I'm trying to build up
my stamina to get ready for the
marathon.

38
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,173
Yeah, you're plenty strong
alright,

39
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,009
but you've never really had much
in the way of stamina. You know?

40
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,013
That's great! You're trying to
overcome your shortcomings. Good
for you, Mugi!

41
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,766
Yeah, and I've been training
hard by sprinting at top speed

42
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,434
from home to school every
morning!

43
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,896
That's not training, Yui,
that's just you oversleeping
everyday!

44
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,233
Well I guess you pretty
much got me there...

45
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:59,531
I don't understand. Why do we
have to run a whole 42.195
kilometers?

46
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,826
You realize, It's not a full
marathon. It's 4.5 kilometers.

47
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:08,456
It involves a whole bunch
of running either way,
so it's basically the same
thing.

48
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,709
[Sawa] If you really hate
running that much,

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,336
why not consider wearing one of
these to make it more fun for
you?

50
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,879
The rest of you, too.

51
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,214
Never gonna happen.

52
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,966
Those would be HARDER to run in.

53
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,885
If the entire student body ran
around town wearing stuff like
that,

54
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,055
this would be the last year
the marathon is ever held.

55
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,976
Yes, that's it! You're right,
Azu-nyan! That's a really great
idea!

56
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,104
What are you talking about?
I was kidding. It was a joke.

57
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,064
Your tea's ready, Sawa-chan!

58
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,108
Just what I've been waiting for!

59
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,067
[Yui] It's black...

60
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,445
[Sawa] Is it black sesame?

61
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,160
Unique flavor...

62
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,245
What's this invigorating
fragrance that's wafting,

63
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,497
through my mouth that's
so redolent of the sea?

64
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,291
To prepare for the marathon,

65
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,586
I thought we should build up our
iron reserves to help fight off
anemia,

66
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,839
so I brought blancmange
made with kelp and hijiki!

67
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,426
[Sawa] Perhaps the normal kind
might be better next time?

68
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,306
[Ui] Sis! This pair looks really
comfortable to run in, doesn't
it?

69
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,684
Wow Ui-chan, you're right!

70
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,937
I'm not sure I want to spend
my whole allowance.

71
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,439
(car door closes)

72
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,610
It's Sawa-chan!

73
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,447
[Yui] After all this time,
I finally get to ride in your
car!

74
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,616
Ma'am, were you out doing
your shopping too?

75
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:29,913
No, I'm on the clock.
I was buying some things that
the school needs for the
marathon.

76
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,166
We teachers are splitting up all
the work.

77
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,502
Sports drinks and lots of paper
cups...

78
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,837
If you're working,
is it okay to give us a lift?

79
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,840
Yes, it's fine. I was just about
to head back to the school,

80
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,052
while driving over the marathon
course, so I could check it out.

81
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,139
[Yui] Mochi and azuki beans?

82
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,518
[Sawa] After the marathon, we'll
be making oshiruko red bean soup
in the schoolyard.

83
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,936
Red bean soup?!

84
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,813
You wouldn't believe the work
goes into this marathon.

85
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,981
There's shopping to do,
checking the race course,

86
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,983
filing for permits with the
police...

87
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,403
Back when I was a student in
high school,

88
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:06,116
I thought that the teachers had
it so easy because they didn't
have to run in it.

89
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,911
Maybe I can muddle my way
through if there's gonna be red
bean soup at the end.

90
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,789
Well we made the course
a lot tougher than last year's,

91
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,334
so I'm pretty sure
you're gonna hate us for it.

92
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,587
You start here in the business
district.

93
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,715
There'll be pastry shops
with their sweet smells,

94
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,842
clothing boutiques
with their vibrant colors,

95
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,928
and general stores with
their shelves full of cute
items.

96
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,514
You'll have to overcome
the temptation to window shop

97
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,099
to put the bus loop behind you.

98
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,643
You'll cross the bridge,
pass the residential district
and,

99
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,146
find the vast expanses
of the rural district.

100
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,983
It's a leisurely one-way road
with heads of rice heavily laden
with seeds.

101
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,236
But after that looming up
ahead is Heartbreak Hill,

102
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,740
a demoralizing monster,
a living hell coming or going.

103
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,492
A literal heartbreaker, a battle
against your own limitations!

104
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,202
But if you're not victorious,

105
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,997
all will be lost and
you'll never reach the finish
line!

106
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,958
As soon as you conquer
this trial and crest the hill,

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,961
you'll be greeted by the sight
of the checkpoint at this park!

108
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,630
You'll need the little strength
you have left for the final
stretch!

109
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,842
The finish line is
so close you can taste it!

110
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,677
It's like that.

111
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,680
Look, we're close to our house.

112
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,266
[Yui] She doesn't have
to be THAT eager about it.

113
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,812
It's not that she's eager,
it's that you've already given
up.

114
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,065
What's wrong, Ui?

115
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,693
One of those mochi got
mixed in with our all stuff.

116
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,782
I can't believe the race is
tomorrow...

117
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,742
Hey, how many snacks
are we allowed to bring?

118
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,660
A marathon isn't a school hike,
you know!

119
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,121
Well, I'd feel a lot more
motivated

120
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,582
about the race if they'd just
let us take a snack with us.

121
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:43,171
We can't have snacks,
but the teachers will have red
bean soup ready and waiting for
us after the race.

122
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,839
As much as I love red bean soup,

123
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,508
it stinks that we have
to run all that way,

124
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,053
and make it all the way
to the finish line in order to
get any.

125
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,888
You're eating mochi with your
rice?

126
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,391
Please tell me you don't think
eating sticky, stretchy things,

127
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,809
will make you tough and
tenacious!

128
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,436
Of course not, Sawa-chan
gave it to me yesterday.

129
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,649
When I tried to return it, she
said I should go ahead and eat
it and do my best.

130
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,237
It's real hard!

131
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:11,783
You know, the race would have to
be called off if it were to rain
tomorrow.

132
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,702
That's it! That's what we'll do!

133
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,122
The marathon will be cancelled,
and we'll have a red bean soup
contest instead!

134
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,041
[TV] There's no percent chance
of rain tomorrow everywhere.

135
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,294
It'll be a beautiful day,
perfect weather for hanging the
laundry out to dry.

136
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,380
What are you doing there, Big
sis?

137
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,383
I'm making a string of
upside-down terabozu dolls.

138
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,512
Granny Tomi from next door said
that if I did this, it would be
sure to rain.

139
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,646
[Yui] Why?

140
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,779
[Nodoka] On behalf of all
athletes,

141
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,782
we hereby pledge to follow
the rules of good sportsmanship,

142
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,911
and will see this race through
to the very end in a fair and
open manner.

143
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,874
Student Council President
Nodoka Manabe, Year 3, Class 2.

144
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,545
[Teacher] All right, everyone!
On your marks!

145
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,546
Get set!

146
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,881
(bang)

147
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,552
Wow, they're all taking
this pretty seriously.

148
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,221
I'm going on ahead, okay?

149
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:21,186
Everyone here's trying way
too hard, even Nodoka-chan.

150
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,397
Yeah, and it's not like there's
a big prize or anything for the
winner.

151
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,692
The way these things normally
go, you'd have a bet going with
the Judo Club,

152
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,446
and the winner would get the
loser's club room for the rest
of the year.

153
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,405
Really?

154
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,949
No, nothing like that happens.

155
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,703
It's a nice day out,
so let's just think of it as a
class hike!

156
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,163
Even though there's no snacks...

157
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,208
But if we run really slowly
and finish dead last then...

158
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,169
(cheering)

159
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,463
<i>I don't want that kind of</i>
<i>attention!</i>

160
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:52,050
All right, come on people!
Put some effort into it!

161
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,928
Not you, too...

162
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,557
Still, it's kinda nice to leave
campus on a school day,

163
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,769
and not get not get into
any trouble for doing it.

164
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,979
And the weather is nice.

165
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,899
You know, you're right.

166
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,070
[Jun] Wait!

167
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:18,576
Let's run... a little...
slower...please...

168
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,078
Sorry!

169
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,914
(panting)

170
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,083
Mio-senpai!

171
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,632
I thought you we're running
with my sister and the others?

172
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,300
They're further back in the
pack.

173
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,637
Was my sister actually
running when you saw her?

174
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,973
Well I wouldn't exactly call it
running,

175
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,684
but she's with the other girls,
so I'm sure she'll be all right.

176
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:43,977
[Jun] Mio-senpai!

177
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,562
Why don't you and I run
together!

178
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,105
Uh, sure.

179
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,107
Well you're full of energy
all of a sudden.

180
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,401
You were at death's door a
second ago.

181
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,447
No I wasn't! I-I was adjusting
my pace, that's all.

182
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,407
Let's move!

183
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,244
[Ui] You know, there's something
really fun about being outside
in the fresh air,

184
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,872
when we'd normally be in
a classroom having lessons.

185
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,790
[Azusa] And the weather's nice,
too.

186
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,625
[Jun] Yeah.

187
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,919
Hey, that bag is cute!

188
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,839
[Azusa] Let's come here
and check it out on Sunday.

189
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,678
Look at that cake! It looks
delicious...

190
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,680
[Yui] Oo, kitty!

191
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,897
Oo, I've never seen
that kind of juice before!

192
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,983
It's brand new? And it's only
$1!

193
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,318
[Machine] How may I help you?

194
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,028
That thing talked!

195
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,364
(bark)

196
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:41,242
Even if she had all the strength
and stamina and endurance
in the world,

197
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,204
could there be a girl less cut
out for running a marathon?

198
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,041
[Tsumugi] Mio-chan!

199
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:53,296
[Yui] I'm so glad you waited
for us! Thank you, Mio-chan!
Thank you!

200
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,638
K-ON!

201
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,350
Drink up. The finish line is
just a stone's throw away now.

202
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,685
Hang in there.

203
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,229
Thank you very much, Ma'am.

204
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,148
We're almost at the
checkpoint, Jun-chan!

205
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,944
I'm sorry...
I can't go any farther...

206
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,071
Go on without me...

207
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,910
(Yui panting)

208
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,163
I'm so pooped...

209
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,165
You shouldn't be wiped out
this fast.

210
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,419
An arts and culture...
club like ours...

211
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,423
is at a... big disadvantage...
in this race...

212
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:41,886
We're no match...
for the Track and Field Club...
or Softball or Judo Club!

213
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,265
Come on the Light Music Club has
its own way of doing things.

214
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,852
Why don't we just act like were
a light music club and try
running to a rhythm?

215
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,395
Hey, you're right!

216
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,231
We should run this marathon
while singing a song!

217
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,363
<i>[Ritsu] Whenever I look at you,</i>
<i>I feel my heart go doki doki.</i>

218
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,950
[Yui] You're going too fast!
<i>[Ritsu] I get so giggly</i>
<i>and wiggly-</i>

219
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,579
Huh? "Fuwa Fuwa Time"
was too tough for you?

220
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,040
How about we try
"My Love is a Stapler"?

221
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:15,086
<i>[Yui] Why is it this way?</i>
<i>On nights like this my mind...</i>

222
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,923
<i>My mind begins to stray...</i>

223
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,801
[Tsumugi] I can't run and
sing at the same time!

224
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,219
Mugi's down for the count, too?

225
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,388
I guess we could just
sing in our heads.

226
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,431
Yeah that's it!

227
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:32,687
(gasps)

228
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,022
What's up?

229
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,317
I forgot the lyrics!

230
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,777
You what?!

231
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,030
The go "La la la" or whatever
you need to do and fake it!

232
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,823
I can't!

233
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,117
Save yourselves!

234
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,996
Don't worry about me! Leave me!
It's okay, just go!
I'll survive!

235
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,040
Forget about singing, then.

236
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,669
Why don't you try thinking of
something else you really like
while you're running?

237
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,253
I think I might be able
to do that!

238
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:02,550
(happy humming.

239
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,935
Oh, you! I couldn't possibly
eat another!

240
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,979
What the heck is she imagining?

241
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,940
Something pleasant...
Something pleasant...

242
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,317
[Ritsu] And she's trying
too hard.

243
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,070
I've got it!
What if we sang a song?

244
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,364
And we're back to square one!

245
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,866
What's the matter, Mio?

246
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,785
Some lyrics just came to me.

247
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,121
(gasping)

248
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:34,124
"Heartbreak run,
my heart just shatters."

249
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,626
"Pounds so hard
it'll soon be tattered."

250
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,087
<i>[Ritsu] Is this that "runner's</i>
<i>high" deal I've heard about?</i>

251
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,132
[Mio] "Or is it all because
of the marathon?"

252
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,467
[Girls] Fight on!

253
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,972
[Ritsu] Hang in there, Mugi!
We've officially conquered
Heartbreak Hill!

254
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:52,100
It's level roads
from here on in!

255
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,104
[Ritsu] Hey!

256
00:14:56,146 --> 00:15:01,276
Oh, you're Azusa's friend.
Um... don't tell me...
it's Sasaki, right?

257
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,277
Suzuki, dummy.

258
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,987
Yeah, yeah, you're Jun-chan.

259
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,822
That's right.

260
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,366
So, you chose to stick with the
rest of the Light Music Club,
Mio-senpai?

261
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,745
Hey, uh, where's Yui-senpai?

262
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,330
Huh?

263
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,000
[Mio] She's vanished?
[Ritsu] She's lost at sea?

264
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,002
How do you get lost at sea on a
road?

265
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:22,839
Yeah, well, I hate to say it,
but with Yui, it's entirely
possible.

266
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,758
Ah.

267
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,385
[Jun] Ma'am! There's an
emergency!

268
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,013
What's wrong?

269
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,599
Yui! Are you around here?

270
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,811
She couldn't have simply
wandered this far off the main
road, could she?

271
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,480
I doubt that even Yui would
mistake

272
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,649
a tiny game trail in dense
forest for the marathon course.

273
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,151
Wait a minute, where are we?!

274
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:47,030
[Tsumugi] Ah! Have we gotten
ourselves lost at sea, too?!

275
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,991
Did we underestimate the perils
of a race?

276
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:53,703
But no body needs to worry!
I've got our survival needs
covered!

277
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,707
There are edible mushrooms
there! See? Now look right
there!

278
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,126
Those really pretty ones with
the red and white polka dots...

279
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,087
those are the ones that
are highly poisonous.

280
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,382
[Sawa] Hey you three, what
are you girls doing up there?

281
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,758
Heh.

282
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,051
Have you found Yui yet?

283
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,011
[Tsumugi] No not yet.
Up until right around here,

284
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,556
we were running together,
singing a song to keep us in
good spirits.

285
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,518
What she said! And that's
when Miss Akiyama here,

286
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,895
began composing
a bunch lyrics in her head!

287
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,564
[Mio] I couldn't help it,
great lyrics were just coming to
me.

288
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,317
Anyway, we better split up
and look for her.

289
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,569
I'll look over there. Now get
going!

290
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,613
[Ui] Jun-chan is taking a long
time...

291
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,199
I wonder what's keeping
the Light Music Club?

292
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,910
Good work you guys.

293
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,079
There's red bean soup waiting
over there.

294
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,623
You should go and
get some before it's all gone.

295
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,791
Sure.

296
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,960
Should we go ahead and eat
without them?

297
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,253
I guess so.

298
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,755
[Nodoka] Oh and just
one mochi each, all right?

299
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,340
[Both] Right.

300
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,928
[Ui] Jun-chan! Over here!

301
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,263
Something has happened!

302
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,141
Yui-senpai vanished somewhere
along the course!

303
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,517
What!?

304
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,436
Yui!

305
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,396
It's no use. There's no sign of
her.

306
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,314
[Girl 1] You know,
now that you mention it,

307
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,026
there have been a lot
of UFO sightings in the area.

308
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:10,155
[Girl 2] Hey, why don't we use
that as our research topic for
the school festival?

309
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,744
You don't think Yui got herself
abducted by aliens, do you?!

310
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,706
[Ui] Hey, everyone! Excuse me!

311
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,707
[Tsumugi] Ui-chan!

312
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,917
Have you guys found my sister
yet?

313
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,169
No, I'm afraid not.

314
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,296
We've looked everywhere
and can't find her.

315
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,797
Jun-chan told me what happened.

316
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,092
She disappeared right before
you got to the park checkpoint?

317
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,846
Yeah. At least, that's when we
all first realized that she was
missing.

318
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:39,351
Then I think we'll find her
hanging around somewhere in that
area.

319
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,063
It's standing!

320
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,231
[Granny] Your tea stem
is standing upright.

321
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,650
That means that something
good will come your way today.

322
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,821
[Yui] Really? But you know that
terabozu weather doll charm,

323
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,033
you told me about didn't work
the way you said it would.

324
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,827
[Granny] Oh, it didn't?

325
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,329
[Yui] I really should get going
now!

326
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,581
Yes, I suppose you should.

327
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,542
In that case, eat this
before you take off.

328
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,921
You need energy to run your
hardest.

329
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,798
(doorbell rings)

330
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,800
Oh, another visitor?

331
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,678
[Ritsu] Do you have any idea
how worried we all were?!

332
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,556
And here you are, eating
chestnut jelly cakes without a
care in the world.

333
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,433
I'm sorry!

334
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:23,520
I tripped and skinned my knee
just as Granny was passing by.

335
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,523
And she cleaned it up and
put a bandage on it,

336
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:31,194
and then she invited me in for
tea, so I took a little break...

337
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,029
Were you hurt badly?

338
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,532
[Yui] Nah, its just a little
scrape.

339
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,201
Thank goodness it wasn't
anything serious.

340
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,162
I'm just amazed that
you knew to look for her here.

341
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,789
The course passed close
to our neighborhood,

342
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,375
so I thought there was good
chance she might be here.

343
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,669
I'm sorry for the trouble she
caused.

344
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:51,214
I'll go on ahead to the school
now and let everyone there know
that she's okay,

345
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,341
and that nothing really
bad happened to her.

346
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,928
You guys just take your time
finishing the race. Okay?

347
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,847
That's one level-headed girl.

348
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,975
[Yui] Let's take her up on her
offer and take our time reaching
the finish line.

349
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,268
And one that screwed up.

350
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,062
We're gonna be dead last now,
that's for sure.

351
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,898
That doesn't bother me.

352
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,902
No way... they'll all stare at
us, and I'll die of
embarrassment!

353
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:16,656
[Ritsu] What's this I see?
You tripping and getting even
more fans?

354
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,701
[Mio] Spare me the twisted
predictions!

355
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:25,081
[Ritsu] Ow!

356
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,375
It's great news that
Yui-senpai is okay, huh?

357
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,710
Yeah, it really is.

358
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,253
Hey look, they're back!

359
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,090
I knew it,
everyone's watching us!

360
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,260
It's okay, let's just
focus on crossing the
finish line together!

361
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,721
[Azusa] Senpai!
If you don't hurry,

362
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,766
they're run out of mochi
for the red bean soup!

363
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,061
What's up, Yui?

364
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,146
No mochi?

365
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:53,777
(reverse slow-mo)

366
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,873
It's that mochi!

367
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,750
I ate that mochi with my lunch,

368
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,543
so that means that they're
going to be one short for
the red bean soup!

369
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:15,757
And that means the person
that finishes last won't
getting a mochi!

370
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,675
What?!

371
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,802
Mochi!

372
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,136
Hey, wait for us!

373
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,429
The loser won't get any mochi?!

374
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,890
[Mio] I don't want to
finish last!

375
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,266
Wait!

376
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,104
They're all running faster
all of a sudden.

377
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,397
I wonder why?

378
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,320
Where is she getting
all this power from?!

379
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,698
Mochi!

380
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:43,410
Mochi really means
that much to you?!

381
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,912
I am NOT going to finish last!

382
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:13,815
Uh oh.

383
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,900
Hey, are you all right?

384
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,236
<i>I drew attention to myself!</i>

385
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,904
It's great that they
had enough mochi,

386
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,657
even for the person
who finished last. Right?

387
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,951
Well of course that makes
perfect sense.

388
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:28,288
They wouldn't have bought
exactly the same number of mochi
as there are students.

389
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,581
Now would they?

390
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,377
Thanks to Yui's crazy idea,
I ended up...

391
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,628
My prediction came true!

392
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,590
I'm real sorry, Mio-chan.

393
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,592
Still, it was kind of fun,
wasn't it?

394
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,345
Yeah! I could get used
to running marathons!

395
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,430
[Both] Hey! Speak for yourself!

396
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,518
I'm really sorry.

397
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,856
Hey does anyone want to have
seconds of soup? There's still
plenty of mochi left.

398
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:58,276
The ones that are left
are for the teachers.

399
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,862
Speaking of teachers,
where is Sawa-chan?

400
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:12,082
Hey Yui, are you there?
Where are you?

401
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,834
There isn't going to be
any soup left!

402
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,922
I am so hungry...

403
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:25,512
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")

404
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,723
[Jun] Okay, I want you
to write down

405
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,351
what the Light Music Club
does on a typical day.

406
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,311
[Azusa] Alright.

407
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,812
[Azusa] This is bad! Really bad!

408
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:01,483
When did I get infected with
their slacker attitude?!

409
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:06,404
[Mio] Give me a minute, okay?
I really want to change
my strings.

410
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:10,784
[Tsumugi] I decided to try
writing a new song for the
school festival!

411
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,494
[Azusa] Sitting here doing this,

412
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,789
it almost feels like we're
a real Light Music Club,
doesn't it?

413
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,876
Today is the day I'm going
to make my comeback!
