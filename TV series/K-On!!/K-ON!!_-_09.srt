1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,673
(Yui humming and running)

2
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,638
(exhales)

3
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,850
Ready!

4
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,685
Sis, you be careful out there!

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,853
Mm!

6
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,855
I'll see you later, Ui!

7
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,481
You have a good run!

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,194
Hi! Good morning, Granny!

9
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,989
Good morning, Yui. You're out
early today.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,200
I just felt like I should work
really hard and give 100%.

11
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,745
Well! Good for you, dear.

12
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,788
Heh.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,665
See you later!

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,462
Oh, goodness...

15
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:52,302
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

16
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,184
(panting)

17
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,564
Well there she is.

18
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,527
She's the definition of "Youth".

19
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,446
She's cutting it real close.

20
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,280
Yui!

21
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,531
[Nodoka] Hurry up!

22
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,616
(happy)

23
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,286
What part of "hurry"
doesn't she get?!

24
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,294
Made it just in time...

25
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,628
Oversleep again?

26
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,214
I got up early so that
I could go jogging.

27
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,841
You mean that's why
you were late?

28
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,303
I wrote on my future plans
questionnaire that I'd
work hard.

29
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,221
Hm. Keep it up, Yui!

30
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,098
Please don't encourage
her like that, Mugi.

31
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,810
That's true, our finals are
coming up pretty soon.

32
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,520
Really?

33
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,941
On a side note, Tadamasa Oguri's
contributions cannot be
understated,

34
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:12,984
(Yui snoozing)

35
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,652
<i>[Mio] She's already asleep!</i>

36
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,364
(muffled noises)

37
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,991
Gonna work hard are ya?

38
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,369
I'm gonna hit the books hard!

39
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,499
(Yui gasps)

40
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,669
[Yui] You have such tidy
handwriting, Mugi-chan!

41
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,628
Could I..

42
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,797
Would you like to make copies?

43
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,382
Yes, thank you!

44
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,098
Oh wow, your notebook
is so cute, Mio-chan!

45
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,516
Leave me alone.

46
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,767
(grins)

47
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,977
Ri-chan.

48
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,189
I see that you, too,
fell asleep during class,

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,358
my soul sister.

50
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:01,533
[Yui] It starts with "ta,"
there's a "ki" right in the
middle, and it ends with "n"?

51
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,952
A hint. It's a kind of food.

52
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,162
Tanuki udon.

53
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,664
What kind of food is that?

54
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,834
It's a whole racoon in a bowl of
noodles.

55
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,254
You know, we aren't getting
any studying done at all!

56
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,509
(excited)

57
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,437
Thanks a lot, Mugi-chan!

58
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,440
[Ritsu] Yui! Mugi!

59
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,983
Open wide.

60
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,317
Ah!

61
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,822
Try one of these Hyper Ultra
Sadistic Mints. Here.

62
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,449
It's spicy!

63
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,992
By dongue iz numb!

64
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,535
What are you guys doing?

65
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,248
Are you sure that you'll
be able to study on your own?

66
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,792
As soon as I get home, I'm going
to work.

67
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,466
[Yui] Hi Granny!

68
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,426
Oh hi, Yui-chan!

69
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,011
I'm back from school.

70
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,429
Welcome back.

71
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,264
Here, I have some chicken stew
for you.

72
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:11,269
I made plenty this time, so you
and your sister can have all you
like.

73
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,480
Thank you so much!

74
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,275
Thank you for always loo- Ow!

75
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,152
What are you doing now?

76
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,236
Heh...

77
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,489
Are you still playing- What's it
called?

78
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,990
Oh! Geeta?

79
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,992
Yes, that was it. Geeta.

80
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,535
He's Geeta the Guitar!

81
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,080
You've stuck with it ever
since you started high school.

82
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:35,043
It's nice to see you working
hard at it, Yui-chan. Good for
you.

83
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,129
(guitar strumming)

84
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,590
I got complimented...

85
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,950
Granny's looked out for me my
whole life.

86
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,159
(Ui knocks on the door)

87
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,869
Oh?

88
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,163
[Ui] Sis, dinner's ready.
[Yui] Ah!

89
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,500
[Yui] Oh no! I was working hard
on the wrong thing!

90
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,717
This is great!

91
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,343
Yeah!

92
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,512
I want to do something to thank
her...

93
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,681
You know, I shared the souvenir
you brought back from

94
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,349
your trip to Kyoto with her.

95
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,559
You really work the neighbors!

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,977
Yeah I guess.

97
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,521
Maybe I'll bake a batch of
cookies and take them over.

98
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,772
Your cookies!

99
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,816
After we're done with finals.

100
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,901
(sad)

101
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,489
I'm going to work really hard on
this!

102
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:51,911
Sis?

103
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,915
(thinking)

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,210
(giggle)

105
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,339
[Azusa] Yui-senpai is
actually applying herself.

106
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,258
Yeah, though she gave up
on jogging after just one day.

107
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,844
I bought shoes, but never
actually ran in them.

108
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,430
[Ui] Heh.
[Azusa] Well that's even
worse...

109
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,438
See?

110
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,193
[Ui] Of course she did fall
asleep at her desk last night.

111
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,238
It is Yui-senpai after all.

112
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,408
[Yui] (gasps) Sale season
is here, isn't it?

113
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,493
Sale season?

114
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,578
Seasonal items are all on
closeout,

115
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,288
so the stores sell them really
cheap!

116
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,748
Wow that's very dynamic!

117
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,126
After finals, I want to come
here and buy some clothes.

118
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,420
That sounds pretty good.

119
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,006
(excited)

120
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,134
[Yui] Every one of these tops
are 30% off!

121
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,427
Heh!

122
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,805
[Ritsu] You got some
questionable tastes lady.

123
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,060
(groans)

124
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,728
(Ui gasps)

125
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,480
What's wrong Ui?

126
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,190
We're out of soy sauce!

127
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,400
I'll go buy some!

128
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,151
[Ui] That's okay, I'll go and
get it.

129
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,904
But you're in the middle of
cooking dinner, aren't you?

130
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,615
(Yui pumped)

131
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,492
Well, can you get it ASAP, then?

132
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,036
[Yui] Yeah!
[Ui] Are you sure?

133
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,329
No problem!

134
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,623
Remember, we need soy sauce!

135
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,376
<i>Soy sauce, soy sauce, soy</i>
<i>sauce!</i>

136
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,461
<i>Not sea sauce, just soy sauce!</i>

137
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,797
<i>Not just any sauce, but soy</i>
<i>sauce!</i>

138
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,799
[Yui] Not sugar, but--
[Granny] Yui-chan!

139
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,469
Hi, Granny! Thank you for
the stew, it was delicious!

140
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,390
You're welcome, dear. Are you
off to run an errand right now?

141
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,142
Yes! We ran out of sugar!

142
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,144
Oh, oh dear.

143
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,480
[Granny] Here you are.

144
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,982
[Yui] Thank you granny!

145
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,527
Your timing was perfect.
I want to tell you about
something.

146
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,280
Here take a look at this.

147
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,323
[Yui] A talent show?

148
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,950
They hold it every year,

149
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,995
but apparently have very
few contestants this time
around.

150
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,329
That's too bad.

151
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,998
Would you be interested?

152
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,332
Huh? What me?

153
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,709
[Granny] I think the shopping
center people would,

154
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,503
love to see a young person
compete in their show.

155
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,464
(thinking)

156
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:12,010
[Granny] And not only that my
dear, I'd love to see you play
your Geeta, too.

157
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,014
What's the date? (gasps)

158
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,184
<i>The day after final exams</i>
<i>end...</i>

159
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,977
Oh, my. You have plans?

160
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,228
Nuh-uh.

161
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,067
I wonder if Shige will perform
this year?

162
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,653
His magic tricks are always
so much fun to watch.

163
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,240
[Yui] Maybe I will...

164
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,283
Do you mean it?

165
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,284
Mm!

166
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,535
I'll play for sure.

167
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,206
Wonderful! Oh thank you,
Yui-chan!

168
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,043
I can't wait to see you
all dressed up on stage!

169
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,544
Right!

170
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,712
[Granny] I almost forgot...

171
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,882
The grand prize is a trip to a
hot spring.

172
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,218
You should take Ui-chan.

173
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,429
[Yui] It wasn't sugar, was it?

174
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,764
[Ui] No...

175
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,643
I wish we had soy sauce for
this...

176
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,269
We have ponzu sauce.

177
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,729
Nah, I don't like sour stuff...

178
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,233
You're the one who mixed them
up.

179
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,404
Do you want me to tell her you
can't play? I need to return
this, anyway.

180
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,822
Nuh-uh.

181
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,907
Granny was really looking
forward to seeing me play.

182
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,076
But the show is the day after
your finals!

183
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,620
Isn't it going to be tough
to rehearse and study?

184
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,789
I'll work hard at both!

185
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,674
[Yui] K-ON!

186
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,218
[Ritsu] A talent show?

187
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,344
Yeah!

188
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,679
Sounds like a lot of fun!

189
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,014
But, it's the day after exams!

190
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,099
That's why I'll perform by
myself.

191
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,267
Huh?

192
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,394
You guys all have studying you
have to do.

193
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,854
[Mio] So do you!

194
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,981
[Tsumugi] Will you really be all
right playing by yourself?

195
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,108
I promised that I'll work
hard at everything.

196
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,402
[Ritsu] More to the point,
why don't you just bow out?

197
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,488
Cause I want to make the nice
old lady next door happy.

198
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,823
[Tsumugi] Old lady?

199
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,034
She's looked after me
and Ui since we were little.

200
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,952
And I want to repay the favor.

201
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,454
Huh...

202
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,372
[Yui] She says she wants to see
me all dressed up on stage.

203
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,168
I'm gonna win, and give her this
hot springs trip as a thank you
present.

204
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,086
Oh?

205
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:14,424
You know, now that I think about
it, she sort of reminds me of
you, Ri-chan.

206
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,759
Reminds you how?!

207
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,510
That's great!

208
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,638
You're like the turtle in Taro
Urashima or the statues in
Kasajizo!

209
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,432
I adore stories like that!

210
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,351
[Mio] Fairy tales?

211
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,937
Hang in there. If there's
anything I can do to help, I
will.

212
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,482
Yeah? Some sweets to keep me
going would be really nice-

213
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,733
[Mio] Hey...

214
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,027
So, what're you gonna do for the
show?

215
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,654
You're not going
to do a talent show act...

216
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,490
Look! I'm spinning plates!

217
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,908
...like that are you?

218
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,078
[Yui] No, Geeta and I are
going to do a nice solo song!

219
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,120
A Yui solo?

220
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,121
I can't wait!

221
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,539
Heh.

222
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,541
Yui's launching a solo comedy
act?

223
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,085
All funny man and no straight
man.

224
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,337
[Yui] I'm playing a song,
not doing stand-up!

225
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,421
(laughter)

226
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,631
Set!

227
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,049
(bang!)

228
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,635
[Azusa] She's playing
in a talent show NOW?

229
00:11:58,677 --> 00:11:59,844
She's confident.

230
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,680
It probably just means
that she isn't thinking.

231
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:06,601
The nice old lady next door
suggested it to her and she
agreed to do it.

232
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,770
[Ui] Sis is really excited.

233
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,271
Hm...

234
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,940
(crashing)

235
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,033
Ah...

236
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,079
(guitar playing)

237
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,581
[Azusa] Yui-senpai.

238
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,791
Hm?

239
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,126
Oh hey, Azu-nyan.

240
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,336
[Azusa] You're practicing
your guitar out here?

241
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,464
[Yui] It's against the rules to
use the music room before the
tests,

242
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:40,677
and I thought it would bother Ui
if I just practiced at home.

243
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,471
[Yui] Are you out
running errands?
[Azusa] Yes.

244
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,433
[Yui] Just make sure you don't
mix up soy sauce and sugar.

245
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,559
Huh?

246
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,519
Well, it could happen to anyone,
you know.

247
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,021
[Azusa] Not really.

248
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,943
[Azusa] So you're really going
to play in that talent show?

249
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,528
[Yui] Oh, Ui told you?

250
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,321
[Azusa] Yes.

251
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,575
[Yui] Heh... It'll be my first
solo performance! I'm really
nervous!

252
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,951
[Azusa] So you're playing alone?

253
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,745
[Yui] Yeah, why not?

254
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,038
[Azusa] Well what about the
club?

255
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,956
[Yui] We're in the middle of
finals.

256
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:13,043
So I didn't want to bother
anyone with helping me on this.

257
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,669
Sure you can you handle it?

258
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,712
[Yui] Yep.

259
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,714
While studying for your final
exams?

260
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,424
I'll work really hard!

261
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,093
(concerned)

262
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,598
[Azusa] I understand.

263
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,807
Huh?

264
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,559
I'll enter the contest with you.

265
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,769
[Yui] Are you sure?!

266
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,062
I always keep up
with my studies,

267
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,980
and I'm doing well
in all my classes,

268
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,608
so I'm not worried about finals.
I think.

269
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,276
Thank you, Azu-nyan!

270
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:43,365
Anyway, we need to pick
a song and start practicing it.

271
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,784
[Azusa] We'll get down to work
starting tomorrow, okay?

272
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,243
Okay!

273
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,539
[Mio] Azusa's playing with you?

274
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,291
[Yui] She is!

275
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,418
[Ritsu] You know, we were all
thinking about joining in
with you too.

276
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,630
You two performing
should be great!

277
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,632
[Azusa] Yui-senpai!

278
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:01,966
Azu-nyan!

279
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,594
Hey there!

280
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:09,099
I worked up a full schedule for
you. First thing up is studying
in the library.

281
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,518
Azu-nyan, what about snack time?

282
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,977
There isn't any.

283
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,772
[Azusa] We'll grab something
whenever a break comes up.

284
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,816
Azusa-chan is so dependable!

285
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,193
I guess we can leave her
to Azusa this time.

286
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,778
Mm-hm

287
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,822
So did you finish the practice
questions?

288
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,073
Um, yes...

289
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,991
Okay then, let me go over your
answers.

290
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,661
(gasps) Uh...

291
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,579
What's wrong senpai?

292
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,624
[Azusa] Please take
this seriously.

293
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,917
I'm sorry...

294
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,336
Your sister is certainly
interesting, Ui.

295
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,048
Mhm! That's why every day
is fun with her.

296
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,968
[Azusa] The first question is,
what sort of song do we
want to play?

297
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,470
A lot of older folks
come to the show.

298
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,347
Maybe an enka song?

299
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:54,978
<i>Fuwa fuwa tiiiiiime!</i>

300
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,688
[Azusa] Why are you singing it
like that?

301
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,690
Practicing voice modulation!

302
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,900
An enka "Fuwa Fuwa Time"?

303
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,986
[Yui] You try, too, Azu-nyan!

304
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,241
<i>Fuwa fuwa time!</i>

305
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:11,244
[Yui] You're modulating
your whole body, not your voice.

306
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,375
<i>Fuwa fuwa time!</i>

307
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,879
Wow, you really don't have
a feel for enka, do you?

308
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,174
I'm sorry, enka's just not going
to work.

309
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,800
How about a folk song?

310
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,052
A candle?

311
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,721
You have to sing without
blowing out the candle.

312
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,181
What kind of practicing is that?

313
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,266
Alright here goes!

314
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,399
That's Kokiriko-bushi, right?

315
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,991
[Yui] Sing it. The line is
"Dederekoden," Azu-nyan.

316
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,287
[Azusa] Dederekoden.
[Yui] More energy!

317
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,415
[Azusa] Dederekoden!
[Yui] More!

318
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,752
Dederekoden!

319
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,045
That might just work!

320
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,214
I don't even know
who I am anymore...

321
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,257
[Granny] Yui-chan!

322
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,177
[Yui] Granny!

323
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,388
[Granny] I made you beef
and potato croquettes.

324
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,306
(excited)

325
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:15,934
Thanks so much!

326
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,728
I heard from Ui-chan
that you were down here.

327
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,647
Hard at work practicing, I see.

328
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,232
I sure am! (gasps)

329
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,652
This is Azu-nyan,
she's performing with me.

330
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:26,736
Please to meet you.

331
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,238
Lovely to meet you, my dear.

332
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,449
Don't push yourself too hard,
Miss Azu-nyan.

333
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,701
Okay.

334
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,830
[Yui] Oh! This is so good!

335
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,624
[Azusa] You know, that neighbor
of yours seems like a really
nice lady.

336
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:44,462
[Yui] Yep, and her takakomi rice
and chiarshi sushi are totally
delicious, too!

337
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:48,091
[Azusa] You sound like
a stray cat that she feeds.

338
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,552
So we do need to do
our best on this.

339
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:54,848
See what I mean? Now, what do
you think we should call our
little duet act?

340
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,767
[Azusa] Right, we can't call
ourselves After-school Tea Time.

341
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,436
[Yui] How about Senpai/Kouhai?

342
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,980
[Azusa] I don't think we really
need to emphasize that.

343
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,566
[Yui] Well, how about just Yui &
Azu-nyan?

344
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,610
How does "Yuiazu" sound to you?

345
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,612
Yeah, Yuiazu!

346
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,448
[Azusa] Okay, let's decide on a
song now.

347
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,242
[Yui] Oops, right.
What would be a good one?

348
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,745
[Azusa] I still think "Fuwa Fuwa
Time" would go over well.

349
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,330
<i>[Yui] Fuwa fuwaaaa!</i>

350
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,212
What the heck is wrong,
Sawa-chan?

351
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,131
I'm having big time tea
and sweets withdrawal!

352
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,593
Why haven't we been having
any tea and cake parties
lately?!

353
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,762
[Ritsu] Because we have tests
coming up.

354
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,305
[Sawako] So what?!

355
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,058
What's more important to
you people, that rule or me?!

356
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,435
The rule, obviously.

357
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:59,287
(Yui snoozing)

358
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,627
[Nodoka] Ma'am!
[Yui] Geh.

359
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,296
I dropped my eraser.
May I please pick it up?

360
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,048
[Teacher] Go ahead.

361
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,363
(Yui snoozing)

362
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,368
<i>[Azusa] She's sleeping NOW?</i>

363
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,464
(bell rings)

364
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,591
[Announcer] Thank you that was
wonderful!

365
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,761
[Announcer] Next up is #14,
the duo of Yuiazu!

366
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,722
[Azusa] Yui-senpai! Yui-senpai!

367
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,683
It's time. We're on!

368
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,851
(alert)

369
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:07,689
(clapping)

370
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:14,237
Hi, everybody! I'm Yui Hirasawa,
a senior at Sakuragaoka High
School!

371
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,239
And I'm Azusa Nakano.

372
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,365
And together, we're...

373
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,950
[Yui] Yui...
[Azusa] azu!

374
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,577
Oh yeah!

375
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,496
(happy clapping)

376
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,331
Yui's being her usual self.

377
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,459
Azusa-chan seems a little stiff.

378
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,753
I think I'm more nervous than
they are...

379
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,130
We thought about singing
an enka song at first,

380
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,966
and I even practiced my vocal
undulation!

381
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,843
Don't you mean "modulation"!

382
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,011
(mic feedback)

383
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,220
Azusa's the straight man.

384
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,056
They really prepped for this.

385
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,058
I'm the older senpai around
here,

386
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,894
but Azu-nyan's the totally
reprehensible one of our little
team!

387
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,189
I HOPE you meant "responsible"!

388
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,607
So then, are you ready?

389
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,901
Yes, I'm ready.

390
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,819
Oops, what were we gonna play?

391
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,155
Would you pull it together?

392
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,698
That was a good one.

393
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,786
Okay, then! Here's the Yuiazu
version of "Puda Pen, Ball Pen"!

394
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,413
One, two, three...

395
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,625
(slowed guitar strumming)

396
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,462
They're doing it like that?

397
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,801
(crowd clapping in tune)

398
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,923
(bell rings)

399
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,759
[Announcer] And that was Yuiazu!
Thank you, girls!

400
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:05,223
[Announcer] Next up is Kotaro
Yoneyama on the shakuhachi
flute!

401
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,477
We got a participation prize.

402
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,312
You're giving it to me?

403
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,482
Actually, I had wanted to give
you the first prize trip as a
present...

404
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:18,319
Aw well, it's the thought that
counts. Thank you, Yui.

405
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,989
I thought the two of you gave
a wonderful performance.

406
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:25,326
You've grown into
a fine young lady, really.

407
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,792
Hehe.

408
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:36,087
[Granny] That reminds me!
I made plenty of chirashi-sushi.

409
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,714
Let's eat it with Ui-chan
and your friends.

410
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,632
[Yui] Oh yeah! Wanna come,
Azu-nyan?

411
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,551
[Azusa] Sure!
[Yui] Are there shiitake
mushrooms in it?

412
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:42,969
[Granny] Of course there are!

413
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,221
[Yui] Yay!

414
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,184
(shocked)

415
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,185
What's up?

416
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,311
(shocked)

417
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,687
[Mio] You got all high scores!

418
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,023
[Ritsu] H-How did you pull that
off?

419
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,566
I must have guessed right!

420
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,526
Yeah, I figured it was
something like that.

421
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,904
You did study really hard,
though, Yui.

422
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,280
Wow, you think so?

423
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,200
You know, I wanted to play
in the talent show, too.

424
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,161
Oo, we can play as Yuimugi next
time!

425
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,537
How does Ritsumio sound?

426
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,081
Or Yuimugimioazu.

427
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,499
Hey!
(laughter)

428
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,126
[Ritsu] No way!
You and me, Mio! You and me!

429
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,378
[Ritsu] How about Rittan-Miotan?

430
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,379
[Mio] That's even worse.

431
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,090
[Ritsu] I got it, Tsumiori!

432
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:24,886
(closing song, "Listen!!")

433
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:57,312
[Tsumugi] Finland this year
is gonna be really fun.

434
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:00,857
[Sawako] Just what the heck are
you thinking, calling me here
like this?

435
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,026
[Azusa] Could she really have a-

436
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,986
[Tsumugi] But wait doesn't
she always complain,

437
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,988
about how lonely she is
because she's single?

438
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,407
[Mio] Look! I'm not interested
in that kind of stuff!

439
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:13,620
You could say that the Light
Music Club is my boyfriend right
now.

440
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,206
[Yui] Wow, Sawa-chan sure is
popular, huh?

441
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:19,876
[Ritsu] Yeah but, it kinda
makes it harder to ask her.
