1
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,840
[Ritsu] C'mon, Yui!
Time to practice!

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,342
[Yui] Okay! Be right there!

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,052
You sure seem excited today.

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,013
Yeah, the school festival
is soon.

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:16,933
Well don't get yourself too
excited and catch a cold like
you did last year.

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,103
Oh I wont. I've been
eating oranges every day.

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,313
I ate so many my hands are
yellow!

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,775
See ya later, Nodoka-chan!

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,735
Stay healthy.

10
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,694
Thanks for waiting!

11
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,237
[Ritsu] Now off to the club
room.

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,948
[Sawako] Yeah, about the club
room...

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,907
Sawa-chan!

14
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,868
It's out of use for a while.

15
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:35,952
What is?

16
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,412
The club room.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,544
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

18
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,384
[Ritsu] It's true!

19
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,803
[Yui] And we can't have
the music room, either!

20
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,388
I wouldn't lie about this.

21
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,015
Why can't we use it?!

22
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,100
Well you see,
there was a report,

23
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,271
that late at night an eerie
dripping sound was heard coming
from inside.

24
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,357
Oh I'll be okay,
just please continue.

25
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:33,194
Well when they went to
investigate the strange sound,

26
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,905
they saw water leaking from the
ceiling!

27
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,658
That was in the classroom
right below the music room.

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,119
They have to replace all
the pipes around there,

29
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,830
and since those pipes also
pass through the club room,

30
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,958
it's shut down for now, too.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,626
Their timing's terrible.

32
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,838
We've got less than a month
to get ready for the school
festival.

33
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,888
For the time being,
I've moved your instruments out
here.

34
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,222
Even the turtle.

35
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,224
[Yui] He's actually a pig-nosed
turtle.

36
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,185
Oh, Azusa.

37
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,354
Hey, is something wrong?

38
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,523
Ton-chan!

39
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,402
Our room's closed. We can't get
in because they're fixing some
pipes.

40
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,321
You realize that means no tea!

41
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,781
That's not the main issue here!

42
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,241
According to the schedule,
the repairs will take ten days.

43
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,661
Are you saying we wont be able
to practice in there for ten
whole days?

44
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,373
So we're just going to have
to find somewhere else to
practice!

45
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,834
[Sawako] I'll try to pull some
strings and get you into Music
Room #2,

46
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,088
that's the room that the
Wind Instrument Club and Choir
Club use.

47
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:38,093
In case you've forgotten, I am
the advisor to the Wind
Instrument Club as well.

48
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,720
Thank you!

49
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,015
It must be bad inside if
they closed it off completely.

50
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,393
Let's go see for ourselves.

51
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,936
[Mio] I wouldn't do that.

52
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,479
Oh, she's back!

53
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,648
[Yui] How did it go, Sawa-chan?

54
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,275
Sorry, girls. I struck out.

55
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,278
Aw, you said you has
some clout around here.

56
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,905
[Sawako] I know, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,366
So what are we suppose to do
now? Where are we gonna
practice?

58
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,371
Good question...
How about your classroom?

59
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,998
Wow! You're gonna
practice in here, really?

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,709
Yeah, we kind of have to.

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,836
Sorry I know it's a bit of a
imposition.

62
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,213
Just remember to please
keep the level down,

63
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,215
so you don't disturb the other
students.

64
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,383
[Girls] Okay!

65
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,760
Good, I'll leave you to it,
then.

66
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,555
Azu-nyan, this is our classroom,

67
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,224
so feel free to kick off your
shoes and get comfortable.

68
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,392
Easier said than done.

69
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,435
[Ritsu] Good idea!

70
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,103
She wasn't talking to you.

71
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,980
Don't care!

72
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,190
All right! Everybody ready?!

73
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,442
Hmph!

74
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,195
Okay, let's kick it off with
Curry!

75
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,155
[Yui] Sounds good.

76
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,198
[Ritsu] One, two! One, two-

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,952
(loud music playing)

78
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,959
That was so intense!

79
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,002
You guys were awesome!

80
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,546
Thanks, but we're not that
great...

81
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,715
(door opens)
[Girl] Um, excuse me?

82
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,799
Yeah?

83
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,967
Look, we're right in the middle
of,

84
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,511
discussing our plans for
the school festival.

85
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,846
Can you please keep it down?

86
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,222
We're so sorry!

87
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,432
Could you guys hear us?

88
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,184
It won't happen again!

89
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,811
Thanks, sorry to be a bother.

90
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,273
What'd we do?

91
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,776
Go somewhere else, I guess.

92
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,819
[Yui] Hey Azu-nyan?
[Azusa] Yes?

93
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,114
Don't you think it'd be better
for Ton-chan if you left him in
our classroom?

94
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,992
Oh, you're probably right!

95
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,539
<i>Rock a by baby on the tree top.</i>

96
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,919
Nice spike!

97
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,547
Do you think it'd be okay with
you guys if we set up over here?

98
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,883
Sure, I don't see a problem with
that.

99
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,053
You might find it a little
bit cramped, though.

100
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,930
Thanks a bunch!

101
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,350
Man I'm spent, pushing these
instruments around all day has
worn me out.

102
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,644
I'm feeling great!

103
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,187
Alright, you ready?

104
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,980
[Both] Yeah!

105
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,981
It seems...

106
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,316
Got it!

107
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,527
...like we're a bit out of
place.

108
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,861
You guys agree?

109
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,656
Yeah, the gym's full of athletic
clubs not musicians.

110
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,658
So? Come on, let's get started!

111
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,702
One, two! One, two-

112
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,414
Um...

113
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,379
Mio-chan?

114
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,839
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

115
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,217
Oh yeah I forgot,
Mio's a closeted sports nut.

116
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,760
Okay, one more time!

117
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,637
[Volleyball club member]
LET'S SEE SOME HUSTLE OUT THERE!

118
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,639
They sure play with a lot of
intensity.

119
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,560
Then we need to play with just
as much intensity and the
passion to match them!

120
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,146
[Azusa] Yeah.
[Yui] Like, the "Light Music,
hustle!"

121
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,022
Let's rock it!

122
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,398
Yeah! Let's do it!

123
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,775
The Light Music, hustle! Come
on!

124
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,362
Sweet! Here we go! One, two,
three-

125
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,949
(Marching band music plays)

126
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,993
Stay in sync, people.

127
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,538
It's kinda hard to focus in
here, huh?

128
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,707
[Ritsu] Drama Club is using
in the auditorium,

129
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,335
and the Chinese Poetry Club
has the roof...

130
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,795
Which explains why you're back
here.

131
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,131
Hey Azu-nyan?

132
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:03,923
Yes?

133
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,508
This is Nodoka-chan's desk.

134
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,385
So feel free to sit down if you
want.

135
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,054
Oh, thank you.

136
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,726
[Yui] What's the Light Music
Club have in common with Snakes
and Ladders?

137
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,436
I don't know, what?

138
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,230
Because now we're right
back to circle one!

139
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,191
You mean "square one"?

140
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,234
Oo, yeah right! What she said!

141
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,780
It's important when telling a
joke not to mess up the punch
line.

142
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,491
I guess this makes us a tribe of
nomads.

143
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,743
What would you do without me?

144
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,871
Alright I'll keep trying to find
a place for you to practice.

145
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,875
But it's time to go home now,
we'll pick up this conversation
tomorrow.

146
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,169
[Girls] Okay!

147
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,839
I sure hope Sawa-chan comes
through for us tomorrow.

148
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,799
Me, too.

149
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,050
[Azusa] You know we never got
to-

150
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,927
[Yui] Eat any snacks at all
today.

151
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,262
I knew you were going to say
that!

152
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,139
I was just kidding, Azu-nyan.

153
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,725
Hey Mio, did you finish making
the you-know-whats?

154
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,935
You mean sweets?!

155
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,228
No.

156
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,437
Song lyrics.

157
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,939
You finished writing the new
song?

158
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,942
[Ritsu] Sorta, Mugi's music
is ready to go, but...

159
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:09,072
I wrote some lyrics for it, but
Ritsu didn't seem to like them.

160
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,990
Can you blame me?

161
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,995
"In a forest of candy so sweet,"

162
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,790
"I chat with songbirds, tweet,
tweet."

163
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,417
Oh nice! Sounds tasty!

164
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,210
Yeah? Well there's more to it!

165
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,878
Fine, let's hear it...

166
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,132
It's also got "Paint my love
in black and white, like a
panda"

167
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,301
and there's " I want to dance
dance dance like a happy
penguin."

168
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,138
Wow, so what's up with the
animal theme?

169
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,350
When Mio gets started on
an animal theme, she just keeps
going.

170
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,020
[Mio] I want to be evolved
like a raccoon dog.

171
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,731
Right into the sunset with me
mandrill...

172
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,483
Why don't each of us try
our hand at writing the lyrics?

173
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,609
Oh, I like it!

174
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,153
You're not going to use mine at
all?

175
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,989
Uh, no we're going
to keep them for backup.

176
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,159
Okay, we'll each write some
lyrics and show 'em tomorrow!

177
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,285
Roger!

178
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,871
So then, do you want me to write
some too?

179
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,539
Yeah! I can't wait to see what
you write!

180
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,001
I don't know why,
but I'm really excited about
this!

181
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,669
Me too!

182
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,796
Let the writing being!

183
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,256
I wonder what I should name it?

184
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,925
[Azusa] We have to
come up with a title too?!

185
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,553
How about "My Protracted Love
for You"?

186
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,221
Or "School My School Bag"!

187
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:20,143
[Azusa] Those are just dumb
puns. Let's take this seriously,
okay?

188
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,520
I tried everywhere
I could think of, but I'm sorry.

189
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,775
The truth is, there's no where
the Light Music Club can
practice.

190
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,401
How could you give up so easily?

191
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,071
[Sawako] Hey, I tried really
hard to help you out!

192
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,365
After the Jazz Club said that
we couldn't borrow their room,

193
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,992
I asked around at the
Science Lab, the Food Lab,

194
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,245
the conference room,
even the principal's office!

195
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,956
I wore down my heels,
walking around all day!

196
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,875
You poor thing! I'm sorry.

197
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,877
We appreciate you trying.

198
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,463
I don't know, maybe we should
go on practice hiatus

199
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,423
until the club room is available
again?

200
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,885
But that wouldn't give us enough
time to get ready for the
festival.

201
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,681
You could always get a rental
studio.

202
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,349
[Yui and Tsumugi] A rental
studio?

203
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,476
That's awesome!

204
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,852
They rent those by the hour.

205
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,229
Can
we really afford that?

206
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,232
No problem! The club fund is
still flush!

207
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,359
Oh Ri-chan!

208
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,654
I've never understood your
ways more than right now!

209
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,114
Gee, thanks.

210
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,286
K-ON!

211
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,668
I didn't know there was rental
studio so close to school.

212
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,336
Look that must be it there!

213
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,214
[Yui] Azu-nyan, Azu-nyan!

214
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,800
Check it out, they sell
picks and stickers!

215
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,552
Wow, look at all of them...

216
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,970
One of you will have to
sign for it,

217
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,597
by filling out your name and
address on a form for me.

218
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,391
[Ritsu] You do it, Mio!

219
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,101
You're the club president.

220
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,185
[Ritsu] Dang.

221
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,854
[Clerk] Since it's your
first time here,

222
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,065
I'm also going to need to see
some identification.

223
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:49,899
Identification?

224
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,568
I can identify her!

225
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,405
She definitely belongs to
the Sakuragaoka Light
Music Club!

226
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:59,034
Your student ID will probably
work a little bit better.

227
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,285
Oh, okay.

228
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,245
[Tsumugi] There are lots
of fliers,

229
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,414
for people looking for
band members.

230
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,124
There sure are.

231
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,586
Maybe we should put up a flyer
looking for new band
members too.

232
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,795
That's a great idea!

233
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,423
That seems really
fascinating and all, but...

234
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,341
Let's go.

235
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,634
Let's see what we've got.

236
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,763
Wow! This is cool!

237
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,390
A little smaller
than I was expecting.

238
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,850
[Both] Don't be so picky!

239
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:31,441
Is this a mirror? Do we really
have a mirror? It IS a mirror!

240
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:35,779
[Yui] Um, do I look kinda dorky
carrying Geeta on my back
like this?

241
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,072
Yeah. A little bit.

242
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,823
You're just now noticing?

243
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,327
I never realized it.

244
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,671
It's hard not to primp when
there's a big mirror around,
huh?

245
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,715
Well, we ARE girls, right?

246
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,969
What's so great about this is we
can check ourselves out while
we're playing!

247
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,471
The tea's ready now!

248
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,889
Oh yeah!

249
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,975
So that's why you
were looking for an outlet.

250
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,977
(Door opens)
[Clerk] Excuse me!

251
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,897
Sorry but, we don't allow
food or drinks in the studio.

252
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,940
[Azusa] Oh sorry, of course.

253
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,692
[Azusa] We understand!
[Yui] Sorry!

254
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,613
That's weird! It's like he could
see in the room somehow!

255
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,781
Because he can.

256
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,367
Wow, you're right! Yoo-hoo!

257
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,037
What should I do with these?

258
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,207
Well since they're made and all,
let's drink them outside.

259
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,085
Now it feels like home.

260
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,380
Hey look, we're not paying for
the studio so you feel at home.

261
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,425
Relax, just one cup of tea and
we'll get to practicing, okay?

262
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:44,723
Hey I've got an idea! In the
meantime let's show the lyrics
we wrote last night!

263
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,726
Alright then... Who wants
to show their stuff first?

264
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,852
[Yui] Oo!

265
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,770
[Ritsu] Wow.
[Azusa] I don't believe it.

266
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,273
Did You actually write some
lyrics?

267
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,277
They're good too!

268
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,156
"Rice is really amazing.
It goes with anything."

269
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:05,577
"Ramen, udon, okonomiyaki. It's
like a happy marriage of
carbohydrates-"

270
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,537
[Yui] And teriyaki and when I-
[Ritsu] Okay, thank you!

271
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,872
We've heard enough!

272
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,915
But my lyrics for the
chorus are even better!

273
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:16,504
One, two, three, four! Rice!

274
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:20,091
And wait till you hear the
title it's "Rice is a Side
Dish."

275
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,885
[Ritsu] Mugi, your turn.
[Yui] Huh?

276
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,763
Listen to this, Yui-chan!

277
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:30,018
"The icy, wind is like
a knife piercing her skin."

278
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,730
"Yoshie has the culprit cornered
at the edge of a precipice."

279
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:39,569
"Ken'ichi, it's true. We all
know it. The real villain is
you!"

280
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,279
And denied.

281
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,783
Mugi, those are lyrics?

282
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,786
I thought it might be nice to
try something off the beaten
path.

283
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,788
Not that far off the path!

284
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,373
You're turn, Azusa.

285
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,874
Okay.

286
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:01,007
Um... Do I really have to read
them out loud? I don't know how
good they are.

287
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,427
Go on, read 'em, read 'em!

288
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:09,432
"I can feel your gaze upon me,
trembling, trembling like
jelly."

289
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,308
[Tsumugi] Oh, I like it!

290
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,727
"Look this way. No don't look!"

291
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,937
Yeah, go on, go on!

292
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,232
"I'm here, I'll give you what
you want."

293
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,360
"So just give me a minute,
Ton-chan."

294
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,489
It's a song about feeding a
turtle?

295
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,699
Rewrite it.

296
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,158
So it's that bad?

297
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,495
[Mio] Okay, Ritsu,
let's hear what YOU wrote.

298
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,124
[Mio] "Salmon Roe, Roe, Roe
Your Boat."? "Phone the Phone."?

299
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,959
"The Cat Catnapped."?

300
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,962
Okay I admit it, they're
more lame than funny!

301
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,630
They aren't even lyrics!

302
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,465
Did you write something,
Mio-chan?

303
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:46,886
I wrote two, "The Raccoon Stole
My Heart" and "The Giraffe Wants
to Neck".

304
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,096
<i>She's still in a rut.</i>

305
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,640
Wait, how much time have
we wasted out here?!

306
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,101
Alright, let's start practicing!

307
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,812
Why is that light flashing?

308
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:59,524
[Ritsu] Whoa, maybe
it's stage lighting! A free
service!

309
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:03,903
Do we dance?

310
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,865
[Ritsu] So, that light meant
our time was up.

311
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,492
[Yui] It's all Mugi-chan's
fault for making tea.

312
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,662
[Tsumugi] But you were
the one who kept asking for
more!

313
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,166
[Azusa] I guess renting studio
time was kind of a big waste,
huh?

314
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,294
I wonder what our club room
looks like right now.

315
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:25,008
[Yui] When something is always
there, you stop realizing how
much it means to you.

316
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,682
[Ritsu] Sawa-chan!

317
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,850
[Yui] Hey there!

318
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,353
[Tsumugi] Hi!

319
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,647
Hey, the repairs in
the club room are done now!

320
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,400
They finished way ahead of
schedule.

321
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,860
Thank goodness!

322
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:47,030
Finally! We get to have
our club room back!

323
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,074
And the saga ends!

324
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,451
Easy on the drama.

325
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,079
Load your instruments in the
car.

326
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,373
I'll take them to school for you
tomorrow.

327
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,084
[Ritsu] Perfect! You can give us
a ride home too then!

328
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,585
[Yui] Ride please!

329
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,713
[Sawako] I told you before,
I can't fit five people in here.

330
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,090
[Ritsu] Meanie.

331
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,054
[Yui] We're home!

332
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,890
After so much struggle...

333
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,017
We're home at last!

334
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,727
It's good to be back.

335
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,605
[Azusa] I really like it here.

336
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,400
I never knew how lucky we were
to have this practice room

337
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,403
The past few days have made that
clear.

338
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,447
We don't have to wander all
over the place anymore.

339
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,909
Not at all! We can just come
here and play every day!

340
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,202
So let's play!

341
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,662
Shall I make some tea?

342
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,998
Maybe we should play a song
first!

343
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,625
[All] Yeah!

344
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,628
[Yui] All that's left
now are those lyrics...

345
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,590
Hey big sis! I peeled a nice
pear for you!

346
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,342
[Ui] What're you doing?

347
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:53,179
Everybody in the Light Music
Club is suppose to write one set
of lyrics.

348
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,724
So now you're writing as well?

349
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,059
That's so awesome!

350
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,105
Mind if I take a look?

351
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,481
[Yui] Go ahead.

352
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,652
"Rice Is a Side Dish"?

353
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,073
I thought my lyrics
were actually kind of good,

354
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,951
but the reaction from
the others was lukewarm.

355
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,619
What do you think, Ui?

356
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,622
I think you've written something
completely original and
different.

357
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,499
I know, right?

358
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,253
[Yui] I love Asian pears...

359
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:29,841
Alright! I'm gonna pull an
all-nighter on these lyrics!

360
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,178
Are you sure?
Don't push yourself too hard,
Big sis.

361
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,513
Don't worry about me, I'll be
fine.

362
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,684
Hey Sis, do you want me
to help you with this?

363
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,021
Really? That'd be awesome, Ui!

364
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,361
Yeah, I've got nothin'...

365
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:53,782
I guess trying to write
good lyrics is harder
than it looks.

366
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,241
Yui, you're looking confident.

367
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,786
Mhm. I finished three already!

368
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,953
Sure you did.

369
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,122
[Yui] Here.

370
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,500
These are amazing!
They rhyme and everything!

371
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,752
You really wrote these all
yourself, Yui?

372
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:09,756
Well I may have had a teensy
weensy bit of help from Ui.

373
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:10,924
<i>[Ritsu] And by teensy weensy...</i>

374
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:11,841
<i>[Azusa] She means...</i>

375
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,176
<i>[Mio] A lot.</i>

376
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,348
[Tsumugi] You look like you're
about to fall asleep, Yui-chan.

377
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,601
I got so wrapped up the lyrics
that I didn't get much sleep.

378
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,396
[Mio] Okay, but just don't catch
a cold like you did last year.

379
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,066
Have no fear! I've got
Mighty Mikans on my side!

380
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,777
Let me give you some mikan
power!

381
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,529
Mikan!

382
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:42,580
(phone vibrating)

383
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,624
Hello, Mio speaking.

384
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,167
[Yui] Mio-chan...

385
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,128
What's wrong, Yui?

386
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,046
[Yui] ...caught a cold...

387
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,673
WHAT?!

388
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,218
[Mio] It's Ui who has a cold?

389
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,723
You freaked us out over nothing!
Not that Ui getting sick is
nothing but...

390
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,391
What am I suppose to do?

391
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:04,602
Keep it together, Yui!
Alright where is Ui?

392
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,772
Hey there, everyone...

393
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,358
Would you... like some tea?

394
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,280
Now just relax and stay in bed!

395
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,115
I'm sorry, Azusa-chan...

396
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,826
It's okay her fever
is actually pretty low.

397
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,411
Well that's good.

398
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,914
Okay, Yui, guess
we should be headed home now.

399
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,624
You're leaving?!

400
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,669
Ui needs to rest and she can't
do that if we're hanging around,
right?

401
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,757
But I'm not sure I can take
care of her by myself...

402
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,551
It's okay, Sis, I can help you
out if you need it.

403
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,762
Ui, you're the one who needs
to be helped right now!

404
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,223
It's alright Ui!
Don't worry I've got this!

405
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:45,101
[Tsumugi] If you need anything,
at any hour just call.

406
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,395
[Mio] We'll be here before you
know it.

407
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:54,027
[Ui] Look Sis, you don't have to
stay here all night. I'll be
fine by myself.

408
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,653
Yeah but...

409
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,032
Listen, if you stay here,
I'll just be worried the whole
time,

410
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,618
that you'll end up catching my
cold.

411
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,410
Ui...

412
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,205
[Ui] Go back to your room.

413
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,916
Okay, but if you need anything,
just say something.

414
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,250
[Ui] Sure.

415
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:19,260
[Yui] I know! I'll make
some rice porridge!

416
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,471
(crashing in the kitchen)

417
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:24,599
[Yui] Why do eggs break so
easily!?

418
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:29,270
<i>I'm too worried to sleep, but</i>
<i>if I don't sleep I'll never get</i>
<i>better!</i>

419
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,692
<i>Precious, priceless things...</i>

420
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,194
<i>They're always there at my</i>
<i>side.</i>

421
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:42,325
<i>But as soon as I take them for</i>
<i>granted, to their value I</i>
<i>become blind.</i>

422
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,503
I feel a lot better...

423
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,523
[Ui] She put a fried egg
on top of rice porridge?

424
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,870
<i>[Ui] "U & I"?</i>

425
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,248
<i>"If you're not here,</i>
<i>I can't do anything. Why?"</i>

426
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,417
<i>"I want to eat the food you</i>
<i>make."</i>

427
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:36,087
<i>"If you're not here,</i>
<i>then I can't even apologize."</i>

428
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,215
<i>"I want you here, to hear your</i>
<i>voice."</i>

429
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:46,181
[Ritsu] And without further ado,
the votes are in, the lyric
writing winner is Yui!

430
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,640
Oh gosh, thanks.

431
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,560
They're so good, Yui-chan.
I was really touched by them.

432
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,062
You know how you don't
really know what

433
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,814
you've got till it's gone and
then you're like I need that?

434
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,025
That's the feeling I was trying
to go for.

435
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,570
I don't believe it, Yui-senpai
you really wrote these lyrics?

436
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:03,281
I'm guessing Ui-chan and the
club room were your inspiration.

437
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:08,203
Yeah, looks like my hidden
talents have finally
blossomed...

438
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,163
[Ritsu] If you say so.

439
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:11,956
What about mine?

440
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,959
You know, one song's really not
enough for us! Hey let's write
two songs!

441
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:19,381
[Ritsu] No, why stop at two!
Let's do three! Or even four!

442
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:25,637
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")

443
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,642
[Nodoka] Miss Akiyama.

444
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:59,481
Oh yeah, I just remembered,
I'm transferring to a different
school.

445
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:03,318
You see, my papa's moving the
whole family to Irkutsk
because of his job.

446
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,156
I see. Well, if you're that
dead set against it,
I may reconsider.

447
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,115
[Mio] Really?

448
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,701
Way to rock it, Mio!

449
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,120
[Ritsu] We're going.

450
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,081
No! I don't wanna!
I don't wanna!

451
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,540
[Mio] I'm done...
