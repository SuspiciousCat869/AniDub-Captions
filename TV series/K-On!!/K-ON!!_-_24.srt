1
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,721
[Ritsu] Mugi!

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,973
Good morning!

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:15,974
[Tsumugi] Good morning!

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,350
[Ritsu] Sorry we're late!

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,853
[Mio] We had to go back
for Ritsu's handkerchief.

6
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,730
Hey, Yui's not here?

7
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:26,317
But it was her idea that we
all walk to school together
in the first place.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,112
[Mio] She picked a bad day
to run late.

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,574
I'll try texting her.

10
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,039
Oh! She just replied back.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,040
So fast?

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,000
"Goe awne whithote mee"?

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,001
[Mio] Is she okay?

14
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,045
I think it says
"Go on without me."

15
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,213
Oh right!

16
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,632
I'll give her a call.

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,302
Nothing.

18
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,012
So do you think we should
go on without her?

19
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,597
Let's wait a bit more.

20
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,806
Okay.

21
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,939
[Mio] She's here!

22
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,566
[Tsumugi] Yui-chan!

23
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,238
I'm so sorry!

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,741
I woke up early, so I started
playing with Geeta-

25
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,076
No worries, it's okay.

26
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,286
Come on! Let's hit it!

27
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:23,792
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

28
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,153
Good morning, all.
Is the entire class here yet?

29
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,488
No, not everyone!

30
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,990
We're still missing
Miss Akiyama, Miss Kotobuki,

31
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,992
Miss Tainaka, and Miss Hirasawa.

32
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,535
Wait!

33
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,703
[Class Rep] Once you have your
corsage to pin on the graduates,

34
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,414
please proceed to
the auditorium.

35
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,376
Here.

36
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,383
[Jun] Azusa, let's go.

37
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,681
[Ui] Graduation is finally here.

38
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,143
It's time to say goodbye
to all the seniors...

39
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,311
[Ritsu] Hurry up!

40
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,354
[Mio] I think we'll make it!

41
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,439
[Yui] Geeta's so heavy!

42
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,402
[Ui] Hey Sis!

43
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,112
Classic Light Music Club.

44
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,322
They're always living on the
edge.

45
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,204
Ow!

46
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,414
[Jun and Ui] What's wrong?

47
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,541
I walked into the wall!

48
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,918
[Light Music Club] We're so
sorry!

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,129
What is wrong with you girls?

50
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,880
We're sorry, Sawa-chan!

51
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,340
Geez...

52
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,884
Miss Hirasawa!

53
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,555
[Mio] Yui! You have a hole!

54
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,932
[Yui] Oh no! I tripped on the
way here!

55
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,142
[Sawako] What'll we do?

56
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,601
[Nodoka] It's all right.

57
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,645
Ui left a change of tights with
me in case you need them.

58
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,564
<i>[All] Whoa! She's psychic!</i>

59
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,566
[Sawako]
Hurry up and get changed.
[Yui] Right!

60
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,609
I'll go along and help her.

61
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,946
No running in the hall!

62
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,824
<i>It's always something.</i>

63
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,245
Hey, you haven't signed
this yet, have you?

64
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,872
It's a gift for Miss Yamanaka.

65
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,957
[Ritsu] Sure thing, I'll do it
right now.

66
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,126
[Natsuka] You four are the
only ones who haven't signed it.

67
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,586
[Mio] Sorry.

68
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,839
You okay?

69
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,050
I can't believe it, today of all
days...

70
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,762
It's okay, you can't tell
with your bangs covering it up.

71
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,221
Really?

72
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:09,684
I gotta say, I hope gradation
goes well, no surprises.

73
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,437
It'll be fine! Just fine!
Nothing else will go wrong!

74
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,318
[Teacher] All remaining
students, please pin a corsage
on a graduating senior.

75
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,408
[Nodoka] Sorry!

76
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,451
They're here!

77
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,952
It took much longer than I
thought!

78
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,289
[Sawako] Thank goodness you
made it! Now go get a corsage!

79
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,749
[Yui] Yes, ma'am!

80
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,169
Um congratulations.

81
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,004
Thanks so much!

82
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,840
[Ritsu] Yui!

83
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,008
You ready?

84
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,179
Congratulations.

85
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,555
Thanks a lot.

86
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,958
Oh, I almost forgot.
Yui, you've got to sign this.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,959
Sign what?

88
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,336
A surprise present for
Sawa-chan.

89
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,797
The whole class is signing it.

90
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,008
You brought the card with you?

91
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,967
Busted.

92
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,135
[Sawako] Let's go girls!

93
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,761
Hurry up and get inside!

94
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,431
Coming!

95
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,099
What's going on?

96
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,726
Nothing!

97
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,021
Nothing at all, Sawa-chan.

98
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,110
What am I suppose to do with
this during the ceremony?

99
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:42,902
I don't know.

100
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,404
You could use it as a fan?

101
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,574
That really wont be necessary
in there. Try something else.

102
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,035
Maybe Sawa-chan could hold it
for us.

103
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,536
Uh no, try again.

104
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,455
Oh, right.

105
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,541
I know, what if I keep it hidden
here?

106
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,877
Through the whole ceremony?

107
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,003
Now I feel bad.

108
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,213
Well, I guess that's our only
option.

109
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:07,177
Oh wow, the auditorium looks
so much different than it
normally does!

110
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:13,600
This is really it... graduation.

111
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,394
[Teacher] The 85th
Sakuragaoka Girls' High
School...

112
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,939
commencement ceremony will now
begin.

113
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,859
Here is our principal. Please
stand.

114
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,404
[Principal] I'd like to take
this opportunity to
congratulate,

115
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:31,618
all of our graduating students.
As well as their families on
this momentous occasion.

116
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,828
Please take your seats.

117
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,665
[Principal] In your three years
with us,

118
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,127
you graduates have made many new
friends, had a number of new
experiences,

119
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,255
<i>[Mio] I'm so worried about Yui</i>
<i>hiding it that I can't focus on</i>
<i>the ceremony!</i>

120
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,550
On behalf of myself and the
members of the faculty,

121
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:51,096
we wish you well in all
your future endeavors.

122
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,473
<i>[Sawako] Everyone is fussing</i>
<i>over Yui...</i>

123
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,684
<i>What's that about?</i>

124
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,143
[Principal] All rise.

125
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,481
<i>[Sawako] She's holding herself,</i>
<i>does she have a stomachache?</i>

126
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,609
<i>No, she was hiding something</i>
<i>earlier.</i>

127
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,486
<i>But what?</i>

128
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,405
<i>Snacks?</i>

129
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,073
<i>Geeta?!</i>

130
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,908
<i>Surely not Ton-chan!</i>

131
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,243
<i>No...</i>

132
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,244
[Principal] Be seated.

133
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,620
<i>What could it be?</i>

134
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,956
[Principal] And now on with the
ceremony.

135
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,001
Will the class representative
please take the stage?

136
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,712
<i>[Mio] Is she looking at Yui?</i>

137
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,922
<i>She's totally focusing on her!</i>

138
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,676
Now graduates, please rise.

139
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,805
Pass this on to Yui, tell her
that Miss Sawako is concerned
about her.

140
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,223
Got it.

141
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,642
Mugi-chan.

142
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,185
Miss Tainaka.

143
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,981
She what?!

144
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,527
Message from Mio-chan. She says
Miss Sawako is corn fed for you.

145
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,280
<i>Sawa-chan is corn fed?</i>

146
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,115
<i>[Yui] Why is she eating corn?</i>
<i>And why do I need to know that?</i>

147
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,867
[Principal] Be seated.

148
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,952
<i>I'm really confused. What is</i>
<i>Mio-chan trying to tell me?</i>

149
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,662
[Principal] The valedictory
address.

150
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,497
Yes, sir.

151
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,875
<i>Nodoka-chan's speech!</i>

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,545
[Nodoka] Honored faculty.

153
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,256
First off I would like to thank
you all for gathering here
today,

154
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,177
on this special occasion. Our
graduation.

155
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,847
Looking back on the past,
our three years at this high
school,

156
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,225
were some of the most fulfilling
years of our young lives.

157
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,233
[All] K-ON!

158
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,819
[Yui] I kept it safe!

159
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,237
[Tsumugi] Thank goodness!

160
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,074
[Mio] I was freaking out
through the entire ceremony!

161
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,035
Yeah I know, I was totally
freaking out, too!

162
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,246
So what did you mean by
Sawa-chan is corn fed?

163
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,249
The message I sent you said that
Miss Sawako seemed concerned.

164
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,793
[Yui] Really?

165
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,128
[Tsumugi] By the time it go to
me it was still "concerned".

166
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,672
It all worked out!

167
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,173
You messed it up, didn't you?

168
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,134
So, have you signed it, Yui?
Have you?

169
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,427
No, not yet.

170
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,179
You should sign it pretty soon.

171
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,180
Here's a pen.

172
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,515
Thanks, Mugi-chan.

173
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,310
Sawa-chan, best wishes to you.
Yours-

174
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,520
That doesn't sound quite right.

175
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,647
That's what you'd write for a
wedding!

176
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,107
But I already wrote it!

177
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,776
That's going to seem like
you don't care. She'll be hurt.

178
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,319
Okay, then I'll add-

179
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,321
Alright girls, it's time to head
back to the classroom, girls.

180
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,657
I'm going to hand out your
diplomas.

181
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,200
[Yui] Y-Yes, ma'am!

182
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,036
And by the way, Yui-chan what
were you doing at the ceremony?

183
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,788
[Yui] Nothing at all.
[Sawako] Liar.

184
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,333
I was so focused on what you
were up to I missed the whole
ceremony!

185
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,626
I was keeping it safe!

186
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,627
What?

187
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,337
We'll see you in the class room!

188
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,880
Tell me now, I mean it!

189
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,841
[Tsumugi] We should really get
to the classroom, Sawa-chan!

190
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,467
[Ritsu] Hurry! Hurry!

191
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,885
[Sawako] Hey!

192
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,391
You've graduated, Yui.

193
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,767
Thanks to you.

194
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,897
[Sawako] Have you all checked to
see

195
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,983
your names are correctly
written on your diplomas?

196
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,943
Once you've checked that they
are correct,

197
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,195
put them away carefully
and take them home.

198
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,616
I love that sound!

199
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,954
[Sawako] All right. Listen, this
marks the end of a big chapter
in your lives,

200
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,331
your high school years are over.

201
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,626
[Sawako] And well...

202
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,630
Because you were the first class
assigned to me you will always
be special,

203
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,760
I consider it a privilege that I
could share this important day
with you.

204
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,220
Your future awaits you.

205
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,891
Embrace it.

206
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,940
All right... Class dismissed.

207
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,317
[Takahashi] Ma'am!

208
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,361
Well um, the class would like
to give you something,

209
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,655
as a thank for everything
you have done for us.

210
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,658
So who was the last person to
have it?

211
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,327
[Yui] Oo! It's me! It's me!

212
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,747
[Takahashi] In that case,
Yui-chan, go ahead and give it
to her.

213
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,917
(Yui singing)

214
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,711
Isn't that the theme for
winning a medal?

215
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,800
Miss Yamanaka, thank you
for looking after us!

216
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,136
Wait, is this what you were
trying to hide during the
ceremony?

217
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,346
You caught me!

218
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,182
Well thank you.

219
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,979
I'll cherish it always.

220
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,190
[Class] Thank you Miss Yamanaka!

221
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,319
[Sawako] I... I'm the one who...
Who should be thanking you.

222
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,407
I was very lucky to have you
as my first class.

223
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,786
Even though you've graduated,
please come and visit.

224
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,254
[Sawako] I've been waiting
for you people to arrive!

225
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,425
[Nakashikma] Whoa, Sawa-chan!

226
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,387
[Girl A] 'Bye.
[Girl B] See you.

227
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,430
Goodbye.

228
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,058
Azusa.

229
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,436
Azusa!

230
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,315
Japanese doll.

231
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,400
Oh. Hey Jun.

232
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,985
Are you okay?

233
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,904
Hey listen, I'll be heading up
to the Jazz Club room now,

234
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,282
try to keep it together.

235
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,742
See ya.

236
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,579
You'll be going up to
the music room now, right?

237
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,122
Yeah, and you?

238
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,166
My family is going to be
celebrating my sister's
graduation,

239
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,752
so I have to go home and get
ready.

240
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,879
Celebrate, huh?

241
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,215
Yeah of course! It's a happy
occasion!

242
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:24,429
I'm kinda sad that I won't get
to wear the same uniform as my
sister anymore, though.

243
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,309
It seems like no matter what,

244
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,228
she's always been one step ahead
of me, leaving me to catch up.

245
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,358
But that's not her fault,
she is my big sister.

246
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,026
Ui...

247
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,155
Sorry. I'll start being
happy for them, too.

248
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,287
Thanks!

249
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,747
Excuse me.

250
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,459
Can I also get a picture
with the Light Music Club?

251
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,502
Course you can!

252
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,087
You bet! Stand here in the
middle!

253
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,755
Thank you so much.

254
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,467
I heard that you're all going to
the same college next year.

255
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,553
So you guys can keep on
playing music together.

256
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,515
Your shows at the school
festival were always...

257
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,725
Really funny!

258
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,976
<i>[Yui] Funny?!</i>
<i>[Ritsu] What?!</i>

259
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,396
<i>[Yui] Not "awesome" or "really</i>
<i>good"?</i>

260
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,731
Later!

261
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:17,774
Bye-bye!

262
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,568
Going on a graduation trip?

263
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,529
[Yui] Sawa-chan sure is
popular...

264
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,448
Do you think she'll come up
to the club room later?

265
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,783
She'll come for tea.

266
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,451
For sure.

267
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,246
[Nodoka] Well I need to stop
by the student council office.

268
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,331
[Yui] Okay!
[Ritsu] See ya, Nodoka!

269
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,500
[Tsumugi] See you!
[Mio] See you later!

270
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:39,879
Nodoka-chan!

271
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,924
Hey, why don't we walk
home together today?

272
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,012
I'll text you later!

273
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,308
Thank you, ma'am!

274
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,582
How can I erase that?

275
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,000
Thanks Mugi-chan!

276
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,626
[Tsumugi] Sure.
(door opens)

277
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,670
Hey! Azusa!

278
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,339
[Azusa] Sorry.

279
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,176
Well you see, I thought it'd be
nice if I made tea for you
today.

280
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,635
[Tsumugi] How thoughtful.

281
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,554
[Ritsu] Azusa! Over here!

282
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,392
[Ritsu] Listen, Azusa...
[Azusa] Yes?

283
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,936
About the future of
the Light Music Club...

284
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,355
It'll be fine!

285
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,190
But we never took the time
to find anyone to replac-

286
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,484
Really, I mean it, it'll be
fine.

287
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,528
I'll do whatever it takes to
get new club members.

288
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,866
I promise that no matter what
I'll never let the club be
disbanded!

289
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,284
Azusa-chan...

290
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,037
More importantly, I have
something I want to give you,

291
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,039
I feel like I've never thanked
all of you properly.

292
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,042
So I wrote a thank-you note
for each of you.

293
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,920
I kind of did it in a hurry
before rushing here.

294
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,380
Ritsu-senpai.

295
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,048
[Ritsu] Thanks.

296
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,675
[Azusa] Mio-senpai.
[Mio] Thank you.

297
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,843
[Azusa] Mugi-senpai.

298
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:09,886
[Tsumugi] Thank you.

299
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:10,929
[Azusa] Yui-senpai.

300
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,640
Oh wow thank you.

301
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,101
So then, can we read these now?

302
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,602
Sure, go ahead.

303
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,856
[Yui] Oo, I wonder what mine
says?

304
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,566
[Mio] Thanks, Azusa.

305
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,110
You're welcome.

306
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,368
I want to wish you,
congratulations on your...

307
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,583
Is something wrong?

308
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,127
[Mio] Azusa?

309
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,548
[Azusa] Please don't graduate...

310
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,216
[Ritsu] Azusa?

311
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,510
[Azusa] I won't yell at you for
leaving the club room a mess,

312
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:54,097
and for doing nothing
but drinking tea all day.

313
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,268
Just please don't graduate.

314
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,485
Azu-nyan!

315
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:12,198
I'm sorry... I just-

316
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,825
What happened to your forehead?

317
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:14,951
Oh did you hurt yourself?

318
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,077
You run into something?

319
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,081
Yes... I know it's your
graduation...

320
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,294
And we should celebrate.

321
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,005
Hey it's okay, I have a bandage!

322
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,053
Done!

323
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:37,140
I'm really sorry... I promised
myself that I wouldn't cry...

324
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,559
I wanted to look happy for you.

325
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,479
[Azusa] I'll be fine.

326
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,315
I'll keep the Light Music Club
going, I promise.

327
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,818
And I have Ton-chan, so I wont
be...

328
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,362
I want you to have this!

329
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,951
[Yui] It's a picture of us from
a long time ago. When we were
freshmen!

330
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,788
We were younger then than you
are now.

331
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,165
Here! This is for you, too!

332
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:06,378
It's a flower with five petals!
Just like us, Azu-nyan!

333
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,469
Way to upstage us with
a bunch of cool stuff, Yui!

334
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,846
She's right you're making us
look bad!

335
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:20,183
Azusa, we have a song
that we want you to hear.

336
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,060
Not you, too, Mio!

337
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,187
And we wrote it just for you,
Azu-nyan!

338
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,065
That was supposed to be my line,
Yui-chan!

339
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,235
[Yui] Azu-nyan.

340
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,196
Come sit over here.

341
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,744
(testing instruments)

342
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,930
Wow, you guys really
aren't very good!

343
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,851
[Azusa] But I want to hear you
play again and again anyway.

344
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,186
Encore!

345
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,772
[Yui] Why don't you join in
on this one, Azu-nyan?

346
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,231
Sure!

347
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,777
[Yui] You came here to
listen to us play!

348
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,532
One, two!

349
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:26,513
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")

350
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,516
The Light Music Club?

351
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:54,976
The third floor?

352
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,479
Maybe the problem is that you're
overthinking it too much.

353
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,397
She's right.

354
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,192
Take a more organic approach and
just write down whatever pops
into your head.

355
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:05,987
What really? I don't think I've
ever heard anyone practicing
on the third floor.

356
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:09,824
For the visuals,
I envision a music video,

357
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,576
with you guys playing in
an old warehouse or something.

358
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,954
You make the camera angles
super high! You'd look
totally awesome!

359
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,539
That's it!
