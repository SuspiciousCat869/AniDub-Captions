1
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,631
(marker squeaking)
[Ritsu] Okay, all done.

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,259
I can't believe she slept
through that.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,721
[Tsumugi] She must be
exhausted from playing Romeo.

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,767
Good morning, Mio!

5
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,644
[Tsumugi and Yui]
Morning, Mio-chan!

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,354
Oh hey, guys!

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,321
(Mio screams)

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:35,827
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

9
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,086
Mio punched me hard!

10
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,587
Why did you do this to me?!

11
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,382
We did it to help keep you
from freaking out!

12
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,800
Well you way overdid it!

13
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,261
It's supposed to be
more effective this way.

14
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,347
And while we were at it,
we also thickened your lifeline!

15
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,325
Well, should we all
head over there?

16
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,577
It'll be okay, Mio-chan!

17
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,954
Just remember our special
training!

18
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,164
[Mio] You're right.

19
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,915
[Azusa] Just play like always
do.

20
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:46,916
[Mio] Okay.

21
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,877
[Ritsu] You guys ready to rock?!

22
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,878
[Girls] Yeah!

23
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,796
[Tsumugi] Another live show for
us!

24
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,964
[Girls] Yeah!

25
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,215
[Azusa] Our best gig ever!

26
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,300
[Girls] Yeah!

27
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,718
[Yui] And then we get to
eat cake!

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,886
Yeah!

29
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,346
Huh?

30
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,564
(applause)

31
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,569
You guys were really great out
there!

32
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,738
Okay, you ready?

33
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,365
Yeah!

34
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,956
Alright, everything here looks
in place.

35
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,669
Can you guys believe this is the
third time we've played school
festival?

36
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,213
[Ritsu] I know right? Just two
years ago,

37
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,674
we were a nervous wreck
before our first show.

38
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,966
Two years ago...

39
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,260
Uh, but so much has
changed for us since then!

40
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,262
Last year was totally different!

41
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:45,475
Yeah you're right, I came down
with a fever and then I forgot
Geeta at home...

42
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,144
I still feel bad about that.
It was one of the worse things.

43
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,938
[Nodoka announcing] And now,
the act you've all been waiting
for,

44
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,066
Sakuragaoka High's school
festival's main event!

45
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,193
After-school Tea Time!

46
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,696
Way to raise their expectations
Nodoka...

47
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,198
I'm scared... The pressure's too
great.

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,033
It'll be alright, Mio-chan.

49
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,828
Yeah, it's like they say,
bad things only come in threes!

50
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,621
[Ritsu] You're really not
helping.

51
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,915
[Ritsu] Yui!
[Azusa] Senpai!

52
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,585
(cheering & clapping)

53
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,011
(Guitar screeches)
[Yui] Geeta!

54
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,764
Sorry about all that...

55
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,605
What's going on?

56
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,650
Every single person out there
has got our t-shirt on.

57
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,528
[Nodoka] Alright, let's have
a big round of applause!

58
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,238
(Audience applauds and cheers)
[Yui] Nodoka-chan?

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,283
[Mio] Hey Nodoka, w-what are you
doing?

60
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,578
Well I didn't plan on it, but I
became president of the Mio Fan
Club,

61
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,747
so I decided to put them to
work.

62
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,457
Wait a sec!

63
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,417
So YOU made all these T-shirts?

64
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,253
Just calm down.

65
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,548
[Nodoka] Miss Yamanaka is the
one who supplied us with the
t-shirts,

66
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,509
and we all distributed them to
the audience before the show.

67
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,095
Oh thank you Sawa-chan!

68
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,264
Yeah thank you so much!
(Audience applauds and cheers)

69
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,974
Thanks, Miss Yamanaka!

70
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,143
[Nakajima] Thank you!
[Ohta] You're awesome!

71
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,603
<i>Finally my moment!</i>

72
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:17,067
Uh... We're After-school Tea
Time.

73
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,611
Uh...

74
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,112
[Nakajima] You can do it!

75
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,072
[Iida] Come on Yui!

76
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,782
Thanks, everybody...

77
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:28,870
When I look out there and see
all that you guys have done for
us...

78
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,289
It almost makes me feel like
crying.

79
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,333
Because you ARE crying.

80
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,918
[Ohta] Yui!

81
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,712
[Iida] That's gross!

82
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,631
[Nakajima] Good one, Prez!

83
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,592
[Nojima] Say something Mio!

84
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:46,680
[Mio] Thanks.
(Audience applauds and cheers)

85
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,391
So anyway, here's our first
song!

86
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,476
Rice Is a Side Dish!

87
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,353
[Chikada] Really?

88
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,606
I hope everyone out there likes
it!

89
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,359
You guys ready?

90
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,993
One, two, three, four!

91
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,535
Hey!

92
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,555
That was great!

93
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,308
Um- (Mic feedback) Oops.

94
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,935
That was Rice Is a Side Dish!

95
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,188
Once again our band's name
is After-school Tea time.

96
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,440
(Audience applauds and cheers)

97
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,944
The four of us who are seniors
are all in the same class
together,

98
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:11,533
and let me tell you, that play
we did yesterday, it was super
hard!

99
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,327
Did you guys see Mio-chan
playing Romeo?

100
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,954
She was pretty awesome, right?

101
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,832
(Audience applauds and cheers)
[Mio Fan] You were super cool!

102
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,084
Come on Mio-chan, say something!

103
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,085
Like what?

104
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,962
Maybe recite one of Romeo's
lines!

105
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:28,383
No that's over! I never want to
have to say those lines again!

106
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,052
Come on. You know you still
have them memorized.

107
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,470
Et tu, Ritsu?!

108
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:38,059
(Audience applauds and cheers)

109
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,769
[Mio] Ah, fair Juliet!

110
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,439
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous,

111
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,649
and keeps thee here to be his
paramour?

112
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,195
(Audience applauds and cheers)

113
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,824
Oo! And Juliet came from
our band too, it was Ri-chan!

114
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,492
You're dragging me into this?!

115
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,244
[Yui] Do a line for us, Ri-chan!

116
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,663
I would, but I've already
forgotten them all.

117
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,332
If had to do it, you have to do
it!

118
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,834
All right, fine...

119
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,836
[Yui] Come on up, Ri-chan!

120
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:13,803
O Romeo! Wherefore art
thou, my fair Romeo?

121
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:18,850
(Audience applauds and cheers)

122
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,518
That was great Ritsu!

123
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,103
Ritsu!

124
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,355
Well thank you...

125
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,856
Thanks guys, good job!

126
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,109
Oh, and I was in the play too
I had the role of Tree G!

127
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,571
I was told to hold perfectly
still the entire time,

128
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,698
but I came really close
to having to sneeze!

129
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,450
(laughter)

130
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,160
[Yui] So I told myself, "You're
a tree!

131
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,038
You're a tree, you don't
sneeze!" and I held it in!

132
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,458
And then during the scene
change, I moved off the stage
like th-

133
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,001
(guitar feedback)

134
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,796
I'm sorry, Azu-nyan!

135
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,923
[Azusa] Don't worry about it,
are you all right?

136
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,842
By the way, what'd your class
do for the school festival?

137
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,886
We're selling baked goods and
stuff.

138
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,222
Come on, let's move on to the
next song!

139
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,765
Sure, sure, good idea.

140
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,769
Alright everybody, here's our
next song!

141
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,856
Handling the scripts for the
play was Mugi- I mean, Miss
Kotobuki.

142
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,066
Give her a big hand guys!

143
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,776
(Audience applauds and cheers)

144
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,903
Now she's just babbling about
nothing...

145
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,072
Wait, what was the next song
again?

146
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,659
I told you to write the set list
on a post-it or something!

147
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,412
I did, but I guess I lost it
somewhere.

148
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,913
Do you think you dropped it?

149
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,249
Maybe, but I could've sworn
that I put it in my pocket...

150
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,377
It's because we changed
into t-shirts earlier!

151
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,671
You're right!

152
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,007
(Audience laughs)

153
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,801
Don't worry! Hang in there, Sis!

154
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,308
K-ON!

155
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,270
Step right up!
Come and check out our booth.

156
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,730
[Girl] Hey look!

157
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,734
("Fuwa Fuwa Time"
playing in distance)

158
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,153
[Ichigo] Here please
put this on.

159
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,571
Are these for free?

160
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,448
Yes. We'd appreciate it
if you would wear it,

161
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,200
during the performance
that's going on right now.

162
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,785
Yes of course.

163
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,252
Thanks a lot!
You guys are great!

164
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,671
[Yui] Alright, I'd like to take
this chance to introduce

165
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,882
all the members of our band!

166
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,842
Our club advisor, Sawa-chan!

167
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,260
Why is she introducing me?!

168
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,263
You have to introduce her
properly as Miss Yamanaka!

169
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:24,768
Oops, make that Miss Yamanaka!
Miss Sawa-chan Yamanaka!

170
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,270
Stop calling her "Sawa-chan"!

171
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,733
[Yui] Miss Yamanaka's
the best, she's super nice,

172
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:35,320
and always helps out
with club activities
whenever she can.

173
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,782
Shine on you crazy diamonds!
(Audience applauds and cheers)

174
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,159
Thank you, for everything!

175
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,288
[Yui] Okay, and on bass,
Mio-chan!

176
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,664
[Audience] MIO!

177
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,334
[Mio Fan] Mio-senpai!

178
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,044
She's pretty great isn't she?

179
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,588
She even played Romeo in
our class play yesterday, and--

180
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,173
We already covered that!

181
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,551
(laughter)

182
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,011
[Mio] Hi, everyone.

183
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,305
I just want to thank you all
for coming out here today,

184
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,393
to hear our songs.
We really appreciate it.

185
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:12,857
Being able to play in a band
like this with my friends, well
it's the best!

186
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,363
Oh I almost forgot! Mio-chan
even has her own fan club!

187
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,781
If any of you want to join,

188
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,701
just see Nodoka-chan over there
and she'll sign you up.

189
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,203
Nodoka-chan's been my best
friend since like forever,

190
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,331
she's super smart and she,
knows just about everything,

191
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,500
that's why she's always helping
me with my homework.

192
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,794
Yui, that's enough!

193
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,838
How about a word for the
audience, Nodoka-chan?

194
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,214
[Nodoka] Why me?!

195
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,551
Hurry up! Just go to your next
introduction already!

196
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,885
[Yui] Aw...

197
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,055
In that case, here on
the keyboard is Mugi-chan!

198
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,558
(Audience applauds and cheers)

199
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,643
Good afternoon, everyone.

200
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,938
Thank you so much for coming out
and listening to us play today.

201
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,898
It really means a lot to me.

202
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,191
[Nakajima] One, two...

203
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,818
[Girls] Mugi!

204
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,695
You guys are amazing!

205
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:03,867
I love being in a band! It's so
fun! It really is the best thing
ever!

206
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,120
[Yui] Okay Mugi-chan, calm
down...

207
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,248
Mugi-chan makes us tea
for the band, it's incredible.

208
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,792
I look forward to it every
single day.

209
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,711
[Girl] I wanna have some!

210
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:18,882
Feel free to drop by our club
room anytime. We would love to
have you over!

211
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,927
Ton-chan's in our club room,
too, so if you come by you can
meet him!

212
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,262
[Girl] What's a Ton-chan?

213
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,431
Oh you see, Ton-chan's
a special kind of turtle,

214
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,391
that's called a pig-nosed
turtle.

215
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,394
He's so cute, his nose looks
like a pig snout!

216
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,395
Right, Azu-nyan?

217
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,855
Huh? Yeah!

218
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,940
[Yui] On guitar Azu-nyan!
(Audience applauds and cheers)

219
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,317
It's my turn now?

220
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,736
Sorry about that!

221
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,862
Are you okay?

222
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,406
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry
everyone.

223
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:48,787
Um, my name's Azusa Nakano.
It's really nice to meet all of
you.

224
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,747
[Jun] Azusa!
[Ui] Azusa-chan!

225
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,501
Azu-nyan's a junior, but she's
one of the best guitar players
I've ever met.

226
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,879
I ask her to give me tips
on the guitar all the time.

227
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,757
Azu-nyan, thanks for everything.

228
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,092
(Audience applauds and cheers)

229
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,218
Of course glad to help...

230
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,221
And next up on the drums, it's
Ri-chan!

231
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,599
[Yui] She's also the president
of the Light Music Club!

232
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,184
Um I'd like to thank everybody

233
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,728
for coming out to hear
the Light Music Club play today.

234
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,021
We really hope you like it.

235
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,189
[Ohta] Yo, Ri-chan!

236
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,024
[Nakajim] Stop acting so
uptight!

237
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,275
(Audience applauds and cheers)

238
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,486
I think it's time for our next
song.

239
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,404
[Ohta] That was quick!

240
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,655
You sure?

241
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,573
[Ritsu] I'm sure.

242
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,700
Okay then.

243
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,451
Alright everyone, here's our
next song!

244
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,037
Hey! You haven't introduced
yourself yet!

245
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,414
Oh, you're right!

246
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,083
[Tsumugi] Lastly Yui-chan on
guitar!

247
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,294
(Audience applauds and cheers)
[Ui] That's my sister!

248
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,589
What I like about Yui is that
what you see is what you get.

249
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,841
A ditzy airhead.

250
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,593
But she always gives you
her all, no matter what.

251
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,305
Her energy's contagious it
brings up everyone in the room.

252
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,267
And you can always
count on her in the end.

253
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,145
(Audience applauds and cheers)
Wait, huh? What just happened?

254
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,772
Come on, start the next song
already!

255
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,858
Big Sis!

256
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,693
Ui!

257
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,069
You're doing great!

258
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,988
She yelled back at me!

259
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,489
Well you did call out to her.

260
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,532
Yui!

261
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,659
[Girls] After-school Tea Time!
Woo!

262
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,828
After-school Tea Time!

263
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:19,252
(Audience applauds and cheers)

264
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,264
Okay, this next song will
be our last one!

265
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,351
(Audience lets out sounds
of disappointment)

266
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:39,647
We really wish we could play
more for you, but we're out of
time.

267
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,815
[Nakajima] You were great!

268
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,610
[Ohta and Iida]
After-school! After-school!

269
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,363
[Sano] Hey! Say the full name!

270
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:53,370
I just want to thanks everyone
for coming here today!

271
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:57,290
And Miss Yamanaka,
thank you for the great
t-shirts!

272
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,543
[Yui] Thanks for always
being there, Nodoka-chan!

273
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,171
Ui! Jun-chan! Thank you!

274
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,215
And to all our classmates, thank
you!

275
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:05,924
Yui!

276
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,050
You rock!

277
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,176
Yui! You're great!

278
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,054
Ton-chan, thank you! Club room,
thank you!

279
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,889
Geeta, thank you!

280
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,725
Everybody everywhere, thank you!

281
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,728
(Audience applauds and cheers)

282
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,566
After-school Tea Time will
always be... Will always be...

283
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,568
after school!

284
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,866
Okay, here's our last song!

285
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,453
It's called, U & I!

286
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,457
We were a hit...weren't we guys?

287
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:48,545
We were, but it all went by
so quickly.

288
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:52,716
I don't even remember how we
played, if we were actually any
good or not.

289
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,761
That surprise t-shirt stunt
they pulled on us really blew me
away.

290
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:00,348
Same goes for me.
I couldn't wrap my head around
it.

291
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,186
But still, it was a lot of fun,
wasn't it?

292
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,023
That just may have been our best
show yet.

293
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,775
Yeah, everyone's playing
was totally perfect.

294
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,360
[Yui] We were so in sync!

295
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,529
[Ritsu] Was Geeta happy, with
the show?

296
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,115
Yeah! And how about Elizabass?

297
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,034
Elizabass is thrilled!

298
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,618
Muttan is happy too!

299
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,039
What!? Why the heck would
you go and name your guitar
Muttan?

300
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,084
He's a Mustang, so Muttan makes
sense.

301
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,587
So everybody what do you wanna
do now?

302
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,381
[Azusa] Well... I could go for
some cake!

303
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,924
[Ritsu] We've got the funds for
it!

304
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,552
[Tsumugi] You can't BUY a cake!
I brought some with me!

305
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:41,514
[Yui] Sweet! Let's eat first,
then plan our club schedule for
next year!

306
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,351
The next show is going to be
our Christmas party, right?

307
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,686
And then right after that
it will be New Years!

308
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,897
We can all visit the temple
together!

309
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,858
And then we'll have
the Freshman orientation show!

310
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,236
What do you guys say
we stay overnight again for
that?

311
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,906
Yeah and we can invite
Sawa-chan next time!

312
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,491
Perfect, that's a great idea!

313
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,493
[Ritsu] And now that we have air
conditioning summer's a breeze!

314
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,203
[Tsumugi] And then
there's our training camp!

315
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,664
[Yui] It's going to be so much
fun I can't wait! And after
that...

316
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,334
[Azusa] Let's see, after that
would be-

317
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,461
Nope. After that, we're done.

318
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,214
When it comes time for next
year's school festival

319
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,424
I know we're going to play even
better.

320
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,718
Are you gonna hold yourself back
a year?

321
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,596
There aren't going to be any
more school festivals for us.

322
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:25,767
Oh yeah, well that's kind of a
big bummer.

323
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,727
I don't want it to end!

324
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,730
Calm down, Mugi-senpai,
don't throw a tantrum.

325
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:34,234
You, too, Yui-senpai.
You can't start crying like a
baby.

326
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,611
It's sweat not tears!

327
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,616
Mio!

328
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,618
Lyco-ping!

329
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,788
(cry-laughter)

330
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,998
You're crying, too, you big
hypocrite.

331
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,875
No! I'm just sweating!

332
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:55,797
Hey, go on, dry your eyes.

333
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,881
Azusa-chan...

334
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:57,924
Yes?

335
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,176
I just want to say thank you so
much.

336
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:01,678
Sure.

337
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:08,935
[Azusa] It's going to be okay,
Mugi-senpai. I Promise.

338
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:13,523
We were good, right? Guys!
We were really good today!

339
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,234
We were amazing!

340
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,529
It was an honor to have
the chance to play with you all.

341
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,782
You guys!

342
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,245
Watch it, Yui!
You're snotting all over me!

343
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,496
[Yui] Mugi-chan!

344
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,790
[Tsumugi] Ew, your nose!

345
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,335
(Girls crying)

346
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,045
[Yui] Lyco-ping!

347
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,505
(Girls laughing and crying)

348
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,476
[Nodoka] Yui and the others were
completely caught off guard.

349
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,812
That means operation:
T-shirt Shock was a success!

350
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,022
Next up...

351
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,483
Sawako! Sawako! Sawako!

352
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,652
Girls! That was amazing!

353
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,237
Huh?

354
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,998
[Nodoka] Well, they all look
happy...

355
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:25,970
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")

356
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,516
[Yui] I'm trying to pick a new
hairstyle for my graduation
picture.

357
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:57,062
It'll be with me for the rest of
my life. So I want to make sure
it's perfect!

358
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,481
[Azusa] Shouldn't you guys
be trying to study?

359
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,024
[Nodoka] Got a headache?

360
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:04,069
[Yui] No, it's something else,
see I'm not my usual self today.

361
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,654
[Nodoka] Well you look
exactly the same to me.

362
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,949
[Yui] Nodoka-chan,
you've known me for so long.

363
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:12,952
[Yui] That means I look like a
dog!

364
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,329
[Ui] Hey there Sis!

365
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,705
[Yui] I was grinning in
this grade school picture,

366
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,249
but then I got nervous
for this junior high photo.

367
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,543
This year is gonna be perfect!
