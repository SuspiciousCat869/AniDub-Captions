1
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,677
Big Sis, if you don't get up
soon, you'll be late.

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,389
Huh? Oh. She slept with Geeta
again?

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,474
Ui?

4
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,521
Huh? My arm's asleep for some
reason...

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,732
Did you fall asleep
while practicing again?

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,567
Yeah...

7
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:32,490
Geeta, good morning! Smoochies!

8
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,039
Sis, don't fall asleep again!

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,294
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

10
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,259
[Yui] It's raining today, huh?

11
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,427
[Ui] The rainy season started.

12
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,346
Which means it's gonna be
raining a lot.

13
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,435
I've got to make sure
that Geeta doesn't get wet.

14
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,229
Ui, can you hold my bag
for just a minute?

15
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,313
Mhm sure.

16
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,606
Thanks a lot.

17
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,817
There you go.

18
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,946
Ready!

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,865
Oh, you're like a couple!

20
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,075
Gosh, you're right!

21
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,660
[Yui] Thanks for holding my bag!

22
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,245
[Ui] Here.

23
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,541
[Yui] And we're off!

24
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,128
[Yui] I can't see where I'm
going...

25
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,463
[Ui] Do you need help?

26
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,340
[Yui] No, I'm okay...

27
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,349
Oh man I hate
the rainy season...

28
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,186
Geeta's dry, but you're
getting soaking wet!

29
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,869
Good boy!

30
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,828
[Woman] I'm so sorry!

31
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,871
Big Sis?

32
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,625
Yuita!

33
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:33,254
It's all right Ui. What's
important is that Geeta's dry.

34
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,256
[Yui] Alright,
let's get moving, Ui!

35
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,217
[Ui] Oh Sis...

36
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,595
Oh Big Sis!

37
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,227
It's been nothing but rain
lately.

38
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,521
Rainy season gets old
real fast...

39
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:54,859
Yeah, even with a great big
umbrella, you always end up
getting wet.

40
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,652
Huh?

41
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,862
Mugi, what are you doing?

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,032
Nothing...

43
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,701
[Yui] Good morning, everybody.

44
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
Hey, Yui.

45
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,036
Good mor-- Eh?

46
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,037
[Ritsu and Mio] You're soaked!

47
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,372
Eheh...

48
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,125
Ui wiped off what she could
with her hanky, but...

49
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,169
[Tsumugi] Oh don't worry,
I brought a towel with me.

50
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,462
Wow, you're so prepared!

51
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,548
Thanks a lot, Mugi-chan.

52
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:22,554
And down we go. And you stay
here and be a good boy.

53
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,973
You really love him, like a
boyfriend.

54
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,099
Huh?

55
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,435
Nah. I wouldn't go that far...

56
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,811
All the best, you two.

57
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,565
So Miss Hirisawa, do you itch
anywhere?

58
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,360
Nope, I mean none!
Oops, sorry that's not how it
goes!

59
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,362
Okay now, what's with the weird
routine?

60
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,531
[Tsumugi] We're playing
"Hairdresser"!

61
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,575
You love that too?

62
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,119
So, what happened to you, Yui?
Did you trip?

63
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,163
You know what I mean. Your usual
schtick?

64
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:54,085
No, I got drenched because I was
trying to keep Geeta safe and
dry in all this rain.

65
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,253
I don't know what happened.

66
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,838
Why didn't you wrap him in a
plastic bag?

67
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,759
Hey, you're right!
You're so smart, Mio-chan!

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,303
<i>[Mio] NORMAL people would</i>
<i>have thought of that right off.</i>

69
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,307
Well your hair is dry, but,
um...

70
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:11,144
My hair is all ruffled up after
I spent the whole morning
setting it!

71
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,856
Yeah, all this humidity's
a real pain, huh?

72
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,983
My hair looks like this every
morning.

73
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,945
[Tsumugi] During the rainy
season, I spend all morning
fighting with my hair.

74
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,114
Hm? You do that, too?

75
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,617
Oh, so that's why you
were fussing over your hair.

76
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,870
I guess we both have
naturally frizzy hair, huh?

77
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,959
<i>[Mio] If they both have frizzy</i>
<i>hair, why are they so</i>
<i>different?</i>

78
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,753
(sneezes)

79
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,256
Oh, no! If we don't get your
clothes dry, you're going to
catch cold!

80
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,634
Let's hang 'em up in the club
room.

81
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,761
[Yui] Sorry for dragging
you up here with me.

82
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:49,516
Ugh, my indoor shoes are all
soggy, too.

83
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,560
And now...

84
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,730
My tights are soaked, too...

85
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,482
I brought some hot water!

86
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,068
Huh? You're going to make tea?

87
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,613
I'm supposed to drink from the
bucket?

88
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,157
No silly, warm up your feet with
it.

89
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,743
Oh I get it, thanks, Mugi-chan!

90
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,995
Please pardon me, then...

91
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,584
That's so warm...

92
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,088
I feel like I'm in Heaven...

93
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,716
[Yui] I don't want to go to
class now...

94
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,968
[Mio] Of course you're going to
class!

95
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,178
[Yui] Yeah, you're mad!

96
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,596
[Tsumugi] Once you're warmed up,

97
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,515
get out of those clothes.
I'll hang them up to dry.

98
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,058
[Yui] Kay...

99
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,397
Whew!

100
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,190
Welcome home, dear!

101
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,859
Here, I just walked in the door!

102
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,027
Thank you.

103
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,069
(sneezes)

104
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,947
Quit messing around and get
changed!

105
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,121
Yui-chan, we hung up your
clothes to dry.

106
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,497
What are you doing?

107
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,170
I'm embarrassed to let Geeta see
me in such a scandalous state!

108
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,171
Yeah, whatever.

109
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,672
Boy, what a tough crowd...

110
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,924
What are you gonna do about
a change of clothes?

111
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,677
There's no P.E. today,
so we don't have our sweats.

112
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,554
Yeah you're right.

113
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,686
Look, we have Sawa-chan's
handmade outfits! The Club's
awful legacy!

114
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,438
Oh. Right, those.

115
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,106
[Yui] Hmph!

116
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,358
[Yui] Yeah!

117
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,026
Why would you pick THAT, of all
things?!

118
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,944
Huh?

119
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,989
Where have you been hiding that
thing, anyway? We returned those
to Sawa-chan.

120
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,367
[Yui] I like this one, so I kept
it!

121
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,453
Ah Yui, there you are.

122
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,039
You need to come back,
homeroom is about start.

123
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,290
You guys, too.

124
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,417
Wait, how did you know it
was Yui in there?

125
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,712
Well, it was just giving off a
"Yui" vibe.

126
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,923
[Yui] You're so awesome,
Nodoka-chan!

127
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,467
Is that the only spare outfit
you have?

128
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,095
Well, there are others, but...

129
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,516
Good morning, take your seats.
Let's take attendance now.

130
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,270
Miss Hirasawa? What in
the world are you wearing?

131
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,565
My uniform was all wet,
so I had to change into this!

132
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,236
B-But a strange outfit like that
isn't appropriate to wear for
school!

133
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,989
C'mon, what're you talking
about? You're the one who made
that thing, Sawa-ch-

134
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,409
Don't you have anything else?

135
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,660
Well, um I...

136
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,911
(door opens)

137
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,247
I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.

138
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,877
I borrowed these sweats
from a girl in another class.

139
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,712
Aw...

140
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,588
What's the matter?

141
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,466
I was hoping this would be a
chance to wear something a
little different.

142
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,968
Just go get changed!

143
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,345
Yes, ma'am!

144
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,682
Hey Azusa-chan, did you find
what you were looking for?

145
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,268
[Jun] What the heck is that?

146
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,310
[Azusa] I don't know...

147
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,812
[Ui] Whose are they?

148
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,522
[Azusa] I don't know...

149
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,109
<i>Those are Sis' tights!</i>

150
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,154
Seriously now, who would hang
all their clothes in here?

151
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,864
<i>I can't tell them!</i>

152
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,081
Darn, I can't crease these
pleats...

153
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,751
Ow!

154
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,919
Yui-chan, I'll do it! Let me.

155
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,088
You will? Thanks...

156
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,215
You're really good at that,
Mugi!

157
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,675
Yeah, thank you so much!

158
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,427
[Ritsu] Yui!
[Yui] Yeah?

159
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,596
One of your buttons was about to
fall off.

160
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,223
Really? And you put it back on
for me?

161
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,892
Mhm.

162
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,518
Here.

163
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,686
Thank you!

164
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,188
For someone who hates
"fiddly" instruments,

165
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,274
you sure can fix a button
quickly, Ritsu. Impressive.

166
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,233
Oh lay off.

167
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,527
It's way too nice for me to
wear!

168
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,112
Gosh!

169
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,575
[Ritsu] Yui.
[Yui] Yeah?

170
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,203
[Ritsu] You're going to wear
that?

171
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,246
No one will be able to tell
when I'm sitting down.

172
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,999
I meant as a girl,
are you going to wear that?

173
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,126
You mix like this all this time,
Ritsu!

174
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,878
I do, don't I?

175
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,047
[Sawako] What are you doing?

176
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,091
[Yui] Sawa-chan!

177
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,552
Take off those sweat pants now.

178
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,347
And you need to tuck in
your blouse, Miss Tainaka.

179
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,348
What?!

180
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,016
You never cared about this
stuff!

181
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,310
W-what makes today any
different from before?

182
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,648
Alright, have I made myself
clear, ladies?

183
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,692
Fine, whatever...

184
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,318
Oh, good afternoon!

185
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,988
Good afternoon to you, too.
You certainly have your hands
full.

186
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,699
Oh, don't you worry about me.

187
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,243
I'm not worried about you at
all.

188
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,285
Heh...

189
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,579
Now you, Miss Hirasawa!

190
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,581
[Yui] But I like it better this
way!

191
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,916
No, and that's final!

192
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,294
Even if my skirt flips up,
I'm covered. And if I-

193
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,380
I said to take them off!

194
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,340
Help!

195
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,050
Sawa-chan, please stop!

196
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,886
Quiet! They'll think I'm
molesting you!

197
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,932
Aw, costume's gone.

198
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,601
Too bad. Class wont be as fun.

199
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,602
You're right.

200
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,980
See? Everybody was enjoying it.

201
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,441
[Nodoka] You don't have live up
to the expectations of others.

202
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,317
Hehe.

203
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,528
I can't believe it's still
raining.

204
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,072
[Ritsu] We're gonna get
soaked again.
[Mio] Yeah no kidding.

205
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,701
<i>[Yui] I have to keep Geeta</i>
<i>safe on the way home!</i>

206
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,126
[Yui] K-ON!

207
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,920
Oh, now I get it that's
what happened this morning.

208
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,881
[Mio] You didn't have any
problems, Azusa?

209
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:18,053
No, I use a raincoat that's
designed for carrying guitar
cases in wet weather.

210
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,055
[Yui] Wow, they really make
those?

211
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,141
[Azusa] Yeah, it's really
comes in handy.

212
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,102
I bought it online,
but it was on sale.

213
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:30,398
And it even came with a
desiccant pack to help
keep your guitars dry.

214
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,234
And I also bought this cool
thing online, for my guitar.

215
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,945
See? It's a guitar hanger
you stick on the wall.

216
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,739
It's shaped like an animal paw.

217
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,449
(awkward)

218
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:43,536
Oh and this is a strengthener
to help you open your fingers
wider.

219
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,623
And I got something else too,
I got a CD that's supposed to
help you,

220
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,043
develop your sense of rhythm
if you listen to it
while you sleep.

221
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,796
[Mio] Azusa.
[Azuza] Yes Mio?

222
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,716
I wonder, has any of
that stuff really helped?

223
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:04,391
Oh! Now I get why that uniform
was hung up to dry in the
club room today!

224
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,809
Jun actually said-

225
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,311
I think this might be
some kind of spell.

226
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,688
(gasps)

227
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,315
A curse cast by someone out
of hate for someone else.

228
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,025
[Azusa] No way!

229
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,820
Why else would someone hang up
clothes to dry in the Music Prep
Room?

230
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,822
Who's our mystery witch?

231
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,365
She had us all spooked
with that.

232
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,993
Ui couldn't bring herself
to say anything?

233
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:28,415
I'm really impressed, though!
You risked your health inorder
to protect Geeta!

234
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,499
Heh.

235
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,084
More, praise me more!

236
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,836
You should be careful, though.

237
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,171
They say if you put your guitar
away wet or even damp,

238
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,966
mold can start growing on the
fingerboard.

239
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,301
It does, does it?

240
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,804
Your case will be all covered
with mold!

241
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,764
(freak out)

242
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:49,519
You know, I really don't think
that Geeta will be all moldy and
gross or anything.

243
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:53,148
There's no mold, but I do see a
little bit of rust on some of
the strings.

244
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,483
Do you think I should put
new strings on him?

245
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,194
When was the last time you
restung him?

246
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,612
Two months ago.

247
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:03,074
Maybe you should, then.
Do you have new set of strings?

248
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,409
Mhm!

249
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,123
(determined)

250
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,249
(wary)

251
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,754
Don't bite...Geeta...

252
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,841
Wah...

253
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,388
[Yui] How dare you raise a hand
to me?!

254
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,475
You're supposed to loosen the
pegs before you cut the strings.

255
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,101
Oh, I forgot!

256
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,064
Don't worry, I'll have brand new
strings on you in no time,
Geeta!

257
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,940
I think it's nice that you're
taking good care of it,

258
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:40,528
but you don't really need to
speak to it like it's a real
person, do you?

259
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,953
Are you jealous, Azu-nyan?

260
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,498
I sense a love triangle here!

261
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,249
Don't encourage her like that!

262
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,586
Yes, a love triangle! Some
lyrics like that would make a
great song!

263
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,129
You, too, Mio-senpai?

264
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,924
Aw, you should've come out and
just said so in the first place!

265
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,885
(screaming)

266
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,262
Whew, I finally got all those
strings changed...

267
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,890
[Azusa] Why are you acting
exhausted over that?

268
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:12,727
Come on, why don't we practice?
The rain's stopped, so we won't
be so-

269
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,020
It stopped?!

270
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,689
[Yui] Hurry! Let's go home
while it's dry out!

271
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,315
[Azusa] I thought
we were going to practice!

272
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,192
[Yui] Geeta might get wet if we
stay!

273
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,778
[Azusa] It's always Geeta this,
and Geeta that with you...

274
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,824
Don't worry, Azu-nyan, I'll
always have a place in my heart
for you!

275
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,456
Everything's so clammy...

276
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,501
Sis ate half of that the day
before yesterday...

277
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,920
It's moldy!

278
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:43,508
[Ui] Big Sis! I'm got tea for
us.

279
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,762
You've got mold on you!
You didn't eat that moldy bun,
did you?

280
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,055
No, I didn't eat a bun.

281
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,099
[Ui] But what are those green
flecks?

282
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,184
Oh, do I still have sea weed on
my face?

283
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,521
Oh, right, you had takoyaki
for lunch today.

284
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,985
When is this rainy season gonna
be done?

285
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,279
[Yui] Rainy days can be fun,
too.

286
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,533
You can just hang out inside the
house and spend the whole day
together.

287
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,745
[Ui] I'm jealous.
[Yui] Huh?

288
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:16,124
[Ui] You've seemed so happy ever
since you started playing
guitar.

289
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,837
But you know...

290
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,257
Sometimes I worry about
not being able to play something
well,

291
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:28,011
or making Geeta look bad if
I play the wrong chord or miss a
beat.

292
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,889
Or really mess something up
badly.

293
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,975
But whatever happens,

294
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:38,813
all I want to go on having fun
and making music with him
forever and ever.

295
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,648
Here we go!

296
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,403
(Yui strumming)

297
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,037
Another rainy day.

298
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,872
[Yui] I've got it covered today!

299
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,874
Ta-dah!

300
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,084
Great idea!

301
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,919
Thank you!

302
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,549
I can't get this plastic off!

303
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,509
You went overboard.

304
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,178
About darn time.

305
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,724
Japanese weather can be awfuly
rough on instruments, can't it?

306
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,683
That's for sure.

307
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,351
If the neck absorbs
any moisture,

308
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:01,563
it'll warp and make it
really hard to tune properly.

309
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,605
Wow, it will?

310
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,815
If you octave tune it,

311
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,734
you can tell right away
if there's a problem.

312
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,278
First, you do this...

313
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:15,076
[Yui] Let me check mine!

314
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:19,748
Oh. Hey you're right!
Its off by half of a half
of a half tone!

315
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,667
You meand you can tell that
without using a tuner?!

316
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,710
Mhm.

317
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,880
(more strumming)

318
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,548
Wow, you're right.

319
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,718
According the tuner it's off by
a half a semi-tone like you
said!

320
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,261
In that case, fix it for me!

321
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,596
Just fix it yourself.

322
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,932
But it'll take forever
if I try to do it myself.

323
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,727
Yui, didn't I teach you
how to do it?

324
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:41,811
(awkward laugh)

325
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,313
Okay, just this once.

326
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,607
[Yui] Thank you, Azu-nyan!

327
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,237
This rain just won't let up...

328
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,447
It's getting worse.

329
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,199
Yeah and the wind's
picking up, too.

330
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,286
The weather forecast said
it's going to rain again
tomorrow.

331
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:02,290
Maybe I'll just leave my bass
in the club room overnight.

332
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:06,961
That's so cruel, Mio-chan!

333
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,797
(spooked)

334
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,173
What is?!

335
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,344
I feel so sorry for you,
Elizabass...

336
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,554
Mio-chan is just abandoning you!

337
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,349
I'm only leaving it here because
I don't want it to get wet!

338
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,975
And please don't name my bass!

339
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,977
Why don't you leave Geeta here,
too?

340
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,146
That would be the smart thing.

341
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:28,566
The plastic wrap you
brought isn't really usable...

342
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,235
[Yui] Good point.

343
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:36,658
[Yui] Now don't talk to
strangers or get into their car
or anything, okay?

344
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,535
What are you saying?

345
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,329
Elizabass, you're going to be
spending the night with Geeta
tonight. Okay?

346
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,664
I said not to name my stuff!

347
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:46,001
<i>She named it that, because it's</i>
<i>a bass...</i>

348
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:50,380
<i>Mine's a Mustang,</i>
<i>so I guess that would make</i>
<i>it...</i>

349
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,299
[Azusa] Muttan.

350
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,718
[Tsumugi] I think that's the
perfect name! (Azusa surprised)

351
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,512
Please don't read my mind
like that it freaks me out!

352
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:00,557
You said that out loud,
Azusa-chan.

353
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,893
[Ritsu] Oh wow, what a downpour!

354
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,604
[Asuza] Ugh, it's soaking
through to my socks.

355
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,149
[Mio] Leaving our instruments
was the right call.

356
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,696
[Yui] Well, I'll see you guys
tomorrow.

357
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:15,905
[Azusa] I'm off too.

358
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:16,990
[Tsumugi] See you tomorrow.

359
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,199
[Mio] Sure.

360
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,701
[Ritsu] Be careful going home.

361
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:22,328
Geeta, I'm worried sick about
you...

362
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,913
[Tsumugi] Wait, Yui-chan!

363
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,290
Yui-senpai!

364
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,126
She left Geeta behind,
and she's still getting soaked.

365
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:32,630
Yeah, it seems that Yui is
constantly fussing over Geeta,
doesn't it?

366
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,134
Well it's more like obsessing
rather than fussing, really.

367
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,971
She's making such a huge
spectacle over leaving him at
school.

368
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,264
Heh.

369
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:44,392
Really? Like you're one to talk
about Yui?

370
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,394
I seem to recall you
coming to me in tears

371
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,147
the first time your bass
got a little scratch on it.

372
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,899
Ritsu!

373
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,442
Where is it?

374
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,027
Here!

375
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,404
(Ritsu chuckling, Mio freaking
out)

376
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,285
(Ui stretching)

377
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,954
I'm finally finished with my
homework!

378
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,915
(strange noise)

379
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,917
W-What the heck is that?

380
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:15,215
(strange noise continues)

381
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,134
I hope it's not burglars...

382
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,683
Big Sister!

383
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,647
Big Sister! There's a weird
noise in the house and...

384
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,608
What are you doing?

385
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,027
Ui...

386
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,779
[Ui] What's wrong?

387
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,280
Ui...

388
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,199
Big Sis! Are you okay?

389
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:45,495
I'm so worried about Geeta
being all alone at school
that I can't sleep!

390
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,915
Aw it'll be alright Big Sis!

391
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:56,631
<i>[Ui] Come to think of it, she's</i>
<i>practiced on him every day</i>
<i>since she bought him.</i>

392
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,509
<i>They've been practically</i>
<i>inseparable.</i>

393
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,640
I can't take it anymore!
I'm going back for him!

394
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,684
Sis, don't do it!
We're on the third floor!

395
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,186
You're in your pajamas! And it's
raining!

396
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,524
Yui only spent one night
away from Geeta,

397
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,818
but she's got a huge smile
on her face.

398
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,904
I guess your guitar means
an awful lot to you, huh?

399
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,698
Yes!

400
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,201
That's understandable, but would
you mind putting it away
during homeroom?

401
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,995
Oh, don't mind him!

402
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,163
[Sawako] But I DO mind!

403
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,248
[Yui] Come on, just for a while?

404
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,375
[Sawako] I said no!

405
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,381
(Mio running and panting)

406
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,553
It's here...

407
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:47,807
Yui was so worried about leaving
Geeta here that it made me
nervous, too.

408
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:51,227
<i>[Ritsu] Your case will be</i>
<i>all covered with mold!</i>

409
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:58,860
What a relief!

410
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,664
Oh Elizabass...

411
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,377
Oh?

412
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,214
Wah!

413
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:23,927
(closing song, "Listen!!")

414
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,472
[Mio] Get it off me!
Get it off me!

415
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,015
The Mio-chan back scratchers!

416
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,683
Stop making up crazy stuff!

417
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:57,062
[Ritsu] And that was
when they first met...

418
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,647
[Ritsu] But what fate
lay in store for them?

419
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,524
[Ritsu] So do I...
First question!

420
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,819
What's the absolute scariest
story you've ever heard
in your whole life?!

421
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,654
[Mio] Huh? What kind of
question is that?!

422
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:10,033
[Yui] Next question! What's the
second scariest story
you've ever heard?!

423
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:13,119
[Ritsu] What's the third
scariest story you've
ever heard?!

424
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:18,958
[Mio] I've tried so very hard
to forget all that...
