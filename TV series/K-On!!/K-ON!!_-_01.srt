1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,383
(Yui running and panting)

2
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,307
(unzipping case)

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,229
(guitar strumming)

4
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,741
(playing guitar)

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,636
(Yui humming along)

6
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,763
(uh?)

7
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,766
[Yui] I look so awesome!

8
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,019
[Ritsu] What are you doing?
[Yui] Huh?

9
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:47,023
Working on a signature move for
our freshmen reception show!

10
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,942
(intrigued)

11
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,902
It's just kind of weird to see
you here so early.

12
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,156
I set my alarm clock wrong
and came to school an
hour early by mistake.

13
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,241
(ah...)

14
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,867
There's something on your face.

15
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,868
(Hm?)

16
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,412
Oh? Huh?

17
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,206
(Yui gasps happily)

18
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,001
Bread! Bread crumbs!

19
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,587
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

20
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,514
[Yui] Azu-nyan! Congratulations
on becoming a junior!

21
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,307
[Azusa] Why congratulate me for
that?

22
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,353
You know, you really don't look
all that different from last
year, Azusa.

23
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,481
Oh yeah? Well like you're one
to talk, Ritsu-senpai!

24
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,359
[Ritsu] Hey what's the big deal?
I was talking about your height!

25
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,361
[Azusa] Then why were
you looking at my bust line!?

26
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,947
Not much has changed now
that we're seniors.

27
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,365
I have to agree.

28
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,201
Alright! Since we're all here,
how about we practice?!

29
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,870
Yeah!

30
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,081
[Yui narrating] These five
people are the members of

31
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,291
our High School's Light Music
Club.

32
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,962
My name is Yui Hirasawa,
on guitar and vocals.

33
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,965
My favorite things are stuff
that's cute or delicious.

34
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:21,302
Our drummer and club president
is the ever-energetic Ritsu
Tainaka.

35
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:25,515
On keyboards is the kind-hearted
and slightly spacey Tsumugi
Kotobuki.

36
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,183
Mio Akiyama's on bass.

37
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:31,062
She's level-headed, but she's
also really shy and a
scaredy-cat.

38
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,608
And also on guitar is the tiny
and adorable Azusa Nakano.

39
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,736
She's our beloved kouhai!

40
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:42,407
Azu-nyan is a junior this year,
and the other four of us we're
seniors.

41
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,825
I feel so grown up!

42
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,535
(Hm?)

43
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,871
We all play in a band together
it's called After-school
Teatime,

44
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,582
and have tea and lots of fun
every day!

45
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,792
[Yui] All righty, then...

46
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,259
I can't believe we're finally
seniors! Time sure flew by!

47
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,219
I don't get what you're so happy
about.

48
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,305
Aw come on, Ri-chan,
can you really blame me?

49
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:09,684
There's something so cool about
it! So what are seniors supposed
to do anyway?

50
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,021
Learn how to set your alarm
clock correctly, for starters.

51
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,859
[Yui] Ri-chan old girl,
take a gander at this!

52
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:18,818
[Yui] What'cha think?

53
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,195
Hm?

54
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,906
Do I look like a senior?
Am I giving off a new vibe?

55
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,493
[Ritsu] What could possibly have
changed in the last two seconds?

56
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,286
[Tsumugi] Your part!

57
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,496
[Mio] You changed sides!

58
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,914
(gasping)

59
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,415
It's... It's!

60
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,250
It's too hard to tell. Denied.

61
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,670
(Yui upset)

62
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,755
[Yui] I wonder what our class
assignments are gonna be?

63
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,592
[Ritsu] Maybe you'll be off by
yourself in another class again,
Mio!

64
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,386
[Mio] Anything but that!

65
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,887
It'll be all right, Mio.

66
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,974
Goodness! What shocking
development is this?!

67
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,518
(Mio gasping)

68
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,144
[Ritsu] Kidding, I can't see a
thing.

69
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,396
[Mio] I wanna go home...

70
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,814
[Yui] Ri-chan!
[Ritsu] What?

71
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,149
I'll make my way in and take a
look.

72
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,068
[Ritsu] Good luck!

73
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,782
[Yui] Pardon me! Coming through!

74
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,336
(breath of relief)

75
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,629
(Hm?)

76
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,383
<i>But this means--</i>

77
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,556
(struggling) Oops!

78
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,609
I fell down!

79
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,528
What're you doing? Get up Yui.

80
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,738
(sobbing)

81
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,489
Well? So what did you see?

82
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,867
Hm? What do you mean?

83
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,412
Oh! We're all going to be in the
same class together this year!

84
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,830
No way!

85
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,622
We really are?!

86
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah! Isn't that amazing?!

87
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,627
[Ritsu] That's so gross! You've
got snot hanging from your nose!

88
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,671
[Tsumugi] You don't want
to go to class like that.

89
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,173
Hey Mio, isn't that great?

90
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,968
We're all together for senior
year, so you don't have to...

91
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,804
I-I'm so happy!

92
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,724
You could at least try
to pretend like you don't care.

93
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,978
The second time we went, we saw
a lot more of the country...

94
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,563
[Yui] Look, look!

95
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,231
Nodoka's in our class too!

96
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,608
(Ah!)

97
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,110
Looks like this is going
to be a boisterous class.

98
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,612
Isn't this the best class ever?

99
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,906
It's like someone rigged it
to keep us together.

100
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,200
It does! What an amazing
coincidence!

101
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,618
Wait, you don't think--

102
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,079
Did you use your power as
student council president?

103
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,375
No, of course I didn't. No one
could possibly fix it so that--

104
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,169
All right, everyone.
Please take your seats.

105
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,962
She could!

106
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,007
This is my very first time
acting as a homeroom teacher,

107
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,344
so even though I have my share
of shortcomings, let's all have
a good year.

108
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,764
How lucky! We've got Miss
Yamanaka as our homeroom
teacher!

109
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,557
She's gorgeous, and she seems
really nice.

110
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,767
(agreeing)

111
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,228
Hey you shouldn't let
appearances deceive you.

112
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,355
[Ritsu] Sawa-chan is really--
[Sawako] Miss Tainaka?

113
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,773
(shocked)

114
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,774
Ma'am?

115
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,944
Please refrain from talking
class.

116
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,947
I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean anything by it!

117
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,825
There you are!

118
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,617
Hm?

119
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,161
Sawa-chan! We need to talk!

120
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,039
The five of us want to ask you
something really important.

121
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,626
Did you have anything to do with
our homeroom assignment this
year?

122
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,295
Of course. I put all of you
in the same class.

123
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,881
Wait, can you do that?
Aren't you abusing your power?

124
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,800
So what's the problem? Aren't
you happy?

125
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,261
Of course we're happy, but
still...

126
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,681
Besides, it means I have five
fewer names to memorize.

127
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,766
<i>Ah, that explains it.</i>

128
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,811
I absolutely love it! Thank you
for doing that Miss Yamanaka!

129
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,812
You're very welcome.

130
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,063
(heavy breathing)

131
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,815
Quit spazzing out, Yui.

132
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,817
(gasps) But I'm excited
we all get to spend

133
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,694
our final year of high school
together!

134
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,112
It's great that we're together,

135
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,198
but we all need to start
thinking about our future plans.

136
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,870
But this means we all
go on class trips together

137
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,748
and do our school festival
presentation together!

138
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,125
And we can study for all
our tests together,

139
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,836
and I'll be able to copy
your homework too.

140
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,920
<i>[All three] What's that last</i>
<i>one?</i>

141
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,758
[Yui] I'm so psyched to be a
senior!

142
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,843
The orientation ceremony
is about to start.

143
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,511
You should get to the
auditorium.

144
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,971
Yes, ma'am!

145
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,348
(Yui giggling)

146
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,724
See ya later, Sawa-chan!

147
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,311
[Yui] It's gonna be so great
to be a senior!

148
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,739
(gasps)

149
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,667
Ready!

150
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,921
[Teacher] All rise for the
school song.

151
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,735
[Azusa] Let me at it!

152
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,945
What are you so psyched about,
Azusa?

153
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,407
I'm going to get more people
to join the Light Music club!

154
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,950
Yeah!

155
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:44,871
[Nodoka] Yui.

156
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,831
Ah, Nodoka-chan.

157
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,833
What are you doing there?

158
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,502
It seems like I'm one short of a
dozen.

159
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,673
So you are. Well, I'm off to
the student council meeting.

160
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,634
And I'm gonna go practice for
our reception show right now.

161
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,345
I hope you're able to find some
new members for the club.

162
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,306
Well, I don't mind too much if
we don't.

163
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,724
Do you really mean that?

164
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,476
(mm-hm)

165
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:10,021
But once you all graduate, Azusa
will be the only one left in the
club.

166
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,690
Wow, you're right...

167
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,318
You need to start thinking
things through. Well, practice
hard.

168
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,781
She's right...

169
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,751
<i>The Light Music Club has</i>
<i>to work hard, for Azusa!</i>

170
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,169
Yeah!

171
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,428
[Yui] K-ON!

172
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,389
[Yui] It's so relaxing here
in the club room!

173
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,184
[Ritsu] I know what you mean. I
had the urge to come here over
spring break.

174
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,602
Yeah so did I!

175
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,479
Okay! What's our first order
of business in this year?

176
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,816
[Azusa] To go and recruit new-
[Ritsu] To eat Mugi's delicious
cake!

177
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,568
I'm kidding, We'll get to that,
I promise.

178
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,862
Geez, take this seriously, would
you?

179
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,030
She's right, Ri-chan.

180
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,531
If we don't get new members,

181
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,451
Azu-nyan's gonna be the only
one left in the club next year.

182
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,828
<i>She's spouting serious words</i>
<i>with a slacker pose...</i>

183
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,621
I hadn't thought of that...

184
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:12,125
Still, that means that you're a
total lock for club president
next year!

185
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,085
[Ritsu] Sorta like this!
(Azusa laughing)

186
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,380
I-I couldn't care less about
that!

187
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,131
<i>She thought about it.</i>

188
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,632
<i>Just for a second.</i>

189
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,469
Anyway, let's get to work on
scouting new members right away!

190
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,803
<i>She dodged it.</i>

191
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,221
<i>She panicked and changed the</i>
<i>subject.</i>

192
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:29,059
Oh, I forgot! I made
some recruiting fliers for us!

193
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,352
No way!

194
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,312
My sister Ui said
she thought it'd be a good idea.

195
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,646
Oh...

196
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,939
Here!

197
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,275
Join the Light Music Club!

198
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,280
[Azusa] Why am I a pig?

199
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,575
[Yui] You complete
the Light Music Club Sandwich.

200
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,327
[Azusa] Sorry, I don't get it.

201
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:50,080
[Yui] We're a club, and club
sandwiches have bacon in them,
get it?

202
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,624
[Azusa] Fine, whatever. Let's
just hand out these fliers.

203
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,875
(Yui dejected)

204
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,294
[Everyone] Join the Light Music
Club!

205
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,421
No one is coming.

206
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,091
At this rate, the club
will be disbanded next year...

207
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:05,553
[Yui] Azu-nyan's gonna be all
alone.

208
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,474
Senpai... I'm so lonely...

209
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,934
(scared, screaming)

210
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,352
What is it?

211
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,144
[Mio] Azusa!

212
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,896
We can't let that happen!

213
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,190
I agree Yui, we can't!

214
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,609
President!

215
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,946
Right... And having more members
means more money in the
treasury.

216
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,364
Oink, oink!

217
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:28,201
Yeah! Operation: Capture
New Members is now underway!

218
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,163
[Girl] So anyway...
[Ritsu] Whoops! Whoa!

219
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,959
Uh, hey are you okay?

220
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:40,630
I'm sorry, but would you mind
helping me to the Light Music
Club room?

221
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,841
[Girls] Is anyone here?

222
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,842
Yes?

223
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,510
Are you all right?

224
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,761
We're here for you.

225
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,388
Hang in there.

226
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,434
Thanks for the help cause...

227
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,812
Right now the Light Music Club
wants you...

228
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,731
Welcome!

229
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,691
[Tsumugi] Would you like
some tea?
[Yui] Sign right here
and you can join us!

230
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,484
[Girls] No-no thank you!

231
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,155
We have cookies!

232
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,282
My "collapse in the hallway"
plan failed.

233
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,535
No Ri-chan, you shouldn't give
up so soon!

234
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:14,456
Sorry, dearies, but do you know
where the Light Music Club room
is?

235
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,125
[Ritsu] An accent?
[Azusa] What's she doing?

236
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,045
Oh, I think she's getting
directions from them.

237
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,506
I guess that's only natural.
How dumb is she?

238
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,386
Next, we'll go with a spy
operation!

239
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,473
So the basic idea here is
to join a club ourselves,

240
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,725
and see how they get
new members to sign up!

241
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,643
Softness overcomes hardness!

242
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:39,606
Judo is the art of mastering
techniques in order to hone the
spirit!

243
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,857
Right!

244
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,693
<i>Ah I see, so they use pep</i>
<i>talks.</i>

245
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,863
You know, I think I wanna
join the Judo club!

246
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,990
<i>The hunter becomes the prey!</i>

247
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,410
Go is a microcosm of the
universe.

248
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,912
(Oh?!)

249
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,247
Be my guest.

250
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,167
(disgusted)

251
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,961
Ri-chan it's so bitter...

252
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,214
All those clubs were really
neat, huh?

253
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,840
Yeah.

254
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,967
Wanna take a peek in here?

255
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,221
Is anybody home?

256
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,556
[Ritsu] Greetings!

257
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,312
It says "The sweat of youth."

258
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,314
This one has a special bonus for
joining.

259
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,899
(door opens)
Welcome to the club!

260
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,275
[Ritsu] Geez, it's you guys?

261
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,403
[Tsumugi] We've been handing out
fliers!

262
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,278
[Mio] How did it go on your end?

263
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,072
We didn't have much luck.

264
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,783
You guys went out dressed like
that?

265
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,368
You're very devoted.

266
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,244
(door opens)

267
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,745
Welcome to the club!

268
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,955
[Ritsu] It's just Sawa-chan.

269
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,832
Real nice.

270
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,793
I was wondering, what are you
going to wear for your
performance tomorrow?

271
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,128
Our uniforms are fine!

272
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,421
I made miniskirt maid-

273
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,588
Uniforms!

274
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,589
But they're cute.

275
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,716
(door opens)

276
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,009
Welcome to the club!

277
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,719
[Ritsu] Oh it's just Nodoka.

278
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,762
Oh are you doing costume
fittings?

279
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,974
[Nodoka] Look, about your
live performance tomorrow...

280
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,108
So does this look okay for our
set list?

281
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,484
Let's have a look...

282
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,444
Have a look?

283
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,195
Hm looks good!

284
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,614
[Ritsu] Mugi, when we do this
song, could you have her put a
rift...

285
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,616
<i>[Yui] The first time</i>
<i>Azu-nyan heard us play,</i>

286
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:18,747
<i>was the moment that she decided</i>
<i>that she wanted to join the</i>
<i>club, wasn't it?</i>

287
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,124
<i>I'm sure that there'll be</i>
<i>more people this year</i>

288
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,960
<i>who will feel the same way</i>
<i>that Azu-nyan did!</i>

289
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:27,213
<i>I hope. There SHOULD be.</i>

290
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,591
<i>There will be! Probably.</i>

291
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,844
What're you doing over there,
Yui?

292
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,929
Oh! it's almost time for us to
go on!

293
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,058
Awesome! Let's rock this show,
people!

294
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,726
Yeah!

295
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,938
[Yui] Testing, testing...

296
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,984
To all you new students,
congratulations on starting
school!

297
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,611
Welcome all of you!

298
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,616
<i>Aw man. They would've looked</i>
<i>great!</i>

299
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,242
<i>Super cute!</i>

300
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,786
We're the Light Music Club.

301
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,330
And our band is called
After-school Teatime,

302
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,540
and we all have tea and stuff
every day,

303
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,001
it's a whole lot of fun
playing music together.

304
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:08,546
If you're interested,
join the Light Music Club!

305
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,716
[Ui] Hurry, hurry!

306
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,926
[Jun] Have they already started?

307
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,719
[Ui] Did we miss them?

308
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,263
("Fuwa Fuwa Time" ending)

309
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,400
(applause)

310
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,530
That was great!
Our show this year was awesome!

311
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,825
Azusa and Yui, your guitar work
was in perfect sync today.

312
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,660
Wow! You really think so?

313
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:42,747
Yes, but Yui burned up all of
her energy and is conked out
over there.

314
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:50,714
[Azusa] You can't rest now,
Senpai! We have to go hand out
fliers!

315
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,591
(Yui objecting)

316
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,309
No one is coming...

317
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,895
Well, there's still
plenty of time.

318
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,480
Yeah, I guess you're right.

319
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,982
Are you going to
hand out fliers?

320
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,734
No the restroom.

321
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,904
You, want to go out and
hand out fliers again?

322
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,615
It's really strange that no
one has come to check us out...

323
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,368
I even made the club room
a more inviting...

324
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,203
(door opens)

325
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,788
(panting)

326
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,249
Yui-senpai! Put this away!

327
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:30,045
Aw, that was a great idea!

328
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,297
[Yui] You're mean!

329
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,760
(lunchtime chatter)

330
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:38,511
Azusa-chan!

331
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:39,554
Real good work.

332
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,560
You still don't have any new
club members?

333
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,230
Is our club really that
unpopular?

334
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,523
[Ui] I don't think that's why.

335
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,650
Yeah, you were great during your
show.

336
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,528
I heard a whole bunch
of new students saying so.

337
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,072
(Azusa happy)

338
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,532
It probably seems like the Light
Music Club is so tightly knit,

339
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,951
that it's hard for anyone else
to break in to it.

340
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,287
[Azusa] Oh. You really think so?

341
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,582
Well yeah, you guys seem
like your such good friends.

342
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,626
[Azusa] Yeah.

343
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,045
Either that, or they've gotten
wind of how weird you guys are.

344
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,296
(dejected)

345
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,090
[Ui] How can you say that?
[Jun] I'm kidding!

346
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,717
Wow, that omelette looks
terrific, Ui!

347
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,760
Want some?

348
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,346
Thanks!

349
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,348
[Mio] Looks like we're not
getting any new members today.

350
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,432
[Ritsu] Guess not...

351
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,767
[Tsumugi] I wonder why?

352
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,103
[Ritsu] Geez, is everybody mad
at us or something?

353
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,312
[Mio] That can't be it.

354
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,022
[Tsumugi] I'm sure that
things will work out.

355
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,399
I mean they have to, right?

356
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,567
[Ritsu] Let's come up with
our next plan of action!

357
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,277
[Ritsu] Operation: Bug Catcher!

358
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,654
[Mio] Operation what?!

359
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,781
Yeah! We'll use big butterfly
nets to catch freshmen!

360
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,783
[Mio] Come on Ritsu,
no one's going to fall for that!

361
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:45,286
Actually, I'm fine with
the way things are for now.

362
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:52,127
[Yui] For now, I want things
to stay the way they are.

363
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,255
You know, hanging out in the
club room together like this.

364
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,799
Well, Azu-nyan isn't
here right now but...

365
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:01,469
Drinking tea, practicing,
and performing together...

366
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,597
Always the five of us.

367
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,433
[Ritsu] I guess you're right.

368
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,852
We'll worry about next year next
year.

369
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:13,523
That's fine, but a year flies
by fast, you guys.

370
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:16,192
But that's 365 whole days!

371
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,653
[Yui] Well, a few days
have passed already.

372
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,947
So, Mugi-chan, what's on the
menu today?

373
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,490
[Tsumugi] Help yourselves!

374
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,118
[Yui] (squealing) Which flavor
do you guys want?

375
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,494
[Ritsu] I can't decide!

376
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,164
Oh! I think Azu-nyan will want
the banana cream one!

377
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,499
[Yui] Let's set that one aside
for her.

378
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,668
[Ritsu] Fine, I get the orange
one, then!

379
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,669
[Sawako] I'll take the chestnut!

380
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,338
[Yui] I call dibs on the
chocolate!

381
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,589
[Tsumugi] Vanilla for me!

382
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,174
[Mio] I get the strawberry then.

383
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,634
[Yui] Wow! These look so good!

384
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,765
S-sorry Azu-nyan! We'll go hand
out fliers right away!

385
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,727
Mugi-senpai, could I have
a cup of milk tea, please?

386
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,022
Oh and also that banana cake?

387
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:58,151
I've decided that this year,
I want to keep on playing
with just the five of us.

388
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,778
Azu-nyan...

389
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,281
Azu-nyan!

390
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,658
Yui-senpai. I'm going to be even
harder,

391
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,494
on you this year, understand?

392
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,288
Come on, take out your guitar.

393
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:19,214
I changed my mind!
New club members come on!

394
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:23,968
(closing song, "Listen!!")

395
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,307
[Mio] For those reasons, we are
going to do some spring
cleaning!

396
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,684
[Yui] Hey guys! Look at what I
found!

397
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,311
[Ritsu] Oh that case looks
expensive!

398
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:59,814
[Ritsu] What sort of treasure
do you think lies within?

399
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,609
[Tsumugi] This makes it super
easy to bind up old magazines!

400
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,321
[Azusa] But are you sure it's
okay for us to split it up
amongst ourselves?

401
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,822
[Ritsu] What else can we do?

402
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,492
Sawa-chan said that we should
just put it in the club fund.

403
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:11,993
[Yui] Oink!

404
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,828
[Ritsu] Gee, it looks like all
of the other school clubs,

405
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,706
have their new members and
are getting down to work.
