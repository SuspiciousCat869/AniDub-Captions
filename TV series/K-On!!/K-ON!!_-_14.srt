1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,216
Let's see, this is squared,
so that makes X-

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,885
(phone vibrating)

3
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,679
Hello? It's Mio. What is it?

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,890
[Ritsu] Oho! You picked up!
Mio, where are you right now?

5
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,308
I'm at home, why?

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,102
[Ritsu] I'm at the station right
now.

7
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,520
Wanna go out and do something?

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:24,024
Well, I still have an awful lot
of prep work left to do,

9
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,567
and summer classes start
tomorrow.

10
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,527
[Ritsu] C'mon, you can do that
tonight!

11
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,031
If I go out, I'll be tired
tonight and I won't get anything
done.

12
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,490
I'm going to take a pass.

13
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,952
[Ritsu] Aw! Which is more
important, me or getting a job?!

14
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,495
Whatever Ritsu. See ya.

15
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,997
(hang up)

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,250
For crying out loud, does Ritsu
ever do any studying at all?

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,209
(phone vibrating)

18
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,253
Ritsu again? Hello Ritsu?

19
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:49,799
[Ritsu as pervert] Hey little
missy, what kind of panties is
you wearin'?

20
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,343
GEEZ!

21
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,595
[Mio] LEAVE ME ALONE!

22
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,013
(chuckling)

23
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,850
Okay, I did the obvious gag
and now I'm out of tricks.

24
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,226
So, what do I do now?

25
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,688
Yui said that she was busy
studying with Nodoka...

26
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,400
Mugi?

27
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,282
[Ritsu] I wonder where she's
going?

28
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,744
I'll sneak up on her!

29
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,665
Huh?

30
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,044
Huh.

31
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:26,920
Wah!

32
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,797
Waaahhhhh!

33
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,591
I noticed you standing back
there,

34
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,927
so I thought it would be fun
to sneak up on you.

35
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,261
You stole my idea...

36
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,931
It certainly is odd to run
into each other here.

37
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,267
It sure is. So where were you
heading when you saw me?

38
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,520
Summer classes start tomorrow,
right?

39
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,106
I wanted to get my shopping out
of the way before then.

40
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,440
Oh, right.

41
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,776
I was going to ask you
if you had some free time,

42
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,570
and wanted to hang out
for a little while today.

43
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,614
(gasps happily)

44
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,865
Uh, what's up?

45
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,409
"Stand right there
and don't move a muscle."

46
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,660
Wouldn't dream of it!

47
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,539
(dialing)

48
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,207
Hello, this is Tsumugi.

49
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,668
Would you mind if I postponed
today's shopping for another
time?

50
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,254
Yes of course, thank you very
much!

51
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,255
(squeal of joy)

52
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,007
I have all the time in the
world!

53
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,299
[Ritsu] Do tell.

54
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:18,847
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

55
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,608
[Yui] Previously, on K-ON!

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,319
Mugi-chan's eyebrows are
takuan pickles!

57
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,445
They're tasty!

58
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,573
Mugi-chan, I need
another pickle!

59
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,372
Don't hog 'em all to yourself!
I want one, too!

60
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,166
(chewing)

61
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,168
(happy) So tasty!

62
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,045
(beeping)

63
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,714
[Yui] Mugi-chan?

64
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,216
When both of my eyebrows are
plucked from my face at the same
time,

65
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,385
I very quickly revert to gel
form.

66
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,095
[Yui and Ritsu] Gel?

67
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,222
[Tsumugi] They have to be
replaced with other pickles
right away...

68
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,390
Mugi-chan!

69
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,766
Yui you've got to find some
pickles!

70
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,769
But where am I supposed
to find takuan pickles HERE?

71
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,273
We'll just have to slap
something on there and hope for
the best!

72
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,691
I'm all better!

73
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,235
[Ritsu] Protractors work too?

74
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,654
Try something triangular...

75
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,241
Where did this blanket come
from?

76
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,744
You'd catch cold sleeping
in light clothing like that.

77
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,830
I was studying! You should
have woken me up instead!

78
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,999
I'm sorry for worrying about
you.

79
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,962
So, where should we go?

80
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,756
I'll leave it up to you!

81
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,758
[Ritsu] Wow, you're downright
beaming.

82
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,593
Think about it, in all these
years,

83
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,095
this is the first time
we're hanging out, just the two
of us.

84
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,350
Now that you mention it...
I guess it really is.

85
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,810
Alright then I think
I'll take you to places

86
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,271
that you normally would never
set foot in!

87
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,440
Like a game center, for
instance!

88
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,025
A game center?

89
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,943
What? You're not interested?

90
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,322
Mhm, it's not that!
I want to go! Very badly!

91
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:27,077
When all of us went to one
together that time, it was
incredibly fun!

92
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,620
(laughs) I know, right?

93
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,539
Good! It's all settled!
We'll go there first!

94
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,460
(Tsumugi beaming)

95
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,295
A game center!

96
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,090
You get impressed over
the littlest things.

97
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,510
Oh! What's this contraption over
here that looks like a
chandelier?!

98
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,303
[Ritsu] A coin game, I guess.

99
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,596
Oh!

100
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,015
And this thing with a steering
wheel and pedals?

101
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,392
A racing game.

102
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,977
What in the world is
a fishing pole doing indoors?!

103
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,020
It's a fishing game.

104
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,897
W-Which one should we play,
Ri-chan?

105
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,774
Everyone of them looks like so
much fun

106
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,402
I really don't know
which one I should try first!

107
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,528
Take a breath.

108
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,614
Well, let's see. For starters,
I'd go...

109
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,450
Ah! Let's try this one!

110
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,580
Let me give it a try!

111
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,876
I have avenged your honor,
Ri-chan!

112
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,461
Um, thank you?

113
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,839
Oh I'd love to have this stuffed
animal!

114
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,134
Okay! First, you press
this button right over here...

115
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,136
Okay! Click!

116
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,933
[Tsumugi] Aw...

117
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:32,684
Almost!

118
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,519
Let me take this.

119
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,447
Ri-chan, you were amazing!

120
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,489
What did you expect?

121
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,534
<i>[Ritsu] Boy was that lucky.</i>

122
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,788
[Ritsu] Right! We've got our
pictures! Now to add some
effects!

123
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,916
We hit this here, and then...

124
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,876
What's this?

125
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,044
(chuckling)

126
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,587
Check this one out!

127
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,465
[Ritsu] You can even do this!

128
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,759
Oscar!

129
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,344
[Tsumugi] I use this button
here?

130
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,720
(shocked)

131
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,513
[Tsumugi] This effect looks
surprisingly good on you.

132
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,558
[Ritsu] What am I, an old
geezer? Then let's try this one
on you, Mugi!

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,560
[Tsumugi] Ah! I'm a pig!

134
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,063
(Yui humming)

135
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,940
Oo, yours looks really good,
too, Nodoka!

136
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:21,733
Does it?

137
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,151
Why don't we trade bites!

138
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,820
That's all right, yours looks
more expensive than mine.

139
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,656
Don't worry about it,
I just wanna try yours!

140
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,116
Really? Well then...

141
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,584
Nodoka-chan...you...

142
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,798
That was fun!

143
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,759
You know Mugi, seeing you this
happy makes the whole day
worthwhile.

144
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,388
I might well be dead of a
happiness overdose tomorrow!

145
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,722
Let's not, okay

146
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,225
We did burn through
an awful lot of money, though...

147
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,561
Which means our next stop
will have to be kind of cheap.

148
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,897
A dagashi candy store?

149
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,110
A dagashi store...

150
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:09,614
Ri-chan... Gie's a bosie,
gracias!

151
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,741
Where the heck are you from?

152
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,204
This is a dagashi store?

153
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,040
Yep. Most items in here are
twenty or thirty cents, so you
can buy,

154
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,127
all you want without worrying
too much about your wallet.

155
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,129
Really? Even this?

156
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,213
Even that.

157
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,965
Even these things on little tiny
skewers?

158
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,299
[Ritsu] Yep.

159
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,592
[Tsumugi] Even these tasty
looking fried things?

160
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,552
[Ritsu] Yep.

161
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,220
Even this huge senbei cracker?

162
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,723
[Ritsu] Yeah.
[Tsumugi] That's amazing!

163
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,267
Is this the result of the price
crashes everyone talks about?!

164
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,145
No, I don't think so.

165
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,690
There are a bunch of different
tricks when it comes to eating
dagashi stuff.

166
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,693
For instance, to open
a fugashi, you do this!

167
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,737
Oh wow!

168
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,410
And when you want to drink one
of these babies, you start at
this end!

169
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,287
Why do you do that?

170
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,790
You can only take little sips
from this end, so it lasts
longer.

171
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,126
Whoa that's amazing!

172
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,337
Now what's this?

173
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,379
What do I do?

174
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,672
With these, you twirl 'em and,

175
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,342
moosh 'em together...
And then you eat them!

176
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,718
Go on try it.

177
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,430
See?

178
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,848
[Azusa] The strawberry on your
cake?

179
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,017
[Yui] She stole it, just like
that!

180
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,227
I don't get what the problem is
here.

181
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,272
It's not right! Who does stuff
like that!?

182
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,775
Huh!? How could you not know?!

183
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,236
Oh, come on. It wasn't all
that strange a thing to do.

184
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,281
And I would have felt bad taking
a piece of the cake itself.

185
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,701
But taking the strawberry off
the cake is like taking its
crown!

186
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,745
Or even its heart! Or its very
soul!

187
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,081
[Nodoka] I'm sure it's only
that way to you.

188
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,208
[Yui] No, it's that way
to the whole world!

189
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,250
Is that my sister?

190
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,502
[Nodoka] All right, fine.

191
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,380
Here, you can have
the chestnut off my cake.

192
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,923
That should make us even, right?

193
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,758
No!

194
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,221
Azu-nyan, this is weird, right?
Nodoka-chan's wrong about this,
isn't she?

195
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,517
I've had so much fun today!

196
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,976
I'm glad to hear it.

197
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,854
You know of so many places
that I've never dreamed existed!

198
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,691
It's absolutely amazing,
Ri-chan!

199
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,317
More! Praise me more!

200
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:14,155
I got this for only $5,
and I was able to eat my fill on
just $1.

201
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:18,201
You're a master of having fun
without having to spend a lot of
money!

202
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,120
Indeed I am!

203
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,581
But even so, the money we spent
today is a total fortune to the
common masses.

204
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,917
[Tsumugi] It is?
[Ritsu] Pretty much.

205
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,254
To tell you the truth, there
was this time last month when-

206
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,928
Sorry, Mio. Could you spot me
a little money to help cover
this?

207
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,888
What, again? So how much are you
short?

208
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,557
Really!? You'll lend me some
money?!

209
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,060
In that case, can I buy these
drum sticks, this new sheet
music,

210
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,770
and this new CD that just came
in?!

211
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,064
Oh can I? Can I please?

212
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,566
And then, out of the blue,

213
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,569
that mean old Mio smacked me
upside the head, for no reason.

214
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,654
She smacked you?

215
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,909
Is something the matter?

216
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,121
[Tsumugi] Actually, there's
a favor that I'd like to ask
you.

217
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,415
If it's money you need, I'm
broke.

218
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,583
I know!

219
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,667
Ehehe...

220
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,836
No! I didn't mean it like that!

221
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,799
It's just something that
I've been yearning for ages now.

222
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,343
Been yearning for?

223
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,677
Mhm.

224
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,805
The thing is...

225
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,975
I'd like you to whack me
on the head!

226
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,187
Uh...

227
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,732
(car honking in distance)

228
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,359
You what?

229
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,157
K-ON!

230
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,952
[Ui] Sis! It's almost time!

231
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,917
Summer classes start today,
remember? You need to get up!

232
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,461
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were already up.

233
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,756
Yup. It's been a while
since I had to get up early,

234
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,926
and I accidentally set
my alarm an hour early.

235
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,141
<i>I wore my uniform out of force</i>
<i>of habit. What am I gonna do?</i>

236
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,976
[Yui] (gasps) You're in uniform!

237
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:12,565
Oh no! Weren't supposed to wear
our uniforms to summer classes,
were we?!

238
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,653
Well, doesn't it make sense to
wear a school uniform to
a place like this?

239
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,488
What, really? I didn't know.

240
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,783
Good morning! Wow, you're
early for once in your life!

241
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,576
Ri-chan, what're we gonna do?

242
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,579
It sounds like we were supposed
to wear our uniforms to
summer classes!

243
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,748
Huh? No, of course we're not!

244
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,625
[Ritsu] Look around.
[Yui] Wow, you're right.

245
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:36,339
Actually, I'd say it's the
people in uniform who are in the
distinct minority.

246
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,800
Oh my gosh! What if Mio is the
only one!?

247
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:44,347
"Oh, see that girl there, she's
the only one here who's wearing
a uniform!"

248
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,058
Quit it!

249
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,769
It said we can wear whatever
we want, so it's really
no big deal!

250
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,813
[Tsumugi] Good morning!

251
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,484
It took ages to get changed this
morning.

252
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,069
[All three] G-Good morning...

253
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,031
Wow, Mugi-chan looks like
she's going to the beach!

254
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,451
Wait, is everyone going
to the beach after class?!

255
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,994
That isn't on the schedule.

256
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,787
Let's hurry in, shall we?

257
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,625
Hey Mugi!

258
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,586
Yes?

259
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,546
You left the tag on your dress.

260
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,214
And with this outfit,

261
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,925
wouldn't going without socks
look a whole lot better than
this?

262
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,511
(huffing)

263
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,557
(gasps) <i>Wait, don't tell me she-</i>

264
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,560
I'd like you to whack me on the
head!

265
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,437
Um, you know, it really hurts.

266
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,981
I want you to do it to me
anyway!

267
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,234
If you're that dead set on it,
I guess I can do it.

268
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,444
You can?

269
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,071
Just a little tap, right?

270
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,282
Whenever you're ready!

271
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,327
[Ritsu] You're not being watched
by a security detail, are you?

272
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,788
[Tsumugi] There aren't any!
Don't worry!

273
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,247
[Ritsu] Then here goes!

274
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,457
[Tsumugi] Ready!

275
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,543
[Ritsu] Um...

276
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,671
Maybe I'll go with a chop?

277
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,131
[Tsumugi] Do it as hard as you
like!

278
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,514
[Ritsu] Whack?

279
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,349
I can't do it! Forget it!

280
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,351
Huh?

281
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,020
[Ritsu] It doesn't work if
someone ASKS you to. It has to
be spontaneous, okay?

282
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,855
[Tsumugi] Spontaneous?

283
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,942
Yeah! I can't whack you in the
head if you haven't done
anything wrong.

284
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,403
But if you were to do
something incredibly ditzy,

285
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,780
I'd straighten you out
right then and there!

286
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,198
Ditzy huh?

287
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,534
[Yui] Right? Nodoka-chan was
crazy to do that, right?

288
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,161
When you offer somebody
a bite of your cake, they
don't...

289
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,872
<i>[Ritsu] Mugi couldn't</i>
<i>possibly be trying-</i>
[Yui] ...eat the strawberry
on top!

290
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,457
[Mio] Sure she's not
just messing with you?

291
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,293
I remember one time when Ritsu
ate the strawberry on my cake,

292
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:41,297
and I whacked her so I can
understand how you feel, but
still...

293
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,591
[Yui] Nodoka-chan ate it,
just as casual as can be!

294
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,010
<i>[Ritsu] No doubt about it.</i>

295
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,306
I guess we should look through
their study guides first.

296
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,642
[Yui] I wonder if there are any
books that say that eating makes
you smarter?

297
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:53,685
[Ritsu] Mugi, over here.

298
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,978
[Mio] Yeah, as if.

299
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,023
I knew it, you're trying
to be a class clown.

300
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,524
Did I do it wrong?

301
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,943
I thought that this would be
the least appropriate outfit

302
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,362
to wear for our summer classes.

303
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,824
I'm afraid it's just too vague
and uncommitted to really work.

304
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:13,371
For a gag like that to work,
it has to be totally in your
face.

305
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,040
[Tsumugi] Sure is hot today,
Mio-chan.

306
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,416
Of course it is!

307
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,251
[Tsumugi] Ah, I see!
[Ritsu] Hey, don't take notes!

308
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,339
Are you really that eager to get
whacked upside the head, Mugi?

309
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,674
[Tsumugi] You and Mio-chan are
always express your affection

310
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,343
in intimate, physical ways.

311
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,762
So do Yui-chan and Azusa-chan.

312
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:32,057
I'm the only one who doesn't
have that kind of intimate bond!

313
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,142
Though I love being physically
intimate!

314
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,896
Don't you think you're
obsessing a little here?

315
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,483
All right, Mugi. If you're
really that determined, I'll
help you out.

316
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,567
You mean it?!

317
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,444
Now the key is a total lack of
shame!

318
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,572
Once you start a gag, you commit
and see it through to the bitter
end!

319
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,074
[Ritsu] Understood?!
[Tsumugi] Yes, ma' am!

320
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,409
I have to say, I'm kind of
surprised that,

321
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,703
you and Ritsu decided to go to
college.

322
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,540
Well, Sawa-chan told us that it
was way too late to start job
hunting.

323
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,250
So we might as well try.

324
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,712
It's also a little late to begin
studying for college entrance
exams.

325
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,714
Oo, headbands!

326
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,508
Ready?

327
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,967
[Tsumugi] Mio!

328
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,763
I will pass my exams for sure!

329
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,889
Quit goofing around!

330
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,058
Yes! So will I, Mio-chan!

331
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,059
[Mio] Mugi?

332
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,769
Those look great on you.

333
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,647
Why in the world would you
put on normal glasses?!

334
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,734
It's so blazingly bright in here
that I can't read anything!

335
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:28,071
Yui, look really close.
If you squint real hard at it,

336
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:31,574
the words will suddenly pop out
of this long passage and you'll
see it.

337
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,577
I saw it! I saw it and
it was the letter "a"!

338
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,037
You did not!

339
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,831
I can see it, too.

340
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,001
Judging from the context
surrounding this passage, the
answer is "a".

341
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,086
Nicely done!

342
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,088
Why did you say it so properly?

343
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,841
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

344
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,759
Your ID card is ready, Miss.

345
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:54,347
I wish I'd brought a more
flattering picture with me this
one looks terrible.

346
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,724
Well mine turned out pretty
good!

347
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,393
[Ritsu] I'm rather shy
and reserved, you see.

348
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,812
This is not a place for goofing
off!

349
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,397
<i>You're on!</i>

350
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,357
Here is mine!

351
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,152
<i>Yes! That should work!</i>

352
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:11,281
[Mio] Oh, I get it. You two just
put stickers over the picture.

353
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,949
Your eyes are half-closed.

354
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,325
What the heck were you
thinking?!

355
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,952
[Ritsu] The normal one
was funnier!
[Tsumugi] It was?

356
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,038
[Yui] Look! Look!
[Mio] Your sister?!

357
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,291
Heh. I kind of submitted
her picture by mistake.

358
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:25,587
Wow, you know,
you just can't beat fresh ditz.

359
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,298
I tried! I tried so hard! I
don't get it!

360
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,841
I know that you're trying your
hardest,

361
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,469
but it's gonna be a lot harder
than I thought it would be,

362
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,970
to get you whacked in the head.

363
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,307
And it'll take a lot to get Mio
to whack YOU, of all people.

364
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,267
May even be impossible...

365
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,852
Oh look, there they are!

366
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,687
You're right!
Thanks for waiting for me!

367
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,646
Sure.

368
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,106
Come on, Let's go home!

369
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,818
[Mio] You do remember that
tomorrow is a school day, right?

370
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,323
[Yui] Of course I remember!
It'll be so great to see
everybody in class again!

371
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,283
[Mio] It sure will.

372
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,667
Looks like there's
an extra piece of cake...

373
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,795
It'll be kinda hard to
divide this into fifths.

374
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,296
[Mio] Rock-paper-scissors?

375
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,341
Come on, no way, I'm terrible
at that stupid game.

376
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:15,679
[Yui] Alright! Then let's settle
it the old fashioned way!

377
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,098
Very well, I'll take you on.

378
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,809
Oh, Okay! The winner
gets the cake!

379
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,062
And the loser gets a forehead
flick from everyone here
in the room!

380
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,313
A forehead flick?!

381
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,815
Oo, yeah let's do it!

382
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,859
Throw the game! If you lose,
you'll get smacked for sure!

383
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,027
I got it!

384
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,821
[Ritsu] Okay, let's start!

385
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,573
I'll get it going! Ready, five!

386
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,951
Ready, set, uh three!

387
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,327
Ready, seven!

388
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,995
[Mio] Ready, one!

389
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,539
[Tsumugi] Ready, two!

390
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:52,257
Who loses at a game
they suggested?

391
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,844
I'm so jealous, Mugi-chan...

392
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,471
Well, let's eat quickly
and get on to practicing.

393
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:01,307
Yeah, I finally get to
have my strawberry today,

394
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,393
so I won't even put up
a fight this time.

395
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:07,480
I remember when Ritsu ate
the strawberry on my cake,
and I whacked her.

396
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,566
So I understand how you feel.

397
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,502
Nodoka-chan!

398
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,254
[Nodoka] What on earth
is the matter?

399
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,048
Just look at her!

400
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,051
She had her strawberry stolen,
and she's heartbroken!
She's in tears!

401
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,387
You see, that's how important
the strawberry is, Nodoka-chan!

402
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,557
[Nodoka] I apologize for
hurting your feelings, then.

403
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,226
[Yui] You finally understand,
Nodoka-chan!

404
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,021
Mio-chan, I'm so sorry.

405
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,314
[Mio] You want to be hit?

406
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,983
[Tsumugi] I'm sorry,
I know how silly it sounds.

407
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:56,029
No way, this is all Mio's fault
for not reacting to any of your
gags.

408
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,947
What!? It is not!

409
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:01,785
You really should have just said
something to me about this in
the first place!

410
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,745
You just want a love tap, right?

411
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,080
Y-You'll do it?

412
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,290
Sure, I guess it's not that big
a deal.

413
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,376
Gie tos, Mio-chan!

414
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,378
Seriously, where are you from?

415
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,463
Okay! Whenever you are ready!

416
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,716
You are one strange girl...

417
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,134
Uh...

418
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:25,558
(heart beating)

419
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:29,145
Wow, she's really tense,
isn't she?

420
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,442
Why'd you hit me?!

421
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,821
[Ritsu] I guess nothing
worked... I'm really sorry.

422
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,948
No, I should be the
one apologizing to you.

423
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,867
I mean, it was a very odd
request I made.

424
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,247
If you just want to be bonked on
the head, there ought to be a
way to get it done...

425
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,456
For instance...

426
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,668
Thanks, Ri-chan,
but I'm giving up on that.

427
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,336
Really?

428
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,506
[Tsumugi] Oh, dear. You have
a welt on your forehead.

429
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,221
You know, you really make
an excellent escort, Ri-chan.

430
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,100
You're so sweet, and I know that
you would do just about anything
to help a friend.

431
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,729
If you were a boy,
the girls would all be lining up
for you.

432
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,439
(gasps)

433
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,692
(embarassed)

434
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,652
[Ritsu] How am I supposed
to respond to that?!

435
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,654
(whacks Tsumugi)
[Tsumugi] Ouch!

436
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,494
[Ritsu] Yeah. Sorry about that.

437
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,371
Well, you remember when I called
you

438
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,832
and asked if you wanted
to go hang out that day?

439
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,084
I ran into Mugi right after
that, and-

440
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:38,882
Huh? Where did we go? Candy
store, a game center, that kind
of thing.

441
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:42,844
Mugi was funny, she was totally
into everything like a little
kid.

442
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:43,803
(chuckles)

443
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,764
Admittedly, she's always
like that.

444
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,893
And then she was like, "I want
to be whacked on the head!"
Can you believe it?

445
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,772
That kind of thing has to be
spontaneous, you know? So I-

446
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,940
Oops. Mio are you there?

447
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:59,319
Um, why aren't you talking?
Are you mad at me?

448
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,112
[Mio] Why?

449
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,990
[Mio] Why didn't you invite me
to come along with you two
that day?!

450
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,410
[Mio] I wanted to hang out
with Mugi, too!

451
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,538
I DID invite you.

452
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,878
(giggles)

453
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:25,887
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")

454
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,766
[Principal] The long summer
vacation is now over

455
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:55,643
and new school term is
once again upon us.

456
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,562
It gives me no end of joy to see

457
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:01,524
all your tanned, healthy faces
here once again after such a
long time away.

458
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,069
I trust you all feel the same
joy in being back here.

459
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,072
The experiences you gain
during high school are...

460
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:12,869
[Yui] I don't understand, why do
we have to run a whole 42.195
kilometers?

461
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,162
Unique flavor...

462
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,164
That's it! That's what we'll do!

463
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:20,460
The marathon will be cancelled,
and we'll have a red bean soup
contest instead!
