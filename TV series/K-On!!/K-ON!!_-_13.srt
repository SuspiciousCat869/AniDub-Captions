1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,715
[Azusa] I hope this letter finds
you well in spite of the
lingering summer heat.

2
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:08,508
Summer vacation is halfway over.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,094
How have all of you been
since we last saw each other?

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,679
(radio chatter)

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,349
[Azusa] Hmm, seems
a little stiff and formal.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,937
[Azusa] Ton-chan is
doing well again today.

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:25,692
In addition to his usual five
food pellets, he also ate a
slice of cucumber-

8
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:30,822
No, they don't really need to
know the details of Ton-chan's
diet...

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,200
How are your studies going?
Well, I hope.

10
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:38,747
No, there's at least one whose
studies obviously won't be going
very well.

11
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,040
(phone ringing)

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,833
It's from Yui-senpai!

13
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,626
"Azu-nyan, how are you?"

14
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:46,713
"Thanks a lot for looking after
Ton-chan over summer vacation!"

15
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,216
"Right now, we're studying
really hard in the library!"

16
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,677
Yui-senpai beat me to it!

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,262
She's actually studying!

18
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,559
<i>I guess everyone really</i>
<i>is busy with their studies...</i>

19
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,729
<i>And Mugi-senpai is off in</i>
<i>Finland.</i>

20
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,523
<i>Please work hard to make sure</i>
<i>your last high school summer</i>

21
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,525
<i>isn't filled with regrets.</i>

22
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,451
I'm so bored...

23
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,044
Oh forget this! I'm gonna go
have fun!

24
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:31,299
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

25
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,099
Hurry!

26
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,642
Wait for me!

27
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,816
Whoa it's so huge!

28
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,320
[Azusa] Isn't it? My mom said
I should bring you guys a gift.

29
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,988
Thank you very much!

30
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,073
Where's Yui-senpai?

31
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,866
After she came home from the
library,

32
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,619
she ate lunch the lunch I made
for her and went back to her
studies.

33
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,997
<i>Wow, she really works hard</i>
<i>when she applies herself.</i>

34
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,999
(Yui playing the guitar)

35
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,167
Or maybe not.

36
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,086
I wonder if she's decided to
take a break?

37
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,422
Anyway, I'll bring her some
of this watermelon.

38
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,639
[Azusa] You're not slicing it?

39
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,140
Nope. Her dream has always been
to,

40
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,726
take a big watermelon
that's been cut in half like
this,

41
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,230
and eat then eat through the
seedless area in the middle with
a spoon.

42
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:54,192
[Ui] Hey, Sis! Azusa-chan
brought over a watermelon for
us!

43
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,528
I'll leave it out here for you!

44
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,405
I just left it outside her door!

45
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,198
(upbeat tempo)

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,366
She changed her tempo?

47
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,536
Yeah she sounds like she's
feeling happy.

48
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,955
Does that mean she's eating
while playing the guitar?

49
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,958
Yeah, it was just like this
at lunch time, too.

50
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,043
At lunch time?

51
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,712
You had chilled soba noodles?

52
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,257
[Ui] Yeah. But you get the
summer doldrums if you only eat
noodles,

53
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,134
so I made some tempura too.

54
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,927
Tempura...

55
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,220
Watermelon...

56
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,639
[Azusa] Senpai don't eat it!
[Ui] What's wrong?

57
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,059
Yui-senpai!

58
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,812
(sad tempo)

59
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,564
Oh my goodness...

60
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,612
It was a dream?

61
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,116
(doorbell rings)

62
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,409
[Azusa] Coming!

63
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,702
Good afternoon!

64
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,911
Hi Ui, Come in!

65
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,414
Sorry, I had sorta conked out
for a minutes.

66
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,582
Who are you?

67
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,625
You came to my house,
so you know who I am!

68
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,004
Sorry, for a second
I didn't recognize you.

69
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,547
Sheesh...

70
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,592
You look sleepy.

71
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,470
I was watching TV last night,
and before I knew it,

72
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,888
it was really late.

73
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,598
So I've been walking around the
house,

74
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,558
pretty much half-asleep all day
today.

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,561
You get lazy over vacation
without even realizing it.

76
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,439
So, what do you want to do
today?

77
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,442
Why don't we invite Jun-chan
along and go hang out?

78
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,069
Didn't she say that her Jazz
Club

79
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,197
was gonna have practice
everyday over summer vacation?

80
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,784
In that case, why don't
we take her a care package?

81
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,581
I don't think anyone's in there.

82
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,209
I guess the Jazz Club
takes Obon day off, too.

83
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,710
Though I'm not really surprised.

84
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,128
Oh, hey. Since we're here and
all,

85
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,798
why don't we go eat in
the Light Music Club room?

86
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,882
Oh can we?

87
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:41,925
Yeah, let's go do it!

88
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,635
We'll need a key to get in,
though.

89
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,346
I wonder if any teachers are
here.

90
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,474
Excuse us, ma'am.

91
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,892
Oh. Who are you?

92
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,019
You were there with at Natsu
Fest when I got this way!

93
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,272
Relax, I was joking.
So, what brings you here?

94
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,443
We came to deliver a care
package to the Jazz Club, but no
one was there.

95
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,362
Yeah, it's just because
of the Obon holiday.

96
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,657
The other teachers are all away
visiting their families or on
trips and such,

97
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,033
so I'm here holding down the
fort.

98
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,619
It's letting me get a lot
of extra work done.

99
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,996
Oh, really it is?

100
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:17,293
So anyway, we came to see if
we could borrow the key to our
club room.

101
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,586
[Ui] Be my guest.

102
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,130
But I didn't get you anything...

103
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,216
Don't mention it, you always
take good care of my sister.

104
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,760
Oh not at all, I'm in their debt
for always imposing on them

105
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,721
and slacking off in the club
room.

106
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,305
[Ui] So has my sister
been studying lately?

107
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,890
<i>[Azusa] What a great sister!</i>

108
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,688
[Students] A-E-I-U-E-O-A-O.

109
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,358
[Students] Ka-Ke-Ki-Ku-
Ke-Ko-Ka-Ko.

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,696
[Students] Sa-Se-Shi-Su-
Se-So-Sa-So.

111
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,906
[Azusa] Have you gotten
any texts from Jun-chan?

112
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,450
Not yet.

113
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,326
I wonder what's keeping her?

114
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,621
Maybe she's already gone
somewhere else to hang out for
the day.

115
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,999
Would you rather have peach or
plum?

116
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,459
[Azusa] Plum.

117
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,419
Here you go.

118
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,670
Thanks.

119
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,052
You know it's kinda warm in here
today...

120
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,094
Yeah.

121
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,854
[Ui] It's so quiet...

122
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:26,613
<i>If we had other members, maybe</i>
<i>I'd be practicing like them</i>
<i>right now...</i>

123
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,576
Hey! Hey! Wanna go out and catch
a movie?

124
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:36,456
That might be fun. Maybe we
could go see a summer horror
movie.

125
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,175
<i>Mio-senpai?</i>

126
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,885
(evil laughter)

127
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,138
<i>I get it, she's training</i>
<i>herself to overcome her fears</i>

128
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,600
<i>by going all by herself</i>
<i>to see horror movies.</i>

129
00:07:55,642 --> 00:08:00,605
<i>It's already scary right now...</i>
<i>I wonder if she's going to be</i>
<i>able to handle this?</i>

130
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,400
(heavy breathing)

131
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,486
(screaming)

132
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,197
<i>That's amazing. Has her</i>
<i>training paid off?</i>

133
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,117
<i>But if this film stays true</i>
<i>to the horror movie formula,</i>

134
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,286
<i>the next scene is probably</i>
<i>gonna get extra scary!</i>

135
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,456
(intense screaming)

136
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,125
(evil laughter)

137
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,337
<i>No way! She didn't even flinch</i>
<i>at that scary scene!</i>

138
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,800
<i>Running down the list of</i>
<i>possibilities, this either</i>
<i>isn't Mio,</i>

139
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,927
<i>or she's passed out!</i>

140
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,015
<i>Oh no! I knew it!</i>
<i>I thought something was weird.</i>

141
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,474
(phone ringing)

142
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,101
<i>Mio-senpai's cell phone?</i>

143
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,354
<i>But they said to turn off our</i>
<i>phones off during the movie...</i>

144
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,148
<i>Senpai!</i>

145
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,360
(phone vibrating)

146
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,529
A dream? Oh?

147
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,532
[Azusa] Ui, your cell.

148
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,035
Sorry, I fell asleep.

149
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,622
Hey, it's from Jun-chan look!

150
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,750
Like we thought, she had the day
off.

151
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,378
She says she went to visit her
grandparents out in the country.

152
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,174
It's kinda lonely without
Jun-chan around.

153
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:16,723
"When you get back,
let's have lots and lots of fun.
Okay?"

154
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,604
[Ui] You said you wanted
to see this one, right?

155
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:27,192
[Azusa] Nah, let's just skip the
horror movie and see this one
instead.

156
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,487
Okay, but there's a pretty long
wait until the next time they
show it.

157
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:34,032
Well let's go kill some time
somewhere, then. Okay?

158
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:41,623
<i>That reminds me, I didn't send</i>
<i>out my late-summer greetings</i>
<i>texts yet.</i>

159
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,166
<i>How about postcards?</i>

160
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,710
<i>But I spent way too much at</i>
<i>Natsu Fest,</i>

161
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,047
<i>so money is tight for</i>
<i>the rest of the month.</i>

162
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,301
[Azusa] Maybe I should've gotten
a summer job after all.

163
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,638
Plus, once Jun-chan gets back,
we have to go out and stuff.

164
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,139
How about this job?

165
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,517
The pay is a little low, isn't
it?

166
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,810
How about this?

167
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,063
$150 per day sounds
a little bit fishy to me.

168
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,775
Let's see... How about that?

169
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,403
[Azusa] Lottery assistants?

170
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,738
[Ui] Let's go check it out!

171
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,911
7th Prize, a pack of tissues!

172
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,205
Thank you very much for playing
today!

173
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,085
<i>All that's left now is 1st</i>
<i>Prize, the trip to Finland,</i>

174
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,546
<i>and 7th Prize, a pack of</i>
<i>tissues.</i>

175
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:33,925
<i>Which means that there's only</i>
<i>one red ball and one gold ball</i>
<i>left in here.</i>

176
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,094
[Tsumugi] I'd like to play!

177
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,097
[Azusa] Mugi-senpai?
I thought you were in Finland.

178
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,351
Yes, but I had the overwhelming
urge to play the shopping arcade
lottery,

179
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,395
so I came back home a day early.

180
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,105
I've always dreamed of spinning

181
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:51,151
this rattling contraption around
and around and winning some
tissues!

182
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,111
<i>Oh please God, if you're</i>
<i>listening,</i>

183
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,156
<i>please grant her wish</i>
<i>of winning a packet of tissues!</i>

184
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,198
And...!

185
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,159
7th Prize, a big packet of
tissues!

186
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,411
[Tsumugi] Hooray!
<i>[Azusa] Good for her.</i>

187
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,955
<i>But that means that all that's</i>
<i>left in here now</i>

188
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,916
<i>is the grand prize trip to</i>
<i>Finland.</i>

189
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,710
Why don't you give it a whirl,
Azusa-chan?

190
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,712
I have an extra ticket you can
use.

191
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,048
[Azusa] All right.

192
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,010
And...!

193
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,346
I won!

194
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,014
We have a winner!

195
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,433
[Azusa] Hey, wait a minute!
What if this is just another
dream?

196
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:27,270
Ui, Mugi-senpai, please
pinch my cheeks right away!

197
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,855
[Ui] Is this okay?

198
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:29,981
<i>I knew it!</i>

199
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,108
[Tsumugi and Ui] One, two!

200
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,485
It doesn't hurt!

201
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,362
So what if it's only a dream?

202
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,697
You can go to Finland anyway!

203
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,034
Congratulations on winning,
Azusa-chan!

204
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:45,663
Congratulations!
...Congratulations...
ations... tions...

205
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,042
[Kid] Teto! Teto!

206
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,960
<i>I woke up before</i>
<i>I went on the trip!</i>

207
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:55,006
[Movie] Teto! I'll never
leave you again!
<i>[Azusa] And not only that,</i>

208
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,467
<i>I slept through the movie!</i>

209
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,849
<i>K-ON!</i>

210
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,148
Where is she?!

211
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,983
She'll be here any minute.

212
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,737
[Azusa] Sorry! It took
a while to get ready.

213
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,198
Who are you?

214
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,574
I knew you were gonna say that!

215
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,326
[Jun] How come your skin
is so tan now?

216
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,788
[Azusa] I guess I just burn
right away when I go
outside in the sun.

217
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,123
[Jun] Outside?

218
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,583
[Azusa] Oh, the Light Music Club
went to Natsu Fest.

219
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,169
Natsu Fest?!
How did you swing that?

220
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,089
Maybe you should've joined
the Light Music Club, Jun-chan.

221
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,341
I-I'm not jealous of you
or anything!

222
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,469
They went to the beach for
their training camps
the last two years.

223
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,515
My sister said they go to
a summer house with
a recording studio!

224
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,059
A summer house? With a studio?

225
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,521
Want to join up, Jun?

226
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,898
I have no regrets!

227
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,153
Jun-chan, your swimsuit is
really cute!

228
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,822
Thanks! I bought
a brand new one this year.

229
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,824
Azusa-chan, are you done
changing yet?

230
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,367
Please don't look at me!

231
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,704
[Jun] Wow, those are
some impressive tan lines.

232
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,497
Wah!
(snickering)

233
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,376
Oh Azusa-chan...

234
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,711
Hey. I've got it!

235
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,422
If you completely cover up,
it'll solve everything!

236
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,466
<i>Cover up?</i>

237
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,383
Yay!

238
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,093
Let's play!

239
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,220
That'll make me stand out even
more.

240
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:28,558
I'll work on an all-over tan
at the side of the pool,
so you go have fun.

241
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,809
[Jun] Here it comes!

242
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,936
And catch!

243
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,273
That's so cold!

244
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,153
I feel kinda bad about
leaving Azusa.

245
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:43,198
Hey, let's go over and
check in on her.

246
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,328
Oh my.

247
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,916
Oh wow, we're really high up,
aren't we?

248
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,543
Hey, why don't you go first,
Azusa-chan?

249
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,759
[Ritsu] If you're going to
slide, you'll need this!

250
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,968
It's yours take it!

251
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,596
Ritsu-senpai?
What are you doing way up here?

252
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,098
And what's with the yakisoba?

253
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,642
This is the Yakisoba Slider!
It's all the rage!

254
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:14,312
Look there. You go down
the water slide like that.

255
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,987
Hey, wait a minute. Isn't
that...

256
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,449
Yui-senpai?

257
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,867
And Mugi-senpai?!

258
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,369
And Mio-senpai?!

259
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,872
[Yui] Darn it!

260
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,207
[Tsumugi] Aw I didn't get
to eat any of it again.

261
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,793
[Mio] Ritsu!
Another order for me!

262
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,794
[Yui] Me, too!

263
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,213
[Tsumugi] And for me!

264
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,216
Go on, Azusa! It's time
for you to slide away!

265
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,467
Wait! I-

266
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,303
Don't push! No one said
anything about yakisoba!

267
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,264
[Ritsu] Here.

268
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,348
Thanks, but I don't want any!

269
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,309
[Ritsu] No can do.
You gotta take it!

270
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,104
Have a nice trip!

271
00:14:56,146 --> 00:15:01,109
(slide screaming)

272
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,783
(gasp)

273
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:13,038
(panic scream)

274
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,460
Dad, get my swim ring
and toss it over here!

275
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,462
A dream?

276
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,797
[Ui] Azusa-chan!

277
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,424
We bought you some yakisoba!

278
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,969
There was a long line,
so it took a while.

279
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,181
[Jun] Hey, you've got
a nice, even tan now!

280
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,892
It's looking better.

281
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,021
[Jun] Yakisoba always tastes
better when you eat it outside
like this.

282
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,731
[Ui] I know what you mean!

283
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,692
[Azusa] Now that you mention it,
Mugi-senpai was looking
forward to

284
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,277
having yakisoba at Natsu Fest,

285
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,781
but they sold out fast and
she never got to eat any.

286
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,532
Gloating about Natsu Fest again?

287
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,242
When you guys were
in your tent at night,

288
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,703
I bet you spent the whole time
fooling around and making
a ruckus.

289
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,457
That's for sure!
Ritsu-senpai was her usual
hilarious self, and-

290
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,543
[Jun] Fine, I admit it!
I'm jealous!

291
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,213
How can you keep having
training camps like that?!

292
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,383
Well, I guess because we...

293
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,177
I have a summer house
we can use!

294
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,888
Why don't I take you guys there?

295
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,935
We-We don't have many members,
so we have plenty of funds
to go around!

296
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,813
[Jun] Oh. I envy you guys.

297
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,357
<i>[Azusa] I can't tell her</i>
<i>we went for free...</i>

298
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,693
[Jun] You're so lucky
in the Light Music Club.

299
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,904
Mio is gorgeous,
and she's great on the bass.

300
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,698
[Azusa] She is, isn't she?

301
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,617
[Jun] Yui-senpai's
a great guitar player, too.

302
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,785
[Azusa] You think so?

303
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,912
I've got admit,
I've been really surprised,

304
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:39,124
at how much better she's gotten
lately. It's pretty impressive.

305
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,210
[Jun] Well, that's Ui's sister
for you.

306
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,421
[Azusa] But she can't be
bothered to learn the lingo,

307
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,090
and she can't read sheet music
very well.

308
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,550
She has a long way to go.

309
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,261
[Jun] Oh, I had no idea.

310
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,596
[Jun] That was so much fun!

311
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,599
I hope we can go one more
time before summer ends.

312
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,226
Yeah!

313
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,728
Ui?

314
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,604
Azu-nyan!

315
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,981
It's Yui-senpai.

316
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,315
[Yui] Azu-nyan!

317
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,359
Are you guys just heading
home from the library?

318
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,528
Yeah. And we're on our way over

319
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,698
to the Sakuragaoka
summer festival to unwind a bit.

320
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,991
Sniff! Sniff! Sniff!

321
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,119
Hey, you smell like
a swimming pool, Azu-nyan!

322
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,288
Please don't sniff me.

323
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,458
And it's because
we all just came from the pool.

324
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,794
Hey, you three should come and
hang out with us at the
festival!

325
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,338
Kay?

326
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,008
[Ritsu] Hook me up with
another, Pops!

327
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,259
[Pops] Sure thing.

328
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,427
By the way, Mugi-senpai.

329
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,179
Weren't you suppose to be
in Finland?

330
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,139
Actually, I came back
a little early because

331
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,308
I wanted to come to
the summer festival.

332
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,810
I'm bound and determined
to eat yakisoba this time.

333
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,396
[Mio] Mugi! We found some!

334
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,566
I'll be back!

335
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,985
[Yui] Get yer grilled corn
right here!

336
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:52,322
Now to eat it,
you gotta go like this!

337
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,741
What are you,
some kind of a rodent?

338
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,203
Here! You have some!

339
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,293
Isn't it terrific?!

340
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:10,173
It's a little bit charred,
but it tastes totally delicious!

341
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:13,802
[Yui] You know, the charred
parts are my favorite!

342
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:17,764
Okay now, people! Next up on
the agenda is mango shaved ice!

343
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:18,890
[Yui] Watermelon flavor for me!

344
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,141
[Mio] There's no such flavor!

345
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,518
[Jun] Strawberry for me!

346
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,435
[Ui] Me, too!

347
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,937
[Ritsu] Green tea and beans!

348
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,313
[Yui] Oh, you're so traditional!

349
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,356
[Mio] I'll have melon.

350
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,774
[Tsumugi] I'd like the
Blue Hawaii.

351
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,735
[Yui] In that case, I'll go
with the Purple Argentina!

352
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,028
[Mio] Quit making up flavors!

353
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,739
[Azusa] I think I'll have
the strawberry milk.

354
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,328
Look at me! Look at my tongue!

355
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,579
Would you stop that!

356
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,582
Your tongue is a funny color,
too!

357
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,714
[Ui] Sis! Look, they've got
a goldfish scooping booth
over there!

358
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,551
I'm so there! We'll put them
in Ton-chan's tank to
keep him company!

359
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,845
But the goldfish might
be eaten if we do that.

360
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,889
Oh, well I'm sure they'll
be eaten pretty quick!

361
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,767
They'll be like "Crunch!" and
"Gnash!" and "Rip!" and "Tear!"

362
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,185
Cut it out!

363
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,812
[Yui] But Ton-chan's tiny,
so I think they'll be safe.

364
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,939
[Ritsu] Yeah I was kidding,
they'll be just fine.

365
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,941
<i>[Azusa] My life is definitely</i>
<i>more fun...</i>
[Yui] Then let's all go...

366
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,152
<i>[Azusa] ...when I'm with</i>
<i>these</i>guys.
[Yui] ...catch us some goldfish!

367
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,236
No we can't!

368
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,946
(fireworks go off)

369
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,322
Look, they're launching
fireworks!

370
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,658
What?! Why didn't
they say anything about it?!

371
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,326
[Ritsu] It doesn't look too far
away...

372
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,995
Let's get moving, people!

373
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,913
[Yui] What'cha doing?
[Girls] Yeah!

374
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:26,166
C'mon let's go, Azu-nyan!

375
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,091
[Ritsu] And we're off!

376
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,558
<i>They're so pretty...</i>

377
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:49,105
<i>Is this real?</i>
<i>Am I dreaming again?</i>

378
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,080
[Ui] Azusa-chan!

379
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,248
Where's my sister
and the others?

380
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,250
I don't know, we got separated.

381
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,670
Will they be okay?

382
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,255
Oh yeah, I'm sure they'll
be just fine.

383
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,174
You're right.

384
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,759
[Jun] Think we should head home?

385
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,260
[Ui] Sure.

386
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,182
[Azusa] Hey, Jun.

387
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,352
Why not join the Light Music
Club? There's still time.

388
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,355
It's tempting...

389
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,816
I'm in.

390
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,569
Hey, good for you, Azusa-chan!

391
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,781
[Jun] If you don't get any other
new members next year, that is.

392
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,991
I don't even want to
think about that.

393
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,829
But maybe there'll be no point
if all the cool people like
Mio-senpai are gone.

394
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,831
[Azusa] Huh! What did you say?!

395
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,666
[Jun] I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

396
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,756
<i>Today was a lot of fun.</i>

397
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,846
<i>But what if it was all</i>
<i>just another dream?</i>

398
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:11,813
Ow! No, it's not a dream...

399
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:19,612
<i>I almost forgot. After this</i>
<i>year is done, I'm going to be</i>
<i>all alone.</i>

400
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,993
<i>Stop that!</i>
<i>Think positive thoughts!</i>

401
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:28,538
<i>I'll work hard with the others</i>
<i>and knock their socks off at</i>
<i>the student festival!</i>

402
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,791
[Azusa's mother]
Azusa, we're finish this
watermelon without you!

403
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,626
[Azusa] No! Wait for me!

404
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,129
[Yui] I'm home!

405
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,839
Ui!

406
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:43,887
That's pretty weird,
did I get home before she did?

407
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,805
Leftovers from lunch detected!

408
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,098
Lucky!

409
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,350
Down the hatch!

410
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,561
(phone rings)

411
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:57,150
Yui here, hey Azu-nyan?
So what's up with you?

412
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,362
You sent me what? A letter?

413
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,490
A postcard? No, I haven't seen
one.

414
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,949
Oh, maybe this is it.

415
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,535
"Shaved ice and tempura
don't go well together,"

416
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:10,538
"so whatever you do,
do not eat them together"

417
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,375
(stunned silence)

418
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:19,589
Azu-nyan? What do I do?

419
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:24,594
(closing song, "Listen!!")

420
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,809
Looks like there's an extra
piece of cake.

421
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:58,146
It'll be kind of hard
to divide this into fifths.

422
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:59,647
[Tsumugi] Rock-paper-scissors?

423
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,650
Come on, no way, I'm terrible
at that stupid game!

424
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:06,488
[Yui] Alright, then let's settle
it the old fashioned way!

425
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,574
Very well, I'll take you on.

426
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,918
Nodoka-chan...you...
