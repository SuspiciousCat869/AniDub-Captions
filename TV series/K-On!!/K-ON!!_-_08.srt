1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:08,091
[Young Yui] Hello, turtle,
Mr. Turtle! Mr. Turtle, hello!

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:13,430
In all the world and outer space
above you and below,

3
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:18,518
nothing walks as slow as you.
Look at how you go.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,149
Why, oh why, oh Mr. Turtle,
why are you so slow?

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,067
(excited)

6
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,778
Hey Yui come here!

7
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,198
[Young Nodoka] Hey, c'mon!

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,700
[Young Yui] Nodoka-chan!

9
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,327
Look, we're leaving to go on our
walk now.

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,289
Wait for me! Wait for me!

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,636
[Yui] Hmmm...

12
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,224
(thinking)

13
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,226
What are you "Hmm"-ing about,
Yui?

14
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,686
Oh hi, Nodoka-chan.

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,022
I can't decide on my top school
choice.

16
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,776
What?! You mean you haven't
submitted your life plans
questionnaire yet?!

17
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,236
But that was suppose to be in
ages ago!

18
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,322
But, but, I'm not really
smart about this stuff,

19
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,575
and I don't really know
which universities are good.

20
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,704
Yui, at this rate, you really
are going to end up a NEET.

21
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,041
This time, that word sounds
like an actual threat!

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:28,296
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

23
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:06,311
(contemplating)

24
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:10,357
(uncertain)

25
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,735
(groans) I give up,
I'll be a NEET...

26
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,737
"N.E.E.T."

27
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,655
Stop that Yui.

28
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,784
[Yui] What about you?
What did you put down for
your top school choice?

29
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:24,162
Who me? I put one of
the national universities.

30
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:29,042
I know it's a bit of a long
shot, but I figured that I'd
give it a try anyway.

31
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,127
Cool, then I'll put that down,
too!

32
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,629
[Nodoka] What?!

33
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,131
[Yui] But I wanna go to the same
school as you, Nodoka-chan!

34
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,299
(groans)

35
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,344
Hey what's the ruckus?
Let's go practice.

36
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,846
The thing is, Yui still hasn't-

37
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,685
Yui! You still haven't
decided on a school yet?

38
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,813
Mio, what school did you put
down? What's your top pick?

39
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:54,234
Well actually, I thought
I'd try for recommendations.

40
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,695
"Recommendations U."

41
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,073
Yui, do you even know what
recommendations are?

42
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,324
Nope.

43
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,951
[Yui] Where are you going,
Mugi-chan?

44
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,954
To the women's university
I told you all about.

45
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,415
Oh, wow! Very prestigious!

46
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,541
I'll put that one, too!

47
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,042
Will you just give it a rest?

48
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,087
[Yui] Is it hard to get into
your school, Mugi-chan?

49
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,006
Well I suppose...

50
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,259
I have their test prep guide
if you'd like to take a look.

51
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,554
Let me see.

52
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,722
English!

53
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,391
My eyes... I see flashes!

54
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,727
Welcome to the real world.

55
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,272
This is Japan! We don't need
no stinking English here!

56
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,315
Amen, sister!

57
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,110
We'll stand strong!
We shall live by Japanese alone!

58
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,319
Amen, sister!

59
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,238
(laughter)

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,075
[Mio] If you flunk English
in school, you'll get
held back a year.

61
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,077
(gasps)

62
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,706
But on the entrance exam,
you'll do fine if you get
good marks in other subjects.

63
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,042
See? It also has Japanese.

64
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,460
Really?

65
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,838
Lit? Right! Ri-chan, handoff!

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,175
All... right! Let's see?

67
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:04,763
"Select which of the following
auxiliary verbs is used in the
same manner."

68
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,556
Mm. Mm. Mm.

69
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,433
I never learned any of this!

70
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,310
We covered that our
freshman year.

71
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,895
(shocked)

72
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,815
<i>But that's-- That's--</i>
<i>That's-- That's-- That's--</i>

73
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,027
<i>Impossible!</i>

74
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,739
[Tsumugi] Didn't you ever learn
how to memorize auxiliary verbs
with a song?

75
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,324
A song?

76
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:28,328
<i>-Muzu, -mu, -zu, -ji, -shimu,</i>
<i>-mashi, -mahoshi.</i>

77
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,710
<i>-Ru, -ra, -raru, -sasu, -ri,</i>
<i>-ri, -ri!</i>

78
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:40,757
<i>-Tsu, -nu, -tari, -keri,</i>
<i>-tashi, -tashi, -ki, -kemu!</i>

79
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:45,553
<i>-Ramu, -beshi, -rashi,</i>
<i>-maji, -nari, -meri.</i>

80
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:50,975
<i>Why, oh why are you so -tari</i>
<i>-gotoshi?</i>

81
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,102
That's it, right?

82
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,645
You see Yui? You DO know them!

83
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,523
So, um, what do I do with all
those?

84
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,025
What's the point of
knowing the song, then?!

85
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,611
So what school did you pick,
Ri-chan?

86
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,738
I just wrote "undecided".

87
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,282
I mean, I have no idea what
I want to do with my life yet.

88
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,494
Oh right, I'll just put down
"undecided," too, then!

89
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,162
[Mio] Is that a good idea?

90
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,000
[Ritsu] Our future can't be
decided by a measly scrap of
paper!

91
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,334
[Yui] Amen!

92
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,753
[Sawako over speaker]
Miss Tainaka and Hirasawa,

93
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,090
please report to the
Staff Room immediately.

94
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,634
Of course it isn't...

95
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,929
You guys just go on up to the
club room without us, alright?

96
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,389
[Ritsu] What a hassle...

97
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,100
Oh brother.

98
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,643
[Mio] You sure have
your hands full with her.

99
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,937
You, too, Mio, with Ritsu.

100
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,149
Yui hasn't changed one bit from
way back when she was a little
girl.

101
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,609
But believe it or not,
she's improved a lot.

102
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,779
And Ritsu can pretty much do
anything she sets her mind to.

103
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,116
It's the same with Yui.
She can have amazing focus.

104
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,202
Hey could we please continue
this up in the club room?

105
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,622
Whoa what are you so suddenly
so wound up about, Mugi?

106
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,876
(door opens)

107
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
Good afternoon.

108
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,045
[Mio and Tsumugi]
Good afternoon.

109
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,629
Pardon the intrusion.

110
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,299
That summons was for Yui-senpai
and Ritsu-senpai, right?

111
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,385
[Mio] Yeah. They brought it
on themselves, though.

112
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,638
[Azusa] Oh did they do
something again?
[Nodoka] Again?

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,308
Um, it seems like they were
being called in to discuss

114
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,477
their future plans, that's all.

115
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,899
Here's your tea, Nodoka-chan.

116
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,817
Thank you, Mugi.

117
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,530
[Mio] I've been wondering, when
did you and Yui first meet each
other?

118
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,324
Way back in kindergarten.

119
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,369
Goodness, so how did you two
meet?

120
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,581
Well, there really wasn't
anything special about it, I
guess...

121
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,875
(kids chattering)

122
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,675
Heh.

123
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,343
Wanna draw together?

124
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,428
[Young Nodoka] Sure, okay!

125
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,681
[Nodoka] Before I knew it, she
was sitting there next to me.

126
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,810
[Mio] Maybe she knew
instinctivly that she could
count on you.

127
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,067
Yui, are you done already?

128
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,611
Yours looks yummy!

129
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,196
[Young Nodoka] Yes it does.

130
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,245
Ah!

131
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,706
No don't eat that!

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,958
(giggling)

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,960
She was like that even as a
baby?

134
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:26,006
Right. We ended up being in the
same class at school every
single year after that.

135
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,967
We definitely have some sort
of strange connection.

136
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,220
I bet that she's caused a lot
of trouble for you, hasn't she?

137
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,143
Well, I'm not sure you
could really call it trouble...

138
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,021
We went camping one time in
grade school.

139
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:53,158
We were supposed to bring
instant meals.

140
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,160
[Azusa] That sounds like her,
all right.

141
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,955
[Nodoka] And there was this
other time when we were making
takoyaki in Home Ec.

142
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,917
We were each assigned an
ingredient to bring from home.

143
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,253
Okay, I'm ready for the octopus.

144
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,213
Oh?

145
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:11,718
[Nodoka] Yui was in charge of
bringing the octopus, but she'd
forgotten it.

146
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,555
We ended up making octopus-free
takoyaki.

147
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,142
Even without octopus it's really
good!

148
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,436
Octopus free!

149
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,521
You know, I could tell you
stories about stunts

150
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,440
she's pulled until
the cows come home.

151
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,109
But when you see that
innocent look on her face,

152
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,653
you just can't help
but forgive her everything.

153
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,489
[Tsmugi and Mio]
I know what you mean!

154
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,157
You do?
Because I'm completely lost.

155
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,535
By the way. When I told you
earlier that in spite of
everything,

156
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,746
Yui had improved quite a bit.

157
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,707
I think that it's all because
of the Light Music Club.

158
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,334
So, thank you.

159
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,544
Nodoka-chan, You're so mature!

160
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,297
You sure are. You're almost like
a mommy.

161
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,423
[Tsumugi and Azusa] A mommy?

162
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,300
(freak out) I meant "mother"!

163
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,054
[Sawako] This is your future
we're talking about, so put some
thought into it.

164
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,097
Alright.

165
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,766
And you still can't decide,
Yui-chan?

166
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:04,729
It seems like it's so far off in
the future that it's hard to
picture it.

167
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,816
Well it's not far off at all.
It's almost here.

168
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,236
[Ritsu] That explains why
you keep looking older.

169
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,404
Did you say something?

170
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,072
No, I didn't ma'am.

171
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,241
Hey, you know. You were like
THAT back when you were in high
school

172
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,244
so what is it that made you
want to become a teacher?

173
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,913
Well, uh, that's...

174
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,248
What is it, what is it?!

175
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,001
Uh, it's a little bit
embarrassing...

176
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,838
We want to learn from your
example, so tell us everything!

177
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,301
There was this boy I liked, and
he said he wanted to be a
teacher someday...

178
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,344
And I said, "So do I!"

179
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,679
[Ritsu] Talk about impure
motives.

180
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,473
So what eventually happened
with you and that boy?

181
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,392
He just dumped me! (sobbing)

182
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,436
[Yui] Yeah, but thanks to
that boy,

183
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,148
you went to college and got your
degree and became a great
teacher, right?

184
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,817
[Ritsu] Yeah! I mean it's
not the past that counts,

185
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,610
it's the here and now,
Sawa-chan!

186
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,114
But you don't have a boyfriend
in the here and now, either.

187
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,949
(sobbing again)

188
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,659
(door closes)

189
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,369
So, how did it go, Yui?

190
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,497
Well we learned one more thing
about Sawa-chan's interesting
past!

191
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,499
Huh? So she didn't chew you two
out?

192
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,295
See guys, you never really know
what life will throw at you, do
you?

193
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,756
Wait, you didn't pull another
one of your stunts, did you?

194
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,926
No, no, I just mean that
whenever life throws you for a
loop,

195
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,137
it can make you stronger.

196
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,723
Huh?

197
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,812
Then she was okay with your
future plans questionnaire?

198
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,314
Not one bit.

199
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,692
Isn't there anything that you
want to be when you grow up?

200
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:36,488
Something that I want to be?

201
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,407
Mio-chan, what do you think
I should want to be?

202
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,326
Decide it for yourself.

203
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,537
(thinking)

204
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,626
Back in middle school, didn't
you say that you wanted to be a
kindergarten teacher?

205
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,002
That's right, I did!

206
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,421
I think it was when
we were reading our essays,

207
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,341
on the topic of "Future Dreams"
in front of the class.

208
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,722
My dream of the future is to be
a kindergarten teacher someday.

209
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,516
I want to become a kindergarten
teacher

210
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,353
and play with kids all day
until they go home!

211
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,898
(class laughing)

212
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,402
(laughing)

213
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,696
[Mio] Sounds like Yui!

214
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,656
Speaking of reading essays in
class,

215
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:24,035
there was this one time when
Mio actually won an award.

216
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,371
No! You can't tell them about
that!

217
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,372
Oh tell us!

218
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,665
Yes please!

219
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:32,168
A-Azusa, let's go and practice!
Okay?

220
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,380
You're not getting out of this
one, Mio. Give it up.

221
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,888
[Ritsu] K-ON!

222
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,725
(class chatter)

223
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,270
[Ritsu] Even back in grade
school, Mio was a quiet,
mild-mannered girl.

224
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,273
She always seemed to have
her nose in a book.

225
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,025
Huh?

226
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,235
Hm...

227
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,195
And that's when...

228
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,322
(nervous)

229
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,033
Hey what'cha reading?!

230
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,078
[Ritsu] She was even more shy
back then than she is now.

231
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,205
C'mon, let me see, let me see!

232
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,332
[Ritsu] I loved seeing her
reactions!

233
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,835
Wow, Mio-chan, you're great at
drawing!

234
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,463
[Ritsu] I was teasing her
constantly.

235
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,548
Wow Mio, you got a hundred?!

236
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,718
You're so lucky, Ri-chan, I wish
I could've teased her, too.

237
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,553
Don't you think that was
more like bullying?

238
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:27,515
Nah, totally different. In grade
school, you always tease the
kids you like.

239
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,683
Everybody knows that.

240
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,352
It's just what you do.

241
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,480
But we really didn't get along
all that well at first, did we,
Mio?

242
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,233
Of course not! After all
that teasing you did to me?!

243
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,611
I'm getting ticked off just
by thinking about it.

244
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,945
Now show me your forehead.

245
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,323
Uh? What're you gonna do?

246
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:47,786
Huh?

247
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,537
(snickering)

248
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,747
My forehead...

249
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,749
Relax, it's a water-based
marker.

250
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,169
So tell us, what exactly
happened when you were reading
your essays?

251
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,587
Oh, you remembered that...

252
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:01,257
[Ritsu] Ah lighten up, Mio,
just tell them the story.

253
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,594
Look! I'm a three-eyed alien!

254
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,388
We were in fourth grade.

255
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,350
And I recieved an award from
the prefecture for my essay.

256
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,019
But all the award winners
had to read their essays

257
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,272
in front of everyone at
an all-school assembly.

258
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,110
I was depressed because I didn't
want to read mine, and that's
when...

259
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,820
[Young Ritsu] What's wrong?

260
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,490
[Mio] Ritsu came up and talked
to me.

261
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,495
You don't want to read your
essay at the assembly? Well why
not?

262
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,956
Because I'm really
embarrassed...

263
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,959
Don't be embarrassed, Mio-chan!
You're awesome!

264
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,336
I-I am not! I'm just regular.

265
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,132
Mio-chan, you were the only one
in the whole class to get an
award!

266
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:46,344
If it was me, I'd be rubbing
it in everybody's face!

267
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,267
Then you should've won the
stinking award! Cause I don't
want it!

268
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,228
I don't want to get up in front
of everyone and read it!

269
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:02,527
(gasps) I-I'm so sorry...

270
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:07,574
<i>Wow, I didn't know Mio-chan</i>
<i>could yell so loud...</i>

271
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,493
<i>That's... so cool!</i>

272
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:15,999
Hey! Come to my house
for some special training!

273
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,668
[Young Ritsu] Just come on!

274
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,503
But-but I...

275
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:26,551
[Young Ritsu] Without further
ado, Grade 4, Class 1, seat #1!
Mio Akiyama!

276
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,511
But I can't do it!

277
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:32,015
Is the platform too low?
Want me to make it higher?

278
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,684
No, it has nothing to do with
that!

279
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,061
Hm...

280
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,688
Oh!

281
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,315
Give me just a minute.

282
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,944
First, I'll take this off and do
this...

283
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,614
Sorta like this, I guess.

284
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,199
Right! Okay, I'm all done!

285
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,950
What are you doing?

286
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,535
[Young Ritsu] I'm a pineapple!

287
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,537
My dad told me that whenever I'm
nervous,

288
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,874
just imagine that everyone in
the audience is a big fat
potato!

289
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:02,837
But I have no idea how to do
a potato impression,
so instead pineapple!

290
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,131
Look at me, I'm a pineapple!

291
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,384
(giggling) No you're not!

292
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:15,058
[Young Mio] And so, it was
passed down from one person
to the next. The end.

293
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,145
Grade 4, Class 1. Mio Akiyama.

294
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:23,775
[Mio] Thanks to Ritsu's help,
I was finally able to relax.

295
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,068
What a wonderful story!

296
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,654
Wow, you used to be really
nice, Ritsu-senpai!

297
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,740
That's so out of character
for you, Ri-chan.

298
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,410
Geez! Don't you two even know
how to compliment someone?!

299
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:37,163
So, did Mio's essay go over
well? Did everybody really like
it?

300
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:43,044
Well, it was something that Mio
wrote, so it had a serious fairy
tale vibe.

301
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,130
Itchy, itchy, itchy, itchy!

302
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,007
You can just imagine.

303
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,633
Yeah.

304
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,343
But it was right after that,

305
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,846
that I started going over to
your house all the time, Ritsu.
Remeber?

306
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,266
Yeah, and I started teaching you
all sorts of cool stuff! Didn't
I?

307
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,143
Right, lots of things...

308
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:02,147
To overcome shyness, you gotta
learn to have some
self-confidence, okay?

309
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,898
You start with how you speak.

310
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,652
If you say "Dude!" at the end of
your sentences, you'll sound
confident!

311
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,780
My name is Mio Akiyama, dude!

312
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,741
Good, good, just like that!

313
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,492
Lots of things...

314
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:19,289
You didn't teach me anything
that wasn't rude or crude.

315
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,584
[Mio] Maybe I should never have
gone to you for help back then.

316
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,170
(sad)

317
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,463
That's so mean, Mio-chan!

318
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:30,633
You said mean things to her
just a minute ago!

319
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:35,889
But I am grateful to her for
introducing me to music and
playing in a band.

320
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,848
I guess.

321
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,475
[Everyone] Mio-chan!

322
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,478
[Mio] Hey, we weren't talking
about me and Ritsu!

323
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,189
We were talking about what to
do about these two and
their futures!

324
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,148
[Yui] Oh.

325
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,441
Yeah she's right.

326
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,401
Don't try to think of
anything specific at first,

327
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:53,114
just start out by thinking in
very general terms of what you
might want to be.

328
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,575
Okay. Then a florist, maybe?

329
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,036
Hey, that sounds like a good
thing to be!

330
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:02,165
Hi! I'm Yui Hirasawa, the town
florist!

331
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,336
Is this type of flower
difficult to care for?

332
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,254
No idea.

333
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,383
Right, you need to know
about plants to do that...

334
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,136
Then how about an office worker
at some company?

335
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,600
I'm a rookie office worker!
I'm late again today! Tee-hee!

336
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:24,062
I'm sorry! I'm late,
I overslept!

337
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,237
You work at the company that's
two doors down the hall, Miss.

338
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,614
Right! Sorry, bye!

339
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,701
Anything with fixed hours
might be a problem...

340
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,035
That was mean, Azu-nyan!

341
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,787
Being a bus tour guide
might be fun!

342
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,708
Yeah, I could go to
all sorts of places free!

343
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,292
That might work...

344
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,961
I'm a bus tour guide!

345
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:52,549
Now if everyone will look to the
right of the bus, you'll see-

346
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,720
(gagging)

347
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,263
(horn honking)

348
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:02,225
[Azusa] That might be a bad idea
for someone who gets carsick.

349
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,352
Why don't you try being a
waitress?

350
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,563
Heh. I'm a waitress!

351
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,982
They have to remember
big orders all the time.

352
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,859
How about a pastry chef?

353
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,610
Look! I'm a pastry chef!

354
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,821
I think she'd eat everything
herself.

355
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:15,947
Yeah, you have a point there.

356
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,241
For now, I think you should
just put down

357
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,202
the very first thing
that comes to your mind.

358
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,246
The first thing that comes, huh?

359
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,582
Ri-chan, I got it!

360
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,791
Yeah!

361
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:29,836
Rejected.

362
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,046
[Both] What?

363
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,255
[Ritsu] What's the deal?

364
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,090
[Yui] We filled it out,
didn't we?

365
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,717
(door closes

366
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,432
[Yui] The mission was
a failure, Commander!

367
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,142
So you wrote "Musician"?

368
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,602
You should take this seriously!

369
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,355
But we were being
totally serious, Mio.

370
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:53,068
(chuckling)

371
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,278
Geez! Nodoka-chan is
laughing at us!

372
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,780
But not because it's funny.

373
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,574
You see, this whole thing was
actually an elaborate gag,

374
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,118
designed by Ri-chan and I
to make Nodoka-chan laugh!

375
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,372
You know they're never going
to buy that story, Yui.

376
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:12,379
(dog barking)

377
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,132
[Yui] Ui, what're you gonna do
after you graduate?

378
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:20,845
<i>I can't tell her. I can't say</i>
<i>that I want to go to the same</i>
<i>school as her,</i>

379
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,764
<i>because I worry about her.</i>

380
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,267
Uh, I really haven't thought
that much about it yet.

381
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,938
[Yui] Oh. Well, you need to give
it a lot of thought before next
year.

382
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,231
How about you, Sis?

383
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,608
I'm thinking about it right now.

384
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,361
<i>She hasn't decided yet!</i>

385
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:09,227
Well I always wanted to be a
beautician, so I'm going to go
to a beauty academy.

386
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,478
Oh, okay.

387
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,606
Art University, I'm gonna
study photography.

388
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,942
You mean there are schools
for photography?

389
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:19,529
University of Foreign Studies
so I can study in China.

390
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,613
Oh...

391
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,699
I've decided to go to nursing
school.

392
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,535
Help run my family's liquor
store.

393
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,873
I'm less sure than ever
what to put down...

394
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,464
(sizzling)

395
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,973
[Yui] Please do me
the honor of accepting this!

396
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,522
Rejected.

397
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,568
(door opens)

398
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,444
Hm?

399
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,738
[Yui] Thank you for your time.

400
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:24,886
(closing song, "Listen!!")

401
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,099
[Ritsu] What the heck is
wrong, Sawa-chan?

402
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,977
[Sawako] I'm having big time
tea and sweets withdrawal!

403
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:59,314
Why haven't we been having any
tea and cake parties lately?!

404
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,815
[Yui] That might just work!

405
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,318
[Azusa] I don't know
who I am anymore...

406
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,403
[Granny] Yui-chan!

407
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,114
[Yui] Granny!

408
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,950
[Yui] Thank you so much!

409
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:14,037
[Yui] Thank you for
always loo- Ow!

410
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,373
[Granny] What are you doing now?
