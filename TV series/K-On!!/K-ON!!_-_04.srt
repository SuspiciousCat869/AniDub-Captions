1
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,634
[Ui] And that's that...

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:13,471
That takes care of the clothes.
Hanky and tissues, check.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,017
Guidebook, check.
Various snacks, check.

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,310
Right, preparations complete!

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:24,566
Okay! The class trip
starts today!

6
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,027
Sis', that is.

7
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,612
Wake up! It's morning!

8
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,031
(groaning)

9
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:36,286
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

10
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,216
[Ritsu] Yay! A trip! A trip!

11
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,677
Oh yeah! I'm getting
even more amped up!

12
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,139
Hey, you really should
keep your feet off the seat!

13
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,057
She's right, it's not
very ladylike, you know.

14
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,976
[Mio] And you shouldn't eat
snacks nonstop, either, Yui.

15
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,436
[Mio] Put it away and-
[Yui] Here, guys! I'm sharing!

16
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,271
[Yui] I've got some
Matsutake Mountain!
[Mio] Hey wait!

17
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,106
(Mio sighs)
[Girl] Thanks!

18
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,149
No one listens...

19
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,777
[Tsumugi] Here!
Have a cup of tea!

20
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,862
Thank you Mugi!

21
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,155
That's our Mugi!

22
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,699
Oh, right! Let's all take
a picture together!

23
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,783
I agree!

24
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,077
Could you please
settle down a little?

25
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,996
It'll be something to
remember our trip.

26
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,831
I wanna look real cute.

27
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,834
You there! Sit down!
Don't leave your seats
unless it's very important!

28
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,003
We told Mio that, but
she was wanted a picture!

29
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,882
What are you talking about?
Get back to your seats
this instant.

30
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,550
[Ritsu] We want you in it, too!

31
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,052
[Yui] Come on and join us!

32
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,513
No! I'm not to joining you!
You girls are just unbelievable!

33
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,770
Don't let it get to you,
we're just getting started.

34
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,481
[Yui] But you should wrap the
seaweed around the rice first!

35
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,649
The seaweed tastes
a lot better when it's soft!

36
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,027
That's why you're still
such a little girl, Yui.

37
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,988
With seaweed, you wrap it around
the fillings right before you
eat it,

38
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,159
and that lets you savor the
aroma and the crispy texture!

39
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,870
Yui! It's Mt. Fuji!

40
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,954
Where?!

41
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,164
[Yui] I dropped my snacks!

42
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,792
Huh? Are you two, grade
schoolers?

43
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,834
Ow!

44
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,753
(Ritsu in awe)

45
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,004
Pretty!

46
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,589
Oh wow! It's so big!

47
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,508
[Ritsu] Clouds are
drifting past it!

48
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,760
[Yui] They're moving so fast!
[Mio] Oh, good grief...

49
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,971
You mean, you're not in
the same group as us?

50
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,557
[Nodoka] I'm afraid not,
it's four girls to a group.

51
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,143
And the Light Music Club
should all be together.

52
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:51,189
It's going to be a lot of work,
but try to keep Yui
out of trouble.

53
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,316
Mio! Mio! Take a picture!

54
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,902
And get Mt. Fuji
in the background!

55
00:03:55,944 --> 00:04:00,699
<i>It's not just Yui, I have</i>
<i>to keep Ritsu in line, too!</i>

56
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,034
<i>I feel like someone is</i>
<i>staring at me...</i>

57
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,828
[Speaker] Kyoto... Kyoto...

58
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,288
Make sure you have all your
belonging as you leave the
train.

59
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,540
We're finally here!

60
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,375
We made it to Kyoto, Ri-chan!

61
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,752
I forget, where do we go first?

62
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,881
[Tsumugi] It says that from
Kyoto Station, we're suppose to
board a bus to-

63
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,216
Let us sally forth!

64
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,551
Sally forth?

65
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,012
Yeah! Right? We're in
the ancient capital of Kyoto,

66
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,015
so let's play a game where
we talk all old-timey!

67
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,100
[Yui] Game huh?
[Ritsu] Verily!

68
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:31,229
Alright, I want all the team
leaders to make sure that your
team is accounted for.

69
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:36,067
Why is she making us all sit
down here? I mean take our rest
upon ye floor.

70
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,902
It's just so she can take roll,

71
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,573
there's almost always one or two
students missing at this point
in the trip.

72
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,034
We don't want to cause
any trouble for people around
us,

73
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,744
so walk in single file, okay?

74
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,038
Is she...asleep?

75
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,205
It's because she overate.

76
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,583
Sometimes she is such a ditz.

77
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,297
[Yui] Ri-chan, what's that?!
It looks like a giant daikon
radish!

78
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,549
[Yui] There's one over here,
too!

79
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,343
[Ritsu] That's so goofy!

80
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,179
Hey! Hurry up and get on the
bus!

81
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,306
Gotta take a load off!

82
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,432
I'm tired

83
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,351
You're just sleepy from eating
so much.

84
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,186
I think I'll eat these next!

85
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,355
Give it a rest, will ya?

86
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,942
[Yui] Ri-chan! Hurry up!

87
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,028
This way!

88
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,821
I see it! I see it!

89
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,115
Pretty!

90
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,201
[Mio] That's amazing... It's so
shiny!

91
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,577
[Yui] I've never seen anything
like it.

92
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:31,122
Is it really made of gold?
I mean, made-y of golde?

93
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,334
[Ritsu] It sure is!
I mean, verily and forsooth!

94
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,960
But thinkth not of stealing, um,

95
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,381
absconding with some, er,
trifling amount of yon gold!

96
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:46,137
A cop, er officer of ye lawe
will arrest, thee forthwith!
That is...

97
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,389
Um. Verily.

98
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,057
<i>She's finally tired of it.</i>

99
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:54,187
The original Kinkaku-ji was laid
to waste by fire in the year
1950,

100
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,482
and what stands before
thine eyes is newly constructed.

101
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,067
The pavilion once resides the
reliquary

102
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,820
the enshrined bones of
the Buddha contained is known
by,

103
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,906
all as Kinkaku-ji,
the Golden Pavilion Temple.

104
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,451
However, Deer Garden Temple
is its true monicure.

105
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,912
(Ritsu sobbing)

106
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,789
[Yui] Oh look, they have matcha
tea here!

107
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,834
Now that's the really bitter
kind of tea isn't it?

108
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,169
[Ritsu] Yeah but it comes with
sweets! You wanna try a cup?

109
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,214
How is that any different from
what we do after school every
day?

110
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,008
So what if it isn't?

111
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,426
Come on let's try it!

112
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,054
Well down the hatch, I suppose!

113
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:34,853
From what I've been told, when
you drink matcha in a tea
ceremony or whatnot,

114
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:39,024
you always eat the sweet first,
and then you drink the tea.

115
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:43,403
Apparently, doing that enhances
the bitterness of the matcha.

116
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,031
Hey don't give me that.

117
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,450
You know studying a little
refined etiquette like that,

118
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,076
would probably do you a lot of
good.

119
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,621
She's right. You eat like
a glutton, Ri-chan.

120
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,124
You're quite uncouth, and
unrefined.

121
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,542
You're one to talk!

122
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,046
[Yui] "Kitano Tenmangu"?

123
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,215
[Ritsu] Hey is this place
famous or something?

124
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,176
[Yui] I don't know. Beats me.

125
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,846
[Ritsu] It's not like we don't
have lots of Shinto shrines
around our school.

126
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,265
I bet there's a big Buddha
statue here!

127
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,017
[Ritsu] That's a temple.

128
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,644
This shrine's god is well-known
as a patron of knowledge and
learning.

129
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,356
He's famous among students
who are taking college exams.

130
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,815
Oh...

131
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,652
Now there are cow statues
scattered all around the shrine.

132
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,572
They say that if you pet
a cow's head like this,

133
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,408
it can actually makes you a bit
smarter.

134
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,410
[Both] That's a good little moo
cow!

135
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,662
[Both] Who's a good cow?

136
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,457
[Yui] I'm rubbing you,
so you better make me smart!

137
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,958
[Both] You like it here, don't
cha?

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,919
<i>I wonder if they'll</i>
<i>be struck down for this?</i>

139
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,753
Stop that!

140
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,962
[Sawako] I can't believe you!

141
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,547
[Sawako] Are you nuts!?
<i>[Nodoka] Thought so.</i>

142
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,925
Ri-chan look! Ema horse prayers!

143
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,094
Ema, huh?

144
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,014
Okay, Yui! This'll make for some
good memories! Let's go write
something!

145
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,434
Mm yeah, let's go send our
wishes to the god of this place!

146
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,269
Right! Ema! Ema!

147
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,938
Moo! Moo!

148
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,857
They'll get denied.

149
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,779
[Sawako] Excuse me, I'd...uh...
like one of these marriage
charms, please.

150
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,156
That will be 6 dollars please.

151
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,451
Here you are.

152
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,787
[Yui] Hey, god! Mighty Tenjin!

153
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,455
[Tsumugi] Please hear us!

154
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,832
[Yui] Please grant our wishes!

155
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,959
[Ritsu] Please grant the tender
wishes of us maidens!

156
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,337
(cow bell rings)

157
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,422
[Ritsu] Think they'll come true?

158
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,340
[Yui] I hope so, Ri-chan!

159
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,467
[Tsumugi] Please grant them!

160
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,469
[Ritsu] Oops! We forgot
to make a donation!

161
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,972
[Yui] What?! You mean
we have to do it again!?

162
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:39,060
[Sawako] What is the matter with
you girls?! Are you doing this
on purpose?!

163
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,979
[Ritsu] Sawa-chan,
you've got it all wrong!

164
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,982
[Tsumugi] We were simply writing
down our wishes on prayer
plaques.

165
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,152
[Yui] Yeah Sawa-chan! To remind
ourselves what our dreams are.

166
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:51,031
[Sawako] Don't give me any of
your lame excuses! Get over
here!

167
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,577
I'm exhausted!

168
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:59,039
Me too. I was in a cold sweat
back there.

169
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,624
[Ritsu] Yui, make sure
you get changed first.

170
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,168
[Yui] Aw, I don't wanna...

171
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,629
[Ritsu] Hey, don't give me
any of your lip, young lady!

172
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,049
[Yui] Oh, you wanna fight, huh?

173
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,553
You know what,
we still have a bit of time,

174
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,680
so why don't we make ourselves
some tea?

175
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,601
We should've brought some games
or something that we could play
with.

176
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,852
Hey I have some cards.

177
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,105
Really? In that case,
why don't we play this?

178
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,899
It's called the Life Guessing
Game!

179
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,028
Yeah! That's the one where you
do whatever you have to become a
celebrity!

180
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,530
I think we should have
some snacks while we're playing!

181
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,782
Agreed!

182
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,700
But we'll be eating dinner
in a little while!

183
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,993
Don't worry about it!

184
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,953
[Ritsu] We'll have room for
dinner, too.

185
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,789
Well you better clean your
plates.

186
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,959
You mean you guys are full
already? Wow, what a waste.

187
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,962
We're just taking... a little
break.

188
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,964
Yeah we'll finish...everything.

189
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,931
You know I've always thought
that you have such lovely hair.

190
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,892
I do?

191
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:05,063
Well thank you. But it is a pain
when it gets dry in the winter.

192
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,983
Your's is really nice, too.
Do you have a perm, Mugi?

193
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,487
[Tsumugi] Not at all,
it's naturally frizzy.

194
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,406
Maybe I should grow my hair out,
too.

195
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,867
I wonder if it would make me
look more feminine...

196
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,288
Hey, what's up with you?

197
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,125
You're laughing!

198
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,210
[Ritsu] What're you picturing?!

199
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,087
[Yui] Bangs Monster!

200
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,092
Do you want to grow taller, too?

201
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,222
I'll be tall one day, and then
you're going to be really sorry!

202
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,601
Okay, I'm turning off the light.

203
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,979
Ready! I've got the alarm clock
set!

204
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,857
We have an early day tomorrow.

205
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,028
Teacher! Miss Kotobuki did it!

206
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,072
Mugi! What are you-

207
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:59,284
You want to have a pillow fight?
You're on!

208
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,539
How about a little less talking
and a lot more fighting, little
lady!

209
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:09,002
Oh yeah? Well feel the wrath
of my mighty pitch!

210
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,007
You gotta try harder than-

211
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,554
What a heavy pitch...

212
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,681
You will pay!

213
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:30,106
(pretend snoring)

214
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,698
Now go to sleep!

215
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,332
Wow, that was a close call!

216
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,209
What?!

217
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,837
Mugi! Our glorious battle
is not yet finished!

218
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,798
Well bring it on!

219
00:11:55,465 --> 00:12:01,262
(girls pillow fighting)

220
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,393
Okay, lights out.

221
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,852
Sure. Good night guys.

222
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,270
[Tsumugi] Good night!

223
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,898
[Ritsu] Honor has been
satisfied!

224
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,951
[Yui] Can you turn off the night
light?

225
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,796
[Tsumugi] Skull...

226
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:42,137
(Tsumugi and Yui giggle)

227
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,099
[Tsumugi] Lycopene...

228
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,771
(Tsumugi and Yui giggle)

229
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,983
[Ritsu] Lyco ping!

230
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,570
(Yui giggles)
(Tsumugi giggles and snorts)

231
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,863
[Ritsu] Mugi snorted!

232
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:06,786
(Yui and Tsumugi giggle harder)

233
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:23,053
(Yui giggles then
starts coughing)

234
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,768
[Yui] K-ON!

235
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,772
[Sawako] All right now,
is everyone assembled?

236
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,565
Today is your independent day.

237
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:39,527
It's very important that
each team, sticks to their
planned routes.

238
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,655
And if anything happens,
call me on my cell phone.

239
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:46,743
[Yui] Anyway, that store was
having a big sale on snacks!

240
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,496
So that's why you had so many of
them crammed into your bag.

241
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,705
[Yui] Yeah that's right!

242
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,916
Get back here, you two!

243
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:58,129
Let's see now... Our team is
suppose to go up to Mt. Arashi
this morning.

244
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,507
[Tsumugi] Hey why don't we
all take a taxi there, then?

245
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:05,845
Good idea. That will save us
a lot of time, and it should be-

246
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,848
Huh? Where's Yui and Ritsu?

247
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,600
Right! This is our first stop!

248
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,937
We've come all the way to Kyoto,
and you're looking at a music
store?!

249
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,898
Get a move on! We're going!

250
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,942
You're so mean!

251
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,528
You'll have time to look
after we come back!

252
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,071
We just wanted a minute!

253
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,281
Come now or we'll just leave you
behind.

254
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,909
Hey, they have lefty models
on display here!

255
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,911
(shocked)

256
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,961
So this is Mt. Arashi, huh?

257
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,921
[Yui] Wow! Look at all
the cute shops!

258
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,424
[Ritsu] And there's
lots of people, too!

259
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,260
Okay, we'll start with
the Togetsu Bridge, and-

260
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:49,055
[Ritsu] Awesome! Look!
It says right here that
there's a monkey park!

261
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,933
[Yui] Really?! Monkeys?!
They have monkeys here?!

262
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,435
[Mio] We've come all the way to
Kyoto,

263
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,645
and you want to go look
at a bunch of monkeys?!

264
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,064
[Mio] Yui! Ritsu!

265
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:02,193
[Ritsu] Yahoo, we're here!
The top of the mountain!

266
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,279
Oh! What a view!

267
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,159
Wow! All of that is Kyoto?!

268
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,120
I wasn't expecting such a
terrific view.

269
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,330
Hey Mio, it looks like they have
it set up

270
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:18,084
so you can feed the monkeys
over in that rest area.

271
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:28,303
There's nothing to be afraid
of, Mugi-chan! Look!

272
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,930
See?

273
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:39,856
I did it!

274
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,149
[Yui] See?

275
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,817
[Tsumugi] Yes.
It wasn't frightening at all!

276
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,029
[Yui] Boy that ways fun. We sure
got our monkey's worth, huh?

277
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,031
[Ritsu] That was fun!

278
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,449
Look, they have souvenirs!

279
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,534
Wow! You're right!
Those are so cute!

280
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,829
[Yui] That reminds me, we have
to buy something for Azu-nyan!

281
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,957
[Mio] That's right.
She had to stay behind at
school.

282
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,294
In that case, shouldn't we get
her something that shouts
"Kyoto"?

283
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,505
Something that shouts "Kyoto"?

284
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,966
[Yui] This, maybe?
[Tsumugi] How about this?

285
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:07,926
No, way! Get this!

286
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,927
No, this.

287
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,847
[Yui] Gosh, we saw so much!

288
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,517
[Mio] I wish we'd seen
more famous spots, though.

289
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,145
[Ritsu] Man, I'm so glad that I
had a whole bunch of money in my
wallet today,

290
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,481
check it out look at
all this stuff I bought!

291
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,067
Yeah me, too!

292
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,319
Why did I have
so much money, anyway?

293
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,322
To buy souvenirs for
your families, remember?

294
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,576
You really forgot about that?

295
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,375
[Mio] Well, it's about time.
Let's head back to the hotel.

296
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,669
[Tsumugi] Why don't
we take the train back?

297
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,045
[Mio] Good idea.

298
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:48,008
Alright then! The station
is this way! Follow me!

299
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,884
[Ritsu] Oops.

300
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,553
Ritsu, are we lost?

301
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,721
We're not lost.

302
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,347
You were looking at
the map the whole time!

303
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,057
I'm double-checking it
right now.

304
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,600
(Yui laughing)

305
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,936
Cut it out! Cut it out!

306
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,064
Stop it! That really tickles!

307
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,941
[Yui] Okay! Sit there!
Shake hands!

308
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,152
Incredible.

309
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,821
Um, forsooth, perhaps ye
coulde help us?

310
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,489
[Woman] Wha?

311
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,617
How dost we get-ith to yon
train station from hence,
milady?

312
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,121
[Woman] Oh, the station?
Go straight that way for
a few blocks,

313
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,915
and then turn right when
the street dead ends.

314
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,168
[Ritsu] Verily? Many thanks!

315
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,588
She understood!

316
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,173
Congrats, Ri-chan!

317
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,800
Well? Were you able to
get directions?

318
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:31,968
Oh yeah, you bet!

319
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,764
This way guys! Follow me!

320
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:36,765
[Ritsu] We're lost.

321
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,433
How could this have happened?

322
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:42,437
It would simplify things
if we knew where we were...

323
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,106
Oh, right!

324
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:54,491
Azu-nyan? Listen we managed to
get ourselves hopelessly lost.

325
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,911
How is calling Azusa
suppose to help us?!

326
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,579
You're right!
(hang up)

327
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,708
Look! Yui's over there.

328
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,794
Yui! Mio!

329
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:06,753
[Yui] Nodoka-chan!

330
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,046
Thank goodness we're saved!

331
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:12,175
Hey, do you guys know
where the train station is?

332
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,593
[Mio] So you guys are lost, too?

333
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,095
[Nodoka] Yes, but
that way is north,

334
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,014
so this should be
the right street,
don't you think?

335
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,224
[Mio] Probably.

336
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,393
If we stick with Nodoka-chan,
we'll be fine.

337
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,603
[Mio] We turn left here, right?

338
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,021
[Nodoka] I think so.

339
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,983
Okay, if we just follow
this road then we should be...

340
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,777
[Ritsu] We're right back
where we started.

341
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,696
That's so strange.

342
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,614
Nodoka...

343
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,742
[Nodoka] Hang on,
let me check my map again.

344
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,748
Aw, skull.

345
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,377
(Mio laughing)

346
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,587
Skull.

347
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,841
Mio?

348
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:56,761
(laughing)

349
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,767
I'm glad we made it back
in time for dinner!

350
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,354
Now listen, don't you ever
worry me like that again!

351
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,024
I'm sorry. Milady.

352
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,151
(quiet chuckling to laughter)

353
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,319
Yon rice, madam?

354
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:17,157
I am lady Akiyama,
on ye bass guitar!

355
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,247
[Mio] I can't stop! (laughing)

356
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,375
[Sawako] Hey what are you
two doing out here?

357
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,753
It's late, so go back
to your room.

358
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,587
[Student 1] Yes, ma'am.

359
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:31,546
[Student 2] Alright we will.

360
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,089
[Student 2] Good night,
Sawa-chan.

361
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,716
Sawa--

362
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,968
I think we can afford
to relax now.

363
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,595
Tomorrow's just the train home.

364
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:43,141
True. But there's still one
more night to get through.

365
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,772
[Mio] Okay, I'm turning off
the light.

366
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,441
Today was fun!

367
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,902
Let's go straight to sleep
this time, all right?

368
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,153
[Everyone] All right!

369
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,907
Mio?

370
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:03,119
This long night of terror has
only just begun, Mio-chan!

371
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,206
Keep it down!

372
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,583
(screaming)

373
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,502
Now you hurry up and
go to sleep!

374
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,212
Who are you?

375
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,464
I'm your teacher!

376
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:17,092
Even on a big trip like this,
you four don't ever change!

377
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,221
You're ten times scarier
without makeup, Sawa-chan.

378
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,848
What? I didn't quite
catch that, Ritsu.

379
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,476
Would you mind repeating
what you just said to me?

380
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:29,896
I didn't say anything!
I didn't mean it!

381
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,609
Now everyone, go to sleep!

382
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:39,280
C'mon, please! Can't we
just chat like friends
like we always do?

383
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:42,075
Look Yui, I'm suppose
to be your teacher now!

384
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,244
Aw, just for a while!

385
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,162
I have tasty snacks, too!

386
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,039
You're always trying to
snare me with-

387
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,792
It's all your fault that all the
other students are calling me
Sawa-chan now,

388
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:55,130
and aren't showing me the
respect that I deserve
as a teacher.

389
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,632
You're ruining my image
at the school!

390
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,968
I've worked really hard to
build up my "nice teacher" act-

391
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,846
<i>[Both] We shouldn't</i>
<i>have asked her to join us.</i>

392
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,436
<i>I'm a senior now...</i>

393
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:22,115
<i>This is our last year as</i>
<i>the Light Music Club, too...</i>

394
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:26,786
<i>But I really want to keep on</i>
<i>playing with all of them</i>
<i>in a band...</i>

395
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:31,458
<i>Forever... and ever...</i>

396
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,251
Miss Yamanaka!

397
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,670
(screams)
Don't scare me like that!

398
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,597
Anyway, I'd already been
given a copy of that book!

399
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,351
So I ended up giving it
to my little-

400
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,852
Yui! Mt. Fuji!

401
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,021
[Yui] Where? Where?

402
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,356
I want to see, too!

403
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,776
Oh I dropped them...

404
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,236
Mio-chan, you're just
as bad as me!

405
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,824
Yeah you're right!

406
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,911
(laughter)

407
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:24,552
(closing song, "Listen!!")

408
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,144
[Ui] Did you make it?

409
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,812
Since you haven't called me,

410
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:01,399
I'm just going to assume
that you were able to
make it on time.

411
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,486
Are you at the station by now?

412
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,744
Um, pardon us...
