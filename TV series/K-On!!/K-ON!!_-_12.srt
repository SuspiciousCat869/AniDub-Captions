1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:07,590
Summer vacation is starting,
so try to spend it in a
productive manner.

2
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:11,177
[Sawako] Now, as seniors, you
will have summer session
classes, so--

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,054
Summer vacation...

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,477
[Yui] Let's have another
training camp!

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,270
Huh?

6
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,771
Another training camp!

7
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,814
Oh yes, let's!

8
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,940
Good idea!

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,191
Wait! We have entrance exams to-

10
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,485
Now, all those in favor say
"Aye"!

11
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,195
Aye!

12
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:33,950
Hey! If we're voting, we're
gonna have to ask Azusa if she
agrees-

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,203
I already texted Azu-nyan
and asked her to vote on it.

14
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,705
That makes it 4 to 1.

15
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,375
Right, then! We're having
a training camp again this year!

16
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,586
[Yui and Tsumugi] Yeah!

17
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,504
[Mio] Y-Yeah.

18
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:51,760
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

19
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,267
Come on in, everybody!

20
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,394
Thanks for having us over!

21
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,188
Hey big sis!
Everybody's here now!

22
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,940
Hey, guys!

23
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,817
C'mon in, c'mon in!

24
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,901
(awkward laugh)

25
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,571
Lazing around the house?

26
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:38,867
[Yui] Come sit!
Let's play video games!
[Tsumugi] Let's! Let's!

27
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,578
[Azusa] Remind me what
we come here for, again?

28
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,039
[Mio] It's suppose to be a
meeting about the camp.

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,166
[Mio] Come on, let's get down to
business.

30
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,710
[Yui] Aw, we can play for a
while...

31
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,670
[Ritsu] Yeah!

32
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,132
[Azusa] Um, are you sure
a training camp is a good idea?

33
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,592
Why wouldn't it be?

34
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,219
Well, for one thing, you're all
seniors.

35
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,472
Yeah, but we could use a break,
ya know?

36
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,806
Yeah that's right!

37
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,600
You sure it's going to be just
"a little"?

38
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,227
You know, we went to the
beach the last two years,

39
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,604
so how about the mountains this
time?

40
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,398
Ah! I wanna go to the beach
again!

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,818
We'll be able to catch fish
and have a barbecue!

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,195
Oh...

43
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,655
That sounds pretty tasty...

44
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,782
Right?

45
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,784
I knew it, you guys just want to
goof off.

46
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:24,120
[Mio] By the way, where
would you rather go, Azusa?

47
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,165
Well um, Natsu Fest takes
place in the mountains.

48
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,166
vvReally?

49
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,125
Gnatso vest?

50
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,168
Nutty pest?

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,672
No, no! Not those things. Natsu
Fest!

52
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:42,180
Natsu Fest, is a huge outdoor
festival where lots of different
bands play!

53
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,641
Tens of thousands of people go
every year!

54
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,852
I've always wanted to check out
Natsu Fest at least once!

55
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,854
Yeah me too!

56
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,400
Plus, it'll be a real learning
experience, to watch
professional bands at work!

57
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,235
So, are we all agreed?

58
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,320
Natsu Fest is a mountain?

59
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,030
The venue is IN the mountains.

60
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,074
Inside a mountain...

61
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:07,997
(tribal music)

62
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,170
We're not going to get
eaten alive up there are we?

63
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,549
[Mio] I really don't know what
you're thinking, but whatever it
is, it's wrong.

64
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,968
What are we going to do
about getting tickets, though?

65
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,761
Is it too late to buy any?

66
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,096
Uh...

67
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,807
What would you do without me?
No more rescuing you.

68
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,891
(gasps)

69
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,851
That's amazing!

70
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,686
That's our Sawa-chan!

71
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,646
Wait! When did you get here!?

72
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,065
Could I get a cup of barley tea,
too?

73
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,234
O-of course.

74
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,028
Wow, my first Natsu Fest...

75
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,031
Yeah, I've never seen an outdoor
show before, either!

76
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,699
I bet it feels really great!

77
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,702
Keep that carefree attitude, and
you're looking at defeat.

78
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,578
Defeat by what?

79
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,538
By summer! Pay attention!

80
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,666
The glare of the blazing sun!
The sweltering heat!

81
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,003
And the summer insects that even
now are waiting to eat you
alive!

82
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:59,007
Those who choose to do battle in
Natsu Fest must face all these
challenges!

83
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,383
Prepare yourselves!

84
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,302
Yes, ma'am!

85
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,471
Mio-senpai is all jazzed up!

86
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,115
Looks like, nobody's here yet.

87
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,409
[Tsumugi] Azusa-chan!

88
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,827
Good morning, Mugi-senpai!

89
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,706
Good morning.
Oh, are you the only one here?

90
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,875
[Azusa] Yes-
[Ritsu] Morning!

91
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,211
[Ritsu] Hey!

92
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,254
[Mio] Figures, you two are the
only ones who managed to make it
on time.

93
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,923
Oh...

94
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,633
You look like you didn't get
much sleep last night,
Mio-senpai.

95
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,303
No. She was up all night,
working out which bands she
wants to see.

96
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,347
It's packed with bands
I don't want to miss!

97
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,767
Yeah, it looks like they have
a whole bunch of stages there.

98
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,604
Oh look, the bus is here...

99
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,691
I better try calling Yui-senpai!

100
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,318
I'm right over here, you guys!

101
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,986
[Yui] Hi! Good morning!
[The girls] Yui!

102
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,948
[Azusa] You should've said
you were already here!

103
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,992
Well...I was waiting to see
when you would notice me...

104
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,662
[Azusa] I'm sorry, but it
never occurred to me that

105
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,664
you might be the first one to
get here.

106
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,459
Of course we're still missing
one person from our group.

107
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,797
(groaning) Girls...

108
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,882
Sawa-chan, what's the matter
with you?

109
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,720
I went out to a show last night
and drank until morning...

110
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,848
I came straight here from the
club.

111
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,519
[Ritsu] Sawa-chan, that was
stupid.

112
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,105
Why would you do something like
that if you knew we were leaving
today?!

113
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,899
<i>[Mio] Come on, let's hit</i>
<i>the road!</i>
[Azusa] You told us to
take this trip...

114
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,655
(queasy) I feel sick...

115
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,991
Oh yeah, welcome to my life...

116
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,660
You're sick because
you're hung over, aren't you?

117
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,371
Yeah, I live the rock-n-roll
lifestyle...

118
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,582
I really don't know what that
means...

119
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,708
You two all right?

120
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,210
Yui-senpai gets carsick easily,
huh?

121
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,921
[Mio] I'm going to see this band
and this band, period!

122
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,633
You can't, Mio. They're playing
on different stages at the same
time.

123
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,093
Then I want two bodies!

124
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,720
Ugh.

125
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,389
Choose one or the other.
Or only listen to half of each
one.

126
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,682
Then I want a teleport!

127
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:13,975
[Ritsu] Get real.

128
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,769
<i>Mio-senpai is acting like a</i>
<i>baby.</i>

129
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,063
I want yakisoba! Yakisoba!

130
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,231
Yakisoba is the one thing
I intend to eat there!

131
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,193
<i>[Azusa] Mugi-senpai</i>
<i>is acting childish, too!</i>

132
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,694
You guys are...

133
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,531
I want to die...

134
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,746
I can't believe I'm going to be
able to listen to music from
sunup to sundown...

135
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,415
You know, she's been getting
more and more wound up.

136
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,918
[Yui] Can you really blame her?!

137
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,002
[Ritsu] You've got ice cream!

138
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,754
They've got lots of great things
to eat!

139
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,756
And they sell lots of souvenirs,
too!

140
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,175
Rest stops are so awesome!
They have everything!

141
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,011
[Azusa] I thought you were
feeling car sick and yucky.

142
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,429
I'm all better now!

143
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,889
Have a taste of this, Azu-nyan!

144
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,892
Soft serve made from rich
highlands dairy!

145
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,145
If you're offering.

146
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,734
Our rest stop is nearly over.

147
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,861
But I haven't bought any
souvenirs yet!

148
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,155
This isn't our destination,
Yui-senpai!

149
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:13,702
Indeed it isn't! This is no
place for one eat yakisoba!

150
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,705
<i>[Azusa] Mugi-senpai</i>
<i>is slightly off-kilter, too...</i>

151
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,792
Are we there yet?!

152
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,837
Yui-chan, please,
stay down in your seat...

153
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,755
We'll make the opening
ceremonies, right?!

154
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,465
Relax, we'll make it!

155
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,968
They'll have tasty food there,
won't they?

156
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,804
Oh wow! Two days surrounded by
music!

157
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,598
Yui-chan! Yakisoba! Let's eat
yakisoba!

158
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,560
[Ritsu] Let's just enjoy
ourselves.

159
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,687
Are you guys going to be a
problem?

160
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,858
Please don't talk so damn
loudly, okay?

161
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,907
It's crowded!

162
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,910
Oh man, there's already
so many people here...

163
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,663
Are you okay? It hasn't even
started.

164
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,248
This sure is amazing, all right.

165
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,751
There must be, 300 million
people!

166
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,253
That's more than the population
of Japan.

167
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,838
[Sawako] Come on, girls!

168
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,506
The slacker attitudes end here!

169
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,800
[Yui] You were slacking
more than any of us were!

170
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,762
You were flat on your back
with a massive hangover!

171
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,890
I've cast off the me of
yesterday.

172
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,978
The festival entrance!
Beyond there lies a battlefield!

173
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,355
Lay it on thick?

174
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,981
(determined)

175
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,900
[Sawako] The wristbands you
got in exchange for your
tickets,

176
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,027
are your passport into this
festival!

177
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:33,073
If you lose them, you won't be
allowed back in, so keep a eye
on them!

178
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,784
Okay! Before we go in,
let's go to the camp area!

179
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,287
We need to secure
a place to sleep tonight!

180
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,539
[Sawako] Damn! Too late!

181
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,917
The flat area is already taken
up!

182
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,046
We'll have to settle
for the inclined area.

183
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,007
But won't our blood pool
in our heads while we sleep?

184
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,927
You sleep with your head uphill,
dummy.

185
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,765
Wow, you're really an old hand
at this.

186
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,601
All right, put your things
inside the tent.

187
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,604
[Tsumugi] Here goes...

188
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,107
Mugi-chan?

189
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:12,987
[Tsumugi] Yahoo! It's a bit
stuffy, but this is wonderful!

190
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,407
It's rather painful on the back,
though...

191
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,867
Yeah, we get it, come on!

192
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,703
Do you have everything you need
with you?

193
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,662
Yes, ma'am!

194
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,372
Have you all put on your
sunscreen?

195
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,415
Yes, ma'am!

196
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,125
Have you brought something to
drink?

197
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,336
I got it all covered! My heat
stroke countermeasures are in
place!

198
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,297
That's no good!
You should have a sports drink!

199
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,590
Should I leave this here?

200
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,592
No, bring it.

201
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,387
Water is useful for washing your
hands, or pouring over yourself
when you get hot.

202
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,016
<i>I guess some people enjoy being</i>
<i>anal retentive about this</i>
<i>stuff.</i>

203
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,184
Gah! Why aren't you
wearing your sneakers?!

204
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,021
[Tsumugi] I didn't bring
any other shoes with me.

205
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,024
Don't worry, Mugi-chan,
I'll lend you my flip-flops!

206
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,776
I brought them because I thought
we might play in the river.

207
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,362
Do you even remember why we're
here?

208
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,239
Yui-chan, thank you!

209
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,615
[Yui] Don't mention it!

210
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,660
Wait a minute, what about bug
repellant?

211
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,498
Bug repellent present
and accounted for, Miss!

212
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,624
Here!

213
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,043
Thanks a lot, Mugi-chan!

214
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,878
And now, here's some for you.

215
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,380
This reminds me of a grade
school hike for some reason.

216
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:16,634
It's your turn, Mugi-chan! Give
me the bottle so I can spray
some on you!

217
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,803
Thank you, but I can
take care of it myself.

218
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,640
Aw, but I wanna make
the bottle go "pshew," too!

219
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,142
All right, you can.

220
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,019
Yep, definitely grade school.

221
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,313
[Yui] Ri-chan, Azu-nyan,
I'll get you guys next!

222
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,899
Alright then! Are you done
dawdling?!

223
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,234
[Yui and Ritsu] When did
Sawa-chan get over there!?

224
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,319
Forward, march!

225
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,949
Here you are.

226
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,242
[Festival Worker]
Please follow our zero-litter
policy!

227
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,744
[Festival Worker]
Garbage bags will be provided!

228
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:43,953
[Festival Worker]
Thank you for your cooperation!

229
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:47,874
<i>The Natsu Rock Festival</i>
<i>is about to begin!</i>

230
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,216
[Yui] K-ON!

231
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,847
All right, let me explain
how the grounds are laid out.

232
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,140
Yes, ma'am!

233
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,934
[Sawako] First is the Fire
Stage, a main venue.

234
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,521
This is one of the two main
venues, with a capacity of
roughly 40,000!

235
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,149
It has a gentle slope, so even
people in the back can easily
see.

236
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,486
This is the Thunder Stage,
or the alternate main stage.

237
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,446
It can hold over 10,000
spectators,

238
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:22,659
and tons of cutting-edge,
underground bands play here
throughout the festival.

239
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,912
People must go back and forth
between those stages a lot.

240
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,707
Definitely.
They're 700 almost meters apart.

241
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,333
(gasps)

242
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,294
Even running at 100m/s,
it'll still take 70 seconds to
cross!

243
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,130
Just breathe.

244
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,632
There's also this indoor stage,
where up and coming bands play.

245
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:42,470
The stage furthest in back
features jazz bands and the more
"unique" bands.

246
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,849
There's even a small stage that
features acoustic musicians.

247
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,184
This is truly, a festival of
music!

248
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,478
And food! Where is it
that they sell food?!

249
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,273
Remember, Yui-chan,
I'm in it for the yakisoba!

250
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,901
Something is seriously off
kilter with these two...

251
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,695
No kidding...

252
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,948
You know, I'm pretty amazed that
you just happened to have those
tickets.

253
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,242
Well, I come to this festival
every year.

254
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,411
But why did you have six of
them?

255
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,289
I was expecting to come here
with some of my friends,

256
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,541
but they cancelled on me
at the last minute.

257
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,793
Do they hate you or something?

258
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,171
Of course they don't!

259
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,757
Uh...

260
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,883
I think.

261
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,469
How am I supposed to react to
that?

262
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,181
(crowd cheering)

263
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,103
Mio-chan, are you okay?

264
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,899
You know, now that I'm actually
here, it's really hot and
crowded.

265
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,067
(band getting ready)

266
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,402
Let's get started!

267
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,196
(cheers)

268
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,365
Are you ready?!

269
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,241
Yeah!

270
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,244
[Singer] Alright! Let's ramp
this up!

271
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,706
(music begins)

272
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,625
Oh! Wow!

273
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,502
Their sound is so big!

274
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,299
This is really Natsu Fest...

275
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:03,927
This is...

276
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,764
(excited cheering)

277
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,349
...is Natsu Fest!

278
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,145
Mio-chan just made her Natsu
Fest debut!

279
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,815
Isn't this band fantastic?!

280
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,778
Oh yeah, the singer's voice is
awesome!

281
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,447
All right, people! We're moving
on!

282
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,367
But I wanna listen to this band
some more! Don't you?

283
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,245
My top band pick is playing at
the indoor stage pretty soon.

284
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,081
It's a little far, so we're
gonna have to sprint it!

285
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,834
Maybe you should just go
by yourself, Sawa-chan.

286
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,294
[Sawako] Suit yourselves!
I'm out of here!
[Mio] Ritsu! Ritsu!
I'm leaving, too!

287
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,338
[Mio] I'm going over to
the Thunder Stage!
[Ritsu] Right now?

288
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,049
Come on, hurry! If we don't
we'll miss the opening!

289
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,093
Mio-chan, I'm going to stay
here, okay?

290
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,594
Yes, I'll stay, too.

291
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,514
[Mio] Okay! We'll see
you guys later, then!

292
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,600
We'll touch base later and
meet up somewhere! Okay?

293
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,768
[Mio] Hurry! Hurry!

294
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,479
Alright, I'm coming!
See ya later! Have fun!

295
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,398
Hey Mio, wait up!

296
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,191
You sure about this?

297
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,486
You want to stay here and listen
to this great band, too, don't
you?

298
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,738
And what about you?

299
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:09,325
Yes, well, I can't
really run in flip-flops.

300
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,745
[Band lead] It's good to be
back here at Natsu Rock Festival

301
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,538
for the first time in three
years!

302
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,789
Ritsu! Ritsu!

303
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:15,790
Huh? What is it?

304
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,751
This band's guitarist is a
lefty!

305
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,502
[Ritsu] Wow, you're right.

306
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,421
(happy)

307
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:24,132
You were right, lefties
really DO look kind of weird!

308
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,092
But I'm really not one to talk,
though.

309
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,011
I'm glad you found a
fellow southpaw and all,

310
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,305
but could you please
bring it down a notch?

311
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,141
(band playing)

312
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:37,020
<i>Yui-senpai's transfixed.</i>
<i>Staring at the stage.</i>

313
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,646
<i>I hope that being here inspires</i>
<i>her</i>

314
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,608
<i>to take her practicing</i>
<i>more seriously from now on.</i>

315
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,569
[Yui] Azu-nyan, I want to ask
you an important question.

316
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,279
Yes? Ask me what?

317
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,115
How do you think their bassist
gets his hair to stay like that?

318
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,159
I mean it's so cool!

319
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,536
It has to be naturally curly.

320
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,580
<i>You too, Mugi-senpai?</i>

321
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,587
It's popular...

322
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,464
It's okay, we'll stand in line
with you!

323
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,965
Yeah, let's go!

324
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,050
Right!

325
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,551
[Yakisoba vendor] Excuse me,
everyone!

326
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,304
[Yakisoba vendor] Sorry folks,
but we're all sold out!

327
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,809
Mugi-senpai!

328
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,978
Just stay strong!
Don't let it get you down!

329
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,524
Mm. Okay, let's go get
what you want to eat.

330
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,276
Yui-chan...

331
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,239
Aw, this stinks...
I just wanna go home now!

332
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,573
Please don't throw a tantrum.

333
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,992
(Yui's phone ringing)
[Yui] Oops, I got a text!

334
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,953
[Azusa] She snapped right out of
it!

335
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,621
[Yui] It's from Ri-chan!

336
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,542
"We'll be at Fire Stage from
2PM, then Thunder Stage from
3PM,

337
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,003
and then Fire Stage again at
4PM."

338
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,087
[Azusa] Wow, packed schedule.

339
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,298
Right! I'll run there now!

340
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,136
[Yui] Mugi-chan!
[Azusa] Mugi-senpai!

341
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,724
(music)

342
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,060
[Sawako] Yeah! THESE GUYS ROCK!

343
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,118
Thank you!

344
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,462
Good. It's down to a drizzle
now.

345
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,673
We have some time to kill before
the next band we want to see.

346
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,926
Is anybody hungry?
We missed lunch and I'm
starving.

347
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,929
You ate crepes and ice cream,
and funnel cakes, remember?

348
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,973
That's dessert, not lunch,
silly.

349
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,643
Tell you what, I'll go buy
dinner for us, then, okay?

350
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,228
Hey, I'll go with you!

351
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,148
Don't worry, I've got this.
You guys stake out a spot for
us.

352
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,152
Okay, you know that river that
runs through the middle of the
boardwalk area?

353
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,529
[Ritsu] We'll wait for you
there.

354
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,242
[Ritsu] So, should we set up
here?

355
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,702
[Azusa] It looks good.

356
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,164
(jumping effort)

357
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:03,792
[Tsumugi] Mio-chan!

358
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,670
Welcome back... Thanks for
getting food.

359
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:11,675
They were selling t-shirts!
Look! It's for that band with
the lefty guitarist!

360
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,345
Where's dinner? Hm?

361
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,680
How does it look?!

362
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,433
Wow, that's nice...
I think I want to get one too!

363
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,185
Why don't we all buy one?

364
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,561
I'd like one as well!

365
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,855
[Yui] Let me see, let me see!
(Ritsu's phone ringing)

366
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,650
[Mio] See? What do you think?

367
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,360
A text from Sawa-chan.

368
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,530
She says she bought a bunch
of takoyaki for us to share.

369
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,615
Takoyaki!

370
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,414
Ah, I'm myself again!

371
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,708
They even have baths here!

372
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,084
It's amazing.

373
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,211
[Azusa] I have pins
and needles all over...

374
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,463
[Ritsu] You're red as
a lobster again this year...

375
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:54,134
I used a whole bunch of
sunscreen, but it didn't work
for me!

376
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,012
It's okay, you look so cute!

377
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,014
Well, I'm going to turn in now.

378
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,390
Huh? Already?

379
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:03,893
My neck's killing me
from the headbanging...

380
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,396
You thought it was because
of my age, DIDN'T you?

381
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,732
Perish the thought!
Perish the thought!

382
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:17,073
(street chatter)

383
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,423
[Azusa] Senpai?

384
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,759
[Yui] Hey, Azu-nyan.

385
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,678
[Azusa] What are you doing
up here all by yourself?

386
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,765
[Yui] I've been listening to
all the songs in the distance.

387
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,393
They really do play music
all night, don't they?

388
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,065
Come on, sit down.

389
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,608
O-okay.

390
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,363
[Azusa] Aren't you getting
bitten by mosquitoes out here?

391
00:19:56,404 --> 00:20:00,325
Not a problem! I'm wearing
two bug repellant wristbands!

392
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,244
Here, I'll give you one.

393
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,871
Thank you.

394
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:08,583
Goodness gracious me!
Are you two having a secret
little chat?

395
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:13,129
[Yui] Come on over, you guys!
Let's listen to the songs here
for a bit.

396
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,804
[Mio] It's almost like a dream,
isn't it?

397
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,723
Yes, it feels kind of magical.

398
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:28,812
Yeah, music playing nonstop in
a wide open place like this, is
wonderful.

399
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:32,148
Everyone of the bands
I saw today was totally awesome.

400
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:38,780
Right. The music's energy...
Its intensity was completely
incredible.

401
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:45,870
Yeah, but I think our
performances are even more
amazing.

402
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,958
Where do you get off
comparing us to pros?!

403
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,209
Huh?

404
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,961
My point is, you should
get good enough to play,

405
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,089
your guitar without flubbing
notes before you say stuff like
that!

406
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:59,175
Ouch, you hit my vulnerable
spot...

407
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,930
Still, I do think we're more
amazing then all of those bands.

408
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:08,518
[Yui] The way we become one,
or... how do I explain it?

409
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,813
Right! It's our aura!

410
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,819
Do you even know what
the word "aura" means?

411
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,904
Uh-uh.

412
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:20,947
[Mio] She's right.

413
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,532
Hm?

414
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,160
After-school Tea Time is
an awesome band, too!

415
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,202
Mio?

416
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,412
[Mio] Right, Yui?

417
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,206
[Yui] Right you are, Mio-chan!

418
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:33,335
[Azusa] You're right! We're just
as good as these pro bands are!

419
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,378
[Ritsu] Wait, you too?!

420
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,298
[Mio] Next time, we won't come
to Natsu Fest to listen, we'll
come here to play!

421
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,008
[Ritsu] A-Are you serious?!

422
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,509
[Tsumugi] Right! To play!

423
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:42,844
[Yui and Azusa] Yeah!

424
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:49,976
Yeah, you're right... Wouldn't
it be awesome to get the chance
to play here?

425
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,686
[Yui] Yeah!

426
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,574
I hope that I can just keep on
playing in a band with you guys
forever!

427
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,035
So do I.

428
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,536
Mm-hm.

429
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,580
So do I.

430
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:15,418
Me too! Forever. And ever.

431
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:24,928
(closing song, "Listen!!")

432
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:57,645
[Jun] Yakisoba always tastes
better when you eat it outside
like this.

433
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,439
[Ui] I know what you mean!

434
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,107
[Azusa] Now that you mention it,

435
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,234
Mugi-senpai was looking forward
to having yakisoba at Natsu
Fest,

436
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,571
but they sold out fast,
and she never got to eat any.

437
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,574
[Tsumugi] I have a summer house
we can us.

438
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,618
You can go to Finland anyway!

439
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,496
[Sawako] Why don't I take you
guys there?

440
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,498
Who are you?

441
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:17,624
[Jun] I had no idea.

442
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,502
[Yui] Leftovers from
lunch detected!
