1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:07,340
[Yui] Um... Not quite...

2
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,537
Ui!

3
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,498
Just what are you doing, Sis?

4
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,249
Ui...

5
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,049
What am I gonna do?

6
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:36,554
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

7
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,148
[Azusa] Good morning, Ui.

8
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,317
[Ui] Oh hey, Azusa-chan,
good morn-

9
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,695
What happened to your hair?
Is this a new look?

10
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,701
I've been so out of it,
I must have forgot to put it up.

11
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,954
Why are you so out of it today?
Is everything all right?

12
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,208
Yeah, yeah, it's all right,
I'm fine...

13
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,546
Azusa-chan! Your shoes!

14
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,604
Thank you.

15
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,065
You're not acting like
yourself today.

16
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,860
It's just, with the
school festival over,
I'm totally drained.

17
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,405
[Ui] It still might be nice
to change your hair, though.

18
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,864
What do you say I try
something new?

19
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,742
Sounds fun. So what are you
thinking?

20
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,369
Ta-dah!

21
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,788
Azu-nyan!

22
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,125
Why would you want to change
yours to match Yui-senpai's?

23
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,045
I've wanted to give you a big
hug like this for a long time.

24
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,839
[Jun] What are you two doing?

25
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,717
We're just talking about
hairstyles.

26
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,012
Whoa, you and your sister could
be twins!

27
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,513
Wow thank you!

28
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,682
That's not a compliment.

29
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,185
[Azusa] Wait, that's
Yui-senpai's...

30
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,356
I've worn them all morning.
You're just now noticing?

31
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,315
I'm really out of it.

32
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,484
So why do you have the hair
pins?

33
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,029
[Ui] Oh, I put them on
earlier this morning.

34
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,405
Yeah, but why?

35
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,906
Because me and my sister
were playing around with,

36
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,492
a bunch of different kinds hair
styles.

37
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,037
She couldn't decide which
hairstyle looked best on her,

38
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,999
so I decided to put her hair
pins in my hair so she could see
what it looked like.

39
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,336
She says the senior pictures
are coming up soon.

40
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,379
For the graduation album.

41
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,261
Got a headache?

42
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,930
No it's something else,
see I'm not my usual self today.

43
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,725
Well you look exactly
the same to me.

44
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,479
Nodoka-chan, you've known me
for so long.

45
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,273
Right here.

46
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,610
Hair pins. So did you forget
'em? Or just lose 'em?

47
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,320
Ui still has them.

48
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,782
I tried some new styles in
the mirror, but just wasn't
feeling it.

49
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,826
So I experimented on Ui
to get a better look at them.

50
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,162
So that's why you came
to school like this.

51
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,747
Yeah, and it feels real weird

52
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,583
not to have my hair pinned
down here like it should be.

53
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,503
Nodoka-chan, do you have
something I could use to pin it
with?

54
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,088
Let me see...

55
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,591
Sorry but this is all I have.

56
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,843
A binder clip, huh?

57
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,721
Well I suppose that it could
work.

58
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,890
[Tsumugi] You're welcome to use
this.

59
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,934
Shall I tie it back?

60
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,354
Would you please? Thanks so
much!

61
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:20,880
[Tsumugi] Your hair's not quite
long enough for a traditional
pony tail. So...

62
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,815
[Mio] Yui? What's going on?

63
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,693
It's Mugi-chan! Look what she
did to me!

64
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,902
Cause of your forehead?

65
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,279
What's that?!

66
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,780
Show it loud and proud!

67
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,533
You have a rather impressive
forehead, too, don't you?

68
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,286
No, please! Any hairstyle but
this!

69
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,412
Okay.

70
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,873
[Ritsu] Aw that's cute!
[Yui] Really?

71
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,335
[Nodoka] Really. I've seen
puppies who look just like that.

72
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,836
[Yui] That means I look like a
dog!

73
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,880
[Nodoka] Yes, but in a cute way.

74
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,881
Hey there Sis!

75
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,882
[Yui] Now I'm really
embarrassed!

76
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,718
Oh, Ui-chan. What brings you
here?

77
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,055
Sorry to bother you.
But could you give this to Yui?

78
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,639
[Mio] Yui.

79
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,020
Thank you, Ui!

80
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,616
[Azusa] The track seems kind of
deserted.

81
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,286
[Ui] It's probably because the
seniors in the athletic clubs
have stepped down.

82
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,954
[Jun] Same with our club.

83
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,083
Hey, wait...

84
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,719
<i>Seniors step down from</i>
<i>their clubs after the school</i>
<i>festival!</i>

85
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,430
<i>And they're about to take</i>
<i>their senior pictures!</i>

86
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,973
<i>Have they already-</i>

87
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,526
Azusa, why are you out of
breath?

88
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,069
Are you okay?

89
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,155
You guys are still here.

90
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,951
You ran here because you
couldn't wait to eat Mugi's
yummy snacks, right?

91
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,452
Say "ah"!

92
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,163
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
drag me down to your level.

93
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,332
Let me guess, you were scared
that we'd stepped down,

94
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,710
and would stop coming to the
club so you freaked out?

95
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,461
<i>NOW she's observant?</i>

96
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,339
Aw, Azusa didn't want to be
alone.

97
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,174
That is so cute!

98
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,594
Stop the violence! Stop the
violence!

99
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,679
She's scary!

100
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,180
Ease up on the drama!

101
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,599
[Azusa] What are you all doing
in the club room anyway?

102
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,977
What do you mean? It's comfy
here.

103
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,603
It's got air conditioning!

104
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,649
And there's always snacks!
There's really no reason NOT to
come!

105
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,276
[Both] Right?

106
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,320
You're here, too?

107
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,197
Actually, all joking aside,

108
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,618
we thought this was a good place
for us to study for our entrance
exams.

109
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,412
Wait, you're okay with that
aren't you?

110
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:01,708
Yeah, of course, if that's why
you're here, I have no problem
at all.

111
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,126
Plus, it's nice to have company.

112
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,253
[Ritsu] That's the spirit,
Azusa!

113
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,255
This way, you won't be left
alone!

114
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:11,009
But the real question is, can
you guys actually study here
without goofing off?

115
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,136
[Ritsu] 'course we can!
[Yui] She has no manners!

116
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:17,182
[Sawako] By the way,
Ri-chan and Yui-chan...

117
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,435
I know this strawberry
shortcake's amazing, right?

118
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,521
Actually what I wanted to
discuss was your career goals.

119
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,191
[Sawako] Have either of you
written up your plan yet?

120
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,361
Well, we both went to summer
school! Doesn't that count for
something?

121
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,695
We thought we'd go to college.

122
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,240
Okay then. Which college? And
what majors?

123
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,575
Well, I...

124
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,452
I wanna do what you do
Sawa-chan!

125
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,705
That's so sweet, thank you,
that's very flattering.

126
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,583
Yeah, I wanna eat snacks, drink
tea, and just hang out and

127
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,502
chit chat every day, like you
do!

128
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,796
[Sawako] I do have a job, thank
you!

129
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,216
Oh Mio-chan, you should
submit your application soon.

130
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,550
Okay.

131
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,927
[Yui] What application?

132
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,679
To take the admissions test.

133
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,763
[Yui] Wow, really?

134
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,598
[Sawako] With your grades,
Mio-chan,

135
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,435
you wont have a problem passing
the entrance exams national
universities.

136
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,145
[Azusa] Wow, that's fantastic!

137
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,064
[Mio] Uh, I guess.

138
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,901
[Azusa] You're applying to a
private all girl's college,
right, Mugi-senpai?

139
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,947
[Ritsu] Well, maybe I'll go
to the same school as Mugi.

140
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,324
Then I'll go there, too!

141
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,159
[Sawako] Put a little more
thought into the decision, all
right?

142
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,079
And keep your academic
abilities in mind as well.

143
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,123
[Yui and Ritsu] Yes, Ma'am.

144
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,168
[Sawako] And, Mio-chan. Make
sure you get that application to
me by tomorrow.

145
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,504
[Mio] Uh okay.

146
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,423
Now that our career goals
are taken care of.

147
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,341
[Azusa] You haven't taken
care of anything.

148
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,592
On to this!

149
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,136
[Azusa] Why the sudden interest
in hair?

150
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,763
I'm trying to pick a new hair
style for my graduation picture!

151
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,809
It'll be with me the rest of my
life! Do I want to make sure
it's perfect!

152
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,602
Shouldn't you guys be trying to
study?

153
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,563
Entrance exams aren't until next
year,

154
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,774
but our senior pictures are day
after tomorrow, Azu-nyan!

155
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,817
Um "Next year"?

156
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,527
Even I have to question that
logic.

157
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:58,074
Listen to me. If you fail to
study for that test, you'll
flunk it.

158
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,494
"Flunk" and "fail" are two words
that no test-taker ever wants to
hear.

159
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,788
[Ritsu] Same goes with
"split up" or "break up"...

160
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,206
That applies weddings!

161
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,335
Ha! We just created a three-man
skit!

162
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,794
Woo-hoo!

163
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,089
Oh, Mio-chan, did you find
a style you like?

164
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,301
Are you gonna get your hair done
like that for the senior
picture?

165
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,764
Of course not.
I'd prefer something like...
this.

166
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,892
Okay, that was a joke.

167
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,186
[Yui] I was thinking of going
with something like this.

168
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,146
You want to make that drastic a
change?

169
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,939
What's wrong with
the hairstyle you've got?

170
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,609
I actually think
it's pretty cute as it is.

171
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,486
[Yui] You think so?

172
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,031
Hey, I'll bring a camera with me
tomorrow, and we can take some
test pictures.

173
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,124
K-ON!

174
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,545
[Yui] I was grinning in
this grade school picture,

175
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,798
but then I got nervous for
this junior high photo.

176
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,302
I should've tilted my chin
down more in this one.
Here, too much tilt.

177
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:04,307
And this one, my bangs are
too short. And here,
they're a bit long.

178
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,309
You think so?

179
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,937
That's why...this year
is going to be perfect!

180
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,943
[Ritsu] Hey, looks like you'll
be first, Ritsu-senpai.

181
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,365
Your hair is so silky!
It's really beautiful.

182
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,325
Hey, that's enough of that talk.

183
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,412
I just want to keep touching it
forever!

184
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,788
Stop it!

185
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,794
Here we go...

186
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,924
[Tsumugi] A little higher,
maybe?

187
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,926
Too high?

188
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,887
It goes here.

189
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,181
Okay. You ready?

190
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,307
Sure.

191
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,395
Alright, one more.

192
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,024
[Yui] It's perfect!

193
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,693
Ritsu never worries about
having her picture taken,

194
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,112
and they always come out
perfect. There's proof.

195
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,740
Okay. You're up next,
Mio-senpai.

196
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,578
[Yui] Looks like she wants to
run away.

197
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,580
Yup. There's that look again.

198
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,042
She has that freaked out
expression in every school
picture she's ever taken.

199
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,420
Just try to relax a bit more
for tomorrow's photo.

200
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,757
It's your turn now, Mugi-senpai.

201
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,425
Ready!

202
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,597
[Ritsu] Why?

203
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,474
Well you see, I always seem
ditzy in my pictures,

204
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,143
so I thought I'd try
looking serious this time.

205
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:33,813
Yeah, but I think that ditzy
thing looks really good on you.

206
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,190
You think so?

207
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,442
You just have be your self.

208
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,569
Okay, the ditzy look it is.

209
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,987
Yeah!

210
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,490
Alright Yui-senpai, you're the
last one.

211
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,824
'kay!

212
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,921
Aw come on, Azu-nyan!

213
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,798
I'm sorry!

214
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,258
[Azusa] Hey, that looks pretty
good.

215
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,761
You look so prim and proper.

216
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,805
Oh, you almost look like
a serious student.

217
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,975
Whoa. I can't believe no one
had a comeback for that.

218
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,394
Do you think my bangs look long?

219
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,562
Not at all. They look good to
me.

220
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,190
Mm-mm. They're just a bit long.

221
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:17,816
Really?

222
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,275
Scissors!

223
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,111
[Tsumugi] Yui-chan!

224
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,445
[Azusa] Don't do anything rash!

225
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,031
If you want them cut,
you should go to a salon!

226
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,200
It doesn't cost much to get a
simple trim.

227
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,578
Yeah, but when I go to a salon,
they always cut them too short!

228
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,873
In a week they end up being the
perfect length, but I don't have
that long.

229
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,709
I need perfect bangs by
tomorrow.

230
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,252
Then at least let Mugi cut them!

231
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,547
What?! That might be too
important of a task for me to
do!

232
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,384
Don't worry. I trim up my
own hair all the time.

233
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,845
I can't bear to watch!

234
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,947
What do you think?

235
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,657
They look great!

236
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,367
Stop while you're ahead.

237
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,580
Maybe they're still a wee bit
too long...

238
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,622
[Both] No don't!

239
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,697
I may have cut it too much...

240
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,909
How does it look?

241
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,536
I-It looks wonderful!

242
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,871
It's weapons-grade cute!

243
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,456
Yeah! It makes you look a lot
younger!

244
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,542
Y-You don't mean like baby
younger do you?

245
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,880
But it looks intentional like
you meant to cut off that much.

246
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,965
Honest? Do you really mean that?

247
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,220
Its my senior picture...

248
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,056
It'll be with me the rest of my
life...

249
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,599
Hide it! No one will ever know!

250
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,936
Thanks, but doing the forehead
thing is really not my style.

251
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,813
Well, excuse me...

252
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,231
You know, I think it might look
better,

253
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,566
if you tried to brushed it to
the side.

254
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,030
You see? Like that.

255
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,283
Look.

256
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,370
[Yui] Better?

257
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,579
Yep, super cute!

258
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,580
Yeah, it looks great!

259
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,498
Agreed!

260
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,374
You mean it?

261
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,626
Yeah, you look very refined now!

262
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,295
You think so?

263
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,257
Anyway, who's up for tea?

264
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,926
[Mio] I am.
[Tsumugi] I brought Mont Blancs
today!

265
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,219
Mont Blancs?!

266
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,222
Yum!

267
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,563
Here you go.

268
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,648
Really?

269
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:13,074
Wow, you guys really
do enable her, don't you?

270
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,708
Thank you... Everyone!

271
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,854
[Yui] See you tomorrow!

272
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,773
Yep, good night.

273
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,982
See you soon!

274
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,025
[Ritsu] Later!

275
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,485
[Mio] See ya!

276
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,866
Hey, by the way Mio, weren't you
supposed to hand in that
application thing today?

277
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:55,825
Yeah.

278
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,535
So then, what? Did you forgot
it?

279
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,164
Don't you have your own things
to turn in? Like a career plan,
maybe?

280
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,333
Well yeah, but you-

281
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,460
[Mio] I'll hand it in tomorrow.

282
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,679
Good morning, Azusa-chan!

283
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,554
Morning.

284
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,223
[Yui] Good morning everyone...

285
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,601
Senpai? Are you still
bothered by your hair?

286
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,687
I wish I could turn back the
clock...

287
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,063
Just deal with it.

288
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,481
You're acting like a baby.

289
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:30,026
Don't worry about me.
I'll be better eventually.

290
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,861
Yui-chan, if you keep up this
behavior,

291
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,739
there will be no snacks
for you today, young lady!

292
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,202
[Ritsu] What are you, ten?

293
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,336
It's almost your turn.

294
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,006
Okay, you look good.

295
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,465
[Sawako] Miss Akiyama!

296
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,341
Here!

297
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,677
There's nothing to be afraid of!

298
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,846
Right! Give 'em hell!

299
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,681
See you in a jiffy!

300
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,057
[Yui] Mio-chan!

301
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,225
[Tsumugi] You can do it!

302
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,060
Relax, relax!

303
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,604
[Yui] Fight on! Fight on!

304
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,108
Now I'm even more embarrassed...

305
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,485
Just remember to breath, okay?

306
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,340
I guess I'm up next!

307
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,147
Be right back!

308
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,621
[Sawako] Miss Hirasawa!

309
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,122
Sorry.

310
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,585
[Yui] All done!
[Tsumugi] Welcome back!

311
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,587
[Sawako] Oh. Miss Akiyama,

312
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,590
please stop by the staff room
after we're finished.

313
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,842
Yes, ma'am.

314
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,142
[Mio] Sorry to interrupt.

315
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,481
Why did she call you to
the staff room, Mio-chan?

316
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:38,446
You decided not to take
that admissions test, didn't
you?

317
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,282
How'd you know that?

318
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,742
[Ritsu] I figured as much.

319
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,203
It's not your style to forget
to hand in paperwork,

320
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,788
when a teacher asks you for it.

321
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,500
Why would you turn it down,
though? That's a really big
deal!

322
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,337
Uh...well I...

323
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,134
Because to be honest,
I'd rather study with you guys.

324
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,220
And if...if it's at all
possible...

325
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,598
I'd really like to go to
the same college that you all
do.

326
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:09,894
We all go...

327
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,688
To the same college?

328
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,277
[Ritsu] Mm I'm starving!

329
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,486
[Yui] Me too!

330
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:19,821
[Mio] You had a tart earlier.

331
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,197
[Yui] Oops, I forgot!

332
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,199
[Ritsu] Later!

333
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,784
[Yui] Yeah, see ya!

334
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:25,827
[Tsumugi] Bye-bye!

335
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,245
[Azusa] Good night.

336
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,211
[Mio] Ma'am.

337
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,550
What brings the three
of you here all at once?

338
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,678
We've come to hand in
our career plans to you!

339
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,195
All right. Forms accepted.

340
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,197
Yahoo!

341
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,615
[Sawako] Work hard, girls.

342
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,910
I hope everyone of you gets
into that all girls school.

343
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,870
[All three] Thanks!

344
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,040
[Ritsu] Ooh, she finally
accepted them!
[Yui] Did you hear the
good news already?

345
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,458
Let's work hard, okay?

346
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,877
[Ritsu] Of course!
[Yui] But first, let's have some
tea!

347
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,878
[Ritsu] Yeah! Good call!

348
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,297
[Mio] Hey!
[Ritsu] Tea! Tea! Tea!

349
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:25,679
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")

350
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,017
[Yui] "Who"? Like owls?

351
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,144
[Ritsu] Based on my careful
testing of pencils of all types,

352
00:23:56,186 --> 00:24:01,149
Hexy #7 is clearly the top
choice, with its astonishing
60% accuracy rate!

353
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,942
[Mio] Just one problem.

354
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,445
This test actually has
9 multiple choices answers
for each question.

355
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:09,991
[Tsumugi] How about we take
a quick break?
I'll go put on some tea.

356
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,077
[Azusa] What have you been
wishing for?

357
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,913
[Ui] I've been wishing that my
sister and the others all get
into the same college,

358
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,583
and that they all graduate
together without any problems.
