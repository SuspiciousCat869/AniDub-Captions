1
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,673
[Ritsu] C'mon, Mugi, let's go!

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:09,843
I still have to finish my
journal and hand it in,
so go on ahead.

3
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,846
I didn't think you were on
cleaning duty today, Mugi?

4
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:16,850
Well, actually Yui was
supposed to do it, but...

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,435
(snoring)

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,979
She's been sleeping like that
since lunch break.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,313
(frustrated)

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,026
I've been trying to wake her up,
but...

9
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,319
Come on, Yui, you've got to wake
up.

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,613
Hey, Yui! Wake up!

11
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:35,535
It's okay, Ui...
Today's Sunday after all.

12
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,288
That's impressive
positive thinking!

13
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,751
Wake up, Yui! You got shows!
You gotta practice!
You gotta play your guitar!

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,423
Yui, we've got cake...

15
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,267
Liars. No cake.

16
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,813
We're losing her!
Mugi, go get some cake!

17
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,148
[Tsumugi] Roger!

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,858
Miss Tainaka.

19
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,694
Bye, Yamanaka.

20
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,738
Bye Miss Tachibana.

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,700
Could you guys please return
those animal costumes I lent you
a couple weeks ago?

22
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,994
The Drama Club wants
to use them next week.

23
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,037
[Mio] Animal costumes?

24
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,040
Ritsu, you havn't
returned those yet?

25
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,127
Oh, you mean those things?
Let's see what did I do with
them?

26
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,046
[Ritsu] After we used them
for our recruitment drive,

27
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,257
[Ritsu] I put them in
the storeroom.
[Mio] Give them back.

28
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,303
I'm stunned.

29
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,554
I'm so sorry!

30
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,974
Let's see... where did I put
those things?

31
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,603
See? Here they are!

32
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,488
Light Music Club Sandwich...

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,283
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

34
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,089
So because of that, we're going
to do some spring cleaning!

35
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,008
And you can wipe those "I don't
wanna" looks off your faces.

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,470
Right! Let's knuckle down and
practice all-out today!

37
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,598
Yeah, you got it, Ri-chan!
It's Budokan or bust for us!

38
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,059
Wow, you're that opposed to
cleaning up?

39
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,852
C'mon...

40
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,355
[Yui and Ritsu] We hate cleaning
more than we love three meals a
day!

41
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,357
[Mio] That's not how that saying
works!

42
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,901
And anyway, shouldn't
the people who've been assigned,

43
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,655
to Music Room cleaning duty
do all the cleaning in here?
And not us?

44
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,823
Yeah, yeah!

45
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,075
Well normally, that would be
right...

46
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,328
[Mio] But we can't make someone
else clean up a mess,

47
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,580
that's mostly our own personal
belongings.

48
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,542
It's not "mostly",
it's all personal belongings.

49
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,962
Indeed, it is as you say!

50
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,296
That's my froggie!

51
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,382
Guess we'd better
put these away.

52
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,050
I already put this away once...

53
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,428
Don't put them back, darn it!

54
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,972
Okay, let's do this right!

55
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,807
This really is a lot of stuff...

56
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,560
Yes, we've used it as a
"for the time being" storeroom,

57
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,770
for any odds and ends
we were carrying with us.

58
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,232
[Ritsu] That's a lot of odds and
ends. What with this pile of
dolls?

59
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,569
(excited) I scored that big one
over there for just two dollars!

60
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,070
I didn't ask that.

61
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,865
Here you go, take it home.

62
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,116
Okay, I got 'em...

63
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,827
[Ritsu] Wait a minute.
Don't forget this one.

64
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,747
But that one isn't mine.

65
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,623
Then who--

66
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,336
It's yours, Mio?!

67
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,798
I brought this coffee set in
last year, but we never got
around to using it.

68
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,177
Wait a minute, you're gonna
clean out the cupboard, too?

69
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,054
Might as well, we're cleaning,
anyway.

70
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:08,391
[Ritsu] Seeing it all laid out
like that, they sure look
expensive, huh?

71
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,144
How much is this tea set worth,
Mugi-chan?

72
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,772
Well um, I don't know the exact
price,

73
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,359
but I was told that the royal
family of Belgium has the same
set.

74
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,069
Royal family?

75
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,779
Watch it!

76
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,031
(workout chants)

77
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,200
[Ritsu] Well that's most of it.

78
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,285
Yes, but...

79
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,246
There's a lot of personal items
here that don't belong to us.

80
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,459
Perhaps they belonged to the
previous members of the Light
Music Club.

81
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,212
It looks like the earlier clubs
had a lot more membership.

82
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,965
They must have had proper club
activities back then.

83
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,634
[Yui] Look, look!

84
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,302
Ta-dah!

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,054
Look what I found way in the
back!

86
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,306
[Ritsu] Oh! That case looks
expensive!

87
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,143
What sort of treasure
do you think lies within?

88
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,853
[Yui] It's a guitar!

89
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,525
It's kinda old, but it looks
really nice.

90
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,403
[Ritsu] Dang, I was hoping
for something cooler.

91
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,113
Yeah it's pretty lame.

92
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,657
[Azusa] We're the Light Music
Club, how can an instrument be
lame?

93
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,992
My goodness, that really takes
me back.

94
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,119
What do you mean?

95
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,954
So this is where it was...

96
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,748
Is this yours, Miss Yamanaka?

97
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,835
[Sawako] Yes, though
I never really used it much.

98
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,963
Were you a part of the Light
Music Club when you were in
school?

99
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,465
That's right.
Didn't I mention that to you?

100
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,676
I knew it had to be something
like that!

101
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,847
That time you played with us at
the school festival, I thought
you were fantastic!

102
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,181
I'm okay.

103
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,725
I havn't played for a while,

104
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,977
but I guess I'm better than
Yui-chan is right now.

105
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,271
Oh please, you've got to teach
me!

106
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,106
Of course I will!

107
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,985
Hey check this out, this is what
she looked like back in high
school.

108
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,069
I think I'll pass.

109
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,779
How come?!

110
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,199
We're all taking home our own
personal stuff that we've kept
here,

111
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,951
so you can take yours.

112
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,665
<i>Geh! It's musty!</i>

113
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,501
I really don't really have time
to play anymore...

114
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,713
What do you want to do
with your guitar, then?

115
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,342
I want you to sell it, and put
the proceeds in the club fund.

116
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,885
You're so generous!

117
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,802
It's more like-

118
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,179
We're doing her dirty work!

119
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,932
But isn't this an awfully
fancy guitar to be selling?

120
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,394
I got this guitar a long time
ago, from a friend of my father,

121
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:21,149
but if it's this dusty and
moldy, it might not really be
playable anymore.

122
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,610
Besides, if it's in sellable
condition,

123
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:28,656
I'm sure this old guitar would
be a lot happier if it was being
played by someone.

124
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,910
[Yui] It's so musty...

125
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,329
You're so mean, for making me
carry it the whole way!

126
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,957
It's your own fault for losing
three rounds of rock-
paper-scissors!

127
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,418
Come on, you can do it,
Yui-chan!

128
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,713
Yeah but my bag is really heavy
today!

129
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,800
You have no one to blame
but yourself for that.

130
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,761
Really good work, Yui-chan.
It's time for another round.

131
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,264
[Yui] Really? Great!

132
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,975
No way am I losing this time!

133
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:01,106
Alright then, prepare to get
shot down!

134
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,317
[Azusa] You're like a bunch of
children...

135
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,568
[Ritsu] I AM a child!

136
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,737
[Azusa] Let's act like adults,
okay?

137
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,948
[Tsumugi] I can see it! Is
that suppose to be scissors?

138
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,243
[Yui] You're not supposed
to say, Mugi-chan!

139
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,162
Hey C'mon, Mio!

140
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,288
Rock-paper-scissors!

141
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,665
[Mio] Look at this.

142
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,625
You mean that sales ad you
picked up?

143
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,461
[Mio] Would one of these
fit in the prep room?

144
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,963
[Ritsu] A shelf set?

145
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,340
[Mio] I think one of these
would help us organize things.

146
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,175
[Azusa] You're right.

147
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,720
At that price, I think we can
manage with the funds in the
club account.

148
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,309
[Mio] Hm, where's the furniture
section?

149
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,520
Wow! So this is a home center?!

150
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,855
Mugi-chan?

151
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,482
They sell all manner of items
here, right?

152
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:49,154
Like light bulbs in all sizes?
And vinyl tape in all the colors
of the rainbow?

153
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,655
[Mio] Yeah, I guess.

154
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,950
Mugi, this is your first time
in a home center?

155
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:54,868
Mm-hm!

156
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,704
I've always wanted to visit one!

157
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,832
Let's go!

158
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,208
Me, too!

159
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,128
Hey, Yui! The guitar!

160
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,507
[Tsumugi] Oh, my, my, my, my,
my! Amazing!

161
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,384
Look!

162
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,220
It says that this pen will mend
holes in walls and make them as
good as new!

163
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,597
Right.

164
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,641
This makes it super easy
to bind up old magazines!

165
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:22,228
This stuff seems that amazing to
you?

166
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,565
This will restore faucets
to a sparkly, new finish?

167
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,734
[Tsumugi] Will it really?

168
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,155
Mugi-senpai! Look at
what they have up here!

169
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,534
A cake slicer that cuts any cake
into eight neat, equal pieces?

170
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,869
It looks like an umbrella!

171
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,704
Will this really work like it
says?

172
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,082
Guys! Guys! Come over here!

173
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,584
[Yui] Look at this!
Check out all these screws!

174
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,419
[Azusa] You're spazzing out,
too?

175
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,213
These are ALL screws!

176
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,381
Uh-huh...

177
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,590
It's so pretty!

178
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,885
Check it out! I feel so cool!

179
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,804
Wah!

180
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,723
[Azusa] What the heck is that?

181
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,642
A cordless screwdriver!

182
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:01,726
Bang! P-pow!

183
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,977
Quick making noise!

184
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,605
Done! You two are now dead!

185
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,441
Unbelievable...

186
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,361
Unbelievable's right...
Yui, you're such a baby.

187
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,739
Ah! I'm blind!

188
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,032
Take that off!

189
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,493
Please, Miss, stop it, I beg of
you! Stop!

190
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,579
[Mio] Quit playing around
with stuff you aren't going to
buy!

191
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,415
[Yui] Azu-nyan! Azu-nyan!

192
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,833
What is it this time, Yui?

193
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,918
This is really easy to move in!

194
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,128
It's hanging off of you.

195
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,422
Maybe we could us these for a
show!

196
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,466
And we could write
After-school Teatime across the
backs!

197
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,094
You mean like a biker gang?

198
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,097
Thanks. I'm sorry to disturb
you.

199
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,933
Sawa-chan says that
we can keep it in the room.

200
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,643
Okay, that's perfect.

201
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,229
We'll have them deliver it to
the club room after school
tomorrow.

202
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,230
Where are the others?

203
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,982
Oh they're around here
somewhere.

204
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,568
Here comes Mugi!

205
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,736
Sorry to keep you waiting!

206
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,989
Wah! Exactly how much did you
buy?!

207
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,081
[Azusa] A turtle?

208
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,791
Or a terrapin?

209
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,835
Azu-nyan!

210
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,712
What'cha lookin' at?

211
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,006
Cut that out! Don't do that
here!

212
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,928
[Yui] W-What a cute little
terrapin!

213
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,515
Cute? I don't even think it is a
terrapin.

214
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:26,394
Even among terrapins,
this one here is a total babe!

215
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,814
No, I mean it...
It says it's a pig-nosed turtle!

216
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,149
It's a turtle! You see?

217
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,819
It's so cute I wanna stick
peanuts in its nose!

218
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,864
Exactly how are you defining
the word "cute"?

219
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,828
I can't believe I lost four
straight matches after the
store.

220
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,205
Hail the scissors!

221
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,707
[Store clerk] Well, I'm going
to need to appraise it.

222
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,876
[Mio] Please do.

223
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,131
[Mio] What are you looking at?

224
00:11:55,173 --> 00:12:00,637
I was wondering what our band
would sound like if we had this
many members in it?

225
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,891
I know what you mean.
It would be nice if we
had that many people.

226
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,396
[Store clerk] I'm done
with the appraisal, Miss.

227
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,315
Thank you all for your patience.

228
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:17,362
Now about this guitar of yours.
We'll be able to offer you
$5000 for it.

229
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,907
$5000?!

230
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,206
[Yui] K-ON!

231
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,502
Is there a problem?

232
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,255
Thank you it was delicious!

233
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,464
Let's go!

234
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,716
Hold it.

235
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,677
B-But...$50,000!

236
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,054
Calm down. You added a zero
there.

237
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,514
Thank you for all your help.

238
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,350
You're agreeing too quickly!

239
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:53,064
So why is that guitar worth so
much? Is it a favor to Mugi and
her family?

240
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,109
Uh, no, she has nothing to do
with it.

241
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,571
[Clerk] This particular line of
guitars was born in the early
1960s.

242
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,783
At the time, they hadn't
completely pinned down its
materials and shape yet,

243
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:09,497
and it underwent a series of
minor changes until they settled
on its current design.

244
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,710
The guitar that you brought in
has a fingerboard made of
Brazilain Rose wood.

245
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:17,339
A wood that's very rarely found
in a musical instrument these
days.

246
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,800
That's one reason that
it commands such a high price.

247
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:25,513
Unfortunately, the guitar's
tailpiece has been swapped out
with a replacment.

248
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,558
Since it's not a full original,
that lowers its value somewhat,

249
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,811
but the playability of this
particular tailpiece is
superior,

250
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:36,900
and since many customers favor
that type, that hardly counts
against it at all.

251
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:41,321
Plus, this guitar appears to
have been in kept in its case
for a long time,

252
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,074
so there are no scratches
or any fret warping.

253
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,534
For a guitar its age,
it is in excellent condition,

254
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,913
and that's why we're
offering such a high price.

255
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,125
A-Anyway, it's a very rare
guitar!

256
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,462
[Ritsu] Look at that stack!

257
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,339
What? It's just a special
burger.

258
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,509
I'm not talking about the
burger.

259
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,636
Isn't that an awful lot of
french fries?

260
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:09,265
Hey, we're loaded to the gills,
now! So I ordered us the extra
large size!

261
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,809
Keep the change!

262
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,018
You used the money?!

263
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,312
'Course not,
I paid for all of this myself.

264
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,732
But are you sure it's okay for
us to split it amongst
ourselves?

265
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,945
Well what else can we do?
Sawa-chan said that we should
put it in the club fund.

266
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,321
Oink oink!

267
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,656
Yeah but I-

268
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,575
Look! Five grand, split 5 ways
is a thousand each!

269
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:33,623
There's a guitar effects pedal
that I've been wanting
for awhile...

270
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,624
There you see?

271
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,292
Azu-nyan's given in...

272
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,254
Idiot! Don't wave that
huge wad of cash around!

273
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,424
You see this? A thousand
of it is yours, Mio.

274
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,301
A thousand, huh?

275
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,303
Gee with that much...I could...

276
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,973
Get a fantastic state of the art
multi-base amp simulator

277
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,891
and a brand new amplifier...

278
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:56,229
I'd get cool new twin base pedal
and maybe a new floor tom to
round out my kit?

279
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,648
How's this Yui, is this okay?

280
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,400
No harder!

281
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,864
Um, are you guys okay?

282
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,116
Over here! Hi!

283
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,287
Wow! It's perfect!

284
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,581
It's all neat and tidy now, huh?

285
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,374
Yeah.

286
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,879
Yui.

287
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,882
We all agreed to take home
our personal belongings.

288
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,178
But I've got all this stuff left
even after everything I took
home yesterday!

289
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,473
If I take any more,
Ui's gonna get mad real at me!

290
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,059
Yeah well if you leave it here,
I'M gonna get mad at you!

291
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,645
But Ui's so scary! yesterday,
she--

292
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,980
Out.

293
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:42,108
Oh Ui please forgive me!

294
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,194
It's like she doesn't know
SHE's the older sister!

295
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:49,366
I promise I'll clean them out
later, just let me keep them
here a little longer!

296
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,368
Oh, all right. But just those,
got it?

297
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,954
What the heck are you doing,
Ritsu?!

298
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,915
(door opens)
[Sawako] Hello!

299
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,877
So did the shelves arrive?

300
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,546
Hey, that looks great!

301
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,970
What's the matter?
I said hi but you didn't say
anything.

302
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:19,771
Goodness, Sawa-chan! There you
are! Sorry I didn't hear you
come it!

303
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,815
So guys, how'd it go yesterday?

304
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,108
Ah! Yesterday?

305
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,527
Yes with my guitar.
How much did you get for it?

306
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:30,532
Oh! That! Um, I forget.
How much did we get for it?

307
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,492
Oh, I think it was...

308
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:36,579
Well, it was pretty old you
know, and being over 50 and all
affected its value.

309
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,664
Really?

310
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,790
Oh, my! Does that mean,

311
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,750
that you're in your fifties,
Sawa-chan?!

312
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,502
You can tell us!

313
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,547
How many women in their fifties
are as hot and nubile as THIS?!

314
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,798
We didn't mean it!

315
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,925
We're sorry! We're sorry!

316
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,970
I told you that I got it from
a friend of my father, remember?

317
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,513
Oh, right I forgot.

318
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,599
Now then, how much money
did you get for it?

319
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,310
Well, it was around...

320
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,480
a hundred dollars.

321
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,274
<i>Ritsu!</i>

322
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,442
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

323
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,152
<i>We're being way too greedy!</i>

324
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,570
<i>Sorry, it slipped out!</i>

325
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:12,157
Yeah well I figured as much.
It was moldy, after all.

326
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,491
(breath of relief)

327
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,494
Alright, why don't
you give me the sale ticket?

328
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,871
Beg pardon?

329
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:22,167
I need the reciept so
I can ear mark it, for the club.

330
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,461
Don't tell me that you
didn't get a receipt!

331
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,005
No, um...

332
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,091
Oh, you have it right there?

333
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,184
<i>She ate it! Our hero!</i>

334
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,604
Chow down! Chow down!
Chow down! Chow down!

335
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,190
What are you doing?!
Spit that out this instant!

336
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,816
Forget it!

337
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,194
Spit it out RIGHT NOW.

338
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,571
Plegh!

339
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,076
No way! It was worth $5000?

340
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,619
That's amazing!

341
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,954
They said that it was extremely
rare!

342
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,289
Forgive me!

343
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,249
I didn't mean to lie about it
and hide it from you,

344
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,253
but the vast sum of money turned
my head around and I just
couldn't help myself!

345
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,255
She's easily corruptible.

346
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,965
She's always been this way.

347
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,550
You two don't have any right to
talk!

348
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,553
Okay, then. I'll go ahead
and donate the $100,

349
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,639
that Ritsu mentioned to
the Light Music Club account.

350
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,975
Consider the rest as going
to pay for those shelves.

351
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,811
Aw you mean that's all?!

352
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,523
I would've given you the whole
thing if you'd come clean in the
first place.

353
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,566
You're lying about that, I know
it!

354
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,696
This whole mess is your fault,
Ritsu. That's what you get for
trying to hide it.

355
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,532
She's right! I told you
we should have just come out,

356
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,742
and told her the truth
from the very begining!

357
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,827
Oh yeah? As if!

358
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,787
Please Sawa-chan!

359
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,622
I have one last request!

360
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:47,210
Please slap me with the wad of
bills! Slap me in the face
really hard!

361
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,922
Now I'm happy...

362
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:54,843
Your in your own happy
world, must be nice.

363
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,678
Oh well, all right.

364
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,390
I've decided to use a portion of
this money to buy one thing for
you guys.

365
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,641
You really mean it?

366
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,853
Talk it over and decide
what it is you all want.

367
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,563
So one thing, huh?

368
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,941
I say that you make it five
things, and not just one!

369
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,443
Don't push your luck.

370
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,863
Ow.

371
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:21,369
I guess an amp is the thing
we need the most of all.

372
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:25,540
Personally, I think we could use
a guitar effects pedal a lot
more than an amp.

373
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,960
Maybe, but neither of those
things is something all of us
can use.

374
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,545
[Yui] Oo!
[Mio] What is it?

375
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,839
Why don't we just buy
another cute little froggie?

376
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,842
If we had two, I bet we'd get
more members for the club!

377
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,969
[Frog] Welcome to the club!
[Girl] It's so cute!

378
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,721
Wah...

379
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,682
[Tennis coach] When you grip the
handle, just don't hold it too
tightly.

380
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,893
Hit the ball with your whole
body.

381
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:48,772
If you only hit with your hand,
you'll hurt your wrist or elbow.
Got it?

382
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,814
[Tennis players] Got it!

383
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,858
Well it looks like all the other
clubs,

384
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,278
have their new members in place
and are getting down to work.

385
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,739
Guess so.

386
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,494
[Yui] Azu-nyan's lonely?

387
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,912
Mm-hm.

388
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,164
I know she said that she
was okay with the five of us,

389
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,208
but I know she wants a kouhai.

390
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,919
The very same thing had occurred
to me.

391
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,962
You know, I was thinking that
too.

392
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:18,051
Yeah, remember how happy we were
when Azu-nyan joined our club?

393
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:22,180
That settles it, then. Here
goes!

394
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:26,810
One of you new students...
Help me to the music room
please!

395
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,228
You tried that already.

396
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,938
What do we do, then?!

397
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,523
(thinking)

398
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,860
I have a great idea!

399
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,571
Hm...

400
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,538
What's this doing here?

401
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,125
Meet Ton-chan, he's our brand
new member!

402
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,002
We asked Sawa-chan to buy him
for you!

403
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:55,505
This is your new kouhai.
So be good to each other!

404
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,055
You know, I was expecting
a bigger reaction, weren't you?

405
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,307
Mm-hm.

406
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:10,270
You were the one who said that
Azusa would like this turtle,
Yui.

407
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,773
But Azu-nyan was staring at him
like she wanted him really
badly.

408
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,567
[Azusa] You were the one
who was staring at it, not me.

409
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:20,530
I was just looking because
I thought it had a really
strange face.

410
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,742
Man we really blew it.

411
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,244
Uh Yui?

412
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,664
What made you decide to do this?

413
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,332
Well...

414
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,669
We thought you might be lonely
because you didn't have a
kouhai.

415
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,504
That's why.

416
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,215
So we bought a new member for
you...

417
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,310
It must stink to become
someone's pet,

418
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,729
because they jumped
to the wrong conclusion.

419
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,358
Wow it nodded!

420
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,234
That was so cute!

421
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:02,822
Don't you worry. I'm going to
take real good care of you from
now on, okay?

422
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,867
[Yui] Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'm going to take care
of him too!

423
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,371
[Azusa] It's too much
responsibility for you, Yui!

424
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,499
[Yui] Aw come on! It is not!

425
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:24,928
(closing song, "Listen!!")

426
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,144
[Yui] He's so cute...

427
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,230
[Ritsu] Listen to me ever since
Sawa-chan became our homeroom
teacher,

428
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,399
hasn't it seemed like her
skin's been glowing,

429
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,276
and her hair's been soft and
shiny?!

430
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,320
It's like she's blossoming or
something!

431
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,947
I wanna shine like her, too!

432
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,533
[Tsumugi] Heh. He looked at you,
Yui-chan!

433
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:13,953
[Ui] That's bad manners you
know.

434
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:17,457
It's okay, I'm thinking about
how we can make Ri-chan shine,

435
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,876
even when she's
sitting in the dark.
