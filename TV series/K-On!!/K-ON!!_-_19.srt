1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,468
Thank you for shopping with us.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,347
Thank you for-

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,267
They have it, Jun. This is the
kind of tea they wanted, right?

4
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,395
[Jun] Let's go with that for
now. Oh, and we need sugar, too.

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,938
[Azusa] Why don't you go, get us
a basket?

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,606
[Jun] Okay.
[Old Woman] Excuse me.

7
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,066
[Azusa] Let's see, we're also
suppose to get toothpicks,
right?

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,484
[Cashier] Oh, yes
I'm sorry, ma'am!

9
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,194
[Azusa] We need these, please.

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,071
Yeah, sure thing, miss.

11
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,240
We'll also need
a receipt, please.

12
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,618
And you can make it out to
Sakuragaoka Girls' High School,

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,579
Class 2-1 festival fund.

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,708
Oh yeah, and under "Comments,"
please put "Tea supply for
mock coffee shop."

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,422
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

16
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,098
[Azusa] Do you think we
should've bought more milk
while we were there?

17
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,768
No, we should probably wait
until we run out again.

18
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,062
I can't believe how hectic
it is today...

19
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,775
The first day is always that
way. Besides, that's what
makes it so much fun.

20
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,153
[Jun] Something wrong?

21
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,699
<i>Is the Light Music Club show</i>
Oh, sorry about that.

22
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,160
<i>[Azusa] tomorrow gonna go</i>
<i>alright?</i>
[Jun] Let's get back to
the classroom.

23
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,631
(minor freak out)

24
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,467
Look the paint is peeling!

25
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,302
Don't worry. I think
that should be just fine.

26
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,387
[Girl 2] This area here
is the problem.
[Girl 3] Hey wait I forget,

27
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,306
[Girl 3] is the right color
for this spot?
[Girl 4] Where did the
prop dagger go?

28
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,891
[Girl 5] Yeah, yeah, sure.
[Girl2] Romeo!

29
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,561
Um, my line...

30
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,900
You broke my concentration, and
now I've forgotten every single
one of my lines!

31
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:17,697
O Romeo! Romeo!
Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?

32
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,618
O! Uh...um I...

33
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,205
O, speak again...

34
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,375
speak again...bright angel?

35
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,293
Why are you getting yourself all
tensed up again NOW?

36
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,963
[Yui] Granny, my nice neighbor
lady told me that whenever you
get nervous,

37
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,883
you should write the word
"pumpkin" on your palms and then
swallow it!

38
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,802
I think you might
have heard that wrong.

39
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,847
Yui. I think she meant, "Imagine
the audience members are all
pumpkins".

40
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,891
Really? You think so?

41
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,185
You swallow the character
for "people."

42
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,728
[Mio] Pu-um...

43
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,271
...p-kin.

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,694
What are you? Mio!

45
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,366
Oh man, she tried
to swallow it for real...

46
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,535
Does anyone know if
all the costumes ready?

47
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,246
Miss Yamanaka was in charge
of costumes, right?

48
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,873
She said that she was going
to lock herself in the sewing
room

49
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,208
and work all night.

50
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,501
Has anybody seen her?

51
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,044
I'll go check on her!

52
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,462
Okay, thanks a lot Chika!

53
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,297
[Tsumugi] Is this all of the
props?

54
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,341
[Girl 1] I didn't see Romeo's
dagger.

55
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,718
[Girl 2] Mio!

56
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,095
[Mio] Please, don't talk to me
right now!

57
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,264
Look you've got it right there,
Mugi!

58
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,557
[Yui] Hey, now!

59
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,058
[Tsumugi] All that's left
now is the lighting,

60
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,226
[Tsumugi] and sound effects.
[Girl 3] Don't touch it yet!

61
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,144
[Girl 3] The paint isn't dry!

62
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,271
They look pretty hectic...

63
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,898
[Ui] Thank you for coming!

64
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,483
[Azusa] I'm here!

65
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,736
Welcome back, Azusa-chan.

66
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,738
How did things look in my
sister's class?

67
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,616
They looked pretty busy, so I
just turned around and left
without bothering them.

68
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,910
Yeah, their play is this
afternoon.

69
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,414
Hey, how long are you two gonna
keep goofing off out there?

70
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,623
Oh, I'm sorry!

71
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,751
[Jun] You go ahead and
handle the kitchen, Ui.

72
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,585
[Ui] Okay, sure.

73
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,086
[Jun] Azusa, you handle this.

74
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,588
[Azusa] No problem.

75
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,424
Wow, I'm beat...

76
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,593
Finally time for a break...

77
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,345
Those crepes look delicious!

78
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,180
You're pretty energetic.

79
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,183
[Ui] Oh wow. That one
looks interesting!
[Hawker] Step right up!

80
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,559
[Azusa] Mammoth Meat?

81
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,354
Wow, Class 2 really went
all-out!

82
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,064
Their costumes are cute, too...

83
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,609
[Jun] They're doing pictures,
too. They thought of everything.

84
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,195
The costumes at the mammoth
booth sure were cute.

85
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,739
I hear that Miss Yamanaka
made all of theirs,

86
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,533
plus Class 3's vampire cafe
costumes.

87
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,620
<i>[Azusa] Miss Yamanaka</i>
<i>did all that? Just exactly...</i>

88
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,455
...how spread thin are you?

89
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,457
[Nodoka] Ma'am? Are you all
right?

90
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:38,046
[Sawako] Yes... I spread myself
a little too thin this year, but
I'll manage.

91
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,549
Because every costume
I make is a labor of love!

92
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,970
Mio-chan, you look amazing!

93
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,305
Come on, don't stare!

94
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,973
[Ritsu] Begging your pardon,
good sirs!

95
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,810
[Tsumugi] Oh, you're
super cute, too, Ri-chan!

96
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,520
[Ritsu] Right?

97
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,439
[Yui] Yeah, but I still think
it's kinda weird, you playing
Juliet!

98
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,233
If we did a survey,

99
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,653
I think that 100 of 100 people
would say that YOU are the weird
one here.

100
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,738
Alright, I need all the actors!

101
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,739
Okay!

102
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,825
Come on, you. Let's go.

103
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,453
[Nodoka] Our Romeo is
being henpecked by Juliet...

104
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,541
Look at that crowd!

105
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,336
[Yui] It's already a full house!

106
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,173
Hey, look, isn't that
Mio's fan club over there?

107
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,050
Hey Nodoka-chan,

108
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,804
is it true that Sokabe-senpai is
going to be coming to see our
show tomorrow?

109
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,515
Yep, she sent me a message
saying she couldn't wait to see
it.

110
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:35,770
All right, let's all go out
there and nail this play
everybody!

111
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,939
[Announcer] And now, a
performance of...

112
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,025
[Mifuyu] Guys, this is
the moment we've...
[Announcer]
Romeo and Juliet by Class 3-2.

113
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,527
[Mifuyu] all worked really hard
for. So let's give it all we've
got!

114
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,196
Let's have no regrets!

115
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,990
Is everybody ready?

116
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,368
Ow!

117
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,830
[Mifuyu] Okay!
Then let's break a leg out
there!

118
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,540
[Class] Yeah!

119
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,836
The auditorium is packed
already!

120
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,797
Are there any seats left?

121
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,425
<i>[Azusa] Towards the end,</i>
<i>the others hardly ever came by,</i>

122
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,886
<i>the club room to practice for</i>
<i>our show.</i>

123
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,680
<i>Do they even care about it</i>
<i>anymore?</i>

124
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,140
[Sawa] Azusa-chan!

125
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:12,932
Yes?

126
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,018
Come on! Over here! Hurry!

127
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,188
<i>[Azusa] No, I shouldn't</i>
<i>think things like that.</i>

128
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,023
Sorry about that.

129
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,234
(buzzer buzzing)

130
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,072
<i>[Azusa] I mean, after all,</i>
<i>this is their very last school</i>
<i>festival.</i>

131
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,159
<i>I just need to keep my fingers</i>
<i>crossed and hope their play</i>
<i>goes well.</i>

132
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:39,334
O he jests at scars that
have never felt a wound.

133
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,546
If thou wishest then laugh.
For I have known pain!

134
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:48,093
The pain of being lost in love!
I know this sweet ache in my
bosom well!

135
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,096
So do the trees in this play
really need to have faces?

136
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,182
It's better not question these
things.

137
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,477
Didst thou hear a sound
encroaching on the night?

138
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,646
What manner of scoundrel has
found his...

139
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,315
[Jun] I'm on the edge
of my seat.
[Eri] ...way into the
Capulet orchard?

140
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,483
Yeah...

141
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,902
<i>[Azusa] Me too, but for another</i>
<i>reason.</i>

142
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:10,115
<i>I'm terrified that Yui-senpai</i>
<i>might screw everything up!</i>

143
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,327
O Romeo, wherefore art thou
Romeo?

144
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,621
O, speak again, bright angel!

145
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,291
How camest thou hither?
Tell me, and wherefore,

146
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,003
the orchard walls are high
and hard to climb!

147
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,672
With love's light wings did
I o'er-perch these walls;

148
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,091
For stony limits cannot hold
love out!

149
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,093
O, Romeo!

150
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,886
My fair Juliet!

151
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,357
Stop messing around!

152
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,151
I'm not just keep going!

153
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,444
Romeo!

154
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,529
Fair Juliet!

155
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,992
My heart's pounding a mile a
minute!

156
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:54,868
Mine is too...

157
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,786
<i>[Azusa] So is mine...</i>

158
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,250
<i>...but not because of the</i>
<i>story!</i>

159
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,878
Within the infant rind
of this small flower...

160
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,838
[Nodoka] Good job holding it in,
Yui.

161
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,424
[Chika] Two such opposed kings
encamp them still in man as well
as herbs, grace...

162
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,552
You would have ruined the whole
play if you had let go with a
sneeze out there.

163
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,013
[Mio] Good marrow, Father.
[Ritsu] I mean, "Forsooth!

164
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,307
[Yui] Ri-chan, you're still in
character!

165
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,558
[Ritsu] What's wrong with that?

166
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,560
I'm staying in character
until the play is over!

167
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,520
It's all going smoothly so far.

168
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,565
Mio-chan seems to be getting
into the swing of things, too.

169
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,234
My heart's dear love is set on
hers.

170
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,820
[Mio] But this I pray, that
thou consent to marry us to-day.

171
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,364
[Chizuru] It's gone!

172
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,534
[Chizuru] The tombstone prop
for the final graveyard scene!

173
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,036
I don't see it anywhere!

174
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,790
Is she whom thy didst love,
so soon forsaken?

175
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,880
K-ON!

176
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,841
In his wisdom,

177
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,553
her father hastes our marriage
to stop the inundation
of her tears.

178
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,348
It wasn't in our
classroom, either!

179
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,310
Well, if it wasn't in there
then, it means that it must have
been dropped somewhere,

180
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,063
along the way when
it was being delivered here.

181
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,190
Could we do it without
a tombstone?

182
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:11,945
But the graveyard scene is the
climax of Romeo and Juliet! We
need to have it!

183
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,073
Right. I really don't
want to this halfway.

184
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,450
What if we made one now?!

185
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,536
There's no way we would
finish it on time.

186
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,787
What if we borrowed one
from a class

187
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,914
that's doing a haunted house
for the festival?

188
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,333
Japanese graves are different.

189
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,543
[Shizuka] Wait a minute,

190
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,378
I think I remember seeing
something that,

191
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,381
looked like a tombstone
at the Occult Club's display.

192
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,882
I have a friend in that club,

193
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,467
so I'm going to go and ask
if we can borrow for the play!

194
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,802
What about your part?

195
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,512
Yui! You do it!

196
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,805
You can count on me!

197
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,557
I'll go with her and make sure
it'll work!

198
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,102
Are you going to be able to
memorize your lines in time?

199
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,814
[Yui] Nodoka-chan!
Quick I need a script!

200
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,274
Calm don, Yui. It's alright.

201
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,611
Yeah, don't worry,
you don't actually have any
lines.

202
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,325
If I may trust the
flattering truth of sleep,

203
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,871
my dreams presage
some joyful news at hand.

204
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,706
She's playing a different tree.

205
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,292
A double tree role?

206
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:11,087
[Occult club member] This is not
a tombstone, this is a Rosetta
Stone,

207
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,548
inscribed with various ancient
languages.

208
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,302
The text is mostly words of
praise for Epiphanies
Eucharistos

209
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,847
of ancient Egypt's Ptolemaic
dynasty.

210
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,811
[Occult club member] We would be
happy to lend it to you, though.
If you need it.

211
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,896
[Both] Oh thank you!

212
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,106
We'll bring it back in a few
minutes!

213
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,860
[Chika] Who bare my letter,
then, to Romeo?

214
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,946
By my brother hood, unhappy
fortune!

215
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,866
We'll never make it!

216
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,286
We got it!

217
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,331
Okay, let's all get to work now!

218
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,086
They seem like they're
a little bit frazzled.

219
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,339
I wonder if everything's okay?

220
00:11:54,381 --> 00:12:00,220
Ah, dear and darling Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair?

221
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:06,601
I will stay with thee, and never
from the palace of night depart
again.

222
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:11,398
Here will I remain with worms
that are thy chamber-maids!

223
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,157
Looks like we're going to
make it without any foul-ups!

224
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,367
Yes...

225
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,870
O Romeo!

226
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,791
O churl! Drunk all, and left no
friendly drop to help me after?

227
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,168
O happy dagger!

228
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,588
This is thy sheath;
there rust, and let me die!

229
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,173
<i>Oh, wow...</i>

230
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,635
<i>It's almost like,</i>
<i>Mio-senpai and Ritsu-senpai,</i>

231
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,054
<i>are really Romeo and Juliet.</i>

232
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,807
<i>They must have rehearsed</i>
<i>like crazy.</i>

233
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:49,978
<i>It's no wonder they didn't have</i>
<i>time to come to the music room.</i>

234
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,064
<i>[Azusa] But still...</i>

235
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,192
<i>It's like they've really</i>
<i>forgotten all about the</i>
<i>Light Music Club!</i>

236
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,154
Wow Azusa, it really
moved you that much?

237
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,021
Honey, we're home!

238
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,898
Boy, I am totally beat!

239
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,858
[Tsumugi] You two were
really terrific!

240
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,069
See? Practice makes perfect!

241
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,323
[Yui] Azu-nyan!

242
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,950
So what did you think?!
How was our play?!

243
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,162
Well, um...

244
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,081
What's this?
Are you feeling lonely,

245
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,583
because we haven't been
hanging out with you lately?

246
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,127
No, of course I'm not!

247
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,587
It's...

248
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:01,758
Well, you haven't been coming to
the club room much lately.

249
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,511
And that's made me
worried that, well...

250
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,139
that you don't care about
our show anymore.

251
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,433
Azusa...

252
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,436
I-I'm so sorry! I know that
you've been really busy with
your play and all.

253
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,730
I mean if you want to put
on such a great play,

254
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,983
you can't do it without
tons of rehearsing, right?

255
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,654
Geez, sometimes you're
such a dummy.

256
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:26,199
We do care about the Light Music
Club. More than anything
in the world.

257
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,452
We're sorry for making you
worry, Azusa.

258
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,496
You mean it?

259
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,997
They're right, Azu-nyan!

260
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,543
As for me, I think about you
all day long, every single day!

261
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,169
Think about me a little less!

262
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,756
Right! We're gonna sleep here
and practice for tomorrow's
show!

263
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,134
[Mio] Is it okay to spend
the night at school?

264
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,011
[Ritsu] Not a problem!

265
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,680
[Tsumugi] Even if we didn't
bring any supplies for us to
sleep over with?

266
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,015
[Ritsu] No problem!

267
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,142
Can I have all the refills
of rice that I want?!

268
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,227
[Ritsu] All you want!
Wait, what?

269
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:58,189
[Sawako] Girls, I have
sleeping bags for you all.

270
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,858
See?

271
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,028
Thanks, Sawa-chan! Are you
pulling another all-nighter
tonight?

272
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:07,449
Yeah, I still haven't finished
all of your costumes for the
show tomorrow.

273
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,244
I have to lock myself in
the sewing room again.

274
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:15,582
By the way, no peeking, promise?

275
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,125
Just like The Crane Wife...

276
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,502
Okay, commence practicing!

277
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,795
[Girls] Yeah!

278
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:27,344
(Light Music Club practicing
"Fuwa Fuwa Time!")

279
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:31,056
Sounds like Sis and the others
are practicing really hard...

280
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,020
[Ritsu] Yum!

281
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:41,775
There's plenty more where those
came from, so please eat all you
want, everyone.

282
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,611
[Yui] Ui, these are so good!

283
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,863
We've already arranged
for a really great dessert,

284
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:50,367
so you're more than welcome
to join us if you want, Ui-chan.

285
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,993
Really? Can I?

286
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,870
[Ui] Thank you very much!
[Mio] No sweets before
bedtime...

287
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:58,208
It's all right, Mio. Tonight it
doesn't matter at hour we eat
our cake.

288
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:02,212
For you see,
we're not going to bed at all!

289
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,380
We're not going to sleep?

290
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,382
Of course not! With school
festivals,

291
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,385
it's all about staying up
all night to get ready!

292
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,262
I won't let you fall asleep,
little kitty!

293
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,098
[Azusa] Please leave me out of
it.

294
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,557
[Yui] Meanie!

295
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,685
(knock on the door)

296
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,563
Staying here overnight is fine,
but have you submitted the
proper form?

297
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,274
I forgot all about it!

298
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,653
I'll give you a copy, then.

299
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,696
The application!

300
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,989
[Ritsu] Oh you're awesome,
Nodoka!

301
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,033
Thank you so much, Nodoka-chan!

302
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,369
[Ui] We have plenty of food.
Please have one.

303
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,871
Thank you that's very kind.

304
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,582
[Ui] Are there a lot of students
staying up all night to get
ready?

305
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,669
Yes. Even though it's the second
day, there are quite a few.

306
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:47,090
Why do you suppose so many
people wait until the last
minute to get ready?

307
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,467
I'm sure that some of
them do it deliberately.

308
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,554
I mean, staying up all night
is kind of fun, isn't it?

309
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,640
Alright, who are you, and
what have you done with Nodoka?

310
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,018
Well, I'M going home, anyway.

311
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,062
[Jun] Azusa, let's go home-

312
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,774
So Jazz Club isn't staying up
all night?

313
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,777
[Jun] What, the Light Music Club
is?

314
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,946
I'm so jealous!

315
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,323
No fair! It's just not fair!

316
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,368
[Ritsu] Okay, the amp's
staying off from now on.

317
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,287
[Tsumugi] What will you do
for drums?

318
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,790
[Ritsu] I'll just pile these
all up like this, and presto!

319
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,625
I've got myself and instant drum
kit!

320
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,503
[Mio] Don't pile up
our textbooks!

321
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,679
[Ritsu] You should have seen us,

322
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,765
we were so freaked out when
we couldn't find the tombstone!

323
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,726
I thought we were going to
practice straight through the
night until morning.

324
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:43,772
[Ritsu] We need a change of
pace. Clear out the cobwebs, you
know?

325
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,607
[Mio] Azusa?

326
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,361
Boy it looks like there are a
lot of students in there who are
still awake.

327
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,945
[Ritsu] Hey, you know,
come to think of it,

328
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,240
we were rushing around all day
getting ready for the play.

329
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,451
We didn't get a chance to see
anything.

330
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,078
Then this is the perfect time!

331
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,456
Why don't we go around and look
at the student festival at
night?

332
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:05,418
That's a great idea!
Let's do some exploring!

333
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,128
[Yui] Guys! Come look at this!

334
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,339
Their meat is mammoth!

335
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:12,008
That's really elaborate.

336
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,468
I had some for lunch.

337
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,552
How was it?

338
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,845
[Yui] Oou!

339
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,473
So what kind of meat have
you found this time?

340
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:22,060
[Yui] It's Juliet's grave stone!

341
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,563
Somebody must've thought
it belonged to this stand,

342
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,941
so they delivered it here by
mistake.

343
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,818
Well, it does fit in here...

344
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,862
[Tsumugi] Oh, hey! Why don't we
go and share some of the great
food,

345
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,573
that Ui-chan brought for
us tonight with the Occult Club?

346
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,868
[Ritsu] Good idea.
We can thank them for helping
us.

347
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,663
[Ritsu] What's the matter?
Are you scared, Mio?

348
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,997
[Mio] I-I am not!

349
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,001
[Yui] Come on, we'll be fine!
Let's go!

350
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,711
[Yui] Looks like they're still
up.

351
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,838
[Azusa] I wonder what kind of
presentation they're getting
ready?

352
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:53,133
[Ritsu] Some kind of
bloodcurdling ritual, you
suppose?

353
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,676
(knock on the door)

354
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,511
Hello?

355
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,390
Come in.

356
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,393
Thank you all.

357
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,729
If you like to, please come
to our discussion,

358
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,898
on cattle mutilations
tomorrow. It'll be fun.

359
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,692
[Yui] Sure!
[Ritsu] We're there!

360
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:14,988
Just so long as we don't
get abducted ourselves...

361
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,200
Thank you, we'd be honored if
you would come see our show
tomorrow, too.

362
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,494
[Ritsu] Mio's gonna get abducted
on stage!

363
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,537
[Mio] I am not!

364
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,414
[Yui] You're so lucky, Mio-chan!

365
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,249
Wait a minute are you jealous?

366
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,043
[Tsumugi] What are alien
abductions?

367
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,753
[Ritsu] Are you blind?

368
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,547
[Ritsu] We even managed
to make friends with

369
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,007
the girls of the Occult Club at
the end.

370
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,885
You know, school festivals
really are the best!

371
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,345
I know what you mean.

372
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,388
[Yui] There's still some
onigiri left in the box.

373
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,433
Shall we take them over to
Sawa-chan?

374
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,518
But she made us promise not to
peek.

375
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,687
[Yui] If we peek,
she'll fly back to the moon!

376
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,274
[Ritsu] Hey, you got the wrong
fairy tale!

377
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,068
Is it really all that funny?

378
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,987
Is it me, or do you get kinda
wound up when you're at school
at night?

379
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,199
I know, I know! I'm itching
to get into mischief!

380
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,451
Mischief...

381
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,204
Mischief...

382
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,750
Can I help you with something?

383
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,502
Not really.

384
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,878
Everyone's totally snapped.

385
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,255
All right, let's write
a new song right now!

386
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,466
You've snapped, too, Mugi?

387
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,718
I wanna do My Protracted Love
for You!

388
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,429
No way, it's gonna be
School My School Bag!

389
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,931
No, My Protracted Love for You!

390
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,600
[Mio] In that case, let's do
The Raccoon Stole My Heart!

391
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,353
What do you mean, "In that
case"?

392
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,981
Azusa's finally snapped, too?

393
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,777
No it's just really, really
late. I think it's about time we
all called it a-

394
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:39,447
But I still haven't had any
yakisoba...

395
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,366
I really like yakisoba.

396
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,450
[Mio] She's already asleep.

397
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:43,410
[Ritsu] That was fast.

398
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,620
[Azusa] Okay then, lights out.

399
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:46,996
[Yui] Oh, my!

400
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,958
[Ritsu] Show me all you have
and I shall be avenged!

401
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,584
(laughter)
[Mio] Quiet down, Ritsu!

402
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,170
[Ritsu] Why are you singling me
out?!

403
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,631
Have at you!

404
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,174
Fine, whatever.

405
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,321
<i>Tomorrow?</i>

406
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,450
<i>Let's give it all we've got.</i>

407
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:33,918
[Sawako] Girls! I've finished
your costumes for the show!

408
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,382
Oh, come on...

409
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,509
Hey! Wake up!

410
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:45,555
Don't ignore me!
That hurts more than anything!

411
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:51,561
Sorry, Sawa-chan... We're too
groggy to work up a decent
comeback for you...

412
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:57,567
But I worked so hard all night,
just to make these for you!

413
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,195
Wow!

414
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,946
It's so cute!

415
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,239
Sawa-chan, that's great!

416
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,575
[Ritsu] Good job, Sawa-chan!

417
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,120
Is this... what it feels like?!

418
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,413
Praise me more!

419
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,998
[Yui] Good job, Sawa-chan!
[Sawako] More! More!

420
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,958
[Ritsu] Good job, Sawako!
[Sawako] More praise!

421
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,378
[Ritsu] Good job, Sawako!

422
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:25,512
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")

423
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,312
[Ritsu] Well? Should we head
over there?

424
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,064
[Yui] It'll be okay, Mio-chan!

425
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,940
[Tsumugi] Just remember
our special training!

426
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,359
[Mio] You're right.

427
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,778
[Azusa] Just play like you
always do.
[Mio] Okay.

428
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,488
[Ritsu] You guys ready to rock?!

429
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:07,489
[Girls] Yeah!

430
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,449
[Tsumugi] Another live show for
us!

431
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,450
[Girls] Yeah!

432
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,910
[Azusa] Our best gig ever!

433
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:12,869
[Girls] Yeah!

434
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,162
[Yui] And then we get to
eat cake!

435
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,122
[Girl] Yeah! Huh?
