1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:08,550
[Tsumugi] Finland this year
is gonna be really fun...

2
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,477
Huh?

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,733
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

4
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,908
[Sawako] The first thing in
the morning is homeroom.

5
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,995
Which means that I'm teaching
back-to-back classes from
first to third period.

6
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:05,583
Over lunch break, I took a
student home who had collapsed
from anemia.

7
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,086
And in fifth period,
I patrolled the campus,

8
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,921
looking for students
who were skipping class.

9
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,384
After school, I've been
supervising the Brass Band
Club's practices,

10
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,969
because they have a competition
soon.

11
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,763
[Yui] Ah, that's why
you're soaking your feet.

12
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,181
Yep.

13
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,183
Who can blame you,
you've been up on your feet all
day.

14
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,269
Have you tried orthopedic
sandals?

15
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,107
No, I can't. Even the freshmen
think of me as an elegant,
ladylike teacher.

16
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,984
Hmm...

17
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,069
Have you ever thought about
coming clean about your Light
Music Club past?

18
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,781
You know, you just say
"I used to be like this!"

19
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,450
Never! Gimme that!

20
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,243
You just don't know what it's
like.

21
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,705
In education, showing the
slightest weakness can lead to
catastrophe.

22
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,332
If they ever learned of my
past...

23
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,627
Um, you're interrupting, please
stop it.

24
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,296
Up yours!

25
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,923
You used to be exactly like this
back when you were in high
school.

26
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,633
Ain't that right?

27
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,968
(laughter)

28
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,345
...that's what would happen!

29
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,472
I think you're probably blowing
it out of proportion.

30
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,765
(phone vibrating)

31
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,849
Oh?

32
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,810
Excuse me for just a second.

33
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,228
You're taking the call?

34
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,688
[Sawako] Hello?

35
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,857
Guh!

36
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,693
Just what the heck are you
thinking, calling me here like
this?!

37
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,279
Hmm...

38
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,282
Um, I'll be right back, okay?

39
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,452
Seems pretty fishy...

40
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:26,331
Oh yeah, she was all: "Just what
the heck are you thinking,
calling me like this?!"

41
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,166
(laughing)

42
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,293
Oh! That reminds me!

43
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,926
[Mio] That happened this
morning?

44
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,763
This morning, she's dropped off
at school and has an argument
with the driver

45
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,432
and then she's surprised
by a sudden phone call.

46
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,894
The normal conclusion would
be that the mystery caller is...

47
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,187
No way!

48
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,522
Her mother?

49
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,691
[Azusa] You shouldn't worry
about this, Yui-senpai.

50
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,733
(dejected)

51
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,110
Why not?!

52
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,986
Because this isn't kids' stuff
we're talking about.

53
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,823
Oh look, speak of the devil.

54
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,324
[Yui] Sawa-chan spotted!

55
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,535
[Ritsu] Yeah, and take a look
at that suspicious behavior!

56
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,329
This isn't the usual way
that she goes home afterschool.

57
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,456
Oh! Mio-chan, you sound like a
detective!

58
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,000
Come on! Let's follow her!

59
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,418
Ah...

60
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,587
Wait! Are you sure this a good
idea? If she spots us-

61
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,298
Look she's turned left!
Come on, let's hurry!

62
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,468
Mugi-senpai is into this
more than anyone else!

63
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,848
[Ritsu] Okay... Target acquired!

64
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,559
Yui, you're to maintain watch,
focusing on the right.

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,105
Mugi, you exercise the utmost
caution, so that Sawa-chan
doesn't spot you.

66
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,064
[Yui & Tsumugi] Roger that!

67
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,149
This is a stakeout?

68
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,317
[Yui] Oh, right! You, too,
Mio-chan!

69
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,694
You came ready!

70
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,238
Looks like something in
the area has spooked her!

71
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,781
You too!?

72
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,950
[Yui] You're right...
[Azusa] You'd think she really
has-

73
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,119
[Tsumugi] But wait, doesn't
she always complain about

74
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,912
how lonely she is because she's
single?

75
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,958
[Mio] Maybe teachers have to
keep certain parts of their
lives secret.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,168
Huh?

77
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,462
Certain parts?

78
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,839
No, not me! I'm not hiding
anything!

79
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,759
You know, come to think of it,
you are a hottie, Mio.

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,177
I wouldn't be surprised at all

81
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,929
if boys liked you just as much
or more than girls do.

82
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,972
Neither would I.

83
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,182
[Mio] How did we get on this
topic?!

84
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,767
Mio-chan, congratulations!

85
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,061
[Mio] What are you doing!?
Don't run with that joke!

86
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,103
Hm...

87
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,438
[Mio] Don't stare at me!

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,774
Look, I'm not interested
in that kind of stuff!

89
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:20,028
You could say that the Light
Music Club is my boyfriend right
now.

90
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,199
Oh... (clapping)

91
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,200
[Ritsu] Ow!

92
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,035
[Ritsu] Why was I the only one?

93
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,079
[Norimi] Heh. Sorry I'm late.

94
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,624
Didn't I tell you never to call
me during school hours like you
did?

95
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,125
I'm really sorry!

96
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,251
Yeah well...

97
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,836
Isn't that a girl?

98
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,129
Oh. Darn.

99
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,422
It's a woman...

100
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,008
Well, you don't need
to read too much into it.

101
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,844
(snapshots)

102
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,305
Why did we follow them in here?

103
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,182
It's like we're in a soap opera!

104
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,268
Today is the day you get your
comeuppance, you scheming vixen!

105
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,728
They'll hear you!

106
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,939
Pardon me.

107
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,648
[Girls] (gasps) Y-Yes?

108
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,650
Party of five, ladies?

109
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,776
[Girls] We, uh...okay!

110
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,861
Um, mind if we sit over here?

111
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,864
We're still in our school
uniforms...

112
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,867
Mugi, keep your head down.

113
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,370
Oh, alright.

114
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,913
Come on, Azu-nyan, scoot over!

115
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,165
Why don't you sit on the other
side, huh?

116
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,626
[Yui] Aw, that's so mean!

117
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,172
What's the matter?

118
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,466
Oh, it's nothing really.

119
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,594
That was close...

120
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,388
[Ritsu] Yui, stay down there.

121
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,015
I'll give you these.

122
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,975
I don't wanna...

123
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:36,521
Hey... Watch it! Don't just
force your way in like that!
You're squishing me!

124
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,566
Would the both of you please be
quiet!

125
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,484
You mean they're holding the
party THERE?

126
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,028
[Norimi] That's right.

127
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,904
Oh hey, isn't that-

128
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,824
Excuse me, girls. May I take
your order?

129
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,035
Uh... Five black teas, please.

130
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,204
We have a lovely self-service
area over there.

131
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,457
[Norimi] Come on,
don't be like that.
[Ritsu] Not good.

132
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,129
Um... I'll have this chocolate
cake, then.

133
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,715
Hey, don't order just for
yourself!

134
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,258
We need something.

135
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,802
In that case, I'm going to have
the pumpkin custard a la mode.

136
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,055
They serve amazing things like
that here?!

137
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,515
I think I'll have the cream
anmitsu.

138
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,892
That's what I wanted!

139
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,894
You CAN order the same thing,
you know.

140
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:20,523
That'd be a waste!
They have so much good stuff
here.

141
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,193
Um... I-I guess what I'll have
is...

142
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,820
Um... I guess I'll have...

143
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,946
(gasps)

144
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,532
T-This! This please...

145
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,619
We've completely lost sight
of our initial objective.

146
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,622
We're paying separately,
and not dutch, you got that?

147
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,123
What? We are?

148
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,375
Obviously.

149
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,377
Well, then in that case...

150
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,755
Will you please make up your
mind. We're gonna be spotted.

151
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,798
(gasps)

152
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,385
Geh!

153
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,637
You've been acting strange
since we got here.

154
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,971
It's nothing.

155
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,475
Liar. You keep looking behind
me.

156
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,938
Shh! Shh!

157
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,108
Please, think about it
one more time, all right?

158
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,402
Talk about pushy...

159
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:09,114
It cost me $14.80 with tax...
There goes my allowance.

160
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,074
You didn't actually need
to buy it, you know.

161
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,952
I didn't want to miss out
on all the good stuff!

162
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,455
You know we never did figure out
who the woman with Sawa-chan
was.

163
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,540
That's true.

164
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,041
[Yui] I recognize her.

165
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,084
Huh?

166
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,961
Yui, you know her?

167
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,713
Yeah, oh course.

168
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,340
She was with Sawa-chan in all of
those old pictures we found
remember?

169
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,466
Pictures?

170
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,759
Huh...

171
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,137
She's Death Devil's-

172
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,930
Name is Christina!

173
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,265
(screaming)

174
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,476
Sorry. Was I a bit overboard?

175
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,021
Oh no, she's always been like
this.

176
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,522
Really?

177
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,984
Let me guess, you're
the Light Music Club, aren't
you?

178
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,861
Are you another master
detective?!

179
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:52,157
We're wearing our uniforms and
carrying guitars, it's not a
huge stretch.

180
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,702
[Norimi] I need to talk to you
about something as a Light Music
Club alumnus.

181
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,828
Who's president?

182
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,871
Eh...

183
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,958
(nervous)

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,753
[Ritsu] Mio is.
[Azusa] Don't abandon your post.

185
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,342
Wow, this is one hell of
an axe you've got here.

186
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,551
Oh thanks...

187
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,428
This really takes me back.

188
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,474
(strumming)

189
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,808
She's good!

190
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,186
Maybe even better than Miss
Yamanaka!

191
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,771
Really? Thanks a lot.

192
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,691
Sawako and I used to have
technique competitions every
day.

193
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,026
Oh wow you did, really?

194
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,695
Oh. Don't be shy, go ahead
and order something.

195
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,031
Pops, another round
of juices for the girls.

196
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,033
[Pops] Sure thing, Nori-chan.

197
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,284
Nori-chan?

198
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,495
[Norimi] Sorry about that.
My name is Norimi.

199
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,790
(gasps) Oh my goodness! You mean
you're not a foreigner of some
kind?!

200
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,249
Or course she isn't.

201
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,334
But her name...

202
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,710
(chuckling)

203
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,962
I'm sorry. I should have
introduced myself sooner.

204
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,882
By the way, if there's anything
else that you girls would like
to eat,

205
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,926
just say the word, okay?

206
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,261
[Yui and Ritsu] She seems really
nice!

207
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,765
Then I would like the ganmodoki,
please!

208
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,725
[Pops] One ganmo coming up.

209
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,893
Oh do you like those?

210
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,062
I don't know, I've never tried
it before.

211
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,732
Its name makes it sound
just amazing, Ganmodoki.

212
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,192
You really think so?

213
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,903
So, what did you want to talk to
us about?

214
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,076
Well, it's nothing major
or anything like that.

215
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,078
Oh?

216
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,957
[Norimi] The thing is,
Sawako is set to get married.

217
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,754
(the girls scream)

218
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,755
(strumming)

219
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,590
Don't worry. That was a just
joke.

220
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,591
(sighs)

221
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,343
You call that a joke?!

222
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,263
An old classmate of ours from
the Light Music Club is getting
married,

223
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,517
and she says that she wants
the old band to play at the
reception.

224
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,021
But Sawako is the only one
who isn't on board with it.

225
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,607
Yeah, she treats her Light Music
Club past as a dark secret.

226
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,608
[Mio] Yeah.

227
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,318
[Pops] One ganmodoki.

228
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,698
It's more mundane
than I expected.

229
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,658
Well did you have pictured
in your head?

230
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,244
[Tsumugi] Something spiny,
I guess.

231
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,162
[Azusa] Spiny?

232
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,706
<i>[Yui] She seems so cool...</i>

233
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:09,961
Ah. I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to keep it so long. Here.

234
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,129
Kay.

235
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,389
(strumming)

236
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,557
(thinking)

237
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,726
[Norimi] Sorry, did I mess
something up?

238
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:25,643
Nuh-uh.

239
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,771
No, everything's fine.

240
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,276
(playing guitar)

241
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,036
[Sawako] K-ON!

242
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,290
[Sawako] English class today
will be independent study.

243
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,042
Work quietly.

244
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:55,382
Miss Akiyama.
It's from Miss Kotobuki.

245
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,300
Thank you.

246
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,011
"Mio-chan, have you
thought of anything?"

247
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,848
[Mio] "I've been thinking
about it a lot,

248
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,434
but if the old club members
couldn't convince her,

249
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,312
I don't see how we're going
to be able to do it."

250
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,814
[Mio] Thanks.

251
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,607
Here.

252
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,150
Thanks a lot.

253
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,987
[Tsumugi] "Apparently
other teachers and members,

254
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,949
of the Newspaper Club
are coming to the reception."

255
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,159
[Mio] "Maybe we could disguise
her with makeup or something?"

256
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:27,497
[Tsumugi] "But considering the
outcome if she's found out,
perhaps she shouldn't."

257
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,374
[Mio] "Good point."

258
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,750
[Mio] "What do you think, Yui?"

259
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,135
[Yui] "Mio-chan,
your handwriting's so cute!"

260
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,305
[Mio] "How about you, Ritsu?
You're our president."

261
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,355
(chuckling)

262
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,357
[Mio] "Be serious!"

263
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,901
(stifling giggles)

264
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,904
(snorting and laughing)

265
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,282
[Sawako] Miss Akiyama.

266
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,576
Wah! Um...

267
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,037
Did you draw this picture?

268
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,830
No!

269
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,914
[Mio] You traitor!
[Ritsu] "I am an ink pen."

270
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,207
[Tsumugi] It was me.

271
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,375
Miss Kotobuki?

272
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,960
Mugi?

273
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,463
I was the one who sent
the first note and started all
this.

274
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,758
So Mio-chan isn't the one
to blame for any of it.

275
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,885
Oh, but still, she had-

276
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,679
The hallway! May I stand out
there as punishment?

277
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,805
Wha?

278
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,057
That's really not-

279
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,933
I want to stand outside!

280
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,187
So this is what it's
like to stand out here!

281
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,733
Twelve years after starting my
school career, my dream has
finally come true.

282
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,902
I can graduate with
no unfinished business.

283
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,029
What kind of dreams do you
have?!

284
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,742
I did it! Ri-chan, look, I
reached it!

285
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,078
Yui seems to be having a grand
old time.

286
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,914
To get back on topic,
what do you think we should do?

287
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,168
Don't you people remember what
Norimi told us about Sawa-chan
last night?

288
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,671
[Ritsu] Of course.
[Yui] I forget, what'd she say?

289
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,381
Get with it, Yui...

290
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,258
[Norimi] Fine, I'll let you guys
talk Sawako into playing.

291
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,220
But you know Sawa-chan can
be really stubborn, sometimes.

292
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,931
So what? You throwing
in the towel already?

293
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,851
Well, if you guys can't
talk her into it then...

294
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,311
What will you do?

295
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,605
Let's just say that I have some
special training for you.

296
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,773
(nervous)

297
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:17,899
Wait, that happened?

298
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,109
You don't remember?!

299
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,277
I wonder what "special training"
means.

300
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,446
When a club alumnus says
something like that,

301
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,448
it tends to be some
kind of harsh practice.

302
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,867
That's true, but we
aren't an athletic club.

303
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,829
No, but with the
Light Music Club, it might be...

304
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,666
All right girls, you're going to
play until I can hear the music!

305
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,334
(gasps) But we don't have any of
our-

306
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,462
They say music comes
from the soul, don't they?

307
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:43,008
Put your hearts into it, and you
should be able to make music
without instruments!

308
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,342
Get started!

309
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,844
Y-Yes, ma'am!

310
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,020
I'm not hearing anything!

311
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,896
We're so sorry!

312
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:57,856
...like that.

313
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,898
Seriously?!

314
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,276
Come on, don't joke around about
that.

315
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,444
Oh my...

316
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,945
It was a joke?

317
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,322
Fine, let's all talk to her
right after school is finished.

318
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,490
(door opens)

319
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,992
You going to stand out here all
day?

320
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,619
Get back to your
independent study, alright?

321
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,246
[Girls] Okay!

322
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,499
[Ritsu] Pardon us.

323
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,461
Is Miss Yamanaka here-

324
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,005
Thank you, Miss Yamanaka!

325
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,466
We don't want to bother the
other teachers, so let's keep it
down, okay?

326
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,510
[Yui] Wow, Sawa-chan sure is
popular, huh?

327
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:31,306
Yeah but it kinda makes
it hard to ask her.

328
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,099
[Norimi] I see.

329
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,934
[Mio] We're sorry.

330
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,062
[Norimi] So, Sawako is
just as popular now.

331
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,688
[Mio] Yes.

332
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,399
[Ritsu] So, um, what's this
"special training" you
mentioned?

333
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,737
[Norimi] Oh, that? I was just
kidding.

334
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,531
[Norimi] No I wasn't.

335
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,242
[Norimi] I just want
your help with something.

336
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,085
This is really hard...

337
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,462
Hey big sis, you still haven't
taken your bath yet?

338
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,924
No, I'll take it in a little
while.

339
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,093
But you'll oversleep again.

340
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,012
You know, Ui.

341
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,057
Adults are pretty amazing,
aren't they?

342
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,184
I guess. Why do you ask?

343
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,189
When I'm grown up and an adult,
will I be all mature, too?

344
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,027
Big sis, do you want some juice?

345
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,071
Today, I shall have tea.

346
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,198
Coming right up.

347
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,743
[Sawako] Congratulations.

348
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,078
Oh, Sawako!

349
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,204
Good to see you again!

350
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,456
I'm so sorry that I can't play
for you.

351
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,752
Now that I'm a teacher,
I have to be careful what I do.

352
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:46,006
It's all right.
We can't wait for the show!

353
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,592
[Yui] Geeta!

354
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,220
[Mio] Quit crying!
It only makes you look scarier!

355
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,931
[Tsumugi] Actually,
I rather like it on you.

356
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,850
[Azusa] You overdid it,
Mugi-senpai!

357
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:01,104
[Norimi] Oh, and Miss President?
I want you to use this to
breathe fire, okay?

358
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:05,650
[Ritsu] Um... Thanks, but NO
WAY!

359
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,528
[Announcer] And now ladies and
gentlemen,

360
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,406
it's time for a special
performance by Death Devil,

361
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,784
a band composed of
the bride's high school friends.

362
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:19,581
Furthermore, today's performance
will feature a special lineup.

363
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,335
[Sawako] Hey! What do
those girls think they're-

364
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,880
Yui-chan, what did you do to
your guitar?

365
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,549
What are you doing with them?

366
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:34,012
Buckle up, you bastards,
tonight we're gonna rock!

367
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,143
[Yui] I missed a note!

368
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,686
[Azusa] Yui-chan, what are you
doing?

369
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:45,148
[Yui] I'm sorry, let's take it
again from the top!

370
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,360
With a name like "Death Devil,"
I was worried what kind of
band they'd be,

371
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,944
but they're awfully cute.

372
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,571
<i>C-Cute?!</i>

373
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,368
You can do it, Death Devil!

374
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,536
We're all rooting for you!

375
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,537
<i>Rooting for them?!</i>

376
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,539
[Crowd] Death Devil!
Death Devil!

377
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,793
<i>This is all wrong...</i>
<i>This isn't what Death Devil</i>
<i>is about.</i>

378
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,629
<i>There has to be a</i>
<i>brutal clashing of souls.</i>

379
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,631
<i>That's when Death Devil</i>
<i>is at its best.</i>

380
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,550
<i>No, I mustn't!</i>
<i>I'm a teacher now...</i>

381
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,095
<i>I left that part of me</i>
<i>long ago in the past!</i>

382
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,932
<i>And it would be an insult</i>
<i>to these people who are</i>
<i>trying so hard.</i>

383
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:23,144
[Yui] Gosh, I'm so sorry!
I'm all thumbs!
<i>[Sawako] This is wrong.</i>

384
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,313
<i>Death Devil is...</i>

385
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,483
<i>The Death Devil that I pursued</i>
<i>all those years is...</i>

386
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:32,153
<i>Death Devil!</i>
<i>MY DEATH DEVIL IS!</i>

387
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,492
What happened?
Where's the lights?

388
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,789
They'll come back.

389
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,499
I know.

390
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,131
Sawa-chan!

391
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,257
It's Sawako!

392
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,175
[Norimi] Here it comes!

393
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,282
[Sawako] Death Devil
ain't this half-assed,

394
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,327
watery crap these kiddies
were trying to play!

395
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:25,707
So I'm gonna show you
bastards how it's done!

396
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,129
Okay! Let's do it!

397
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,464
One, two!

398
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,407
Catherine! Yeah!

399
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,496
{\an5}Okay...

400
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,331
{\an5}Yeah!

401
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,418
{\an5}(crowd cheering)

402
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,854
[Sawako] What have I done?!

403
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,440
[The girls]
Look what we made her do!

404
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,320
I'm finished...

405
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:22,532
The genteel, ladylike image
I've worked so hard to
cultivate...

406
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,659
[The girls]
We're truly ashamed
of ourselves.

407
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,995
It's okay. In the end, it was...

408
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,665
Yeah you're right, it's your
own fault for snapping like you-

409
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,752
I SAID it was my fault already,
didn't I?

410
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,170
[Ritsu] I'm sorry.

411
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,504
(knock on the door)

412
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,505
Come in.

413
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:41,551
Um...Miss Yamanaka? Is that you?

414
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,720
Huh?

415
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,806
Thank you so much!

416
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:49,559
I can't believe it! You were so
awesome in that show last night!

417
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,312
We can't wait until
the next time!

418
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,233
I don't get it.

419
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,693
[Yui] Well, I'll be.

420
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,446
It looks like Sawa-chan is
popular no matter what she does.

421
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,240
I'm thinking that maybe a band
has to be way over the top

422
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,534
if anyone's going to
remember them.

423
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,911
Maybe...

424
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,621
[Ritsu] Okay, let's do it!
Slap some makeup on Mio!

425
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,830
[Mio] Don't even think about it!

426
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,457
[Tsumugi] I rather like
the whole idea of it.

427
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,959
[Azusa] You really go
overboard with that stuff!

428
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:15,960
[Tsumugi] Do I?

429
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,629
[Yui] For mine, I wanna go
way...

430
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:24,886
(closing song, "Listen!!")

431
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:20,460
It's so hot...
