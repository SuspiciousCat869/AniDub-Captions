1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,175
[Ui texting] Did you make it?

2
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,094
Since you haven't called me,

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:15,515
I'm just going to assume that
you were able to make it to make
it on time.

4
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:19,436
Are you at the station by now? I
hope you didn't forget anything.

5
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,229
Oh?

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,607
I was worried, so I went to your
room to check, and it turns out
you did.

7
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,737
Have Mio and the others take
lots of great pictures
for you, okay?

8
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,035
Have a great trip, see you soon.

9
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:39,622
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

10
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,508
"Now riding Mt. Fuji.
Can now see bullet train."

11
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,096
Sounds like my sister's
having a great time.

12
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,347
Good for her!

13
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,391
You know, she's so
scatter-brained,

14
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,852
because you keep coddling her
the way you do, Ui.

15
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,687
Huh? Scatterbrained?

16
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,981
Well she's a senior
in highschool,

17
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:31,651
but all she ever really does is
hang around the club room and
eat snacks.

18
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,738
She never practices unless I
yell at her.

19
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:40,035
So you think she'd be better off
if she was all straightlaced and
proper?

20
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,120
Of course.

21
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,539
If she had her head on straight,
she'd--

22
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,210
Nakano! You're not playing in
sync with the rest of the band!

23
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,754
Senpai, I'm sorry!

24
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,592
Hey, what're you looking at?

25
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,554
You mean this? It's a text from
my sister.

26
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,977
Oh wow that's pretty funny,
your sister's so goofy.

27
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,562
You really think so?

28
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,774
Look check it out,
I just got a text from a senior.

29
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,858
She's in the Jazz Club.

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,277
"Be sure to look after the
freshmen."

31
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,529
She's got it together.

32
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,908
[Azusa] Oh it's from Yui-senpai.

33
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,954
"Remember to feed
Ton-chan, okay?"

34
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,581
They're so lame...

35
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,794
In the Light Music Club, do you-

36
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,006
Today, we play kick-the-can!

37
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,466
Yay!

38
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,722
[Both] Hey they're not THAT bad!

39
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,398
[Jun] Oh the elusive
golden chocolate eclair!

40
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,275
This is my first time seeing
one in two years!

41
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,277
I never knew they sold them.

42
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,324
They only sell three. The
seniors always buy them up
before anyone else can.

43
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,246
Jun, you should take a picture!

44
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,248
Yeah! Good idea!

45
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,793
That's so cute!

46
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,255
It's from big sis!

47
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,799
What's the matter?

48
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,927
Big sister left her lunch box
in the classroom,

49
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,888
and she wants me to
take it home for her

50
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,476
Um, I'm getting a little
embarrassed over here...

51
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,614
[Ui] Um, pardon us...

52
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,576
It's so quiet...

53
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,746
Is it really okay for us
to go in?

54
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,916
We're just going to pick up
something a senior left.

55
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:57,964
Let's see, I think her desk is
somewhere over there on that
side of the room.

56
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,299
[Ui] You're right!

57
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,806
Hey, which one is Mio-senpai's?

58
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,975
I think this it.

59
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,233
I feel kinda cooler somehow!

60
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,818
You're imagining it.

61
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,239
"Pull me"?

62
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,616
Don't touch that!

63
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,453
What the heck?

64
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,121
Ritsu-senpai...

65
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,124
Huh? Where's Ui?

66
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,710
This is my sister's desk...

67
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,921
Wow, she looks really happy.

68
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:42,384
If you like your sister so much,
aren't you going to be
lonely tonight?

69
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,805
She won't be home until
the day after tomorrow.

70
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,433
You're right... Sis isn't
going to be home tonight.

71
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,477
You just realized that?!

72
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,145
No don't cry!

73
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,315
Don't worry! We'll come over to
hang out with you tonight!

74
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,317
We can even sleep over
if you want!

75
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,196
[Ui] And so, Jun ans Azusa will
be spending the night at
my house tonight,

76
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:07,867
so I've decided to help out
at Jazz Club practice in return,

77
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,163
[Ui] Look at all their stuff!

78
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,667
[Jun] We have just as many
instruments as the Brass Band
Club.

79
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,336
[Azusa] Do you really have
that many players?

80
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,005
Pretty much.

81
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,506
Amazing.

82
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,425
Yep. It's about
survival of the fittest.

83
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:29,055
So we have to practice hard
while the upperclassmen are
away, so that we uh-

84
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,433
I forgot my bass
in the classroom!

85
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,519
<i>She's scatterbrained, too!</i>

86
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,564
Well Jun never never seems
to change at all...

87
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,694
We um...

88
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,864
Sorry! We're friends of
Jun-chan's. She'll be
right back.

89
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,367
Oh, oh, oh, are you
Azusa-senpai?

90
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,536
Jun-senpai told us
a lot about you.

91
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,123
She said there was an
amazing guitarist in
the Light Music Club,

92
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,500
and we should get
lessons from her!

93
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,796
Oh, she did?

94
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,508
Great timing guys!

95
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,843
[Both] Good morning, Senpai!

96
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,720
Good morning.

97
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,722
These are two of the freshmen
in the Jazz Club.

98
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,559
Azusa, can you teach
them a few guitar tricks?

99
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,272
Sure.

100
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,441
[Azusa] One, two, three, four.

101
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,485
One, two, three, four.

102
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,236
Oh I'm sorry!

103
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,864
It's okay, this part is a little
tricky.

104
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,701
I can't get my fingers
in the right position.

105
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,120
Well there's some finger
stretches, that you can do.

106
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,748
First you hold your chord
hand straight out,

107
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,459
with all your fingers
pressed tightly together.

108
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,088
Now spread your index finger
from the middle finger, like
this,

109
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,507
then pull it back to the middle
and spread your ring finger

110
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,676
and your pinky out the other
way.

111
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,261
One, two, and three, four.

112
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,389
One, two, and three, four.

113
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,431
I can't do it!

114
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,891
Ah they're cramping!

115
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,643
Ow...

116
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,729
Wait a minute,
you can do it, Ui?

117
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,692
Yeah, I copied my sister when
she was doing her stretches.

118
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,778
If you do it in the bath
or before playing,

119
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,990
you'll find that your fingers
will gradually become more
flexible over time.

120
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,826
Okay!

121
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,829
What's the matter?

122
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,499
What do I do? My hand
has totally seized up!

123
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,878
Pig feet!

124
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,258
[Jun] I-It was a joke.

125
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,220
(doorbell rings)

126
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,680
[Jun] I'm here!

127
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,057
[Ui] Coming!

128
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,475
Good evening, Ui!

129
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,144
Hi! Come on in!

130
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:44,190
Um this isn't really very much,
but please accept this gift.

131
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,776
Wow Jun-chan, thank you!

132
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,279
Donuts, huh?

133
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,742
They're super all-star pack!
I always wanted to buy one.

134
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,327
Jun-chan, this is so cute!

135
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,829
Oh, come and see!

136
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,541
W-Wow...

137
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,878
Since there's going to be three
of us, I thought I should make a
lot.

138
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,880
Now let's see..

139
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,552
If this isn't enough, I also
have sushi rice bowls and pizza.

140
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,679
This will be plenty!
It's more than enough!

141
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,056
(doorbell rings)

142
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,058
Good evening.

143
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,351
Come on in!

144
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,063
Um, my mother said
I should bring this for you.

145
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,898
Thanks!

146
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,150
Uh, what did you bring?

147
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,486
It's sushi, why?

148
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,280
<i>My donuts are even lamer now!</i>

149
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,659
I'm full!

150
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,245
I can't eat another bite...

151
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,875
Is that really how you eat
donuts?

152
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,962
I couldn't help it,
I wanted to taste them all!

153
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,258
Go ahead, eat the rest
if you wanna, Azusa.

154
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,638
I don't have any more room.

155
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,142
Come on, there's always room for
dessert. That chocolate one is
great.

156
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,147
You're gonna eat one?

157
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,111
So sweet...

158
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,364
It's from Big Sis!

159
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,074
Let me see!

160
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,120
Nothing says "school trip"
like a pillow fight.

161
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,957
"Are you guys having fun
at your sleepover, too?"

162
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,837
What's up?

163
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,591
Ow!

164
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,802
Are you okay?

165
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,014
She's asleep.

166
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,891
Wow, she's out like a light.

167
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:45,270
I guess we should go to sleep,
too.

168
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,772
Oopsie daisy...

169
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,858
But I don't want to go to sleep
yet.

170
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,153
Okay then, why don't we just
talk in bed?

171
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,863
[Ui] Lights out.

172
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,786
I bet Yui-senpai and the others
are having a lot of fun right
about now.

173
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,748
Yeah or they could be asleep
already.

174
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,458
I really doubt it.

175
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,586
When we had band camp, we would
always stay up late goofing
around.

176
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,670
I'll bet-

177
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,047
(giggling)

178
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:16,468
Souvenirs? Oh! We were having
so much fun we forgot!

179
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,802
Yeah sorry!

180
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,180
Our tea's ready!

181
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,018
Oh Azusa-chan, I doubt it's that
bad.

182
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,400
They're so lucky...

183
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,323
Hey, why don't we go somewhere
tomorrow?

184
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,284
Is there anywhere that
you would like to go?

185
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:48,500
Well um... Maybe the zoo, I
guess.

186
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,293
I'd love to go to the zoo!

187
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,378
Really?

188
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,004
Yeah!

189
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,011
It's from Big Sis!

190
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,102
"Skull"?

191
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,105
What the?

192
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,986
[Yui] K-ON!

193
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,205
Hey...

194
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,209
Aw rain...

195
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,132
Here.

196
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,428
Here.

197
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,944
[Ui] I have a fresh tube.

198
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,196
I've... got... this...

199
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,949
[Ui] Azusa-chan, isn't it a
little high?

200
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,576
[Azusa] I think this is about
right.

201
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,455
[Jun] I'm jealous, Azusa. Your
hair's so black and straight.

202
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,123
Really?

203
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,043
People always say I look just
like a Japanese doll, so I hate
it.

204
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:18,298
I'd take that any day! Mine
always takes forever to brush
out in the morning!

205
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,800
Especially on rainy days like
today.

206
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,720
See? It does this.

207
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,930
Wow, that's some impressive
frizz.

208
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,267
Well, maybe you could
just wear a hat today?

209
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,232
It's really coming down out
there...

210
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,527
Yeah. I guess the zoo plan is a
bust.

211
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,239
I really wanted to go.

212
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,326
Jun-chan? What do you think we
should do?

213
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,121
Is there anywhere that you want
to go?

214
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,458
We could even play video games.

215
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,381
Ui, do you have volume 6 of
this?

216
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,133
Huh? I don't know, I'm not
sure...

217
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,427
I think that if you do that
at a friend's place,

218
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,930
then you're gonna lose that
friend.

219
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:11,393
You know, I think I might have
seen that up on my sister's
bookshelf.

220
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,521
So this is your sister's room
huh?

221
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,438
Yeah!

222
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,190
Hey, aren't those...

223
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:20,568
Oh yeah, she brought home a ton
of stuff a while ago for some
reason.

224
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,321
They're from the club room
cleaning...

225
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,742
So this is Geeta?

226
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,035
This is so awesome!

227
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,330
Let's see... Found it!

228
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,623
Here! Volume 7!

229
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,418
Oh? But I needed volume 6!

230
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,963
Really? But I only saw
volume 7 on the shelf.

231
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,090
[Azusa] Skipping one
is really no big deal.

232
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,803
I... guess I could read it.

233
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,805
No I thought I could, but I
can't!

234
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,307
Let's go to a bookstore and get
it!

235
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,269
But it's pouring outside!

236
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,857
I feel bored out of
my mind all of a sudden.

237
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,361
That's why I've been suggesting
all morning that we should do
something.

238
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,991
Oh, it's Yui-senpai.

239
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,537
"So what are you guys up to,
Azu-nyan?"

240
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,500
C'mon guys, let's go out and do
something!

241
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,960
She's asleep now!?

242
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,341
Why did we come to batting cage
place?

243
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:28,178
That was a baseball manga I was
reading, so I had an urge to try
it myself!

244
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,888
Whoa!

245
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,224
How do they expect us to hit
that?

246
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,685
Hey, I'm gonna go play
the crane game over there!

247
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,270
<i>She gave up so quickly!</i>

248
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,565
Having any luck?

249
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,360
No, this is pretty hard, all
right...

250
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,111
[Man] Keep your eye on the ball.

251
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:49,908
Let it get really close and
picture a wall right about here.

252
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,535
And swing!

253
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,912
Okay you got it?

254
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,413
[Kid] Yeah!

255
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,419
<i>Let it get really close...</i>
<i>Picture a wall...</i>

256
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,421
<i>And swing!</i>

257
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,175
[Kid] Wow!
[Ui] Oh my.

258
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,718
I did it!

259
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,181
I hit it! I hit it! I actually
hit it, Azusa- And she's gone...

260
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,518
[Jun] Boy you sure pick
things up quickly, Ui.

261
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,979
[Azusa] I guess you and
Yui-senpai have that in common.

262
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,732
[Ui] Thanks for waiting!

263
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:23,733
It's huge!

264
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,568
[Jun] That's their home run
prize?

265
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,778
Yeah.

266
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,239
That thing is ten times
bigger than Ton-chan.

267
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,533
Where in the world are
you going to put it?

268
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,118
(realize)

269
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,577
What's the matter?

270
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,623
Ton-chan... I forgot about him.

271
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,929
Thank goodness! He looks just
fine!

272
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,473
I'm sorry, Ton-chan.

273
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,562
So this is Ton-chan, huh?

274
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,772
I guess he's kinda cute.

275
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,190
You heard he's cute?

276
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,110
Yeah, my sister always saying to
me.

277
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,530
"Ton-chan is just as cute as
Azu-nyan is."

278
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,493
He's cute like me?

279
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,581
Here it is! I found volume 6!

280
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,624
Good thing we came, huh?

281
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:28,006
Well, I'm relieved that
Ton-chan is okay. But still...

282
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,426
When is this rain going to stop?

283
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,806
[Ui] Yeah, our Sunday's going to
waste.

284
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,643
Why don't the three of us
have a jam session, then?

285
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:45,815
It's raining out, and nobody's
going to complain if we play
really loud, right?

286
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,151
The three of us?

287
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,488
Yeah! That might be fun!

288
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,324
But I'm not sure if I'm good
enough to jam with you.

289
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,534
Don't worry, we'll just
stick to easy stuff.

290
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,745
Yeah, you can play the organ,
can't you?

291
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:02,332
Ah! Well I used to play it
when I was little!

292
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:05,669
[Azusa] Let's play! Let's play!
[Ui] Okay...

293
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,630
[Azusa] Jun, do you have any
spare guitars in the Jazz Club
room?

294
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:12,467
[Jun] You bet we do!
Just wait right here!

295
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,982
Alright, here we go.

296
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:32,153
And one, two, three, four!

297
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:36,199
(playing music)

298
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,106
I did it!

299
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,401
Oh wow, that song
almost sounded cool there!

300
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,655
Look the rain!

301
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,240
What?

302
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,213
Hang on a second...

303
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,176
It's from Sis.

304
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,304
"Geeta, oh how I
yearn for thee..."

305
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,145
[Jun] Come on, Azusa,
scoot in closer.

306
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,024
Ready? Here goes.

307
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:54,235
Say cheese!

308
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:58,573
[Ui] "To my big sister:
Pretty cool, huh?"

309
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,747
Bye, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Ui, remember volume 7.

310
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,833
Sure thing.

311
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,128
[Azusa] Don't get too caught up
in your book and miss your stop,
okay?

312
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,675
Is she gonna be alright?

313
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,761
Today turned out to be
a lot of fun, huh?

314
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,599
Yeah, it really was.

315
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,728
(phone rings)

316
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,522
It's Yui-senpai!

317
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,315
Hello?

318
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,860
[Yui] Azu-nyan? Listen, we
managed to get ourselves
hopelessly lost.

319
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,947
[Mio] How is calling Azusa
suppose to help us?!

320
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,699
[Yui] Oh! You're right!

321
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,866
(disconnected)

322
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,578
How weird.

323
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,666
[Azusa] Really?

324
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:53,003
Sis says that she's running
really low on Azu-nyan energy.

325
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,963
Maybe I should hide...

326
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,131
What's the matter?

327
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,757
[Yui] Azu-nyan!

328
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,429
It'sh been so wong!

329
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,807
C'mon, cut it out!
Not in the hallway!

330
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,142
Is she always like this?

331
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,601
Yep. Always.

332
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,938
Oh, right! We bought you
a souvenir from our trip!

333
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,483
Everyone's in the club room
waiting, come on!

334
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,860
It can wait until later.

335
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:21,114
No it can't! Mugi-chan already
made us all some tea!

336
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,366
See you guys later!

337
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,202
Yui-senpai! Hey!

338
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,873
[Yui] Here, Azu-nyan!

339
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,543
This is a souvenir?

340
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:34,294
Yep!

341
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,212
See I have this one!

342
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,468
One, two...

343
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,097
Then this is...

344
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,142
MCL - That stands for
Music Club Lite!

345
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,935
It does not!

346
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,022
LMC! Light Music Collider,
creates a black hole that
devours Earth!

347
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,315
[Mio] That's not it, either!

348
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,108
[Ritsu] What?! Then next up is-

349
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,568
Light Music Club.

350
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,905
Exactly.

351
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,747
Do you want to practice?

352
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:13,541
Aw, let's just all
have tea today.

353
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,877
We've got jet lag...

354
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:24,886
(closing song, "Listen!!")

355
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:56,102
I think this might be
some kind of spell.

356
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:59,481
A curse cast by someone
out of hate for someone else.

357
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,024
[Azusa] No way!

358
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,692
Who's our mystery witch?

359
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,112
Miss Hirasawa?

360
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,697
What's the matter?

361
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,076
It's a special occasion
so I want to wear
something different.

362
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,494
[Tsumugi] Yeah!

363
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,662
[Mio] Wait! Why would you
pick THAT of all things?!

364
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,373
See? Everybody was enjoying it.

365
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:19,918
[Nodoka] You don't have to
live up to the expectations
of others.
