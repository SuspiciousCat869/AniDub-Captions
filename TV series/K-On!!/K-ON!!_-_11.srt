1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:06,339
(band playing, "Fuwa Fuwa Time")

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,757
(cicadas chirping)

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,813
Drumming's going to kill me!
(groans)

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,274
It's another scorcher today.

5
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,818
Huh? Where did Yui run off to?

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,989
(groans)

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,116
It's so hot...

8
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:38,371
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

9
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:12,674
(sighs) I wish summer would
just go away already... Ugh.

10
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:16,678
Oh, please. You'll be saying
the exact opposite once
winter's here.

11
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,721
Noooo...

12
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,764
[Azusa]
Here's some water, Senpai.

13
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,183
(happy)

14
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,768
Thank you, Azu-nyan! Thank you!

15
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,271
Azu-nyan...(groans)

16
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,150
My face is hot...

17
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,402
[Mio] Then don't do that.

18
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,200
I have to say, it's like
an oven in here...

19
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,703
Long hair makes
your neck sweat like crazy.

20
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,165
Oh! Why don't you just put
your hair up, then?

21
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,584
Okay, all done!

22
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,128
Ah! You look just like
Azusa-chan!

23
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,464
Yeah, it looks terrible!

24
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,256
(gags)

25
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,632
You're the one who did it!

26
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,801
(choking) I-I I'm sorry...

27
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,303
(Azusa gasps)

28
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,680
What's going on?

29
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,557
Oh Ton-chan!

30
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,019
Did he get a sunburn?

31
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,020
(sighs)

32
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,521
No of course he didn't!

33
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,857
Ton-chan's molted.

34
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,900
Molted?

35
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,859
[Yuri] Malted?

36
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,486
I didn't know turtles did that.

37
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,613
Of course they do
they're reptiles.

38
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,949
The turtles that we have at
home have all molted, too.

39
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,368
(sigh of relief)

40
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,744
Thank goodness...

41
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,747
I was so worried that
Ton-chan might be getting sick.

42
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,000
I've got it! We should all
shed too, just like turtles do!

43
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,377
Ah?

44
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,754
You do know that humans can't
shed their skin, right?

45
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,507
Oh, but we can, Ritsu!

46
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,175
Yosakoi!

47
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,885
That's what you meant?

48
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,848
Ah... This is kinda comfy!

49
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,685
It might be easier
to play this way.

50
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,395
Not happening.

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,024
Why don't you put yours on,
too, Mio-chan?

52
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,484
No, no, no, no!

53
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,570
No one but you would ever
wear something like that to...

54
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,989
Mugi-chan!

55
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,950
Seriously?

56
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,868
Hm...

57
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,663
I wonder if it's cold
on top of the desks?

58
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,374
Are you doing what I think?

59
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,542
Here goes...

60
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,627
Oh wow, how does it feel?

61
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,171
Ah...

62
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,424
(disappointed)

63
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,011
It wasn't as cold as
I hoped it would be...

64
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,429
Mm-hm.

65
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,101
(groans)

66
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,478
It's not cold either...

67
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,109
For some reason,
today seems especially hot.

68
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,988
Still, with all this sweating
we're doing, we're sure to lose
some weight.

69
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,700
[Tsumugi] Sauna suit time!

70
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,076
[Mio] This will do the trick,
right?

71
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:45,952
No way.

72
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,328
Those again?

73
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,205
Mm.

74
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:54,002
(poorly played bass and
keyboards)

75
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,503
[Mio] I'm sweating, all right...

76
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,630
[Tsumugi] But I can't
play properly.

77
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,677
[Ritsu] Hey, let's play
a word association game!

78
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,054
Huh?

79
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,806
What says "summer in Japan"
more than anything else?

80
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,433
Watermelons!

81
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,185
Big wind chimes!

82
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,978
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

83
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,772
Uh...

84
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,940
Ice cream!

85
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,108
I know, it's fireworks.

86
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,568
No, no, no, no!

87
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,195
Oh! Chilled Chinese noodles?

88
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,738
You're not even close.

89
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,282
Wow, it's all about food
with you, isn't it?

90
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,492
Huh?

91
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,619
What could it be, then?

92
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,997
The answer is... scary ghost
stories!

93
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,499
Ah!

94
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,502
Sorry.

95
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,382
This is a story that
is told in this school.

96
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,217
Apparently, a student came here
alone

97
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,428
one night to retrieve
something she had forgotten.

98
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,475
The school should have been
deserted, and yet the notes of
piano being played,

99
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,936
could be heard emanating
from the music room!

100
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,479
(piano music)

101
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,065
(screaming)

102
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,692
Mugi!

103
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,776
Heh.

104
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,236
[Ritsu] She thought this was
unusual,

105
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:05,824
so she peeked into the music
room, and what did she see?

106
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:10,036
Sawa-chan, tutoring a student
who was applying to a music
school!

107
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,497
(screaming)

108
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,000
(inflating noise)

109
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,168
Ah, isn't there anything else
we can do to cool off?

110
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,672
You know it's bad for your
health to get yourself so
agitated.

111
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,634
Man it seems like the
harder we fan ourselves...

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,596
(groans)

113
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,974
...the hotter it feels whenever
we stop.

114
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:35,353
Thinking about how hot it is
only makes you feel even hotter
than you really are.

115
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,731
Oh you mean mind over matter?

116
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,775
Okay, Ri-chan, let's think
about lots of cool things!

117
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,737
Things that are cool, huh?

118
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,655
So cold!

119
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,160
[Yui] It sure is nice and cool.

120
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,870
[Ritsu] It sure is, Yui.

121
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,456
[Yui] It's all about mind over
matter.

122
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,958
You know, you maybe right.

123
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,211
It's hot...

124
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,463
(gasps)

125
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,923
Don't give in, Yui!
Think about how cool it is!

126
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,550
(determined)

127
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,053
It's so cool! It's so cool!

128
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,846
It's so cool...

129
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,264
It's so cool...

130
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,850
It's so cool! It's so cool!

131
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:18,813
(sizzling)

132
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,566
Yui-senpai, are you feeling
okay?

133
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,068
This is so hard!

134
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,529
I can't tell my mind it's cool
when the matter is so hot!

135
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:31,076
Hey, back at the beginning of
the school year, when we were
all cleaning in here,

136
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,995
I could swear that I put
a fan in the storage room...

137
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,121
That's it!

138
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,207
Mio-chan, you're a genius!

139
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,710
Found it!

140
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,466
It's ancient...

141
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:50,053
(fan working hard)

142
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,603
Well, I guess I know
how she feels...

143
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,773
This way, the breeze should
hit everyone, okay?

144
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,941
Oh!

145
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,526
Here goes...

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,445
(happy)

147
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,614
(satisfied)

148
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,783
Hello? Excuse me?

149
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,785
I'm not getting any wind
at all back here!

150
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,287
You're way in back,
what did you expect?

151
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,789
(stunned)

152
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,832
(angry)

153
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,670
Hey! Ritsu!

154
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,468
Right, then! Ultra-maximum
power! We are go!

155
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,804
(fan on super high power)

156
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,723
(Ritsu's excitement
echoing through fan)

157
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,640
(fan overworking)

158
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,767
(girls screaming)

159
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,689
(fan imploding)

160
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:44,649
(groans)

161
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,693
I think it broke...

162
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,072
Nothing we can do...

163
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,699
[Tsumugi] Hey guys!

164
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,285
I brought ice with me today.

165
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,162
[Ritsu] Sweet!
[Yui] Yahoo!

166
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,538
(excited)

167
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,500
It's cold!

168
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,877
Let me see!

169
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,590
[Mio] Mugi, when did you
get these-
[Ritsu] Down the hatch.

170
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,841
Wah!

171
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,635
That's freezing!
What do you think you're doing?!

172
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,180
Now, now, how could I pass that
up?

173
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,351
Well, the truth is, I had
planned to use this to make us
some shaved ice.

174
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,852
Awesome!

175
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:25,190
But I forgot to bring
my shaved ice machine
from home...

176
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,775
(disappointed)

177
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,154
Ah... It's so nice 'n chilly!

178
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,114
Really?

179
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,033
Me, too! Me, too!

180
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,955
You weren't kidding!
That's freezing!

181
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,961
You know, it's kinda
lukewarm now.

182
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,923
Ice sure melts quickly
when it's hot.

183
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,469
Ri-chan, go buy us
some more ice.

184
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,055
Uh, why don't YOU go buy some.

185
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,890
Don't wanna, it's too hot.

186
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,725
It's hot for me too.

187
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,978
Just go get it, Ri-chan...

188
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,398
Oh no! My chronic back pain
has returned!

189
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,651
That's no fair! I was here with
my feet in the bucket first!

190
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:13,238
And MY feet were in the bucket
for a lot less time than yours
have been!

191
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,240
Ri-chan, you're the one who
should go!

192
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,408
No, YOU should go!

193
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,409
Ri-chan!

194
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,410
Yui!

195
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,244
Ri-chan!

196
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,496
Yui!

197
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,289
(water spilling)

198
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,042
Would you two give it a rest?

199
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,548
For pete's sake...

200
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,676
Seems like a big waste
to throw away all this ice.

201
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,471
Oh? Why don't we gather it up
and put it in Ton-chan's tank,
then?

202
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,681
No you can't!

203
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,683
The tank has it's own
thermostat,

204
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,685
so he's fine just the way he is!

205
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,645
Oh Azu-nyan I was kidding.

206
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:51,568
Well you know, your jokes never
really sound much like jokes,
Yui-senpai.

207
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,155
It says here a turtle's growth
is based on the size of its
tank,

208
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,409
so if we want Ton-chan to get
bigger, we have to get him a
bigger tank!

209
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,373
So then, the reason Ton-chan was
shedding,

210
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,376
Is because he wants
to grow big and strong.

211
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:12,380
In that case, we have a larger
tank than this at our house that
isn't being used.

212
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,300
Wow, really? You do?

213
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,303
But how in the world would
we get it over here?

214
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,348
Didn't Miss Sawa-chan say to us
once that she had a car?

215
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,143
Hey, you're right she did!
Let's go and ask her if she'll
help us!

216
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,687
Sawa-chan hasn't come
to the club lately, has she?

217
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,941
Good thing. If she was here,
it would just make the room
hotter.

218
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:35,862
Oh wait I know, maybe she's
passed out from the heat around
here somewhere.

219
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,447
(giggling)

220
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,867
Like the two of you have
any right to laugh at that.

221
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:49,125
[Sawako] What's the matter,
girls? What brings you two here
to the staff room?

222
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,462
What? Where are you two taking
me?

223
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,423
It's so hot...

224
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,676
Miss Yamanaka, look at Ton-chan!

225
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,094
(groans)

226
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,055
What, isn't he in the water
where it's nice and comfy?

227
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,559
Oh, looks like he's molting.

228
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:10,438
That's why we want to switch him
into a larger tank that Mugi has
at her house.

229
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,192
Would you mind helping us out
and bringing it over here in
your car?

230
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,527
(moaning)

231
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,362
It's way too much work...

232
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:21,491
Look Sawa-chan, I have an
ice cream float for you!

233
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,867
I'll fetch my car at once!

234
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,204
[Ritsu] She's SO easy
to manipulate.

235
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,794
K-ON!

236
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:37,716
(car pulling up)

237
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,844
Thanks for waiting.

238
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,722
Bye! It's my job as club
president to go.

239
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,766
Wha? No fair! You can't
go by yourself!

240
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,353
I wanna go, too!
I wanna ride in Sawa-chan's car!

241
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,356
[Yui] Hey! No cutsies!
[Azusa] I can't go?

242
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:57,360
[Mio] They're going to Mugi's
house so Mugi has to go no
matter what.

243
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,446
You're lucky, Mugi-chan!

244
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,489
So Mugi-chan gets shotgun,

245
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,535
and me, Azu-nyan, Ri-chan,
and Mio-chan will all
ride in back seat.

246
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,078
How about that?

247
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,291
My car only seats four,
so that only leaves
two seats free.

248
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,294
In that case, do you wanna take
Sawa-chan's spot, Ri-chan?

249
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,170
Okay!

250
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,130
Well who's gonna drive the car?!

251
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:21,593
Hm. I hate to say it but, you
really should've bought a
bigger car, Sawa-chan.

252
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,011
I didn't buy the car for you,

253
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,347
so if you don't mind you can
spare me the commentary.

254
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,558
Um, you know the fish tank
is rather large and bulky,

255
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,354
so there's a really good chance
it could take up the entire
inside of the car.

256
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,023
[Mio] Well then, assuming the
tank will take up the rear of
the car,

257
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,566
Mugi's the only one who can go.

258
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,901
Say what?!

259
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,445
We'll be back soon, everyone!

260
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,781
[Yui] Have a safe trip!

261
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,203
It's hot...

262
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,955
(excited)

263
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,379
I'm riding in my teacher's car!

264
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,470
[Tsumugi] Oh, what's that
on your mirror?

265
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,181
It's a good-luck charm.

266
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,892
You can see everything
from the front seat!

267
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,853
Ah! The seat moves!

268
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,232
[Sawako] I knew that was coming.

269
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,696
[Tsumugi] We're back!

270
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:23,822
[Ritsu] Look at that!

271
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,365
It's huge!

272
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,825
That's amazing...

273
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,618
Incredible...

274
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,453
What do you mean incredible?

275
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,914
It was just incredible!

276
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,542
I'll be sure to make home visits
more often all right?

277
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,294
Thank you for looking out
for me.

278
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,548
[Ritsu] Thanks for doing
this for us.

279
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,799
[The girls] Thank you very much!

280
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,343
[Sawako] You're welcome, girls!

281
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,929
[Yui] Thanks for waiting,
Ton-chan!

282
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,306
Look, here's a big, new tank for
you!

283
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,268
Isn't that terrific, Ton-chan?

284
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,646
Oh! The sunlight's hitting
one corner of the tank!

285
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,315
Yeah, you're right, we'd better
cover it up with something.

286
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,067
[Ritsu] Don't we have some
packing tape?

287
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,570
[Yui] I think there was
some in the storeroom.

288
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,949
You think that'll work?

289
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,534
It should be just fine.

290
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,955
Okay then, I think it's time I
headed back to the staff room.

291
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,790
Wait don't go yet!

292
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,250
You need something else?

293
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,503
Oh please stay, you're the
only one that we can turn to!

294
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,381
Right. I'm going now.

295
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,925
Sawa-chan!

296
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,428
I said no!

297
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,804
Mugi!

298
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,807
Sawa-chan, would you like
a nice chocolate frappÃ©?

299
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,309
Yes please!

300
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,270
[Sawako] An air conditioner,
huh?

301
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,814
[Yui] Can you do anything
for us?

302
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,316
I don't know.

303
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,692
Oh, really?

304
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,110
[Ritsu] Right!

305
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,529
In that case, we'll buy
the air conditioner ourselves!

306
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,782
Where are we supposed
to get that much money?

307
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,909
We'll get ourselves some jobs!

308
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,827
(cheering)

309
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,081
Don't you guys need to study for
your college entrance exams?

310
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,041
Oh, wait a minute.

311
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,585
Why don't you go and
ask the Student Council?

312
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,878
Good idea!

313
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,756
Do you really think
they would okay the request?

314
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,341
Air conditioners aren't cheap.

315
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,927
Yeah...Maybe this calls
for a little bribe.

316
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,306
You know, Nodoka-chan was saying
earlier that she wished she had
a computer!

317
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,809
Mugi, rustle up a computer right
away!

318
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,102
Right, you go it!

319
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,522
That would cost as much as
an air conditioner.

320
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,906
We've got an emergency,
Yui's passed out from the heat!

321
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:36,955
R-Ri-chan... Just once before I
died, I wanted to snap my
fingers and...

322
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,418
Yui... Yui!

323
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,923
Is your wish for an air
conditioner of gold,

324
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,633
or an air conditioner made of
silver?

325
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,971
Mighty God, my only wish is
but for an ordinary air
conditioner...

326
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,806
How honest this creature is!

327
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,101
So I shall grant thee
a brand new air conditioner!

328
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,438
Oh! Praise God!

329
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,357
What's with the all the cheap
theatrics?

330
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,192
Sorry for all the ruckus.

331
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,738
So, what is it you want?

332
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,907
[Yui] The thing is, we came here
to ask for a favor from the
student council.

333
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,284
Wait, Yui.

334
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,620
Feel the air... It's cool here.

335
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,497
(gasps)

336
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,752
[Ritsu] This room has
an air conditioner!
[Yui] It what?!

337
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,003
Abuse of authority!

338
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,672
Nodoka-chan, I believed in
you...

339
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,299
What are you talking about?

340
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,760
We talked about this at
the Club Presidents' Council.

341
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,971
The school had decided to okay
air conditioners in the club
rooms,

342
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,767
so I said that any clubs that
wanted one should put in a
request.

343
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:43,146
(whistling innocently)

344
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,522
President?

345
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,693
[Ritsu] I forgot to attend the--
Ow!

346
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,195
I'm so sorry...

347
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,489
Is it too late to apply?!

348
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,116
Uh, well um...

349
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,993
[Ritsu] We're back.

350
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,995
How did it go?

351
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,582
I'm going to put in a formal
proposal, at tomorrow's Club
Presidents' Council.

352
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:03,375
Council?

353
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,626
I've never heard of that.

354
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,378
What do you guys talk about
there?

355
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,171
Don't know, never been to one.

356
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,964
I wouldn't be boasting!

357
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,593
Well does the council ever vote
to turn down requests made by
the clubs?

358
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,054
I suppose so.

359
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,682
But I really wanted an air
conditioner!

360
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,685
We'll just have to plead
our case convincingly.

361
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,395
(thinking)

362
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,898
Well for now, why don't we
rehearse our petition to the
council?

363
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,525
What do you mean rehearse?

364
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,610
We'll think of reasons that
they might turn down our
request,

365
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,862
and then prepare
counter-arguments.

366
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,782
Oh, I follow you! Good idea!

367
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:39,661
Very well, those with business
before this council, raise your
hand.

368
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:43,123
Here! The Light Music Club
requests an air conditioner!

369
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,749
Heh.

370
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,627
Those in agreement with
Miss Tainaka's request say
agreed.

371
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:48,712
Agreed!

372
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:49,796
Uh...

373
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,382
If you all agree, it defeats the
purpose!

374
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,386
Right, those opposed to the
request?

375
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,555
(groans)

376
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,181
President!

377
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,684
We heard petitions for
air conditioner at a previous
council,

378
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,687
so I believe it is far too late
to request one now!

379
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,439
Uh... That was because--

380
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,567
Ma'am! The Light Music Club
doesn't seem to practice all
that often,

381
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,570
so do they really need an
air conditioner in their room?

382
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:18,825
(nervous)

383
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:22,037
I'm so sorry I wasted your time!
I withdraw my request!

384
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,955
Why the heck are you giving up?!

385
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,707
Because, this is hard...

386
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,335
[Tsumugi] You have to make
some kind of counter-argument.

387
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,004
It'll be okay, Ri-chan!
You can do it! I know it!

388
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:34,591
You're a club president! You're
a big sister! And you're a good
drummer!

389
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:38,511
Hey, you're right, Yui...
Bring it on, Azusa!

390
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,598
One more time, then...

391
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,392
I don't believe that the Light
Music Club needs an air
conditioner

392
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,894
because they never practice!

393
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:50,273
We DO to practice! All the time,
but it's a secret practice.

394
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,776
Why do you have to say
that our practices are secret?

395
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:56,654
Ma'am! I believe that there is
more to being a club than
practice!

396
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,949
Wow, Yui said something
that made sense for once!

397
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,451
We deepen our bonds of
friendship!

398
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,995
And we interact with students
of other class years!

399
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,330
That's right, that's right!

400
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,582
We also eat cake, drink tea,
and go to the beach!

401
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:14,756
See?! The Light Music Club has
no need for an air conditioner
in their room!

402
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,468
If we had an air conditioner,
we would practice!

403
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,886
Would you really?

404
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:23,306
We sweat like crazy when
we play our instruments all-out!

405
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,808
Drums are physically demanding,

406
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,727
which makes them very dangerous
to play in the summer heat!

407
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,104
Uh, nevertheless-

408
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,106
Plus, if we had an air
conditioner,

409
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,149
our performances would be a lot
cooler!

410
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,401
Yeah they would!

411
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,157
You've made your case.

412
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,868
Oh yeah! Now I'm ready for the
real thing!

413
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,704
[Yui] Go get 'em, Ri-chan!

414
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,207
[Ritsu] Watch what a club
president can do when she sets
her mind to it!

415
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,209
(laughing)

416
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,592
So is there any other
business today?

417
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:00,635
Ma'am!

418
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:01,970
Miss Tainaka.

419
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,556
The Light Music Club
requests an air conditioner!

420
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,685
Are there any objections
to the proposal?

421
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,192
Huh? Wait, so you're okaying it?

422
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,986
But madam president,

423
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:21,197
the Student Council's budget
for the year is already
fully allocated.

424
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,621
Well we could hold off on
replacing the copier at least
until next year, right?

425
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,499
Yes we could. That would do it.

426
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,878
That's it?

427
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,839
Seriously?

428
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,592
(happy sighs)

429
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,137
We're in heaven!

430
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,097
It's so cool!

431
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:50,852
Now we can finally practice
without sweating like mad.

432
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,521
I say we all just call it
a day and relax.

433
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,230
Hey!

434
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,191
I'm just kidding!

435
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,734
(giggling)

436
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,194
Oh good grief...

437
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:04,115
Here we go! One! Two!
Three! Four?

438
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,700
What's the matter, Yui?

439
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:09,913
I-uh, forgot that air
conditioning makes me queasy...

440
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,374
What are we supposed
to do, then?

441
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,542
[Yui] I feel terrible...

442
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,460
(groans)

443
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,879
[Ritsu] We can't win.

444
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:24,886
(closing song, "Listen!!")

445
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,936
Another training camp!

446
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,149
[Azusa] Um, are you sure a
training camp is a good idea?

447
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,194
We're not going to get eaten
alive up there, are we?

448
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:08,365
[Mio] I really don't know what
you're thinking, but whatever it
is, it's wrong.

449
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,532
I want to die...

450
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,160
Oh wow! Two days
surrounded by music!

451
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:17,457
[Yui] I hope that I can just
keep on playing in a band
with you guys forever!
