1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,214
[TV Host] Oh, that looks
delicious!

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,507
[TV Hostess] It really does!

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,925
[TV Hostess]
And believe it or not,

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,511
I'm told that these deserts
are made with ingredients,

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:15,432
that are flown all the way here
from their country of origin.

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,101
You get the pleasure of sampling
flavors from abroad,

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,853
while staying right here
in Japan!

8
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,688
[TV Host] There's no longer a
need to leave the country
anymore, huh?

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,690
[TV Hostess] I wouldn't go
that far...

10
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:27,902
On the screen now is the contact
information for this amazing
store!

11
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,487
I should write this down.

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,489
[Yui] Um...Pen...
[Hostess] Well, we do have a lot
to cover.

13
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,617
[Hostess] So anyway, let's move
on to the next review!

14
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,661
[Yui] I didn't find it in
time...

15
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,330
[TV Suzuki] Hey, everyone!
Suzuki here!

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,875
[Host] True to form Mr. Suzuki,
you're always larger than life.

17
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,587
[Suzuki] Thanks for saying so!
That's the best compliment I
could receive!

18
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,506
[Yui] Guess I don't need to
iron these.

19
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,800
[Yui] These tights are
full of little nubbies...

20
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,886
(Yui's phone rings)

21
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,805
Hey, it's Ri-chan!

22
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,391
[Suzuki] What do you see here?
Their delicious choux pastry!

23
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,060
[Yui] Hi! What's up, Ri-chan?

24
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,644
[Host] Wow, those look
delicious, too!

25
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:05,106
[Yui] Great idea!
[Hostess] I absolutely love
choux pastry!

26
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,816
[Jun] What're you doing, Ui?

27
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,570
I'm texting my sister. I want to
make sure she's out of bed
already.

28
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,531
She has a ton of work
to do to do for tomorrow.

29
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,492
Tomorrow?

30
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,536
Yeah, she has to iron her school
uniform, buy new tights, and
that kind of thing.

31
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,123
They're all gonna be out
of here soon, won't they?

32
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,670
What is it?

33
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,213
She's here.

34
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:36,805
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

35
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,770
Good morning!

36
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,979
[Ritsu] What's up!

37
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,105
[Mio] Morning.

38
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,899
Good morning!

39
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,902
Starting the day with tea?

40
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,279
Sit down and join us, Yui-chan.

41
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,546
Having tea this early
feels so decadent.

42
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,508
I know, and I can't stop feeling
that I should be doing
something.

43
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,927
Graduation's tomorrow.
Let's just all relax!

44
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,680
[Ritsu] Our time here
was long, but felt short...

45
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,432
[Mio] Are you trying to say
it was short, but felt long?

46
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,394
[Ritsu] Guess that kind of
works, too.

47
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,354
[Ritsu] What are you doing?

48
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,233
I was challenging myself to see
how many bites I can take in 10
seconds!

49
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,859
That is so lame.

50
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,238
You're on!

51
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,536
Ready...go!

52
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,414
Ow! I bit my tongue!

53
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,790
Are you okay?

54
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,045
(school bell rings)

55
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,382
Guess that means third period
is starting now.

56
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,969
So, what should we do today?

57
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,973
President Ri-chan, didn't you
call us all here today because
you have sort of plan?

58
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,558
Yep, no plan.

59
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,018
[Mio] I figured as much.

60
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,394
Hey, then let's play something!

61
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,562
[Tsumugi] Perfect!

62
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,397
[Mio] Classes are in session
right now.

63
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,899
Let's wait until after school.

64
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,776
Okay then.

65
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,405
It sure is warm today.

66
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,282
[Yui] Don't mind me.

67
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,576
You wanna go somewhere and hang
out?

68
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,411
Let's just stay here.

69
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,204
But what should we do, though?

70
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,331
Let's have an epic battle!

71
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,254
What? Snakes and Ladders?

72
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,091
It's not the usual version.
It's the Light Music Club's
version!

73
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,926
Our own Snakes and Ladders?

74
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,305
Don't you have to put some sort
of action inside the circles?

75
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,265
Do I?

76
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,767
You haven't made up the rules
yet?

77
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,977
[Tsumugi] How about "Sing a
song" or "Play an instrument"?

78
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,563
[Ritsu] "You're a crushing
failure, back to start"!

79
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,982
[Tsumugi] Oh! "Blow an audition,
lose three turns"!

80
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,109
[Mio] This Snakes and Ladders
is pretty brutal.

81
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,447
[Yui] Then let's add "Drink
tea!", "Eat snacks!" and "Eat
candy!"

82
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,865
[Mio] That's our version
of Snakes and Ladders.

83
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,619
[Mio] What is this paper?
Our club application form!

84
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,662
Guess we still had some left.

85
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,498
[Ritsu] Hey, there's no finish
line.

86
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,917
Yeah, I ran out of space.

87
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,836
You can't play Snakes and
Ladders without a finish line!

88
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,881
Well, what do YOU want us to do,
then?

89
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,801
I've got it!

90
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,185
[Ritsu] "Leave your desk
as you wish to find it!"

91
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,522
[Mio] You haven't cleaned out
your desk and taken your things
home yet?

92
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:05,407
It's our classroom, but still,
somehow it feels kind of
different now.

93
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,955
Yui, what's with all the paper?

94
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,665
They're some of the notes I
saved

95
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,126
that you passed to me
in the middle of class.

96
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:20,046
[Yui] Look at how childish and
immature... You should be
embarrassed, Ri-chan.

97
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,382
[Ritsu] Nice try, but YOU drew
that one!

98
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,426
[Yui] Oops, I think you're
right.

99
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,845
Hey, I'd like to have those
please!

100
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,512
What?

101
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,806
Sure, I guess so.

102
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,182
Thanks a bunch!

103
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,684
[Yui] I have a bag for them!

104
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,811
Throw them away...

105
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:35,895
[Nodoka] Hm?

106
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,023
[Yui] Nodoka-chan!

107
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,899
Did you come here to hang out,
too?

108
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,902
Oh, is that what you all are
doing here?

109
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,320
And you're not?

110
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,157
[Nodoka] I came to tidy up
the student council office.

111
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,575
She's like a real graduate.

112
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,660
I also thought I should get
a final once over,

113
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,705
on the commencement speech
I'll be giving tomorrow.

114
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,877
Looks like a really good speech
to me.

115
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,670
Thanks for looking at it.

116
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,130
Read it to us Sawa-chan!

117
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,883
[Sawako] Perhaps you could
add one thing to the end.

118
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,343
[Yui] C'mon, please!
[Sawako] Maybe something like,

119
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,763
"And a special thank you to
Miss Sawako Yamanaka." Okay?

120
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,140
I don't really know if I should
do that.

121
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,475
The crowd would love it.

122
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,143
You mean YOU would love it.

123
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,104
Go ahead and hand this
in to the vice principal.

124
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,397
Will do.

125
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,150
[Sawako] So, what did you
girls come here for?

126
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,526
No reason really!

127
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,446
[Sawako] Well, it must be
nice to be so carefree.

128
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,490
Why don't you come and have tea
with us!

129
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,660
I would love to, but I have to
get through a checklist a mile
long for tomorrow!

130
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,287
And this is my first graduating
class,

131
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,957
so this ceremony has a
special meaning for me too.

132
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,382
In that case, since we mean so
much, will you help us carry
this stuff home later?

133
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,258
[Sawako] I don't have time for
that!

134
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,927
C'mon, Sawa-chan!

135
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,304
You can carry your things home
yourselves.

136
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,181
[Yui and Ritsu] Sawa-chan is so
selfish!

137
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:57,352
Try to keep the noise down. The
other students are still in
class right now.

138
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,853
[Yui and Ritsu] Fine.

139
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,482
Back to the classroom?
Or the club room instead?

140
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,609
Good question...

141
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,152
[Nodoka] Sorry to interrupt.

142
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,076
Well I'm off to the
student council office now, see
ya.

143
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,037
Bye...

144
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,130
(door opens)
[Yui] Sorry to interrupt!

145
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,633
What are you doing here?

146
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,804
Well, we thought going straight
back to the music room might be
kind of boring.

147
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,139
Ah.

148
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,600
[Ritsu] This is like a whole
new territory for us.

149
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,602
[Nodoka] But you've been
here several times.

150
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:45,400
Yeah...it just seemed like the
right thing to say under the
circumstances.

151
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,569
[Mio] I guess I kind of see what
you mean.

152
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:50,905
What's up?

153
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,157
Nodoka-chan! What is this?

154
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,659
[Ritsu] Whoa! That picture
for a dating site?

155
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,702
Of course not.

156
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,328
The student council makes an
album

157
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,748
like that of the class president
at the end of every year.

158
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,293
<i>This IS unfamiliar territory!</i>
<i>Nodoka's blushing!</i>

159
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:08,298
Wow cool, Nodoka-chan! You're an
official part of Sakuragaoka
High's history now!

160
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,134
[Ritsu] This pic would
so work for a dating site.

161
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,218
[Tsumugi] Mhm!

162
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,930
What?

163
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:21,269
[Yui] Nodoka-chan, will you lend
me your glasses please?

164
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,397
Tell me, do I look all student
councily and presidenty?

165
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,316
Not really...

166
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,984
[Yui] They don't work, huh?

167
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,112
Well I'm not really the student
council president anymore,
either.

168
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,783
Not to worry! You'll always
be presidential in my book!

169
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,326
What does that mean?

170
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,702
You ooze presidential!

171
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,538
I'm not sure that's a
compliment.

172
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,082
[Yui] Here you go! Thanks!

173
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,708
Sure.

174
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,672
See ya, Nodoka-chan!

175
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,048
[Ritsu] See you tomorrow!

176
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,633
[Mio] See you!

177
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,762
[Tsumugi] Sorry we bothered you!

178
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,485
We can make it if we go now!

179
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,320
Right, you go first!

180
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,241
Ui sad she had stuff to do at
lunch today.

181
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,242
Okay.

182
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,828
[Yui] Azu-nyan!

183
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,414
Just the girl I was looking for!

184
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,291
What are you still doing here?

185
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,960
She doesn't need us anymore.

186
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,754
Cast aside like yesterday's
trash!

187
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,841
So, what did you want anyway?

188
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:37,595
Could you see it in your heart
to please go up and buy some
lunch for us?

189
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,764
[Yui] We didn't bring any lunch
today.

190
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,766
[Azusa] Why can't you just go up
and get it yourselves?

191
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:47,105
Cause it's kind of weird for
seniors to actually be here at
school today.

192
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,774
[Azusa] Fine, I'll buy something
for you,

193
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,318
[Yui and Ritsu] Thank you!

194
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,820
So, what do you want anyway?

195
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,947
[Ritsu] A croquette bun and
melon bun!

196
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,949
[Yui] A cream bun and a cheese
bun!

197
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,993
What do you guys want?

198
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,620
I'll have a tricolor sandwich.

199
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,955
Same for me, please.

200
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,206
[Jun] Mio-senpai!

201
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,585
Um...I'll cover yours
and Mugi-senpai's lunch.

202
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,004
Uh. Well thank you.

203
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,425
So this is the exclusive
golden chocolate eclair!

204
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,177
But where is the "golden" part?

205
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,263
Wait, are you saying that you've
never eaten one of these before?

206
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,307
I can't believe you were able to
get one!

207
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,560
Well I lucked out and spotted it
stashed way back in the corner.

208
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,813
How could you hide something as
big and awesome as this guy?

209
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,024
[Yui] I will do the honors...

210
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,109
Let's eat!

211
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,614
That's sweet!

212
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,367
There's chocolate cream on the
inside!

213
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,994
I'm so happy!

214
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:48,375
Yum! I dreamed that I might be
able to eat one of these before
I graduated!

215
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,502
Now my dream's come true!

216
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,504
Oh thank you, Azu-nyan!

217
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,631
Well I've got class, go to go.

218
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:55,965
Hold on!

219
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,594
<i>[Yui] Here's a souvenir</i>
<i>for Jun-chan and Ui!</i>

220
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,139
<i>They're elusive, so they ought</i>
<i>to eat it while they can!</i>

221
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,811
We've all had these things
at lunch before.

222
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,318
[Azusa] Oh. I need to change
out of my sweats.

223
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,325
K-ON!

224
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,288
Fifth period is starting now...

225
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,083
It kind of feels like
we're playing hooky today.

226
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,503
[Yui] Do you guys have
unfinished business left
before graduating?

227
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,838
[Mio] Um...like what?

228
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,881
[Yui] Like eating the
elusive chocolate eclair.

229
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,925
[Ritsu] Let me think...

230
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,803
What is it, Mio-chan?

231
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,685
Wow I can't believe you've never
had a chance to feed Ton-chan
before.

232
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,688
Someone else always seemed
to get to it before I did.

233
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,898
[Ritsu] You really know how to
dream big.

234
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,235
Oh yeah, well let's here
what YOUR big plan is.

235
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,699
[Ritsu] I was thinking we could
do something with the leftover
club funds.

236
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,200
What've we got?

237
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,496
[Ritsu] A whole five cents.

238
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,458
Well maybe we should just leave
that here as gift.

239
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,959
Let's put bow on it!

240
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,837
[Yui] It looks like some kind
of lucky charm now!

241
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,256
Let's give it to Sawa-chan!

242
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,091
Bad idea.

243
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:25,263
Do you have anything, Mugi-chan?
Some unfinished business?

244
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,768
Nothing comes to mind.

245
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,317
Is it sixth period yet?

246
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,443
Yeah.

247
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,362
[Yui] This is a new record for
us, huh?

248
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,696
[Mio] For what?

249
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,198
[Yui] For the number of times
we've had tea today.

250
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,742
[Mio] Oh, right. Because
we started in the morning.

251
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,494
There is!

252
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,081
There is something,
some unfinished business!

253
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,086
It's so clean!

254
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,421
I bought this but never got to
use it.

255
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,924
It's specially designed to clean
windows!

256
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,426
[Yui] That's great! They're so
sparkly!

257
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:07,889
You know, it might be kind of
nice to give the club room a
good cleaning.

258
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,060
That's a great idea!

259
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,772
[Yui] Perfect! The reason we
came here today was to clean up
our messy club room!

260
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,440
[Ritsu] And clean we shall!

261
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,858
[Mio] Dial it down.

262
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,629
[Mio] All done...

263
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,297
[Yui] It's spotless!

264
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,508
[Ritsu] Can we move on
with no regrets?

265
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,676
Mhm!

266
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,803
And now we have more stuff
to take home.

267
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,054
That's your own fault.

268
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:52,434
(School bell rings)

269
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,577
[Yui] It's officially
after school!

270
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,872
[Ritsu] Sweet! And as soon as
Azusa gets here, we're gonna
rock out!

271
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,915
[Tsumugi] So shall we
have tea first?

272
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,042
[Mio] Again?!

273
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,544
Well it is our last
after school meeting.

274
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,467
S-So guys what'll we do?!

275
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,634
What do you mean?

276
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,511
Shouldn't we be doing something?

277
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,804
What exactly?

278
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,639
[Yui] Like, like-
[Tsumugi] Yui-chan, calm down.

279
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,809
Yeah but this might be
the very last time we all
ever have tea here!

280
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,437
You're just now realizing this?

281
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,357
Yui-chan.

282
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,526
What are we gonna do, Mugi-chan?

283
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,363
Why don't we leave something
behind to be remember by?

284
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,032
Like Nodoka-chan and
her pictures.

285
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,370
What do we leave?

286
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,746
[Yui] Maybe we hang
a group picture on the wall.

287
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,166
[Ritsu] Just us hanging on
the wall is weird...

288
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,502
[Yui] We can carve our names
on a desk!

289
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,087
[Mio ] No. Bad idea.

290
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,340
Then how about...
Uh let's see...

291
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,509
Our music!

292
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,718
Our songs?

293
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,345
That might work!

294
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,555
Yeah but, how do we leave them?

295
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,183
Oh I know!

296
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,227
[Jun] Going up to your
club room, Azusa?

297
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,312
Azusa-chan, if my sister
is there,

298
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,482
will you please tell her not
to stay out too late today?

299
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,239
<i>I wonder if they're still</i>
<i>drinking tea?</i>

300
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,250
Azu-nyan, you're here!

301
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,085
Come on! Set up already!

302
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,878
Are we going to play today?

303
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,921
We sure are!

304
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,090
We're playing every song
we've written.

305
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,174
All of them?

306
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,509
We're recording them!

307
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,677
[Azusa] With THIS?

308
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,845
[Yui] It's all we've got,

309
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,471
but we can make do with
a cassette for now.

310
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,266
It's like a documentary
of After-school Tea Time.

311
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,600
Proof that we were here
and stuff.

312
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,520
We wanted to leave
something of ourselves behind.

313
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,982
I totally get it!

314
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,569
Okay, here we go!

315
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,945
Yeah!

316
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:12,323
So, what song are we going to
start with?

317
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,409
Haven't thought that far
have you?

318
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,372
[Yui] Should we start off
with Fuwa Fuwa Time?

319
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,166
[Tsumugi] Wouldn't it be better
to close with that?

320
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,667
We have to open with Curry.

321
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,128
Yeah, the first track should
really be something up-tempo.

322
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,091
No way, taking our musicianship
into account, I feel that it
has to be-

323
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,718
What's up, Azu-nyan?

324
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,803
I can't believe that the word
"musicianship"

325
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,472
just came out of your mouth!

326
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,266
Oh, stop it! Why are you
acting so surprised?

327
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,143
You were itching to say that,
weren't ya?

328
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:44,147
I've got an idea why don't we
start with "Fuwa Fuwa Time"
sans vocals?

329
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,607
Sans vocals?

330
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,694
That means an instrumental.
No vocals, only instruments.

331
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,572
Oh! A karaoke version?!

332
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,407
Close, but not exactly
like that.

333
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,951
I see where you're going!
Lots of bands do that!

334
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,622
They open the album with
an instrumental and
close with one too!

335
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,748
That's right!

336
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,000
I gotcha, but we'll keep it
simple right?

337
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:08,672
I guess we kind of have to.
We are sort of pressed for time.

338
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:12,008
It's harder than it looks to
put together a set list,
isn't it?

339
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,094
[Tsumugi] Shall I make some tea?

340
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,220
Good idea!

341
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,013
I'm worried about the time.

342
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,016
But you've got to catch up with
us you haven't had any tea at
all today!

343
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,352
[Azusa] That's because
I actually had classes.

344
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,729
[Yui] I know right?
Which means that you need tea!

345
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,149
I think we must've drank at
least a gallon of tea today!

346
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,568
[Mio] That's not something
to brag about.

347
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:36,157
I think we should record
all of this too.

348
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,992
You see, the thing about
After-school Tea Time,

349
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,246
is we're a rock band,
but not just any rock band,

350
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,415
we've captured the intense rock
and roll spirit of everyday

351
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,500
high schoolers who
live in the moment.

352
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,627
Hey, now you're just
trying to talk us up.

353
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,338
Hey, we're leaving this for
future club members, aren't we?

354
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,926
All right, President Ri-chan,
Tell us what After-school
means to you?

355
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,095
Let me think...

356
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,223
Wasting our lives away, I guess.

357
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,309
You have a point.

358
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,644
She definitely does.

359
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,688
Now let's play it back!

360
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,068
[Ritsu's recording]
Let me think...

361
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,779
[Ritsu's recording] Wasting
our lives away, I guess.

362
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,407
[Mio's Recording]
You have a point.

363
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,200
[Azusa's recording]
She definitely does.

364
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,661
[Yui's recording]
Now let's play it back!

365
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,413
Does my voice really
sound like that?

366
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:27,250
I say we don't record this!
I think we should just
record our songs!

367
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,253
Aw, come on it's fun!

368
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,089
Stop doing that!

369
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,424
Did we get all of that?

370
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,634
[Azusa] No!
[Azusa's recording]
Stop doing that!

371
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,596
I'm scary...

372
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,722
Now you know...

373
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,058
You're scary when you get mad,
Azu-nyan!

374
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,436
I'm sorry. I had no idea
that I sounded like that.

375
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:51,691
Hey, no more messing around
guys! We have to work out
the set list!

376
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,651
[Yui] Meanie!
[Ritsu] See? Terrifying!

377
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,159
[Sawako]
That was so much work...

378
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,668
One more done!

379
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,672
Oh Sawa-chan!

380
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,881
You're recording, huh?

381
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,425
Mhm. Every song
After-school Tea Time has!

382
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:21,596
We thought it might be kind of
nice to leave behind a
recording of our music.

383
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,099
Since she's here,
shall we have some tea?

384
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,102
I'm fine, keep recording.

385
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,270
[Ritsu] Next, Brush Pen,
Ballpoint Pen!

386
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,856
[Yui] Oops, wait!
Time for a potty break!

387
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,775
[Tsumugi] I'll go, too!

388
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,193
[Mio] Wait for me!

389
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,236
[Ritsu] Potty all around.

390
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,779
[Azusa] You're ALL going?

391
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:41,282
That's what happens when you
drink nothing but tea all day.

392
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,036
Aw man.

393
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,080
I'd better go, too.

394
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,708
Once again, Brush Pen,
Ballpoint Pen!

395
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,668
Alright now, here goes!

396
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,961
Recording!

397
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,754
(P.A. Chimes)

398
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,298
[P.A.] Mr. Yamamoto of
the Biology Dept,
[Yui] Our take's ruined...

399
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,717
[P.A.] you have a phone call.

400
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,843
Yui-chan.

401
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,011
Yeah?

402
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,805
Do you want me to help
with the recording?

403
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,141
That's okay, just sit there
and watch!

404
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,809
Okay.

405
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,936
Here we go for real!

406
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,440
(Tsumugi sneezes)

407
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:14,983
I'm sorry!

408
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,901
Forget it, let's play!

409
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:17,986
Yeah!

410
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,612
Let's play!

411
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:23,074
And here we go! One, two, three!

412
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:27,454
(Music playing)

413
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:39,883
Finally done...

414
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,177
Just whose big idea
was that, anyway?

415
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:46,931
We really did it, though.
We actually made our
first album.

416
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,436
Here Let me see it.

417
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,359
And done.

418
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,902
Hey let's listen to it!

419
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,987
(Girls all agreeing)

420
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:04,074
Just one song. It's late, and
you all have a big day tomorrow.

421
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,701
I still haven't bought
a new pair of tights yet!

422
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,119
[Tsumugi] Why don't you buy
some on the way home?

423
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,373
[Azusa] Hey, does the room
seem cleaner to you guys?

424
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,750
[Yui] Azu-nyan!
You finally noticed!

425
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:17,212
[Azusa] But your uniform
is filthy.

426
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,213
(Yui freaks out, girls laugh)

427
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,465
[Ritsu] Yeah, you're gross!

428
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:25,970
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")
