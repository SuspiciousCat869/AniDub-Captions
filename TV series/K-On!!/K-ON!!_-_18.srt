1
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:07,007
[Nodoka]
Miss Tachibana. Miss Akiyama.

2
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:11,177
Miss Matsumoto. Miss Akiyama.

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,806
Miss Tachibana. Miss Akiyama.

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:19,769
All right then, for our
production of Romeo and Juliet
at the school festival,

5
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:24,232
Our class has voted that the
role of Romeo will be played by
Mio Akiyama.

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,234
Mio-chan's the star!

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,652
That's amazing!

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,071
Way to rock it, Mio!

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,451
Anyone home there?

10
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,705
She's out cold.

11
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:44,419
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

12
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,847
I-I object!

13
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,682
[Nodoka] To what, Miss Akiyama?

14
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:26,187
Um well, you see, it's just
that, I don't think it's
a good idea,

15
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,939
to vote on who should be
the lead actors.

16
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,609
But if you'll recall there were
no volunteers or nominations,
either.

17
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,486
Fine! Then I-I nominate Ritsu!

18
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,740
She's energetic, and brave! And
she's always practicing pro
wrestling moves!

19
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,950
What does that have to do
with being Romeo?

20
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,746
I mean after all you're the only
girl here with her very own fan
club.

21
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,081
That makes you the obvious
choice!

22
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:49,294
I get it! The obvious choice
to play Ro-MEO is Mio?

23
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,212
Is that your idea of a joke?!

24
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,839
Relax, it'll be fun.

25
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,425
And hey on the day of the play,
I'll even do your makeup!

26
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,136
I'm thinking, lots of heavy,
purple eyeshadow...

27
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,512
I'm Romeo not a witch!

28
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,556
And I'll be sitting there
right in the front row,

29
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,976
making sure that I catch
every second of it on video!

30
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,728
Put yourself in my shoes...

31
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,979
[Nodoka] Miss Tainaka.

32
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,023
You've been cast too, as Juliet.

33
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,025
Nope! Objection!

34
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,320
Wow Ritsu, that's quite the 180
you've just made now that the
tables have turned.

35
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,906
How in the world could
I possibly play Juliet?

36
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,659
The decision wasn't mine.
The class voted for you to play
that role.

37
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,829
But there's lots of people
in class better suited for that
roll!

38
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,164
Like, uh...Mugi there!

39
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,668
I'd love that role, but I'm
directing.

40
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,088
How about Ichigo, then? She's
got that "cute princess" thing
going on!

41
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,964
No way.

42
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,257
What about you, Mika?

43
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,385
Didn't you say you wanted
to play a princess?

44
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,637
But Mio's been cast as Romeo.

45
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,346
So what?

46
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,555
It's gotta be!

47
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,807
Look, if Mio is playing Romeo,

48
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,476
then the only one
who can play Juliet is you!

49
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,894
[Girl] Hey she's right,
you know!
[Ritsu] What!?

50
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,021
Yeah think about it, you guys
are a duo.

51
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,233
You can't put the straight guy
up there without the funny
sidekick!

52
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,567
What are we, a vaudeville team?!

53
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,778
If Mio-chan and Ri-chan
are gonna be the leads,

54
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,197
then I think I'm going to make
some major rewrites!

55
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,865
[Both] What are you up to?

56
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,535
Okay, since there are no real
objections to be dealt with
here,

57
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,913
Then I'm going to move on to
selecting who will do the other
jobs.

58
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,206
[Ritsu] She just blew us off...

59
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,916
First, up the costumes-

60
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,543
Me! I nominate myself!

61
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,878
Yes but we can't ask a teacher
to-

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,008
It's okay, I promise you won't
regret it.

63
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,761
Why are you so scared?

64
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,348
[Azusa] Wow, so your class is
going to be putting on a play,
huh?

65
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,641
[Tsumugi] Yes we are!

66
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,935
Which is why Mio-senpai's like
that?

67
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:35,567
I have to say, the thought of
you on a stage playing Juliet
is-

68
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,402
If you wanna laugh, fine! Go on!

69
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,614
I wasn't laughing at you
I promise, I was just...

70
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,325
Okay that's it!

71
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,952
I'm sorry!

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,413
You laughed again!

73
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,622
I'm sorry!

74
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,042
Wait who's Yui-senpai playing?

75
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,710
Tree! I'm tree G!

76
00:04:53,752 --> 00:05:00,508
A, B, C, D, E, F... does the
play really need that many
trees?

77
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,306
[Yui] Having to stand perfectly
still... makes this a very
demanding role!

78
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,974
<i>What kind of play are they</i>
<i>putting on?</i>

79
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,018
[Tsumugi] Okay we need to run
some lines right now,

80
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,270
so I'm going to head
back to the classroom.

81
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,773
Once Mio calms down, we'll join
you.

82
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,985
Now, then... What to do about
Mio?

83
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,781
Hey, Ton-chan would you
like to trade places with me?

84
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,324
[Ritsu] Mio.

85
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,369
[Azusa] I know you can do it!
You'll make a fantastic Romeo!

86
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,871
I can't wait to see you on
stage!

87
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:34,626
I really wouldn't get your hopes
up too high. I don't want to do
this at all.

88
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,336
But you landed the lead role!

89
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:40,674
This year's school festival is
going to be like all Mio all the
time!

90
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,139
[Ritsu] Really? Were you trying
to make her feel worse?

91
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,599
[Azusa] I'm so sorry!

92
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:56,064
Hey where are you going?!
We've got to rehearse the play!

93
00:05:56,106 --> 00:06:01,277
Oh yeah, I just remembered,
I'm transferring to a different
school.

94
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,323
You see, my papa is moving the
whole family to Irkutsk because
of his job.

95
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,324
Terrible liar.

96
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,200
"Papa"?

97
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,494
I meant Dad!

98
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,163
A-Anyway, that's what's
happening. Goodbye!

99
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,000
Not so fast!

100
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,504
Come on, let me go! I'll move
back as soon as the school
festival is over!

101
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,673
But what about our show?!

102
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,425
[Mio] My twin sister will fill
in for me!

103
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,467
You don't have one!

104
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,469
Wait it was a dream?!

105
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,138
Wow, that was scary!

106
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,683
I had this crazy dream where
I was picked to play Romeo in a
play!

107
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,686
She just keeps sinking
deeper into a state of denial.

108
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,605
All right, I think it's time
we start practicing for

109
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,065
our concert at the school fes-!

110
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,066
[Ritsu] We're going.

111
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,693
No! I don't wanna! I don't
wanna!

112
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,278
[Mio] No! Please!
[Ritsu] Shut up!

113
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,905
[Mio] Forehead freak!
(door closes)

114
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,034
Shouldn't you be going there
too?

115
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:53,455
I have to practice holding
completely still, Nodoka-chan
said so.

116
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,873
Oh.

117
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,962
Hark Benvolio! Is Benvolio here
praytell?

118
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,507
[Nodoka] She wont?

119
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,760
She says we can't talk her into
it.

120
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,887
A lead role is just too much...

121
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,806
It's too bad, but she has
the concert to think of too.

122
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:16,770
I see. Well, if you're that dead
set against it, I may
reconsider.

123
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,229
Really?

124
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,899
But just remember you were
chosen to do this by your class,

125
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,194
so maybe you should
at least give it a try.

126
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,697
The whole class seems
to be into this play. See look.

127
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,867
As I hate all Montagues,
repent thine ways!

128
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,328
It's sounding like a samurai
drama!

129
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,581
(girls laugh)

130
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,916
I'll try.

131
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,750
That's great!

132
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,628
Nodoka's persuasive.

133
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,090
I really don't think the class
picked Mio for her acting
skills, though.

134
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,301
I can hardly wait to see Mio
play Romeo!

135
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,678
Me too!

136
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,102
Hark, art thou not Romeo sir,
and a Montague as well?

137
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,603
[Tsumugi] Cut!

138
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,481
Ri-chan, I need you to dig
deeper into Juliet's emotions!

139
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,108
I'm sorry...

140
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,527
And now you, Romeo!

141
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:10,407
Okay... I'm happy to be neither,
fair maiden, if thee by chance
happen-

142
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,783
[Tsumugi] Cut!
[Mio] -to dislike...

143
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,036
Mio-chan, you're still
way too embarrassed.

144
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,579
You're really harsh.

145
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,957
You're up, Ri-chan!

146
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,250
Where was I?

147
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,710
[Ritsu] Do I really have to say-
[Tsumugi] No cut!

148
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,045
[Tsumugi] You're still-
[Ritsu] Mugi.

149
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,924
You're not just shouting "Cut!"
all the time because you think
it's fun, are you?

150
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:34,305
Maybe I am. I guess I just
wanted to sound like a director,
sorry.

151
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,475
You need to talk louder, Mio,
or no one will hear you.

152
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,019
Okay, sorry.

153
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,647
[Girl] You've got a great voice,
so let us all hear it!

154
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,067
[Tsumugi] Alright, let's focus
on that and try it again.

155
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,111
We'll start with your line,
Ri-chan.

156
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,821
[Ritsu] Got it. Um...

157
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,199
Good night, good night!
Parting is such sweet sorrow...

158
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,662
So I guess that I shall just say
good night then or something...

159
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,457
Ri-chan, you have more lines.

160
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:04,085
...till it be the morrow.

161
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,337
GAH!

162
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,838
I'm gonna hurl!
What kind of dialogue is this?!

163
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,089
Now SHE'S losing it?

164
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,008
And what's with this damn story,
anyway?

165
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,968
Everything they say
is all hoighty toighty!

166
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,678
If they really hate
their parents that much,

167
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,638
just run away already and be
done with it!

168
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,474
[Girls] It's a Shakespeare
meltdown...

169
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,560
And it looks like Mio's
spiraling down again, too.

170
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,187
[Girl] I give up.

171
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,195
[Mio] I'm done.

172
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,906
And now you can see why the
class is rather concerned about
them.

173
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,324
[Azusa] Well, I definitely see

174
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,868
how Ritsu-senpai playing
Juliet could pose a problem.

175
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,995
[Ritsu] No, don't sugar coat it
for me...

176
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,039
Wow, she can barely get a
comeback out!

177
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,541
Oh, hey! I just had a great
idea!

178
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,627
Like what?

179
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,003
Listen, listen!

180
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,714
If Ri-chan starts acting
more feminine in general,

181
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,883
and if Mio-chan starts
acting more masculine,

182
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,885
even when they're
not rehearsing for the play...

183
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,054
[Azusa] Oh yeah, that actually
might work!

184
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,972
All right, it's settled,
from now on Ri-chan,

185
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,183
you can no longer talk like a
tomboy.

186
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:00,892
Dude, come on!

187
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,852
Yep! No more of that.

188
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,273
[Yui] And let's hold our teacup
in both hands, shall we?

189
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,859
[Yui] And stick out your pinky!
[Ritsu] What for?

190
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,236
Oh! And you also have to make
sure

191
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,030
that your blouse is always
tucked into your skirt!

192
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,659
Feels weird.

193
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,202
It kind of looks weird on you
too.

194
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,663
[Yui] We're finished with
Mio-chan!

195
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,876
[Mio] Is this really going to
help?

196
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,671
I don't like it...

197
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,632
Whatever. Let's just practice.

198
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,719
Now my waist feels all sweaty.

199
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,928
[Yui and Tsumugi] Sit like a
lady!

200
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,764
I can't do that while
I'm playing the drums!

201
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,601
This still feels pretty weird...

202
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,646
I can feel a draft hitting my
stomach.

203
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,234
Hey, Ritsu.

204
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,655
I know it's kinda late, but
shouldn't we just tell them that
we want to quit?

205
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,907
R-Ritsu?

206
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:02,454
[Ritsu] Ah! I can't handle how
stuffy I feel with my shirt all
tucked in!

207
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,788
Fix yours the way you like Mio.

208
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,957
Intensive training begins now!

209
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,586
[Ritsu] You wanna go on letting
them make fools of us?! Is that
okay with you?!

210
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,962
[Mio] Yeah, I guess it is.

211
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,882
[Ritsu] Well, it's not okay
with me! Let's get to it!

212
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,309
K-ON!

213
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,897
[Satoshi] You're in a play?
Seriously?

214
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,274
Yeah. So don't come into
my room while we're rehearsing.

215
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,360
[Satoshi] What role are you
playing?

216
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,694
I'm Juliet.

217
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,779
(sputtering)

218
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,990
Don't laugh! It's not funny!

219
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:46,081
How silver-sweet sound lovers'
tongues by night like softest
music-

220
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,624
[Ritsu] Wrong! All wrong!

221
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,835
You keep acting like that missy,
and you'll never be a star!

222
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,587
Who are you?

223
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,881
Let's hear what YOU'VE got then!

224
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,592
Sure, I'm way better...

225
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,302
Hark, tis almost morning;

226
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:03,348
Like a poor prisoner in his
twisted gyves, And with a silk
thread-

227
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,975
[Mio] Y-You are SO not Juliet!

228
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,270
Quit laughing!
At least I can get the line
right!

229
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:14,025
Well the line maybe right,
but you are way wrong!

230
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,152
Oh shut it.

231
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,239
(Satoshi and Mio laughing)

232
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,701
It's hopeless.

233
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,328
At least we managed
to get all the lines
memorized...

234
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,956
Yeah, but you were
laughing the whole time.

235
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:32,919
Well of course, I mean
your Juliet is kinda-

236
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,838
What? The very thought
of it makes you laugh?

237
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,048
Your Romeo's nothing special
either,

238
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,009
whenever you said a line
your eyes would get all shifty,

239
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,721
like the last thing you
were interested in was me!

240
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,349
But I can't help it.
I'm nervous like that in real
life too.

241
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:51,438
You know, they should've picked
you to be Juliet not me.

242
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,106
You can do nervous and timid...

243
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,985
Romeo, O Romeo!
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

244
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:01,281
Come on, I'm not like that!
If you were Romeo, you'd be all-

245
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:06,911
Ah Juliet, what light through
yonder window dost break?

246
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:07,871
Like that.

247
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,664
Romeo wouldn't talk like that.

248
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:13,293
[Mio] All I'm saying is that
you'd be better at playing Romeo
than Juliet.

249
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:17,547
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou
as far as that vast shore
wash'd-

250
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,215
What?

251
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,925
Your performance was spot-on!

252
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,430
You know, when you were trying
to be me your Juliet was good
too!

253
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,767
[Mio and Ritsu] We did it!

254
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,730
[Girl] Then hie you hence
to Friar Laurence's cell!

255
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:38,735
Hie to high fortune!
Honest nurse, farewell.

256
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:42,405
So Ritsu is playing Juliet
by imagining Mio playing her?

257
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,240
And Mio is choosing her
performance based,

258
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,786
on how she imagines Ritsu
would be playing the role of
Romeo?

259
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,412
That's confusing...

260
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,997
So Mio is Ritsu?

261
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,127
The heavens smile upon on us!

262
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,713
Amen, amen. But come what sorrow
can-

263
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,756
[Class] Speak up!

264
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,633
C'mon, Mio, you did this
yesterday!

265
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:06,554
Yeah I know, but that was in
front of you this is totally
different now.

266
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,056
[Ritsu] Goodness...

267
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,766
[Tsumugi] Then maybe you should
just pretend that Ri-chan is

268
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,643
the only one here in the class
room.

269
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,311
Just Ritsu?

270
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,107
What's up?

271
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,858
Come on, dude.

272
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,319
("Ritsus" talking at once)

273
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,320
So noisy...

274
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,655
["Ritsus"] Was that a crack at
me!

275
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,782
I really hope she can get
over her stage fright.

276
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,909
If not we're going to be in
trouble.

277
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,745
Yeah, I suppose you're right...
I know!

278
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,290
[Tsumugi] Mio-chan!
Are you free this Sunday?

279
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,250
For what?

280
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,544
To give you some special
training!

281
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,628
Are you in?

282
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,629
Do I need it?

283
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,131
Just what do you have in mind?

284
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,508
Okay, listen close...

285
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,469
Good idea...

286
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:50,056
I just remembered! I have plans
this Sunday! I totally forgot!

287
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,058
[Class] Miss Akiyama!

288
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,395
Fine.

289
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,482
W-What IS this place?

290
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,818
It's a high end tea room
run by a family friend.

291
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,111
Tea room?!

292
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,947
Yep! And we're going
to be working here today!

293
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,657
Yeah the idea is, that working

294
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,076
with all these customers will
help get you over your stage
fright!

295
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,079
Well, come on, everyone let's
go!

296
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,666
That looks really nice on you!

297
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,001
Yeah? You think so?

298
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,712
Yours is super cute, too,
Mugi-senpai.

299
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,047
Aw thank you!

300
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,381
And Ritsu... you look...

301
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:29,220
If you've got something to say,
just go on and spit it out!

302
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,515
Mine feels kinda tight to me...

303
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,933
Yeah, so does mine.

304
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,853
Hey, Are you sure you gave them
the right sizes for us?

305
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,605
I did. But they said
they might not all fit

306
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,649
since we're kind of in
a growing spurt right now.

307
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,859
Where does it feel tight?

308
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,029
Well, it's a bit tight
around the waist for me.

309
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,239
For me it's across the chest.

310
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,576
[Yui] Mio-chan?

311
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,787
Very well, girls,
I'll leave it to you, then.

312
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,957
Now you might feel a bit
overwhelmed until you find your
footing, but you'll get it.

313
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,668
Just remember, the important
thing

314
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,796
is to greet the customers with
a big smile and a warm welcome.

315
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:03,880
Yes, sir!

316
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,173
A big smile?

317
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,634
Azu-nyan, what do you say?
Let's give it a try!

318
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,968
Sure.

319
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,553
How may I help you?

320
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,515
Thank you so much for coming
today!

321
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,142
Yeah, we get it, you're both
real cute.

322
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,478
[Yui] Now you give it a try,
Ri-chan!

323
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,357
Well uh...sure...

324
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,445
Thank you so much for waiting!

325
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,116
Were you the one that
ordered the apple tea, sir?

326
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,076
I didn't know you could be so
cute!

327
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,536
That's enough from you!

328
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,620
Azusa!

329
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,747
By the way girls, where is Miss
Akiyama?

330
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:43,503
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's see,
chances are that she's just
hiding somewhere.

331
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,548
Commander! I've spied her over
there!

332
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,676
Come on. You wont get any better
if you keep hiding back here all
day.

333
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:53,013
[Mio] You don't need me!
You've already got plenty of
waitresses.

334
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,180
I'll just get in the way!

335
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,058
We're here because of YOU,
remember?

336
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,019
[Mio] All right, fine...

337
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,687
[Shop Owner] If you're ready,
I'll open for business.

338
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,604
(door opens)

339
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,816
Here you are, Miss.

340
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,736
So this doesn't make
you guys nervous at all?!

341
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,279
I guess you could say...

342
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,532
that thanks to a certain someone
we've built up out tolerance.

343
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,951
[Woman] Excuse me.

344
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,203
[Ritsu] Go on, your audience is
waiting!

345
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,122
Just get in there!

346
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:28,048
I uh... would you... have a nice
flight!

347
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,722
Could you take our order now?

348
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:39,100
Yes, of course, go ahead.

349
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,977
My pen...where'd I?

350
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,605
It's all right, there's really
no hurry.

351
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,190
I am very sorry!

352
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,400
Please just give me one minute!

353
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,403
Yui! Quick, I need
something to write with!

354
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,781
Here!

355
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,699
Why is there string cheese
in your pocket?!

356
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,911
[Yui] The nice old man in
the kitchen said I could have
it.

357
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,871
But if you need it, here you go!

358
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,248
A pen! Not a piece of cheese!

359
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,959
[Yui] Oh, well this is a pen!

360
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:05,794
You see?

361
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,754
That's confusing!

362
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,172
It's a skit, right?

363
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,174
Has to be.

364
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,009
They must be high-schoolers.

365
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,719
Well they're awfully cute.

366
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,182
[Mio] T-Thank you for waiting.

367
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,642
No problem.

368
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:21,935
You okay?

369
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,479
Y-Yes, ma'am! Thanks for asking.

370
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,193
Are you all right, Mio-chan?

371
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,070
I'm just not very good at this.

372
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,738
Everywhere I go I create a mess.

373
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,533
Instead of thinking of the
customers as a bunch of
strangers,

374
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,411
why don't you try imagining
them as your close friends?

375
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,371
I guess I could try that.

376
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:46,126
Let's see... I'll have the
parfait and the vanilla ice
cream, oh and the cake!

377
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,962
What else? What else?
Gimme a minute, 'kay?

378
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,338
Oh sure.

379
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,923
I'll take the custard plate
please, and supersize it!

380
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,925
[Mio] I'm not so sure
we can do that.
[Yui] Yum pie!

381
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,428
[Ritsu]C'mon, of course you can!
[Yui] That sounds good
but so does....

382
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,014
All you have to do is put some
extra custard on the plate!

383
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,265
And now I'm annoyed.

384
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,142
Oh dear, that's not good...

385
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:06,646
She doesn't exactly seem to
be picking this up so easily,
does she Senpai?

386
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:07,897
Not at all.

387
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,733
But even when
she's playing bass for the band,

388
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,986
she's only half as good live as
she is when we're just
practicing.

389
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:17,407
But for the really big concerts
she does do fine. She can even
sing, too.

390
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,075
Yeah, you're right about that!

391
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,453
When she's backed in
a corner, she- Hold on!

392
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,580
Maybe if she had no choice
she could do it.

393
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,584
Girls? This is generally
a slow time of day for us,

394
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,128
so if you all would like to take
a break got right ahead.

395
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,212
Okay, thanks!

396
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,173
You too Miss Akiyama and Miss
Kotabuki.

397
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,050
Ah no break for Mio.

398
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,886
She's the one that needs
the practice, so get to it!

399
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,763
Well if you say so.

400
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:40,930
[Mio] R-Ritsu!

401
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,183
See ya! C'mon, it's break time!

402
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,060
Wait! I feel bad leaving her!

403
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,770
[Ritsu] Trust me.

404
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,438
Ah. All right.

405
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,773
[Ritsu] Yui and Mugi,

406
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,274
[Ritsu] you're on a break too!
[Mio] Ugh, Ritsu...

407
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,778
This cup is really beautiful!

408
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,322
[Tsumugi] From what I'm told all
the tableware they use here

409
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,032
was brought over from Europe.

410
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,158
Wow, really?

411
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,118
Yep, and the tea that I'm always
serving,

412
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,454
at the Light Music Club
comes from here, too.

413
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,376
It's expensive.

414
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,961
You haven't looked at the menu,
till now?

415
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:16,508
It's shocking to learn we've
been guzzling such expensive tea
this whole time, huh?

416
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,803
Do you really think Mio-chan
is gonna be okay out there?

417
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,013
She looked like she
was having a rough time.

418
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,225
I think that when she's under
pressure, she always steps up.

419
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,726
Guess we'll soon find out.

420
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,688
[Mio] Thanks for dining with us
today!

421
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,318
[Yui] Wow, check out Mio-chan!

422
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,195
That smile alone gets
perfect marks!

423
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,530
See?

424
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,200
Mio-chan!

425
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,662
Mio-chan?

426
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,248
This is bad!
It's a smile trance!

427
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,792
Yo! Mio! Get it together!

428
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,545
[Ritsu] Oh no!
What have I done?!

429
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:58,967
[Mio] Good morning!

430
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,135
Wow!

431
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,638
[Yui] Her smile is perfect!

432
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,473
That special training
must have worked!

433
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,643
Yeah, and at the end, she got
pretty good at dealing with
the customers.

434
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,855
[Mio] Mhm, now I can interact
with them.

435
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:12,981
Really?

436
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,066
[Mio] But back to my face...

437
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,361
It's been stuck this way
since yesterday.

438
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,530
It was really that hard on you?

439
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:24,451
Sorry! But don't worry,
I'll fix you right up!

440
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,661
[Mio] Ow!
[Ritsu] Get better, get better!

441
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,414
[Mio] It's fixed!
[Yui] The old Mio-chan is back!

442
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:33,418
The real question is, do you
think you'll be alright for the
play rehearsals today?

443
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,919
[Mio] Not at all.

444
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,590
Customers and audiences are
two different things entirely.

445
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,300
I dressed like that for nothing?

446
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,052
But your smile was perfect!

447
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,929
[Tsumugi] Give it a try, maybe
you'll find you did learn
something.

448
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,681
[Mio] I doubt it.

449
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,853
So, Mio-senpai and Ritsu-senpai
are-

450
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:55,440
Mhm. They said they're going
to have to double their
rehearsal time,

451
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,233
just to get comfortable with the
play!

452
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,736
Oh. Okay then.

453
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,207
[Yui] And now...

454
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,918
When the curtain falls,
I exit the stage!

455
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,631
Is our show gonna be okay?

456
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:25,470
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")

457
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,309
[Jun] The auditorium is
packed already!

458
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,393
[Ui] Are there any seats left?

459
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,645
[Mio] For I have known pain!

460
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,399
[Mio] No sweets before bedtime.

461
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,901
