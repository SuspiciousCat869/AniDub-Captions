1
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,803
Oof...

2
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,475
Here we go...

3
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,195
Hey, this is...

4
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,825
[Nodoka] Dear Sokabe-senpai.

5
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,704
The weather has finally turned
warm. How have you been?

6
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:42,500
I'm writing to you today because
there is something that I wish
to tell you about.

7
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:47,756
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

8
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,144
Oh, Mio-chan? What's wrong?
You seem real fidgety.

9
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:28,189
Well, I've had this weird
feeling all morning long that
I'm being watched.

10
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,941
It's because you're really
popular.

11
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,904
No, not that, Mugi. It's almost
like somebody is staring at me.

12
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,366
Staaaaare...

13
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,909
[Mio] Don't do that!

14
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,370
Sure you're not just being
self-conscious?

15
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,872
Ritsu, I'm serious!

16
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,542
I can feel someone's eyes
on my back at this very second!

17
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,170
[Sawako] Guess who!

18
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,464
Heh.

19
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,633
[Girls] Sawa-chan...

20
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,801
Huh?

21
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,561
[Sawako] So you feel like
someone's watching you, huh?

22
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,564
Personally, everyone's eyes
are always on me!

23
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,192
Because your book has
a really nice COVER, anyway.

24
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,443
Hey! What do you mean, "cover"?!

25
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,320
Maybe you're the culprit
who's been tailing,

26
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,821
Mio around and creeping her out.

27
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,657
As if! If it were me, I wouldn't
stop at just watching her!

28
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,826
Oh yeah, good point!
(laughing)

29
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,871
I've got it! The culprit
is really Ton-chan!

30
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,206
Huh?

31
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,333
See? It's all because
you're scared of Ton-chan,

32
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,460
and you always try
to avoid looking at him.

33
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,296
So Ton-chan glomped onto your
back!

34
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,715
[Mio] Get it off! Get it off!

35
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,677
<i>[Mio] It's no use... These</i>
<i>people aren't going to help me.</i>

36
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,680
Come on guys, I think you should
show a little more concern here!

37
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,140
She might be the target
of some creepy stalker!

38
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,350
Azusa!

39
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,020
Now I see. I think I solved the
mystery.

40
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,397
The culprit...

41
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,566
Is you!

42
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,569
(confused)

43
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,405
[Tsumugi] I'm sorry guys,
I always wanted to do that!

44
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,990
But the part about solving
the mystery was true.

45
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:05,078
Mio-chan, you had a yakisoba bun
for breakfast this morning,
right?

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,038
Y-You're right, I did!

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,875
I overslept and didn't have time
to sit down and eat breakfast
like I usually do.

48
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,545
And that yakisoba bun
was 20% off, wasn't it?!

49
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,380
H-How in the world did you know
that?!

50
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,965
(giggling)

51
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,555
From this. You see?

52
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,889
Hm?

53
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,808
Uh!

54
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,769
Oh, I get it! You've been
walking around all day with that
stuck to your hair!

55
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,147
That's why everyone was staring
at me?!

56
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,733
[Nodoka] What are you two doing
out here?

57
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,486
[Mio] Nodoka, who are these two?

58
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,696
[Nodoka] I'm not-

59
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,197
[Fan A] Hey we're not
criminals or anything!

60
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,242
Yeah! We're just members
of the Mio-senpai Fan Club!

61
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,827
The fan club?

62
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,330
Ugh, I came THIS close to
forgetting about that picture...

63
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:53,084
Wait, you didn't come here to
see the sticker in Mio-chan's
hair, did you?

64
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,128
Yeah! We heard about it from
the other members!

65
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,922
If you're her fans, why didn't
you say something to her about
it?

66
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,092
Well, I did say to everyone
that we really ought to tell
her...

67
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,013
But having something stuck in
her hair like that is just so
Mio-y and wonderful!

68
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,765
<i>[Ritsu] Wonderful?</i>

69
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,351
I was actually wondering if you
had stuck that thing there on
purpose!

70
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,436
You mean you knew about it!?!

71
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,813
[Nodoka] I'm sorry.

72
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,691
It's because I've been so
undependable that those two fan
club girls-

73
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,068
What are YOU apologizing for?

74
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,779
Wow, I didn't know
your fan club was still around!

75
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,075
[Tsumugi] Yeah! I thought it had
disbanded after Sokabe-senpai
graduated.

76
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,743
Wait, Sokabe-senpai? Who's that?

77
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,953
Oh yeah, that's right, you never
met her.

78
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,791
She used to be the president of
the offical Mio-chan Fan Club
here at school.

79
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:37,754
That's right... Oh has it been
so long since those events
transpired?

80
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,089
What events?

81
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,801
[Ritsu] Well, it was March,
just before graduation.

82
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,514
Mio was scared, thinking that
she was being constantly watched
by someone.

83
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,977
I couldn't bear seeing her like
that,

84
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,023
so I advised her to go talk
to the Student Council about it.

85
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,316
Really the Student Council?

86
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,152
Dial down your imagination,
okay?

87
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,196
Nobody took me seriously,

88
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:08,076
so I decided on my own to go
talk to the Student Council
about what was happening.

89
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,787
So you feel like there's someone
always watching you?

90
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,706
I wonder if it's a stalker?

91
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,376
It's hard to believe there could
be a intruder on campus, but-

92
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,878
Mio, why are you crying?

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,840
I'm so happy that someone
is finally reacting normally!

94
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,676
<i>How are they treating her</i>
<i>in the Light Music Club?</i>

95
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,345
[Megumi] Miss Manabe, are you
there?

96
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,555
Oh Senpai?

97
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,514
Oh, we have a visitor?

98
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,932
[Nodoka] Is there a problem?

99
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,393
[Megumi] Not at all, I brought
the handover paperwork.

100
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,020
Nodoka, who is this?

101
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,605
[Nodoka] Megumi Sokabe,
the Student Council President.

102
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,192
Well, former president.
A pleasure, Miss Akiyama.

103
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,028
Uh, same here.

104
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,947
I suppose that a member of the
Light Music Club might not have
heard of me.

105
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,323
I-I'm really sorry!

106
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,701
[Ritsu] That was the moment
of their first encounter!

107
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,078
However, poor unsuspecting Mio

108
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,707
had absolutely no idea what
fate held in store for them!

109
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,709
Lay off the creepy narration,
will ya?

110
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,211
So what kind of fate
are you talking about?

111
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,630
That's where it gets weird...

112
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,676
[Megumi] Here. I'm afraid it's
not as fancy as the Light Music
Club's tea.

113
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,428
Not at all, this is fine.

114
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,348
Wow, a stalker...
This is a rather serious matter.

115
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,226
Miss Manabe, will you please
inform the Disciplinary
Committee of this?

116
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,561
Yes of course.

117
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,271
Y-You don't need to go
through all that trouble!

118
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,816
It's no trouble at all. If a
student at our school has a
problem,

119
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,443
we want to do everything
we can to help them out.

120
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,696
<i>I wish my club president</i>
<i>could hear you say that...</i>

121
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,908
Still, I wonder what sort of
person would follow Mio around?

122
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,078
A member of her fan club,
perhaps?

123
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,662
You know about that?

124
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,581
Oh. What's wrong?

125
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,543
Uh nothing, it's just that you
know an awful lot about the
Light Music Club.

126
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,629
You even knew my name.

127
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:47,008
[Nodoka] Come to think of it,
you also knew that their club
has tea parties.

128
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,096
Um... You must have mentioned
it to me, Miss Manabe!

129
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,305
I don't think I did.

130
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,807
Really, you didn't?

131
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,394
Well, the Light Music Club is
rather famous around school.

132
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,105
Well, I should be going now,
goodbye.

133
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,692
Senpai. Wait you dropped
something.

134
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,945
"Mio Akiyama Fan Club Membership
Card"...

135
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,614
[Megumi] I found this in the
hall earlier!

136
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:14,744
But Miss Sokabe, your name
was written on the front of it.

137
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,456
<i>Oh no, I have to say something</i>
<i>to break the tension!</i>

138
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,334
Gosh, is it possible
that you're the culprit?

139
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,294
Oh right, as if!

140
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,506
(laughter)

141
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:30,844
Miss Sokabe, you couldn't be
the stalker yourself, could you,
huh?

142
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,432
I didn't mean to frighten you!

143
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,933
Uh?!

144
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,978
[Megumi] I'm graduating soon,
you know?

145
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,315
The thought of never seeing you
again was almost unbearable...

146
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,694
I just couldn't help myself...

147
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,072
[Mio] It's okay.

148
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,200
I have to admit that I'm
flattered to hear you say that.

149
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,618
And embarrassed, too...

150
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,620
Miss Akiyama...

151
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,582
[Nodoka] Member #1?

152
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,460
Yeah that's right, I'm also
the president of the fan club.

153
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,004
(shocked)

154
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,923
So you mean the Student Council
President was actually the
culprit?

155
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,718
She couldn't be open about it
because of her position.

156
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,219
I suppose.

157
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,181
It was tough for her. That's why
we all wanted to come up,

158
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,351
with a special something to do
for her, for her graduation.

159
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,519
Yeah. So we...

160
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,690
[Nodoka] The Light Music Club
asked us to come to the
auditorium... I wonder why?

161
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,359
[Megumi] To get even with me?

162
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,194
[Nodoka] Oh, I doubt it.

163
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,406
Sokabe-senpai,
congratulations...

164
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,283
[The whole band] ...on
graduating!

165
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,826
I uh...

166
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,871
Sakura High's Light Music Club,

167
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,375
would like to play for you
to celebrate your graduation!

168
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,543
We hope you enjoy it!

169
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,253
[Band] It's Fuwa Fuwa Time!

170
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,423
[Ritsu] One! Two! One, two,
three, four!

171
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:56,096
("Fuwa Fuwa Time" instrumental)

172
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,271
(music ending)

173
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,902
[Nodoka] Senpai? Senpai?

174
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,446
Senpai! They finished playing
the song!

175
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,409
What's the meaning of this,
using the auditorium without
permission?!

176
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,412
Is what I'm suppose to say.

177
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,958
Thank you all so much.
It's the best gift I've ever
gotten.

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,792
(happy)

179
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,669
She liked it!

180
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,713
[Megumi] To mark the occasion...

181
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,797
Please autograph this!

182
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:31,756
(Mio cries out)

183
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,341
Please sign it "From Mio-tan"!

184
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,886
<i>My image of her as</i>
<i>a wise elder, is shattered...</i>

185
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,347
So did you sign it from
"Mio-tan"?

186
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,432
[Mio] I did...

187
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,101
Sokabe-senpai was
totally ecstatic.

188
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,896
Membership card number 0001?

189
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,106
It's in your name, Nodoka?!

190
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,066
[Nodoka] You see,
after you played...

191
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:54,320
[Megumi] I've decided, that you
should also take over as
the fan club president.

192
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,281
Thank you but absolutely not!

193
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,533
[Nodoka] I couldn't turn down
this membership card,

194
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,493
so I gave in and accepted the
position

195
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:05,415
but I never had time for it, and
never carried out any of my
duties as president.

196
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,875
Nodoka-chan...

197
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,377
[Nodoka] That's why I came
today to ask a favor of you.

198
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,590
To ask if you would mind holding
a tea party for the members of
the fan club.

199
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,966
[Tsumugi] A tea party?

200
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,802
[Nodoka] Right. I could
never look her in the eye,

201
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,512
if I don't do at least try.

202
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,307
[Yui] You bet! We'll be honored
to help you, Nodoka-chan!

203
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,641
Uh?

204
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,477
Yeah! You're always helping us
out, so we owe you!

205
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,895
Uh...

206
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,355
What sort of tea party do
you think we should have?

207
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,564
Et tu, Mugi?!

208
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,483
Hey come on, let's not rush
into this, okay?

209
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,651
[Yui] Oh and there has to be
a cake-cutting ceremony!

210
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,488
[Ritsu] And a bouquet
presentation and a memorial
album!

211
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,697
What is this?

212
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,699
[Azusa] Why don't we do
a Q&A period, then?

213
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,742
[Ritsu] Great idea!

214
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,410
<i>They're not listening...</i>

215
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,705
So is it all right to take you
up on your offer

216
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,291
and leave all the planning
of the event to you, then?

217
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,044
I'll go and secure a venue for
us and make the notifications.

218
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,088
I volunteer to make all the
posters!

219
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,090
And I'll bring an extra large
cake!

220
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,466
[Mio] You're way too into this!

221
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,967
[Ritsu] Let's go all out!
It's a special occasion!

222
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,469
<i>[Nodoka] With everyone's help,</i>

223
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,430
<i>this is going to be an amazing</i>
<i>tea party, Sokabe-senpai.</i>

224
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,980
[Mio] K-ON!

225
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,443
[Nodoka] Things certainly seem
to be coming together nicely.

226
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,696
[Yui] We're pulling out all the
stops for Mio-chan's fans!

227
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,199
Mio-chan pencils! Mio-chan
erasers! Mio-chan tissues!

228
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,994
Mio-chan chocolates! Mio-chan
bottle openers! Mio-chan
chopsticks!

229
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,705
And the Mio-chan back scratcher!

230
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,164
Don't make weird stuff like
that!

231
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,166
I just put a Mio-chan sticker on
it!

232
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,003
It's simple, but don't
you think it's cute?

233
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,880
[Mio] Why would anyone even WANT
one?

234
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,882
Ui even made these cookies for
the party.

235
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,135
Yeah and they're Mio-chan
cookies!

236
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,012
(Mio sighs)

237
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,681
Ritsu-senpai, don't even think
about charging admission,
I know that look.

238
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,142
Hey, don't make me sound
like I'm some kind of miser!

239
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,643
(knock on the door)
Hm?

240
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,894
Yes!

241
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,814
Excuse us! We have
a special delivery for you!

242
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,274
You do really?!

243
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,818
Please all of you help
yourselves.

244
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,278
Here you go.

245
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,529
Thank you very much.

246
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,448
Wow look, it's yakisoba buns!

247
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,657
And tea, too!

248
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,616
[Yui] Mind if I eat now?

249
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:04,701
[Tsumugi] That was fast!

250
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,745
Thank you.

251
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,539
We're looking forward to the tea
party!

252
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,166
Sorry we bothered you!

253
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,127
Thanks again guys!

254
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,628
So cute!

255
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,048
I'm glad that everybody seems
to be looking forward to it.

256
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,259
Nodoka, is Sokabe-senpai
coming to the party?

257
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,053
About that...

258
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,096
[Azusa] She can't come?

259
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,598
I wrote her a letter inviting
her,

260
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,226
but she says that her college
club has a big trip that day.

261
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,771
So there's not much point, is
there?

262
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,397
Can we change the date?

263
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,108
She insisted that since
we've already announced it to
everyone,

264
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,235
we shouldn't reschedule the
party.

265
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,236
No way...

266
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,113
[Nodoka] She said that her dream
is

267
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,367
to keep the fan club going
strong and to get everyone
excited about it,

268
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,578
so if the current fan club
members had fun at the party,

269
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,790
she said that, that's enough for
her and that she's happy.

270
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,084
What a mature thing to say...

271
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,086
Well she is in college.

272
00:13:56,127 --> 00:14:00,382
So when she graduated, she also
moved on from being a Mio fan,
huh?

273
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,175
That can't be true!

274
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,427
I bet she just had conflicting
plans and couldn't make it
that's all!

275
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,347
[Nodoka] Yes, and maybe she
just didn't want us

276
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,974
to go to any special
trouble on her account.

277
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:16,398
<i>[Mio] When I... When I graduate</i>
<i>from here, will I become as</i>
<i>mature as her?</i>

278
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,109
[Ritsu] Just then, touching
images of the happy days

279
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,903
Mio spent with her friends
flashed before her eyes...

280
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,280
[Mio] I said to cut out
the stupid narration!

281
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,782
(Ritsu laughing)

282
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,201
In that case, and in keeping
with Sokabe-senpai's wishes,

283
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,329
let's go ahead with the date as
scheduled.

284
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,581
[Tsumugi] Here, this is the
day's program.

285
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,793
Ri-chan, you and Yui-chan
will act as hosts.

286
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,044
[Ritsu and Yui] Aye, aye!

287
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,587
[Nodoka] As far as
the venue is concerned...

288
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,506
<i>[Mio] It's not in the program</i>
<i>or anything,</i>

289
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,551
<i>but maybe I should do</i>
<i>something special for them,</i>
<i>too.</i>

290
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,844
[Nodoka] But don't go overboard.

291
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,138
[Nodoka] Let's just keep it
simple and informal.

292
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,142
Okay, let's all run through
the program together.

293
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:56,146
[Ritsu] Welcome everyone! The
Light Music Club thanks you for
coming here today,

294
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,524
for the inaugural Mio Akiyama
Fan Club Tea Party!

295
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,902
We will be acting as your
masters of ceremonies today!

296
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,946
My name is Ritsu Tainaka!

297
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,906
And I'm Yui Hirasawa!

298
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,116
Have a great time, everybody!

299
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,368
(clapping and cheering)

300
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,662
[Azusa] Wow this is a great
turnout!

301
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,999
[Nodoka] I think I see some
familiar faces out there, too.

302
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,084
[Nodoka] Miss Sasaki is a
member?

303
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,920
[Ritsu] Anyway, as we all know
life is an exciting journey,

304
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,464
that is full of ups and downs-

305
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,841
[Yui] Ri-chan, that's
a wedding toast, too!

306
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,176
So, let's leave our skit at that

307
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,137
and get the Mio Akiyama Fan Club
tea party started!

308
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,847
Here comes our guest of honor!

309
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,017
[Yui] Mio Akiyama!

310
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:38,188
(cheering and applause)

311
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,983
Mio-chan looks so cool!

312
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,943
But her uniform's so boring!

313
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,029
Don't worry!
We've planned costume changes!

314
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,697
No, we haven't!

315
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,741
(disappointed)

316
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,827
Thank you for taking time out
of your busy schedules to-

317
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,704
[Fan 1] Mio-chan bit her tongue!

318
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,706
[Fan 2] But that's cute, too!

319
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,625
They're eating it up...

320
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,044
...to join us here today!

321
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,465
To join us... for a bite.

322
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,841
(laughter)

323
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,719
Wow, Ri-chan, she's a bigger
hit than our skit was.

324
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,096
Seriously?

325
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,181
[Yui] And on that note,
let's cut the speeches short,

326
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,559
and get right to the cake
cutting!

327
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,397
[Yui] Go on, Mio-chan! This is
your very, very, first act as a
couple!

328
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,356
Act with who?!

329
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,941
Azu-nyan will be helping you!

330
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,359
(shocked)

331
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,409
[Yui] And now, the cake
and tea service will begin!

332
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:38,248
And all your table candles will
be personally lit by Mio Akiyama
herself!

333
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,500
Senpai, we're ready for you over
here!

334
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,253
Here, too!

335
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,423
[Ritsu] And now, we'd like to
move on to our special event!

336
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,884
We call it 100 Questions With
Mio Akiyama!

337
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,553
(horn honking)

338
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,763
[Ritsu] Oh one more thing,
each time a question is
answered,

339
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,766
please extinguish one candle
on your table, alright?

340
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,184
Okay, time for the first
question!

341
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,937
What is the scariest story
you've heard in your life?!

342
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,230
What kind of question is that?!

343
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,858
Next question! What's
the second scariest story?!

344
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,278
Third question! What's the
third scariest story you've
heard?!

345
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,449
The next, next, next, next
question! What's the fourth
scariest story?!

346
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,908
They're playing Tales of Terror?

347
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,868
(Mio screaming)

348
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,619
Mio, hang in there!

349
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,038
You can do it, Mio!

350
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,164
Mio-san!

351
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,790
Let's open the floor to you!

352
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,958
Who has a question to ask?!

353
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,335
(clammering fans)

354
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,670
[Fan 4] When you take a bath,
what do you wash first?

355
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,797
I-I wash the shower head...

356
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,507
<i>She washes the bath?!</i>

357
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,426
[Fan 5] When you have grilled
octopus, do you start with the
head?

358
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,510
The cucumber...

359
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,429
<i>Where's that?!</i>

360
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,015
[Ritsu] And now, let's move on
to the next portion of our
program!

361
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,101
[Yui] Let's have an intimate
look back at the first half of
Mio's life,

362
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,480
with the following slideshow put
together especialy for this
party!

363
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,690
<i>My life is half over at 17?</i>

364
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,071
Heh.

365
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,698
(slideshow music)

366
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,496
Oh wow, she was so cute!

367
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,206
Look at how much she's grown up!

368
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,459
[Fan 7] She's so cute I'm gonna
burst!

369
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:08,213
Hey is it just me, or are these
slides more about you than
Mio-senpai?

370
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,341
Duh! That's because I got them
from my own photo album!

371
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:39,244
[Ritsu] Sadly, the end of this
inagural tea party is now upon
us.

372
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:43,039
As the grand finale, we of
After-school Tea Time would like
to play you a-

373
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,457
[Mio] Wait!

374
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:50,547
Um, there's something that
I'd like you all of you to hear.

375
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,466
[Mio] I knew I wouldn't be able
to express my feelings clearly,

376
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,969
so I put them into lyrics
instead.

377
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,762
(cheers, excitement)

378
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:58,847
Big surprise!

379
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,645
Heart-throbbing Sugar...

380
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:09,065
I make a caramel sauce
for you, my beloved.

381
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,067
Granulated and brown sugar.

382
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,528
Maple, honey, and
wasanbon sugar.

383
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,364
A caramel sauce for you,
my beloved.

384
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,159
My heart is also caramel sauce.

385
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,618
Even if it gets a little burnt,

386
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,288
your tender heat will
make it taste delicious!

387
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,296
Oh! (nervous)

388
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:35,842
Figures, not even Mio's fans
can make heads or tails
out of her lyrics.

389
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,262
And now, it's time for
our performance!

390
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,056
[Ritsu] A new song
by After-school Tea Time!

391
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,351
[Yui] It's called
Pure Pure Heart!
[Tsumugi] Shoo, shoo!

392
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:50,273
(band playing and singing)

393
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:06,289
(fans clapping)

394
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,736
[Yui] Everybody say cheese!

395
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,780
[Ritsu] Alright, look over
here next, please!

396
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,450
[Tsumugi] And now over here,
please!

397
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,952
[Ritsu] You're all crowded in
too close to Mio!

398
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:30,540
I wish that Sokabe-senpai could
see how excited everyone here
is.

399
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,501
Oh, hey!

400
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,462
Hey what are you going to do
with that?

401
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,756
I thought I'd take a picture
of this and send it to her!

402
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,176
Uh? But I don't know her cell
number.

403
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,678
Just look it up at the
Student Council office!

404
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,935
[Girl] I'm gonna go buy
something to drink, okay?

405
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:51,936
Okay.

406
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,563
(Megumi's phone rings)

407
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,697
They all just gave me
another wonderful gift.

408
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,119
<i>[Nodoka] Dear Sokabe-senpai.</i>

409
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:12,040
<i>Please be sure to come to</i>
<i>the next tea party we have.</i>

410
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:15,669
<i>I'm sure that it will be</i>
<i>another terrific one.</i>

411
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:24,886
(closing song, "Listen!!")

412
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:59,147
[Sawako] This is your future so
give it a lot of thought, okay?

413
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:04,152
[Yui] It seems like it's still
so far away and it's real hard
for me to picture it.

414
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,280
[Mio] Yui! You haven't decided
on your life plans yet?

415
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,740
[Mio and Tsumugi]
I know what you mean!

416
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,575
[Azusa] Really? 'cause
I'm completely lost.

417
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,118
[Nodoka] For now,
just writing down

418
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,580
whatever it is that comes
to mind, should be fine.

419
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,832
[Yui] Whatever comes to my mind?

420
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,084
Got it!
