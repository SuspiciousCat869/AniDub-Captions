1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,587
[Yui] Look! Look!
Aren't they cute?

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,297
Aw...

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,426
[Ritsu] Go ahead,
have another one, Azu-nyan.

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,136
[Azusa] No thank you, that's all
right.

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,014
Sawa-chan said that she would be
in late today, so she didn't
need it.

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,850
Yeah, it would just go
to waste if no one ate it.

7
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,979
Ah, come one, Azu-nyan! Your
face has "Gimme!" written all
over it.

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,481
Are you really sure?

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,275
You have something in your hair.

10
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,361
[Azusa] What is that, a sticker?

11
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,071
[Yui] I've been totally into
them lately-

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,324
Azusa, you forgot this back
in...

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,952
[Jun] Were you guys taking a
break?

14
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,329
[Azusa] No! We were just... I
mean...

15
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:43,835
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

16
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,640
Okay, I want you to write down
what the Light Music Club does
on a typical day.

17
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,850
All right.

18
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,771
[Jun] That's a lot of meetings.

19
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,442
So, what is it that you guys
talk about in all these
meetings?

20
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,152
Hm? Well I don't, um...

21
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,403
<i>I can't tell her.</i>

22
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:36,072
You guys talk about
music-related stuff, right?

23
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,574
Um, sure.

24
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,451
We talk about what
we're gonna call our next live
show,

25
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:44,414
and about the set list, and
funny stuff to say during our
audience banter.

26
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,253
You've changed, Azusa.

27
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,965
You know, the Jazz Club
has already started practicing

28
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,092
for the big school festival.

29
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,761
[Jun] Azusa? Hello?

30
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,638
<i>[Azusa] This is bad! Really</i>
<i>bad! Really, really bad!</i>

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,100
<i>When did I get infected with</i>
<i>their slacker attitude?!</i>

32
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,687
All right! Beginning today,
I'm making my comeback!

33
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,150
That was a very Yui-senpai thing
to do...

34
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,985
[Azusa] Okay, let's do this!

35
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,196
That was a Ritsu-senpai thing to
say.

36
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,782
All right, let's get to work.

37
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,326
Hm, that was Mio-senpai.

38
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,911
Shall we begin, then?

39
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,497
No, that was Mugi-senpai...

40
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,125
Everyday, I'm forgetting
who I am more and more.

41
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,670
No, if I give up now, I've lost!

42
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,296
Alright!

43
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,465
No body's here yet?

44
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,429
[Azusa] Something's there...

45
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,435
Mugi-senpai? W-What happened to
you?

46
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:54,234
Oh, dear. I guess I must
have nodded off for awhile.

47
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,361
Azusa-chan, good afternoon...

48
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,947
Oh my goodness,
you scared me half to death!

49
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:03,952
The sun is pouring in through
the windows, so this spot is
really cozy and warm.

50
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,537
Would you care to join me?

51
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,247
Thank you, but I'll pass.

52
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,623
[Tsumugi] Oh, really?

53
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,877
What in the world were
you doing down there, anyway?

54
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,216
Oh! Well, I thought I would
scare the next person to come
in, so I was hiding.

55
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,135
Jump out and go, "Boo!"

56
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,221
<i>[Azusa] She sure comes up</i>
<i>with cute plans...</i>

57
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,349
I hope someone comes in soon!

58
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,643
Oh!

59
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,770
Boo! Boo!

60
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,231
Mugi-senpai, you can't
really surprise someone,

61
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,442
after you've told them
what you're about to do.

62
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,946
Yikes! You scared me
half to death, darn it!

63
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,157
Boo!

64
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,700
[Azusa] Mugi-senpai.

65
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,911
Do you know when Yui-senpai
and the others will be here?

66
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,956
No, they're all on cleaning
duty, so they said they would be
here late.

67
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,084
Oh, they will, huh?

68
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,754
[Tsumugi] Boo!
<i>[Azusa] Hey wait, it just</i>
<i>occurred to me,</i>

69
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,923
<i>that I'm hardly ever alone in</i>
<i>the music room with</i>
<i>Mugi-senpai.</i>

70
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,968
[Tsumugi] I wonder if I can do
this as well as Ri-chan did that
one time.

71
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,433
Maybe I'll practice my guitar
while I'm waiting for them!

72
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,061
In that case, I'll go and get
some tea ready, okay?

73
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,902
<i>I get really nervous when</i>
<i>I think about being alone with</i>
<i>her.</i>

74
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:24,157
<i>I mean, she has those amazing,</i>
<i>huge eyes, beautiful hair, fair</i>
<i>skin.</i>

75
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,493
And she's next to me!

76
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,411
Oh did I do something odd?

77
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,622
N-No, it's all right.

78
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,083
Really? I'm relieved.

79
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,044
Hey Azusa-chan,
is the guitar a hard instrument?

80
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:42,050
Huh? I guess it can be...
Would you like to try?

81
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,094
May I? Thank you!

82
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,724
Um, it's all right to hold it
normally. You know?

83
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,645
Sorry, but could you move
your hair for a sec?

84
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,608
The strap goes right over
your shoulder like this.

85
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,153
Thank you very much.

86
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,907
I remember when Ri-chan tried
her hand at it last semester.

87
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,743
Well? So how does it look?

88
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,705
It looks just as good on
you as it did on her!

89
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,084
<i>Huh? There are stickers here,</i>
<i>too?</i>

90
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,502
<i>It must've been Yui-senpai.</i>

91
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,671
[Tsumugi] Azusa-chan, here.

92
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,589
Thank you for letting me hold
it.

93
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,884
You're not going to play it?

94
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,429
[Azusa] All right now,
this next one is petty tough.

95
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,433
Everyone has trouble holding an
F chord when they first try to
do it.

96
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,351
Are my fingers in the right
position?

97
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,897
Yes, that looks pretty close to
me. Go ahead and give it a
strum.

98
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,567
Here goes!

99
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,569
Here goes!

100
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,414
<i>There's something cute about</i>
<i>that.</i>

101
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,374
[Tsumugi] Drink up.

102
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,043
Thank you, Mugi-senpai.

103
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,296
The guitar is a difficult
instrument, all right.

104
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,048
It does take a lot of patience.

105
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,052
I see. I've studying the piano
ever since I was a very little
girl,

106
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,679
but
I've made sure to practice every
day.

107
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,807
I was told if I didn't, my
fingers would lose flexibility.

108
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,019
Then I guess it's the same with
guitar as it is with the piano.

109
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,520
Yes, it is.

110
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,023
<i>Hm. I wonder why</i>
<i>Mugi-senpai decided to join,</i>

111
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,400
<i>the Light Music Club in the</i>
<i>first place?</i>

112
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,154
<i>Image-wise, you'd think she'd</i>
<i>be more cut out for classical</i>
<i>piano.</i>

113
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:30,200
<i>I've never talked to her about</i>
<i>stuff like that, have I?</i>

114
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,493
What? What's the matter?

115
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,995
I don't have something on my
face do I?

116
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,873
No, I uh...

117
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,917
You have some frosting on your
cheek.

118
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,709
I do?!

119
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,920
Wait a second, hold still.

120
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,422
Oh thank you.

121
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,884
So now you know I've been
sneaking bites to eat...

122
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,262
Wait, you've done this before?

123
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,098
Yeah, sometimes.

124
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,310
(snickering)

125
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:01,064
<i>I feel so stupid now for</i>
<i>worrying so much and being</i>
<i>nervous and stuff!</i>

126
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,986
(door opens)

127
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,489
[Ritsu] Hey, quite pushing!

128
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,448
[Yui] I can't help it!

129
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,449
[Mio] Be quiet, you two!

130
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,577
What are you guys doing out
there?

131
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,997
Geez, come inside instead of
eavesdropping from the hall next
time.

132
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,792
You two had a real
interesting dynamic going there.

133
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,003
What is that suppose to mean?

134
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,553
Mugi-chan, this cake you
brought it's yummy!

135
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,388
Is it? I'm glad you like it.

136
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,225
[Tsumugi] Oh! Just a moment,
I have something to hand out to
everyone.

137
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,769
What is this?

138
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,814
Yeah, it's you again, isn't it?
You and your stickers.

139
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,025
Pretty cute, don't you think?

140
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,235
Don't do that!

141
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,778
Thank you for waiting!

142
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,532
I decided to try writing a new
song for the school festival!

143
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,909
Hey, way to go!

144
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,203
[Yui] And Mugi-chan gets a gold
star!

145
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,789
[Azusa] Again with the stickers?

146
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,375
[Ui] When my sister's into
something, she's REALLY into it.

147
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,503
[Jun] I had no idea Mugi-senpai
had such a cute side to her.

148
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,798
She has more than a few odd
sides to her, too, though.

149
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,677
You mean like she suddenly
appears out of no where like
she's teleporting?

150
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,095
Not really.

151
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,431
I think it's great how
she's so sweet and kind,

152
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,184
and thoughtful even though
she's really, really rich.

153
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,019
Yeah I know.

154
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,271
She's always acts so cheerful
whenever she serves tea and
pastries to us.

155
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:27,442
So in other words, you look
forward to drinking her tea
every day.

156
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,818
I-It's not like that at all!

157
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,529
Calm down. Still, I gotta say
I'm pretty surprised,

158
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,157
she's been sneaking bites
of food all this time.

159
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,909
Yeah I know, right?

160
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:42,165
<i>[Azusa] I didn't go to the club</i>
<i>room to think about how cute</i>
<i>Mugi-senpai is!</i>

161
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,711
All right, today is the day
I'm going to make my comeback!

162
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,381
No, that sounds wrong.

163
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,590
[Mio] What does?

164
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,841
[Azusa] Mio-senpai?

165
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,551
What is it that sounds wrong?

166
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,970
[Azusa] N-No, it's nothing!

167
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,889
So I see that the others aren't
here yet.

168
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,644
[Mio] No, they're busy with
stuff like supervising class
chore teams today.

169
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,564
Maybe we should start
practicing without them, then?

170
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,692
[Mio] Sure, good idea.

171
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:13,154
[Mio] Give me a minute, okay?
I really want to change my
strings first.

172
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,239
Sure.

173
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,789
Azusa, is something wrong?

174
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,082
Not at all!

175
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,208
Are you sure?

176
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,501
Yes!

177
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,295
Oh! What songs do
you want to do for the festival?

178
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,674
Well, we should definitely
include the song that Mugi just
wrote,

179
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,384
but other than that...

180
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,761
Well I've been thinking that a
ballad might be nice for a
change.

181
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,973
Hey you know, that just might
work for us!

182
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,562
Okay, let's propose
that idea to the others.

183
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,688
Sure!

184
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,648
[Mio] A ballad, huh? That sounds
like fun!

185
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,400
I'm making my comeback!

186
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,193
[Mio] Hm? You say something?

187
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,361
Uh... No!

188
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,948
[Mio] Really?
[Azusa] Yes!

189
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,867
[Azusa] Sitting here doing this,
it almost feels like,

190
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,994
we're a real Light Music Club,
doesn't it?

191
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,372
[Mio] Yeah. But we ARE a Light
Music Club.

192
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,587
Okay, that should do it then.

193
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,924
Oh great. In that case,
I'll go get the tea ready.

194
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,635
[Mio] Oh, you want to have tea?

195
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,346
Well, the others aren't here
yet,

196
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,140
[Mio] so I guess...
[Azusa] It was just a
suggestion.

197
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,977
[Mio] If you want to have tea,
we can.
[Azusa] It was a suggestion!

198
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,396
But you-
(Ritsu busts through the door)

199
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:32,025
Oh, it's you, Ritsu.
Don't scare me like that!

200
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,986
[Mio] What's wrong?

201
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,364
M-Mio!

202
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,283
I'm begging you! Help me out
with my Home Ec assignment!

203
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,326
With Home Ec?

204
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,286
I forgot what the assignment
was.

205
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,456
Ri-chan doesn't have
a clue how to sew a skirt.

206
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,665
Oh, that one.

207
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,292
Yeah, well you can't do it,
either!

208
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,087
I'm gonna have Ui help me,
thank you very much!

209
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,380
Is that really something to brag
about?

210
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,507
But you're really good
at sewing buttons on.

211
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,677
This is on a sewing machine!
I'm really bad at it.

212
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,096
Oh, brother... I guess I have
to.

213
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,224
It's not like we can blow off
school work to do club stuff.

214
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,476
Ri-chan, I'll be happy to help
you, too!

215
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:10,188
Let's head over to
Ri-chan's house right now!

216
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,898
[Ritsu] Thank you, thank you,
everyone!

217
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,692
<i>The way this is looking, we're</i>
<i>not gonna-</i>

218
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,277
Um, what about band practice?

219
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,905
Hm? What's wrong, Azusa? Aren't
you coming too?

220
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,490
<i>I knew it!</i>

221
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,409
<i>[Azusa echoes] I knew it!</i>

222
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,000
K-ON!

223
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,671
<i>I came with them...</i>

224
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,549
[Ritsu] Azusa!
Why are you still outside?

225
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,175
[Azusa] Coming!

226
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,844
Thanks for having me.
(Toilet flushes)

227
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,762
[Satoshi] That you, Sis?

228
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,515
Mom said to put your
dirty clothes in the wa-

229
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,933
Hi, Satoshi.

230
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,352
Hey, these are my friends
from the Light Music Club.

231
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,437
Pardon the intrusion!

232
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,357
Sure...I uh... Hi. Excuse me.

233
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,527
He went back into the bathroom.

234
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,362
He's a weird kid.

235
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,075
<i>She's really good at that...</i>

236
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,414
Azu-nyan! Here you go!

237
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,584
You forgot this in the club room
when you left yesterday.

238
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,336
Oh, thank you for picking it up!

239
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,256
Can I peel this off?

240
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,675
[Yui] Azu-nyan, you meanie!

241
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,926
Okay, all done.

242
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,011
Huh? Already?

243
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,971
[Tsumugi] You are so good at
this!

244
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,598
Hey, where's Ritsu?

245
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,142
You know, she went downstairs
and never came back.

246
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:34,064
Oh, excuse me. I need to step
out and use the ladies' room.

247
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,357
Do you know where it is?

248
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,818
Sure. I saw it by entryway
when we walked in.

249
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,115
[Mio] What's up, Satoshi?

250
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,911
Sis said to call you guys
downstairs.

251
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,413
Wow, did you made
all this yourself, Ri-chan?

252
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,790
[Ritsu] Indeed I did!

253
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,876
That smells great!

254
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,504
Ri-chan, thanks for going
to all this trouble!

255
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,672
Yes, thank you very much!

256
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,923
[Ritsu] Oh don't sweat it!

257
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,174
What kind of friend would I be,

258
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,176
if I didn't do anything for all
your help?

259
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:06,304
Now, let's all sit down and dig
in!

260
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,516
Alright then, I think
that's everything we need.

261
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,643
Mio, do you have tea over there?

262
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,603
[Mio] Yeah, I'm fine.

263
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:14,771
Ritsu-senpai!

264
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,564
What? Did I forget anything?

265
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,651
No, it's nothing to do with
the dinner you made...

266
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:23,822
There's something over here
that's not really fit for the
dinner table...

267
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,324
Sorry! They're my dad's.

268
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,993
No, I'm really sorry that I
brought it up.

269
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:29,994
[Yui] They're pink!

270
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,122
Let's not talk about it!

271
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,333
Now, why don't we all try this
again.

272
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,420
[Everyone] Thank you for the
meal!

273
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,171
Now dig in, everyone!

274
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,968
The hamburger steaks is
delicious!

275
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,304
[Ritsu] You think so? Glad to
hear it!

276
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,306
And the rice is really tasty,
too!

277
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,018
[Ritsu] You have my family's
prized rice cooker to thank for
that!

278
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,895
You do love your rice, don't
you, Ritsu?

279
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,023
Yeah! I'm Japanese, after all!

280
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,150
I think, rice is amazing too!

281
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,653
But sometimes we have toast
in the morning instead.

282
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,031
Strawberry jam is so yummy!

283
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,699
What do I usually have?

284
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:11,995
[Ritsu] Foolish girls! When
you're Japanese, you eat rice!
Rice!

285
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:17,000
So you just ended up going over
to Ritsu-senpai's place and
goofing around?

286
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,502
We went to go help her
with her homework assignment!

287
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,672
I'm jealous! You got to
have her home cooking!

288
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,342
Yeah, and everything she cooked
was really delicious too.

289
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,636
Oh boasting now, are we?
You're trying to make me
jealous?

290
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,263
I-I didn't mean it like that!

291
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,475
Now, now. It's good to do
something like that once in a
while.

292
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,852
Every journey needs some rest
stops.

293
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:36,978
You really think so?

294
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,104
Yep, I do!

295
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,814
[Jun] Oh, hey, about our next
assignment-

296
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,026
<i>Our problem is that rest stops</i>
<i>are all that we do in this</i>
<i>club!</i>

297
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,195
Today, I am definitely,
definitely, definitely

298
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,447
making a comeback!

299
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,116
I'm a lot less confident
now for some reason.

300
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:53,787
[Azusa] No! Third time's the
charm!

301
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,538
[Azusa] Yui-senpai?

302
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,706
Hi Azu-nyan!

303
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,208
[Azusa] Good afternoon.

304
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,710
The others haven't gotten here
yet?

305
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:01,711
Nah.

306
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,380
Oh, really?

307
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,965
We're going to practice today
anyway!

308
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,635
Before we do that,
come over here and look at this.

309
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:12,222
Ton-chan's tank looks funny.

310
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,349
[Yui] You think that maybe
we should clean it?

311
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,435
[Azusa] Yeah, you're right.
I'll go get the hose.

312
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,730
<i>No! I'm getting infected by</i>
<i>her slacker attitude again!</i>

313
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,943
<i>We're going to practice today!</i>
<i>We're going to practice!</i>

314
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,865
<i>[Yui] For Ton-chan, we scrub</i>
<i>his tank all sparkling clean!</i>

315
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,035
[Azusa] Focus on cleaning the
tank instead of singing your
weird songs!

316
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,578
[Yui] Yes, ma'am!

317
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,748
<i>For Ton-chan, we scrub</i>
<i>his tank all sparkling-</i>

318
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,334
[Azusa] Yui-senpai!

319
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,253
[Yui] You're a harsh mistress,
Azu-nyan-senpai.

320
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,422
[Azusa] What are you talking
about?

321
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,924
Oh, why don't we also get rid of
the stickers on that mirror

322
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,634
over there while we're at it?

323
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,595
<i>[Yui] For Azu-nyan,</i>
<i>we scrub his tank all sparkl-</i>

324
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:56,141
[Azusa] Would you PLEASE
stop singing that ridiculous
song?

325
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,395
All done!

326
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,772
[Yui] It looks a lot more comfy
now.

327
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,025
Isn't that great, Ton-chan?

328
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,278
Aw you really do love Ton-chan,
don't you, Azu-nyan?

329
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,572
That's really not it at all.

330
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,699
<i>Ton-chan took my mind off my</i>
<i>problems!</i>

331
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,452
All right, why don't we go
practice now?

332
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,038
Sure, why not?

333
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,459
That's right! There was
something that I wanted you to
help teach me how to do.

334
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,879
Mugi-chan wrote that song
a little while ago, remember?

335
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,505
It's kinda complicated.

336
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:31,634
Ah, you must mean the guitar
solo in it. Sure, I can help!

337
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,094
[Yui] No, not that.

338
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,181
Um... I can't figure out how
you're supposed to read it.

339
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,558
You don't know how?

340
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,312
[Azusa] So on the third verse,
you skip to here, this symbol is
a dal segno,

341
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,273
and tells you to jump back
to the other one like it,

342
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,026
and then we end at this al fine
here.

343
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,529
Yui-senpai?

344
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,491
Sorry, sorry! It's just a little
convoluted.

345
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,077
That's true, it is a little
hard to remember it all.

346
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,997
I just wish that she'd written
it in Japanese, instead of like
that.

347
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,083
Instead of forte, say "loud"!

348
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,544
Instead of fortissimo, say
"really loud"!

349
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,256
Oh, and you know that little
symbol near the very end of the
song,

350
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,675
that you thought looked kind of
neat

351
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,010
that one's called a fermata
and it tells you to pause.

352
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,679
Oh, so that's what it's called!

353
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,683
Leave that one as "fermata"
it sounds way cooler!

354
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,351
Make up your mind.

355
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,067
Wow, the rest of the guys
sure are taking their time.

356
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,276
They are.

357
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,487
I could use Mugi-chan's tea
about now...

358
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,571
Yeah, me too.

359
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,284
N-Not this time!

360
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,203
Let's start practicing!

361
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,955
We're practicing today,
no ifs, ands, or buts!

362
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,833
Sitting around like this is
what's wrong with this club!

363
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,167
Practice! Practice!

364
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,795
Hey, what's gotten into you,
Azu-nyan?

365
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,630
You're so gung ho today.

366
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:54,926
T-Today is no different!
I'm always like this, senpai!

367
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:55,885
You are?

368
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,178
Yes, I am!

369
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,847
Um. I think.

370
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,683
I suppose you could say
that this is the real me.

371
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,937
Or that I've been off my game
lately. Or maybe just a little
lazy.

372
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:11,401
Wait! That's right! I just
wouldn't be the real me if I
wasn't acting like this!

373
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,403
I get it!

374
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,238
Wow, you really think up some...

375
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,949
...really philosophical
stuff, huh, Azu-nyan?

376
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,828
I guess I never really gave any
of that all that much thought.

377
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,373
Well, you know...

378
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:29,377
Guess I'm trying to say that
you're your own person.

379
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,048
[Yui] Ri-chan is Ri-chan.
Mio-chan is Mio-chan.

380
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,175
And Mugi-chan is Mugi-chan.

381
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:40,221
So I suppose that's why I really
never put too much thought into
it.

382
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,725
I could go for one of
Mugi-chan's cakes...

383
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,893
Right AFTER we practice!

384
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,478
[Yui] You just got fortissimo
mad!

385
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,273
[Azusa] Please don't
use musical terms that way.

386
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,817
[Jun] Well, I'll be.
You two are getting along.

387
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,780
Well, yeah, but I went there
so we could practice.

388
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,200
Is Azusa-chan here?

389
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,911
Yes, what is it?

390
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,996
Here, for you.

391
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,790
[Girl] This is yours, isn't it?

392
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,459
No way!

393
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:14,422
Is it yours?

394
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,091
Yeah! Thanks a lot!

395
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,343
Sure thing!

396
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,512
How did she know it was mine?

397
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,515
What was that about?

398
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,268
Nothing major.

399
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,992
[Tsumugi] Thank goodness you
found it.

400
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,830
[Azusa] I know. Yui-senpai,
I really want to thank you.

401
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,915
[Ritsu] Shucks, it was nothin'!

402
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,208
[Mio] You didn't return it.

403
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,711
[Yui] Alright! So that's
everybody!

404
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,629
[Ritsu] Yep!

405
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,215
[Yui] This cake was worth
fermata-ing for!

406
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,217
That's not how you use that
word.

407
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,760
[Tsumugi] Here, Azusa-chan.

408
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:04,055
Sawa-chan says that she's
not going to make it today.

409
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,975
But I had it last time. Are you
sure?

410
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,894
[Ritsu] Your name was on it,
so it's yours.

411
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,157
Isn't that sticker so cute
you want to hug it?

412
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:26,453
[Yui] Eat lots so you can
grow up big and strong!

413
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,999
Do you mind if I peel this off?

414
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,834
No way! Leave it on.

415
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,586
All right everyone,

416
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,506
please decide which position you
want to fill and sign up by next
week.

417
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,092
[Ui] Azusa-chan!

418
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,511
[Ui] What do you think you're
going to want to do?

419
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,388
Well I haven't really decided
yet.

420
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,807
I guess I think I'm going to be
a waitress this time.

421
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:51,394
"Welcome to our cafe!
May I take your order, please?"

422
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,396
[Ui] That sounded perfect!

423
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,983
That's pretty good, so what kind
of cat are you going to be?

424
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,276
What do you mean?

425
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,862
Well, you will be wearing
cat ears, won't you?

426
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,322
Why would I do that?

427
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,742
Huh? Waitresses at a cafe always
wear cat ears, don't they?

428
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,080
Azusa-chan...

429
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,457
You're in the Light Music Club,
all right.

430
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:18,755
[Azusa] T-This isn't...
This isn't the real me!

431
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:26,513
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")

432
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,811
[Mio] You sure seem
excited today.

433
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,314
[Yui] Yeah, the school festival
is soon!

434
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,774
[Sawako] How about your
classroom?

435
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:01,858
[Yui] Thanks for waiting!

436
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,526
[Ritsu] Now off to
the club room.

437
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,862
[Sawako] Yeah, about
the club room...

438
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,030
Sawa-chan?

439
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,449
It's out of use for a while.

440
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,367
What is?

441
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,035
The club room.
