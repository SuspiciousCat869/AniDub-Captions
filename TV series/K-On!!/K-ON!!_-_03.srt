1
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,385
He's so cute...

2
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,180
Mio are you scared of it?

3
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:18,601
I'm not scared, I just haven't
reached the point where I think
it's cute yet.

4
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,521
But he IS cute!

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,314
Right, Ton-chan?

6
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,651
[Tsumugi] He looked at you!

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,488
He's looking at me!
I'm right over here!

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,656
[Yui] Ton-chan!

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,241
Hey! Ton-chan!

10
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,619
[Yui] You try calling him,
too, Mio-chan!

11
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,999
Ton-chan...

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,043
(snort-like sniffs)

13
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,461
Kay, that was cute...

14
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,046
Right? Right?

15
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,756
Yui-senpai, if we're going to
keep him,

16
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,216
we have to look after him
properly, too.

17
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,845
The water must be kept at a
precise temperature and changed
regularly.

18
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,222
Wow, he's higher maintenance
than Geeta.

19
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,682
[Azusa] He also has to be fed
every day.

20
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,935
Oh, if you ever run low on food,
I'll bring some from home.

21
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,395
We have Chinese pond turtles,

22
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,857
Asian yellow pond turtles,
and eastern musk turtles too.

23
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,025
<i>She's an expert!</i>

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,860
That'd be a big help!

25
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,364
Don't you worry, we're all gonna
take real good care of you.

26
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,492
That's right, we won't get sick
of you and just throw you away.

27
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,119
[Ritsu] I'm sick of this!

28
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,169
I'm sick of the drums!

29
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,463
[Yui] Ri-chan, what's the
matter?

30
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:33,718
(opening song, "Go! Go! Maniac")

31
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,064
What do you mean,
you're sick of the drums?

32
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,983
Sorry! That was an exaggeration.

33
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,320
However... Look at this!

34
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,990
This is our Club activity
footage recorded by
the student council.

35
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,617
I got it from Nodoka.

36
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,453
[Tsumugi] That's our
freshman year!

37
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,829
[Yui] That takes me back!

38
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,998
[Azusa] I saw that one!
We all saw Mio-senpai's--

39
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,375
[Mio] Ah! Stop the video!

40
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,336
No way! Look at where
the drums are!

41
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,546
[Yui] You're all dark, Ri-chan!

42
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,007
Your forehead is
nice and bright!

43
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,175
Hey shut up!

44
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,843
I guess the lights
just aren't hitting you.

45
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,762
Yeah, because you're way in
back.

46
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:45,100
When looking from straight on,
you're the only one of us who
isn't visible.

47
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,434
And it's not just this show!

48
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,228
[Ritsu] Last year's
welcome show!

49
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,312
[Tsumugi] You're dark!

50
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,523
[Ritsu] And this year's
welcome show!

51
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,274
[Azusa] I think I saw your foot!

52
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,903
[Mio] Wow, the camera
misses you completely.

53
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,197
(Ritsu weeping)

54
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,783
So...what do we do?

55
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,288
[Ritsu] I wanna play
another instrument.

56
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,165
Wait just a minute.

57
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,752
You can't just change
instruments. Who's gonna play
the drums if you don't?

58
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,547
(soft whining)

59
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,174
<i>She hasn't thought this</i>
<i>through.</i>

60
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,759
[Mio] Besides, weren't you the
one

61
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,221
who said you hated how "fiddly"
all the other instruments were?

62
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,973
That's true.

63
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,225
But maybe we should try
switching instruments every
once in a while.

64
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,685
Just for laughs.

65
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,103
That sounds like a lot of fun!

66
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,522
That's a great idea!

67
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,357
Wanna try playing the guitar?

68
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,900
Is it okay?

69
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,402
Eh!

70
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,071
Ta-dah!

71
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,073
That suits you rather well!

72
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,159
Yeah, looking real good, senpai!

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,577
It seems out of character.

74
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,704
[Tsumugi] Why don't you
try playing something?

75
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,748
[Yui] Wah!

76
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,584
What's the matter, Yui-senpai?

77
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,878
Geeta's cheating on me!

78
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,466
You willingly handed him over
with a smile on your face!

79
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,427
Thank you, Geeta.
We had good times, you and I.

80
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,763
If it's not one thing, it's
another...

81
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,765
So, teacher, what do I do first?

82
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,309
Me? Teacher?!

83
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,144
[Yui] Sure Ri-chan, I'll teach
you!

84
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,564
I'll just go make us all some
tea. She'll get bored of this
soon enough.

85
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:18,777
You form the chords with your
left hand and strum with your
right one.

86
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,654
Sorry, but I already know all
that stuff.

87
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,783
What should I teach you, then?

88
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,744
Fine, I guess I'll be handling
this.

89
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:31,122
For now, let's try playing
"Fuwa Fuwa Time".

90
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,749
Yes, ma'am!

91
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,042
Let's see...

92
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,045
It might be easier if
you played sitting down.

93
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,130
Then I'll sit down...ready.

94
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,425
Okay, the first chord in the
song is an E.

95
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,470
Your index finger goes
on string 3 at fret 1.

96
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,848
And uh... And the middle one
on string 5 at fret 2.

97
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,686
And then your ring finger
goes on string 4 at fret 2.

98
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,313
Um...

99
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,900
Your index finger goes here.
And the middle one here.

100
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,402
Just like this. You see?

101
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,613
Now, pressing down your fingers
like that, strum the guitar.

102
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,995
Um, Ri-chan? Try to keep your
right hand really relaxed. Like
a cooked noodle!

103
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,124
And keep the fingers pressing
on the strings curled more.

104
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,292
Some of the notes
aren't coming out cleanly.

105
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,714
Ri-chan, you need to hold
the pick gently! Very gently!

106
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,174
[Azusa] Okay, the sound is
starting to come together.

107
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,344
Ritsu-senpai, keep your back
a little straighter.

108
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,597
[Yui] You should move your
left wrist forward a little.

109
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,808
So, shall we move on to the next
chord?

110
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,477
[Yui] It's pretty tough to play,
isn't it?

111
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,188
I'm not cut out for this.

112
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,026
Wow, it's a big pain to have
to keep track of all that stuff.

113
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,610
I had no idea.

114
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,362
[Yui] That's quite all right.

115
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,282
Welcome back, Geeta!

116
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,992
Who's a good boy?

117
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,999
Good morning Miss Yamanaka!

118
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,500
Good morning.

119
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,420
Good morning, Ri-chan.

120
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,714
Oh hey, Sawa-cha-huh?

121
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,721
<i>Sawa-chan is glowing!</i>

122
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,723
[Everyone] Let's dig in!

123
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,226
Nodoka, your lunches always
look so wonderfully delicious.

124
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,688
Yeah, Nodoka-chan has
always been a terrific cook!

125
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,065
[Mio] So's Ui-chan.

126
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,817
Am I the luckiest girl
in the world, or what?

127
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:27,155
I've noticed your lunches
are always packed full, Mugi.

128
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,907
I burn up a lot of energy.

129
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,200
<i>On what?</i>

130
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,703
Mio, your lunches,
always look so cute and cuddly.

131
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:38,917
Wow, I guess your mom must still
think of you as her darling
little girl, huh?

132
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,213
What's Ritsu doing?

133
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,883
[Yui] Just wandering around.

134
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,385
Like a bird.

135
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,097
Kind of like Cozy Powell, in a
good way.

136
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:57,185
<i>She's been restless for as long</i>
<i>as I've known her. She gets</i>
<i>bored easily.</i>

137
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,521
<i>But her drumming has</i>
<i>been the one constant.</i>

138
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,190
I'm back!

139
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,317
Welcome home!

140
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,279
Ritchan here! Have some of
Nodoka-chan's omelette!

141
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,447
Can I?

142
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,157
You already took a bite...

143
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,956
And on that note, I'll be trying
out the keyboard today!

144
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,125
Exactly what note are you
talking about?

145
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,669
Another Shine On, You Crazy
Ri-chan instalment?

146
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:26,131
You don't understand, Yui,
I HAVE to shine!

147
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,342
When everyone has their eyes
on you, that's when you sparkle!

148
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,719
Look her!

149
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:33,722
What was that?

150
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,015
Just look at her!

151
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,975
Ever since Sawa-chan became
our homeroom teacher,

152
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,687
it seemed like her skin's been
glowing, and her hair's been
silky and shiny!

153
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,315
It's like she's blossoming or
something!

154
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,486
I guess I get more chances to
take the stage, a teacher's
lectern in this case,

155
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,405
now that I'm a homeroom teacher.

156
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,449
And I wanna sparkle, too!

157
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,035
So you're going to try out the
keyboard.

158
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,082
It said "Bingo"!

159
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,044
Can you read sheet music, Ritsu
senpai?

160
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,966
It said, "I read it fine!"

161
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,843
<i>How can she interpret that?</i>

162
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,220
You're making trouble
for Mugi, so--

163
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,180
Or not.

164
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,224
My keyboard is actually
speaking!

165
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,228
Oh! It just said "Mugi-chan"
just now!

166
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,521
It did, it did!

167
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,106
[Mio] Oh, brother...

168
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,074
It's neat how you can get so
many different tones out of a
keyboard.

169
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,452
I'm getting all sorts of
wonderful ideas for new songs!

170
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,245
<i>[Azusa] What kind of songs?</i>

171
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,830
This is so cool!

172
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,832
That looks like fun.

173
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,086
Mugi, you think I might
be able to have a try?

174
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,214
Stop that!

175
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,717
I hate that, Ritsu,
stop making that sound.

176
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,720
Fine! I'm sorry!

177
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,555
[Mio] What're you doing?

178
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,391
[Ritsu] Jerk!

179
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,770
Hey Ri-chan, aren't you
gonna try playing the bass?

180
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,063
No, not the bass!

181
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,023
[Yui] Why not?

182
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,192
I'm on bass...

183
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,278
And I don't ever want to play
anything but the bass,

184
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,198
I only want to be a bassist.

185
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,368
I just love its low, deep sound.

186
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,454
The way it supports all of you
without ever standing out...

187
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:26,167
I also like writing bass lines
that fit in with everything
you're doing.

188
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,044
One who doesn't take center
stage,

189
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,380
but doesn't get drowned out
by the other members.

190
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,508
That's the kind of bassist
I always want to be.

191
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,218
I know, Mio.

192
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,471
That's why I'll never touch your
bass, Mio. So don't worry about
it.

193
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,933
I do declare I'm kind
of jealous, Miss Tainaka!

194
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,310
Don't be like that!

195
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,104
I said way too much...

196
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,399
Uh-oh! Hey Mio-chan! Mio-chan!
Hello?

197
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,776
Oh, no! She's turning
into one of the living dead!

198
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:56,156
That is so great. It's just like
Mio and her bass are one and the
same.

199
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,743
I know what you mean,
I love her bass playing!

200
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,703
So do I.

201
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,456
Oh, come on! How long is she
going to stay stiff as a board?

202
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,249
Don't worry, Ri-chan!

203
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,879
Just leave everything to me! I'm
going to work this all out!
You'll see!

204
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,797
[Yui] Snap out of it Mio,

205
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,216
[Yui] or Death's gonna
come for ya!
[Ritsu] What am I leaving
to her?

206
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,931
(clinking sounds)

207
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,268
[Ui] Sis? What're you doing?

208
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,607
That's bad manners, you know?

209
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,442
I'm sitting here in a dark
corner

210
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:36,446
trying to formulate Operation:
Shine On, You Crazy Ri-chan.

211
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,950
Well, I'd like to wash
the dishes but...

212
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,410
I guess it can wait.

213
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,953
(dejected)

214
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,170
[Yui] K-ON!

215
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,929
Okay, here we go!

216
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,809
There's another class after us,
so get into position quickly.

217
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,769
Alright, how do you want us
to line up?

218
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,979
[Sawako] Um, by seat number?

219
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,649
Wouldn't it be better
if we lined up by height?

220
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,276
Oh, you're right.
Thank you for that.

221
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,071
This is the very first homeroom
class I've ever had,

222
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:22,867
so please, if I make
any mistakes, be sure
to point them out.

223
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,829
Miss Yamanaka is really great.

224
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,249
It's like she's getting prettier
and prettier every day.

225
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,837
<i>I like being on the end.</i>

226
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,214
I think I'll stand here!

227
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,134
Scuse me!

228
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,177
[Ritsu] Could you squeeze
over just a little bit?

229
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,929
[Mio] We're lining up
by height, remember?

230
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,681
[Ritsu] Watch this!

231
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,558
Ah, Ri-chan,
you've grown taller!

232
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,018
You're sneaky.

233
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,103
Look, we're all together!

234
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,188
I guess we're not going by
height anymore.

235
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,315
I say we're better off
being all together.

236
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,819
Me too! It's gonna be
a great class picture!

237
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,864
So is everyone in position?

238
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,033
Alright, whenever you're ready!

239
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,994
Okay! Everybody smile!

240
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,246
[Photographer] Say cheese!

241
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,002
[Yui] Hey, this is great!

242
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,920
[Ritsu] What are you doing?

243
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,715
Ri-chan! We moved
the drum set around! See?

244
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,259
You're smack in the middle now!

245
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,887
I was thinking about
this idea all night long!

246
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,849
You were right about changing
things! Come on, try it out!
Try it out!

247
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,017
Alright Yui!

248
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,478
Okay! We'll use this position
from now on!

249
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,313
I'm embarrassed...

250
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,775
I think this works best.

251
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,234
[Everyone] Yeah so do I.

252
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:42,155
But don't worry, Ri-chan!
You'll still shine!

253
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,532
I'm going to use this
head lamp to light you up!

254
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,867
Cut it out!

255
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,620
Shine on, you crazy Ri-chan!

256
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,831
[Miu] Stop it, Yui! Look at her!

257
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,249
[Mio] She's gasping for breath.

258
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,210
[Yui] Oopsie!

259
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,338
Hey Ri-chan, you aren't lonely,
are you?

260
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,464
Why do you ask?

261
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,507
Well, you're always in the back,

262
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,550
so I thought you might
feel lonely.

263
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,511
No, not really.

264
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,262
What if we try something new?

265
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,265
[Yui] While we're playing, we'll
just interact with you more.

266
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,934
Kinda like this.

267
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,067
Right, now you guys try it.

268
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,111
Let's practice how we're going
to interact with Ri-chan,

269
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,988
who's feeling lonely there in
the back!

270
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,491
Let's do it! One, two!

271
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,161
Hey!

272
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,414
Hey!

273
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,543
Doesn't that work perfectly?!

274
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:41,381
Yui, you don't understand,
that's really not why I'm doing
this...

275
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:45,802
Don't go it alone. Ri-chan,
if you're hurting, we're all
hurting!

276
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,429
[Yui] I won't let you suffer
alone!

277
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,764
[Ritsu] Yui! Look, I'm not
suffering!

278
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,308
Let's get through this together!

279
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,145
Why won't you listen to me?!

280
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,564
Aw, and I brought all
this other stuff too!

281
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,109
Just give it up, Yui,
and take it all back home.

282
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,156
Hey Azu-nyan?

283
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,157
Yes?

284
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,366
If Ritchan doesn't play the
drums,

285
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,578
I was thinking I might take
over.

286
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,996
Why do you say that?

287
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,416
Well, something's really
bothering Ri-chan, I know it.

288
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,753
It's like she's in a, what's the
word I'm looking for?

289
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,796
Sounds like "gut"... Not
"mutt"...

290
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:22,964
Wait, do you mean rut?

291
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:23,923
Yeah, that!

292
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,508
Then you were pretty far off.

293
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,302
[Yui] I think that's why she
suddenly,

294
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,971
wants to try out a bunch
of different things.

295
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,264
You really think so?

296
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,183
That's why I'm going to
start playing the drums!

297
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,478
I'll just sit behind you guys
and play the drums!

298
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,775
Maybe not, I think I'd rather
you stay where I can see you.

299
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,360
Aw, why?

300
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,570
You're reading too much into it,
Senpai.

301
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:51,159
This will make my skin glow even
more!

302
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,639
(phone vibrates)

303
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:25,068
Thinking about it, I just
realized I haven't played my
drums for a few days.

304
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,364
I was the one who suggested it,
but...

305
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,324
<i>I've played the drums every</i>
<i>day,</i>

306
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,661
<i>ever since I decided I was</i>
<i>going to be a drummer.</i>

307
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,378
Let's start a band, Mio!
And I'll be the drummer!

308
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,547
Sounds like fun, but why the
drums?

309
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,466
Isn't it awesome, how
they flail around back there?!

310
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,220
Oh...

311
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:56,433
<i>[Ritsu] Well, I could only</i>
<i>afford drumsticks at first.</i>

312
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:04,274
<i>And later on, I finally got</i>
<i>my hands on a used drum kit.</i>

313
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,487
<i>And every day since...</i>

314
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:20,373
<i>I still have some calluses.</i>
<i>I really whaled away on them at</i>
<i>first.</i>

315
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,362
[Satoshi] Sis! Keep it down!

316
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,494
(panting)

317
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,332
How could you have overslept?!

318
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:04,459
I was up late watching a movie!

319
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:10,298
In a village far from
civilization, they had this
horrific custom where they--

320
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,470
[Ritsu] I'm kidding.
It was a Who concert.

321
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:17,806
What?

322
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,599
The Who.

323
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,022
Oh, right. You like
that band's drummer,
don't you, Ritsu?

324
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:32,487
(school bell rings)
Crap! Mio, get a move on!

325
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,197
[Sawako] Please make sure
you fill out

326
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,826
the self-study activity form
for the class trip by
tomorrow, okay?

327
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,286
There are so many temples
that it will seem daunting,

328
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:44,666
but plan ahead to give
yourselves enough time to
visit each in turn.

329
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,418
Ri-chan! Mio-chan!

330
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,670
[Yui] I thought you were
home sick!

331
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,011
Sorry about that!

332
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,637
Heh... Whoa!

333
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,140
All right, take your
seats please.

334
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,810
[Ritsu] Sawa-chan?

335
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,646
[Yui] What's wrong, Sawa-chan?
[Ritsu] It's freaky!

336
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:11,317
I've been trying all sorts of
creams to make my skin glow
even more...

337
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,487
Oh my goodness...

338
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,239
(Sawako sobbing)

339
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,615
[Both] You overdid it.

340
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,994
Ta-dah!

341
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:24,372
It's drums or nothing for me!

342
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,416
Yeah, I figured as much.

343
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,836
She told me she watched
a Keith Moon DVD yesterday.

344
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:30,879
Who's that?

345
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,630
He's a drummer Ritsu
really admires.

346
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,301
Oh, he's the guy they called
Moon the Loon and Mad Moon,
right?

347
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:40,013
[Azusa] I heard that he
demolished his house with cherry
bombs or something.

348
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,098
Well that's not what I
admire about him.

349
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,019
You know, even if I'm in
the shadows and aren't
in the spotlight,

350
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,562
and you can only my feet,

351
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,189
I still love playing my drums!

352
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,607
[Yui] Yeah!

353
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,860
No one but you can be
our drummer!

354
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,780
[Ritsu] Yui?

355
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,531
[Yui] When we all look back at
you when we're just about to
start a song,

356
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:01,368
you count us in with your sticks
and you have a big grin
on your face.

357
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,954
That always gets me
so pumped up!

358
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:09,334
[Yui] Besides, I also learned
some things thanks to you.

359
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,752
Even though we're all
in the same band,

360
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,756
what we see and think are
sometimes very different.

361
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,718
We all have our own places here,
and each of us is different,

362
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,886
but when...

363
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,097
But when we start playing,
we become one!

364
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,516
Right!

365
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:29,270
[Ritsu] You know, as I sit on
my stool and watch your backs...

366
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:33,608
I listen to you play and
I bang away on my drums!

367
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,318
I love it!

368
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:44,202
Oh, I also did something
thanks to you. I wrote us
a brand new song.

369
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:48,415
And it was all because you made
my keyboard speak to me
that day.

370
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,458
You mean those noises?

371
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,918
What kind of song is it?

372
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,336
I wanna hear it!

373
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:01,720
(keyboard and humming)

374
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,642
Yeah, I like it!

375
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,687
Hey I think you should play and
sing this one, Mugi-chan!

376
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,647
Great idea!

377
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,858
[Mio] Yeah, that might work!

378
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,693
Mio, get to work on the lyrics!

379
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:20,905
Um you guys, I also thought of
a real good title for the song.

380
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,657
[Yui] What is it? What is it?

381
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:26,036
I call it "Honey Sweet Teatime."

382
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,787
Tea again, huh?

383
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:34,419
Wow, these rusks are fantastic
when you put honey on
all over them!

384
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:38,923
It's the intermingling of
flavors, the combination
of tastes!

385
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,344
You've got some sticky stuff
on the side of your mouth.

386
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,929
Wipe it for me, will ya?

387
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,306
No way!

388
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,515
<i>They're a good team</i>
<i>in their own way.</i>

389
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:48,892
[Azusa] Here wipe it yourself!

390
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,644
What am I going to do with you?

391
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,689
The honey-colored afternoon
passes by...

392
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,483
And it's "Honey sweet teatime."

393
00:21:56,524 --> 00:22:00,487
Hey how would it sound if
we repeated that phrase twice?

394
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,031
That could work!

395
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,908
(loud nibbling)

396
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,494
I can't concentrate...

397
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,413
Well then maybe we should
all just take a break?

398
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:24,969
(closing song, "Listen!!")

399
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,475
[Speaker] Kyoto... Kyoto...

400
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,270
[Yui] Ritchan, what's that?!
It looks like a giant daikon
radish!

401
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,938
There's one over here, too!

402
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,149
[Ritsu] (laughs) That's so
goofy!

403
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,818
[Yui] "Kitano Tenmangu"?

404
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,863
[Ritsu] Hey, is this place
famous or something?

405
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,240
What a view!

406
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:12,160
[Yui] Wow! All of that is Kyoto?

407
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,078
[Ritsu] Oops.

408
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,913
How could this have happened?

409
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,122
[Ritsu] We're lost.

410
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,083
Please, just for a while!

411
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,543
I have tasty snacks, too!
