1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,588
So what are you going to do
this year?

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,927
Hey Jun, are you taking up
candy making or something?

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,972
What? Oh boy no.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
It's for Valentine's Day.

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,727
Oh, right. Well who are
you giving them to?

6
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,103
A senior in Jazz Club.

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,398
I thought I might try making
them by hand this year.

8
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,609
Who are you going to
give some to?

9
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:30,321
Maybe to one of the seniors
in the Light Music Club?

10
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,366
No. I didn't really give
any last year, either.

11
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,160
What? No one at all?

12
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,954
Well I had brought some
to give out, but then...

13
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,706
The Belgian royal family?!

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,792
Yes! I just learned that
I've been given access to their,

15
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:47,005
Royal Warrant certified
chocolates, so I'll bring some.

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,175
They were so good I completely
forgot to give them my own.

17
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,843
I hate you right now...

18
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,219
And you?

19
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,429
I made some last year,

20
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,181
but I didn't really
make very many.

21
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,809
I only gave them out to
my sister and the nice
neighbor lady next door.

22
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,144
Oh, bummer.

23
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,688
<i>You know, now that</i>
<i>I think about it,</i>

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,441
<i>I've never given them</i>
<i>chocolates, not once.</i>

25
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,068
Something wrong, Azusa-chan?

26
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,778
I-I don't know what
you just said,

27
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,821
but I definitely wasn't thinking
about Valentine's Day!

28
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,282
[Yui and Jun]
Jeez, you are so obvious...

29
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:19,788
(opening song,
"Utauyo!! MIRACLE")

30
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,216
[Yui] I don't know.

31
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,763
Who? Like owls?... Means birds!

32
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,224
If it says Who, they're
obviously talking about Keith
Moon's band.

33
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,684
Wow? Really?

34
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,520
[Tsumugi] In this instance,
though, it doesn't mean that.

35
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,316
I think this particular "who" is
being used as a relative
pronoun.

36
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,443
It refers back to this clause,
where in the book-

37
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,861
I don't get this...

38
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,529
It's basic stuff.

39
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,325
Hey! Don't worry, Ri-chan!
You've always got your secret
weapon!

40
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,993
Yeah, totally!

41
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,661
[Mio] Secret weapon?

42
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,998
Check it! Leave all your
multiple-choice needs to this
bad boy!

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,874
Hexy #7!

44
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,125
THAT'S your weapon?

45
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,418
[Ritsu] Watch your tone!

46
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,212
Based on my careful testing
of all pencils types,

47
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:36,549
Hexy #7 is clearly the top
choice, with an astonishing 60%
accuracy rate!

48
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,679
[Ritsu] For example,
the answer to this question
is...

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,263
Number three!

50
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,807
She's right!

51
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,433
[Ritsu] 'course I am!

52
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,228
With Hexy on our side,
we're going to pass this text
for sure!

53
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,896
[Ritsu] Oh yeah!
[Mio] Just one problem.

54
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,149
This test actually has 9
multiple choice answers for each
question.

55
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,027
[Ritsu and Yui]
Then we fail for sure.
[Mio] Really?

56
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,697
[Ritsu] But if I can't
use Hexy...
<i>[Azusa] Should I give them</i>
<i>chocolates?</i>

57
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,490
<i>Seems kind of embarrassing.</i>

58
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,076
<i>And presenting them formally</i>
<i>just seems weird.</i>

59
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,369
[Tsumugi] Azusa-chan?

60
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,037
[Tsumugi] Something wrong?

61
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,831
Oh. nothing. I'm fine.

62
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:12,043
Azusa, please don't worry about
us at all, okay? Just keep on
practicing

63
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,169
Yes, go ahead.

64
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,963
[Ritsu] Give us some mood music!

65
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,881
[Yui] Yes!

66
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,925
Well, alright...

67
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:25,223
(Azusa playing the guitar)

68
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,891
I like it keep playing!

69
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,018
[Azusa] Thank you.

70
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,936
Come on, why don't
we get to studying guys?

71
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,396
Kay!

72
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,408
[Mio] Focus!
[Ritsu and Yui] Sorry!

73
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,784
Unbelievable...

74
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,831
How about we take a quick break?
I'll go put on some tea.

75
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,499
[Ritsu and Yui] Yahoo!

76
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,960
[Ritsu] I can't take it anymore!
I've gotta play my drums for a
bit!

77
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,086
[Yui] Yeah same here!

78
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,714
But I gotta make a quick pit
stop first!

79
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,133
[Tsumugi] Join us for tea,
Azusa-chan!

80
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,426
Okay.

81
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,762
I'm sorry. I kind of feel
like my practicing,

82
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,347
is interrupting all your
studying.

83
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,433
No way, look, you're suppose
to practice in the club room,

84
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,186
we're imposing on you by
studying in it.

85
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,730
And to be honest,
I concentrate a whole lot better
when

86
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,815
there is music playing in the
background.

87
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,735
So go ahead and wail away all
you want!

88
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,323
Are you all right with
milk tea, Azusa-chan?

89
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,991
Yeah, of course.

90
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,327
I'm so sorry, it looks like
I've only got some cookies to
offer.

91
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:32,123
That's fine. Worry about
studying that's what's most
important right now.

92
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,543
Well, since Valentine's Day is
coming up and all,

93
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:40,131
I had really hoped to have
some chocolates for everyone.

94
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,219
[Jun] Oh, I see you've decided
to give out chocolates this year
after all?

95
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,845
[Azusa] Yep. It doesn't sound
like

96
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,473
Mugi-senpai will have time to
get chocolates this year.

97
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:53,812
So I thought it might be kinda
nice, for this one time, to give
them all something.

98
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,190
I'm jealous! They're getting
your handmade chocolate!

99
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,441
I'll give you some, too.

100
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,820
Wow thanks! I'll make extra
for you as well.

101
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,698
Now I'm jealous! You're each
getting handmade chocolates!

102
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,324
Don't worry, you'll get some,
too, Jun.

103
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,242
Oh yeah!

104
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,828
Now with that said...

105
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,416
Zip it! You have to keep your
mouth shut and not tell them
about this!

106
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,126
I mean it!

107
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,961
My lips are sealed.

108
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:22,173
However, there might be a few
other people in on the secret.

109
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,467
You can do it, Azusa-chan!

110
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,177
She's so adorable!

111
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,805
[Azusa] W-What just happened?!

112
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,608
[Ritsu] I'm freezing!

113
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,861
[Tsumugi] I can't believe it's
snowing on the day of the exam.

114
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:48,033
There it is. My admission slip
is safe and sound, right in this
pocket.

115
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,659
You are so paranoid...

116
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,202
Do you have yours with you,
Ri-chan?

117
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,874
Of course! It's right here,
all ready to go.

118
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,043
No way.

119
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,003
Are you serious?!

120
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,672
Wait, could that be it over
there?

121
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,008
[Ritsu] That was close!

122
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,218
Come on, don't DO that!

123
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,720
My bad.

124
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:10,930
Here she is!

125
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,390
[Tsumugi] Good morning,
Yui-chan!

126
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,267
[Mio] Morning!

127
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,978
Please don't say anything to me.

128
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,816
If you do, the vocabulary in
my head will start to spill out!

129
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,487
No! Something fell out just now!

130
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,073
Oh please don't be important!

131
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,909
[Ritsu] That's some serious
last-minute cramming.

132
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,463
[Azusa] I wonder if
the test has started yet?

133
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,965
Azusa?

134
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,592
Oh, Jun.

135
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,303
Are you out doing
your Valentine's shopping?

136
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,388
Uh-huh.

137
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,597
So what are you making?

138
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,807
I was going to make a chocolate
cake,

139
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,559
but the recipe I found is so
complicated.

140
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,104
What kind of ingredients are in
it?

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,443
Let's see, some granulated
sugar, and heavy cream...

142
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,405
Oh hey, looks like they've got
some sugar right here.

143
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,281
[Azusa] Oh, you're right.

144
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,033
Wait, that's brown sugar...

145
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,370
Yeah, but chocolate brown too,
so this should good with it.

146
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,330
[Azusa] Uh, really?

147
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:21,960
And if I remember right, I think
they've got some good chocolates
just over here.

148
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,670
[Azusa] But that chocolate's
not for baking.

149
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,756
Chocolate is chocolate. It's all
the same.

150
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,970
[Jun] Now let's see,
the cream is-
[Azusa] Jun wait a sec..

151
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,054
Yeah?

152
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,265
You HAVE made a chocolate cake
before?

153
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,766
Of course I have!

154
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,810
<i>Why don't I believe her?</i>

155
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,938
[Ui] Hey! Azusa-chan! Jun-chan!

156
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,356
[Azusa] Ui!

157
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,984
Hey there! You doing your
Valentine's shopping, too?

158
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,446
Who all are you baking for?

159
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,157
[Ui] I thought I'd start with
something for my sister first.

160
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,993
[Azusa and Jun] That's all
for one person?!

161
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,328
So what are you going to make,
Azusa-chan?

162
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,582
[Azusa] It's SUPPOSED
to be a chocolate cake...

163
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,210
So you want to make it together?

164
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,963
[Azusa] But I...
[Jun] That would be really
great!

165
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,675
Where's all that confidence you
had?!

166
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:16,514
I've got two, but one set are
these big fluffy panda slippers.
Which do you want?

167
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,266
[Jun] Both.
[Azusa] One each.

168
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,977
[Jun] Measure out the
amounts precisely, okay?

169
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,062
[Azusa] Right.

170
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,481
Jun-chan, has the chocolate
melted yet?

171
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,733
[Ui] Hey! Don't!

172
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,692
It's yummy!

173
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,861
I know, but just don't eat it.

174
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,280
Can't we just give it to them
as a gift like this?

175
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,198
[Azusa] No!

176
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,366
[Yui] Hello!

177
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,992
Y-Yui-senpai!

178
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,869
<i>[Azusa] What bad timing!</i>
[Ui] Hey there Sis, you're home
early!

179
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,538
Yeah, we just covered two
subjects today.

180
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,624
Hey guys, you decided to drop
by?

181
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,250
Yeah, we did!

182
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,753
<i>I have to make sure she</i>
<i>doesn't suspect anything!</i>

183
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,339
So, how do you think you did on
the exam?

184
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,924
Uh, I...

185
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,012
I've no idea.

186
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:56,805
[Azusa] Figures.

187
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,057
What'cha guys making here?

188
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,477
Whatever it is it sure smells
chocolatey and yummy!

189
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,436
It's, um...

190
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,188
It's a chocolate cake!

191
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,564
<i>She told her!</i>

192
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,609
Wow, really? When it's done,
let me have some, okay?

193
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,236
Yeah of course.

194
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,487
Why did you tell her?

195
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,947
I'm always making snacks,

196
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,783
it'll never occur to her that
it's for Valentine's Day.

197
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,536
Are you sure?

198
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,665
Uh oh, looks like we don't have
powdered sugar for the
decorations.

199
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,958
What'll we do?

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,002
The store on the corner
has it, I'll get it.

201
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,713
No, hold on if you don't want to
I'm happy to-

202
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,715
(Door opens, cold wind blows)

203
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,091
-keep an eye on things here.

204
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,634
Really?

205
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,679
[Ui] Once the timer goes off,
take it out of the oven, okay?

206
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,264
[Jun] Got it!

207
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,432
[Azusa] It's freezing!

208
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,143
I bet Jun will taste- test
everything.

209
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,563
[Ui] Wait a sec.

210
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,481
[Azusa] A hundred prayers?

211
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:52,861
[Ui] Yeah. It's right next door,
so I throw in ten cents every
time I walk by.

212
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,904
This has to be about the
hundredth time...

213
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,823
[Azusa] That's some bad
bookkeeping...

214
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,955
What have you been wishing for?

215
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:08,501
Oh, I've been wishing that my
sister and the others get into
the same college,

216
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:13,131
and that they all graduate
together without any problems.

217
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,343
I see. I guess I'll do
the same then.

218
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,806
[Azusa] It's freezing!

219
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,064
[Azusa] K-ON!

220
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,279
<i>I'm a nervous wreck</i>
<i>for some reason...</i>

221
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,781
[Jun] I gave it to her!

222
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,240
How did it go?

223
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,784
Perfect!

224
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,119
What's up? Are the guys from
Light Music Club not here yet?

225
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,580
No. You sure that
it's a good idea

226
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,083
that I give it to them here
at the front of the school?

227
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,251
It's really kind of
embarrassing.

228
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,462
Why do you think that?

229
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,130
S-Senpais! It's for you!

230
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,757
Though the chocolate may be
bitter,

231
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,677
it is full of the sweet feelings
that I have for you!

232
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,805
[Girls] Um. Thanks.

233
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,182
You're right, I see how that
might be embarrassing.

234
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,059
[Azusa] Like I would ever say
that.

235
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,729
I know, how about sneaking it
into a guitar case or something?

236
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,482
Yeah, but the issue with
that is when to do it.

237
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,150
Ah. Oh, but-

238
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:18,071
[Yui] Take cover! It's a bomb,
Commander!

239
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,656
That might cause a big fuss.

240
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,699
[Azusa] And it wouldn't happen.

241
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,825
Well if that won't work,

242
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,535
then maybe put it in one of
their desks,

243
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,661
when they're not looking.

244
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,955
That's not bad. I could make
that work.

245
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,417
Hey Ritsu! We're leaving now!

246
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,127
I'll be right there!

247
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,295
There is that chance.

248
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,297
Yeah, THAT I could see
happening.

249
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,050
[Yui] No, you've got to have
the black sesame custard roll!

250
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,636
[Ritsu] Eh, is that even a
thing?

251
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,763
Yeah! And it's totally
delicious!

252
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,515
[Yui] What would you want,
Mugi-chan?

253
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,059
[Tsumugi] Me? I suppose an
anko bean bun.
[Jun] Aren't you going?

254
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,686
[Azusa] Yeah.
[Yui] An anko bun, huh?

255
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,354
[Mio Fan] Akiyama-senpai!

256
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,773
Uh both of us would like you to
have this!

257
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,443
Oh, uh... Thank you.

258
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,944
Wow, it's huge!

259
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,613
[Ritsu] Befitting for our
legendary live vocalist!

260
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,157
[Mio] Back off!

261
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,159
[Ritsu]
Oh my, somebody's blushing!
[Jun] You're not going?

262
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,202
Mm... No.

263
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,205
[Ui] You haven't given it to
them yet?

264
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,791
Nope. Not yet, and
it's already lunch time.

265
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,878
Well that's all right, you can
still give it to them after
school, can't you?

266
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,883
Well she can but, I bet you
anything Mio-senpai gets a ton
of chocolates.

267
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,635
What if they divide them all up
and eat them together?

268
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,221
When school's out the last thing
they'll want are chocolates.

269
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,974
I don't think they'd wolf them
down all at once like that.

270
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,934
My point is, "Victory goes to
the swift."

271
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:34,564
Don't you worry about it. I'm
sure that they'll be happy to
get it whenever.

272
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,024
Do you think so?

273
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,943
Maybe I'll give her mine now.

274
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,236
Who is it?

275
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,237
It's Mio-senpai.

276
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,239
She's my bass guitar idol.

277
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,367
O-Okay.

278
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,035
[Ichigo] That's the Light Music
Club.

279
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,870
Hey, you're right.

280
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,789
Mio and the others went to the
staff room.

281
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,916
Thank you so much!

282
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,377
[Jun] I'm a nervous wreck!

283
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,004
[Ui] They remembered us.

284
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,258
They here?

285
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,762
Yui-chan and Ri-chan, got
accepted to their third choice
school.

286
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:09,140
Mio-chan and Mugi-chan, were
accepted to their third and
second picks.

287
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:13,436
You are true to form, bad at
rehearsals, but great when
you're up on stage.

288
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,479
Word!

289
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,022
That wasn't a compliment.

290
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,818
We just have to hear from
your first choice school now.

291
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,486
When do they post their results?

292
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,154
Two days from now.

293
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,658
All right. I'll keep my fingers
crossed, that you're all
accepted.

294
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,201
Thanks!

295
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,078
[Sawako] Well, that's
the last of all your exams
girls.

296
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,039
Now you can just kick back
and relax until graduation.

297
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,416
You've earned it.

298
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,585
[Azusa] Graduation...
[Girls] Will do!

299
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,920
Ah, nothing.

300
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,880
[Tsumugi] Look, it's Azusa-chan!

301
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,132
Hello!

302
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,718
What is it? Here for a teacher?

303
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,594
Uh actually...

304
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,930
Azusa go on!

305
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:55,603
Um, well here you go!
This is for you, Mio-senpai.

306
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,813
Thank you.

307
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,816
[Jun] And these are for
the rest of you. Here.

308
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:00,817
[Girls] Thanks!

309
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:01,860
[Ritsu] Ours are, dinky!

310
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,154
[Tsumugi] But very cute, though.

311
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,905
Just do it, Azusa.

312
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,574
Ah. Okay...

313
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,076
[Mio] You brought us
something, too, Azusa?

314
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,370
Azu-nyan chocolates!? Awesome!

315
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,497
Um...I...

316
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,505
[Azusa] I um...have to use
the bathroom right now.

317
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,508
Wait, what? Hey, Azusa!

318
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,760
I'm confused.

319
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,386
Oh, to be young!

320
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,472
[Jun] Azusa!

321
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,520
Azusa. What's wrong?

322
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,231
Just give it to them,
it's not THAT embarrassing.

323
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,526
All you've got to do is hand
them the box and say, "Here you
go."

324
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,236
That's not it.

325
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,198
That's really not it at all.

326
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,411
[Azusa] It hit me.
They're really gonna graduate.

327
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,582
They really are gonna leave. All
of them.

328
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,672
[Jun] There, there...

329
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,188
Okay, I'm off to Jazz Club now.

330
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,733
All the seniors said they
were coming in today for sure.

331
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,609
Later.

332
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,277
Bye!

333
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,614
Azusa-chan I-

334
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,075
[Jun] Azusa!

335
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,619
Whatever you do just make sure
you give it to them!

336
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:40,375
She's right.
You have to do it, Azusa-chan!

337
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,710
Girl power!

338
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,128
Yeah!

339
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,925
Here goes...

340
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,219
[Yui] Ow!

341
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,347
[Azusa] Yui-senpai?! Are you
okay?

342
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,182
Wait, why are you down there?

343
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,852
I sensed your presence
outside...

344
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,186
Um you sensed my what?

345
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,772
[Tsumugi] Oh, Azusa!

346
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,192
I decided to break out
my special reserve tea today.

347
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,069
Oh, wow, you did?

348
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,030
Well it sure does smell really
good.

349
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:13,199
[Ritsu] While we're talking
about it, whatcha got for snacks
today?

350
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,202
[Tsumugi] I'm sorry, I didn't
bring anything today!

351
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,454
But I have a feeling that

352
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,373
Azusa-chan may have brought
something instead!

353
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,336
[Azusa] How did you guys find
out?!

354
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:29,049
[Ritsu] As we left the office,
Sawa-chan said: "Save a piece
for me please!"

355
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,678
[Yui] So good!

356
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,138
You are a cake genius!

357
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,848
I wouldn't go THAT far.

358
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,808
It really IS quite delicious.

359
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,602
Y-You guys think so?

360
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,898
Azusa! Seeing as how this is
a chocolate cake, does that mean
it's a-

361
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:49,778
Well um, how can I put it?
It's a token of my gratitude, I
guess.

362
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,488
Ah, gratitude? Do tell.

363
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,699
And in return for your
amazing gift, I give you this!

364
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,785
What is it?

365
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,786
[Yui] Candy!

366
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,496
A return gift for White Day!

367
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,164
[Azusa] Too soon!
[Ritsu] Too cheap!

368
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,042
[Ritsu] If you don't give the
gift ON White Day, it's
pointless.

369
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,919
[Yui] Oh, really?

370
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,338
[Girls] Thanks for the treat!

371
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,298
Thank you all, you're too kind.

372
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,051
I really hope Sawa-chan gets
here soon.

373
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,096
What is it?

374
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,472
Snow.

375
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,683
[Mio] It's snowing a lot, too.

376
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,143
Wow, you're right!

377
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,853
Everything is all white!

378
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,189
Yeah? Let me see.

379
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,982
[Ritsu] That truck is totally
buried!

380
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,150
[Azusa] You're right, it is!

381
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,069
I want to see, too!

382
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,363
Well...So do I!

383
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,573
We're all going to have
to squeeze in pretty tight.

384
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,202
[Yui] Wait! What about me?!
Don't leave me!

385
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,663
[Ritsu] Fine, fine, get over
here.

386
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:45,250
[Yui] Hey I can't see
anything...

387
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,252
[Ritsu] Yo, watch with the
pushing!

388
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,505
You're such a baby.

389
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,924
[Yui] Oo! It's all white!

390
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,175
[Tsumugi] It's lovely.

391
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,387
[Ritsu] We're getting a lot
of snow this year.

392
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:58,763
[Girls] Look out!

393
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,890
[Ritsu] Whoa, that girl
almost slipped and bit it.

394
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:01,975
[Azusa] She sure did..

395
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,977
[Mio] Loafers fail when it
comes to-

396
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,104
Ah! Don't say fail!

397
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,606
[Mio] Sorry.

398
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,659
You know, this is nice.

399
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:24,372
All of us huddled together
like this. It's nice.

400
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,750
Even though it's been
freezing all day long,

401
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,587
when I'm with you guys
like this, it doesn't seem
cold at all.

402
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,132
Oh, that goes for you too
Ton-chan.

403
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,720
Yui-senpai?

404
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,806
You're all warm and cozy,
Azu-nyan!

405
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,475
Thanks.

406
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,894
[Ritsu] Warm and cozy!

407
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,189
[Ritsu] Warm and cozy!

408
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,899
[Ritsu] That tickles!
Cut it out!

409
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,152
Sawa-chan!

410
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,580
[Azusa] Ten cents times 100!

411
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:27,644
May all my senpais, please,
please, please, please please!
Oh please!

412
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,479
Get accepted to their
first school of choice.

413
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,564
So they can all go to
college together!

414
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,445
And may we spend every
single minute

415
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:41,408
until they finally graduate
laughing and smiling.

416
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,840
The candy Yui-senpai gave me...

417
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,809
That's sweet...

418
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,486
[Ritsu] Ready! One, two!

419
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,197
Come on, this is still
just a practice run.

420
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,909
[Mio] That one essay.
I know that I messed up
that essay question.

421
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,495
[Ritsu] You don't know
if you flunked just yet, okay?

422
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,706
[Mio] Yeah. You're right...

423
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,751
Even if I go to a different
school, let's stay friends,
okay?

424
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,711
Just wait until you see
the dang results.

425
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,505
[Ritsu] And if you leave before
you look at that board,
you're dead to me.

426
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,507
[Mio] No! Don't say that!

427
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,426
[Ritsu] Okay, for reals
this time!

428
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,178
[Ritsu] Let's do it!
[Girls] Yeah!

429
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,929
[Girl 1] There's my name!
[Ritsu] We so got this!

430
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,515
[Girls] Yeah!
[Ritsu] After School Tea Time!

431
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,351
[Girls] Yeah! Huh?

432
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,852
[Girl 2] You should call
your mom!

433
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,771
Why did you do that?

434
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:58,234
One, two!

435
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,211
[Azusa] They did it!

436
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,254
They got in!

437
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:25,929
(closing song, "NO, Thank You!")

438
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,893
[Mio] It sure is warm today.

439
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,061
[Yui] Don't mind me.

440
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,730
[Ritsu] You wanna go
somewhere and hang out?

441
00:23:58,772 --> 00:23:59,856
[Tsumugi] Let's just stay here.

442
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,150
[Mio] But what should we do,
though?

443
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,486
[Yui] Let's have an epic battle!

444
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:14,579
[Mio] It's our classroom,
but still, some how it feels
kind of different now.
