[NARRATOR] 15 years ago,

in the middle of
the Pacific Ocean.

The city of San-Teresa

became known as
"Earth's Front Door."

Over two million citizens from
this strange world live here.

A melting pot of races,

San-Teresa is the world's
newest "city of dreams."

But, in the shadows, lurk all

He talked,

314
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,291
but was too scared to say
very much, unfortunately.

315
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,625
That fairy was stolen.
Supposedly.

from a gang of Mexicans

It's difficult to say,

00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,958
but with the right donation
amount maybe God would talk.

I could share His word with you.

for drugs and murder.
