00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,969
[NARRATOR] The city of
San‐Teresa on Kariaena Island

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,013
became known as
"Earth's Front Door."

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,141
Over two million citizens from
this strange world live here.

4
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:19,394
A melting pot of different
races, cultures, and species,

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,313
the haves and the have‐nots.

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,815
But, in the shadows of the
chaos lurk all kinds of

7
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,442
crimes and criminals.

8
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,611
The San‐Teresa
Metropolitan Police force

9
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:31,532
maintain a specialized unit
to deal with the seedy mayhem.

10
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,752
[TILARNA hums]

11
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,463
[TILARNA] I've only been in this
world a handful of months,

12
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,423
and yet so much
has happened.

13
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,551
[TILARNA] The first case I
took on with my partner,

14
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,637
Kei Matoba, was personal.

15
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,014
It involved tracking down
someone that I knew:

16
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,141
a fairy named Leahyah.

17
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,522
[TILARNA] She wasn't
just any fairy, either.

18
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,815
She was a noble fairy.

19
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,361
A member of a powerful
clan in western Farbani.

20
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,989
[TILARNA]
She was kidnapped.

21
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,742
A group of nasty criminals
took her from her home

22
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,911
and brought her into this world.

23
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,539
[CAPTAIN A]
There they are.

24
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,417
It's some important noble,
is that right?

25
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,795
I'll let you take it from here.

26
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,297
[TILARNA] In accordance with a
treaty struck between my land

27
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,800
and the entity called,
"The United Nations."

28
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,596
I was sent to the world of the
doreany, to carry out justice.

29
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,932
I stipulated that I only
wanted to work with a

30
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,351
"boliceman" who was
wise and just.

31
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,020
Someone who was strong and
experienced and well‐versed

32
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,855
in the ancient traditions.

33
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,317
But instead, I was paired
up to work with this man.

34
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,277
A foul‐mouthed cigarette smoker,

35
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,114
and the first person
I met when I arrived.

Knights of Mirvor?

Do Earthlings have no
welcoming ritual?

[KEI]
I talk.

you answer? Well, then?

I didn't know you who were.

46
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,476
[TILARNA]
I see.

47
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:50,230
[TILARNA] My name is

Nelano Seiya. Nel Exedilica.

In your Earth language it's,

[KEI]
Huh?

61
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,259
Huh. Typically,
only people of low birth

62
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,096
have names that short, but I
suppose it's of no consequence.

63
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,890
It's a pleasure.

64
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,183
To simplify things,

65
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,019
you may call me
Tilarna Exedilica for short.

Don't touch anything.

I think it's latena.

Someone was here who's
controlled by an evil wizard.

Someone else was controlling
him via mildey.

Even if we had captured him,

at each other?

[TILARNA] Kei and I
didn't get along at all,

to solving the case.

[TILARNA] He and learned
something disturbing:

143
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,001
the fairies were being used as
weapons in the doreany world,

144
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,128
and we soon discovered that
a man named Zelada

145
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,255
was heavily involved
in the case.

146

[music blaring]

[chuckles]

148
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,140
[TILARNA] But, sadly,
the bolicemen seemed

149
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,601
more interested in arresting
Zelada and his fellow criminals

150
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,771
than they were in finding
and saving Leahyah.

151
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,693
[TILARNA] Under doreany law,
fairies are considered citizens,

But because of the
way they look and act,

155
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,827
they're treated more like cats
or dogs than actual citizens.

156
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,621
They're not often given
the respect they deserve.

In any case,

159
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,672
Even if it meant forfeiting the
sword I valued as much

160
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,132
as my own life,

161
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,010
and embarking on a journey that
promised little hope of return.

162
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,094
[ELBAJI] ...you know
why that is, friend?

163
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:13,845
No.

164
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,847
Because I'm hot,
man, that's why!

165
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,640
[TILARNA]
She was important to me.

166
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,101
I cherished her more
than anyone knew.

167
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,686
I couldn't just let her
die in this world.

168
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,731
[KAREEM] Congratulations, but
I'm just here for the product.

169
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:28,234
Sorry, right. Hey, Zelada!

170
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,030
[ZELADA] Yes, my lord,
what may I do for you?

171
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:32,822
[ELBAJI]
Mr. Kareem,

172
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,909
allow me to introduce
you to Zelada the Sage.

173
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,078
[KAREEM] He's the wizard you
were telling me about?

174
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:38,953
[ELBAJI]
Yeah.

175
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,623
He's the greatest when it comes
to controlling the dead.

176
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,001
[ZELADA] Your words do me
great honor, sir. I'm grateful.

177
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,296
I only do what I can for
the sake of my master.

178
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,256
[KAREEM] He called them,
"the dead."

179
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,759
Was he talking about
fairy dust users?

180
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,427
Yes, indeed he was.

181
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,138
My magic has no effect
on the pure of soul.

182
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,767
Those who use the drug
fall right under my spell.

183
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,519
[ELBAJI] And that's
where this thing comes in!

184
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,771
And is that device
the fairy bomb?

185
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,272
[ELBAJI]
A prototype, but yeah.

186
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,942
And you're about to see
me put it to the test.

187
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,527
Wait, what are you
talking about?

188
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,988
[ELBAJI] I called these guys.
Dialed nine‐one‐one.

189
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,616
Told them some suspicious
people were causing trouble.

190
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,409
[COP A] This place is
off‐limits. Come on.

191
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,536
Hands above your heads,
all of you.

192
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,663
Check this, watch your eyes.

193
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,334
[COPS shout]

194
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,919
[KAREEM grunts]

195
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,383
It works immediately!
Verdict, Zelada?

196
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,468
[ZELADA]
A total success, my lord.

197
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,636
Judging by the look of them,

198
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,222
both officers are
already deceased.

199
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,850
How 'bout you have them give
us a nice, little salute.

200
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,894
As you wish, my lord.

201
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,855
Now, have one of them
shoot the other.

202
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,273
Yes.

203
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,899
‐‐[gasps]
‐‐[gunshots]

204
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:57,490
Poor bastard! He blew him away!
So, what next? How about this!

205
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,951
Make that stupid piggy
dance on the hood!

206
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,580
[ZELADA, ELBAJI laughing]

207
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,748
[ELBAJI]
Zelada, you call that dancing?

208
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,001
‐‐You need some lessons, bro!
‐‐[ZELADA] Apologies, sir.

209
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,587
[ELBAJI laughs]

210
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,047
Ah, man, that's freakin'
hilarious, right?

211
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,549
[KAREEM] How many can
he control like this?

212
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,383
[ELBAJI]
Ha!

213
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,635
Five, or ten thousand?

214
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,304
Really. As many as you like,

215
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,182
I've controlled up to
about 300 at once.

216
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,266
[KAREEM]
Good god.

217
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,687
And that's just the prototype.
Imagine the real thing, bud.

218
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,357
We use a potent fairy,
every inch of its body.

219
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,612
The blast radius. Bro, it covers
about five kilometers.

220
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,906
That's the size of a nuke.

221
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,908
We could overthrow
superpower governments

222
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,326
with this in our hands.

223
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,453
Do whatever you want
with it, my man.

224
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,081
Thing is, to work it, you'll
have to rent Zelada, too.

225
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,917
Just name your price.

226
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,587
All right. Good. Get the cash,
and it's yours.

227
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,715
[ZELADA] My lord. Have you
finished with this one?

228
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,675
[ELBAJI]
Yeah, take care of him.

229
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,023
[KEI]
Forest Tower,

230
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,525
one of the tallest buildings
in the whole city.

231
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,653
That's where he's
gonna use the bomb?

232
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,029
[TILARNA]
It may have more of an effect

233
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,323
from up there than
on the ground.

234
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,741
[KEI]
Interesting.

235
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,244
So, it's the same as
a nuke that way, huh?

236
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,703
[TILARNA]
What's this place like?

237
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,332
[KEI] Loaded with rich people.
Common folk never go there.

238
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,833
Heh! On second thought,

239
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,044
maybe we oughta let
him go through with it.

240
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,504
[TILARNA grunts]

241
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,839
[KEI]
Come on, that was a joke.

242
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,968
Better be... Kei.

243
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,344
[KEI]
What?

244
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,806
This Zelada. Do you know
him from somewhere?

245
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,642
[KEI exhales]
I might.

246
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,186
But that doesn't mean he's
different from any other perp.

247
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,109
[BOTH gasp]

248
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,404
[TILARNA] This is Zelada's
doing. I can sense it.

249
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,991
[KEI]
Inside!

250
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,492
Is he dangerous?

251
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,995
I do fear him. He's a wizard.

252
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,747
They can blind you,
shoot poison flames,

253
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,000
and sadly, your
weapons can't win.

254
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,461
Even this? It's a good gun.
I've been using it forever.

255
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,881
It's still a
doreany weapon. No soul.

256
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:24,053
Although, I feel a
faint latena from it.

257
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,263
[KEI]
Hm?

258
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:29,142
Feelings for a thing
create latena, no matter what.

259
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,685
[KEI sighs]

260
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,978
[elevator beeps]

261
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,026
Better stay close to me, Kei.

262
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,778
I'm the only one who can
spot the enemy's ambush.

263
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,988
Come on.

264
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,407
We're partners. Trust me.

265
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,744
[KEI grunts]
Got it.

266
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,831
[TILARNA gasps]
Back away!

267
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,500
Ahead! Hurry!

268
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,128
[TILARNA] That fire will
burn up your lungs.

269
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,964
You'll lose your ability
to breathe. It's horrible.

270
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,259
[KEI] You mean I'll
choke to death? Damn.

271
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,552
[TILARNA]
There she is!

272
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,556
[gasps]
Leahyah!

273
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,268
Leahyah!

275

[KEI]
Wait! It's a trap!

276
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,190
[TILARNA] I don't care.
I have to save her!

277
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,400
[KEI]
I know that, but‐‐Dammit!

278
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,696
[KEI]
What do I do with this thing?

279
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,198
I don't know, just smash it!

280
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,324
[KEI]
Are you kidding?

281
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,743
That's a good way to
make it detonate.

282
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,996
Gotta disarm it somehow.
I don't know.

283
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,082
Is this even technically a bomb?

284
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,752
[ZELADA] What a reckless,
futile endeavor.

285
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,587
You cannot stop what's coming.

286
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,839
So, you might as well
run for it now.

287
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,925
Hurry and you'll escape, go!

288
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,218
[TILARNA]
Damn you!

289
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,345
[KEI] Something about that
stupid grin on your face

290
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,139
makes me even more
motivated to take you down.

291
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,350
[ZELADA] Charming, but we
both know you won't.

00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,227
Shut up!

unfortunate, Sir Matoba.

300
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,453
It appears that you've
lost once again.

301

And now, for your
little friend...

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,667
I'll enjoy this part!

I can't see him.

305
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:32,223
No. Don't rely on vision.
Follow the sound.

306
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,933
The sound.

[ZELADA]
Yes. Nicely done.

314
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,632
I haven't been wounded like this
in a hundred and three years.

315
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,304
You're wasting
your last moments.

316
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,890
It's time to make your
peace and prepare for death!

317
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,684
Not yet. I'm afraid
I cannot bring shame upon

318
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:21,689
the Marzeny Sect by dying at
the hands of a mere Barshe.

319
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,107
Therefore...

320
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,609
[TILARNA gasps]

321
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,612
[ZELADA]
...I must bid you farewell!

322
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,491
[ZELADA laughs]

323
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,786

[KEI grunts]

325
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,918
[TILARNA]
Kei!

326
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,920
I got rid of Zelada.

327
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:48,216
But I don't have any elixir
to heal you. I'm sorry.

328
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:53,095
[KEI grunts]
Go. Run. Now!

329
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,185
[TILARNA]
No. No time for that.

330
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,480
I suppose we'll just spend our
last few moments together.

331
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,856
You should be grateful.

332
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,275
A boorish, uncouth,
sarcastic man like you

333
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,861
getting to die next
to someone like me?

334
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,948
Please go. You can make it.

335
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,992
[speaks Farbani]

336
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,118
[LEAHYAH gasps]

337
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,789
[TILARNA] As I promised.
I've come to rescue you.

338
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,166
When I was child,
lost in the forest,

339
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,960
you did the same for me.

340
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,338
You showed me the way out,
helped me get back home.

341
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,173
Remember the
promise we made?

342
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,218
That, no matter what,
we'd always be friends.

343
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,014
That's why I'm here. I had to
uphold the oath we swore.

344
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,642
At least I saved you
from dying alone.

345
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,145
So, please, Leahyah.
Don't be afraid.

346
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,064
We are together.

347
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,610
[sighs]

348
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:56,576
Leahyah? You can't. Stop this!
Don't do it! Leahyah!

349
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,329
[TILARNA]
Leahyah!

350
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:17,221
[TILARNA speaks Farbani]

351
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:21,017
[grunts, coughs]

352
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,730
I'm alive...? What is this?

353
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,231
[TILARNA]
I used a healing spell.

354
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,399
[KEI gasps]

355
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,900
[TILARNA]
I needed an elixir,

356
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,987
one that could counteract the
damage caused by the poison.

357
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,573
Something with very
powerful latena.

358
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,408
[KEI]
An elixir?

359
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,328
[TILARNA] I was able to
make one from her body.

360
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,913
So, the fairy died anyway?

361
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,041
[TILARNA sobs]
She did.

362
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,713
[TILARNA] The bomb needed a
living fairy as a catalyst.

363
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,674
I suppose she knew that.

364
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,051
[KEI]
Hm...

365
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:01,515
[TILARNA] She sacrificed her
life in order to save me.

366
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,392
To save all of us.

367
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,771
[TILARNA]
When I was a child.

368
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,858
Leahyah loved to entertain me by
doing the most magical dances.

369
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,905
When I was hungry, she brought
me nuts that she had foraged.

370
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,282
We made a promise,
that if we were in trouble

371
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:22,244
or found ourselves alone, we
would be there for one another.

372
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,163
Because we held our
friendship sacred,

373
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,706
no matter where we were.

374
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,503
[TILARNA] Kei Matoba.
Thanks for everything.

375
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,382
[KEI] Uh, sure. You, too.
I appreciate it.

376
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,925
[TILARNA]
I'm going home in shame,

377
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,094
instead of dying with
honor like I'd hoped,

378
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,096
but I leave knowing that there
are some good warriors

379
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,597
on earth, after all.

380
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,142
[KEI]
Oh, wait. I almost forgot.

381
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,268
[TILARNA]
My brooch.

382
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,813
I pulled some strings
to get it from O'Neill.

383
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,481
This thing's worth a lot.

384
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,566
Wouldn't want to
lose it to that guy.

385
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,067
Yes, but‐‐

386
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,611
Just shut up and
take it, will ya?

387
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,950
[TILARNA giggles]

388
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,453
Bye.

389
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,372
[TILARNA]
Bye.

390
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:10,209
I bid you farewell, and I thank
you for your gallantry!

391
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,754
[TILARNA sighs]

392
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,256
[KEI sighs]

393
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,354
[TILARNA] I could've just gone
back home at that point,

394
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,357
but I was curious about
the city of San‐Teresa.

395
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,027
And also, I found myself
becoming fond of Kae.

396
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,488
[TILARNA]
When I say "Kae."

397
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,283
I'm referring to my
partner's cat, of course.

398
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,835
[KEI]
Kuroi, you hungry?

399
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,211
[SPORTSCASTER A]
Slam dunk!

400
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,422
I haven't seen a play
like that in ages!

401
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,008
And nice rebound
from the Semanian.

402
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,343
Here comes the shot
from half‐court.

403
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,305
Boom! Two three‐pointers
in a row!

404
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,056
[KEI]
What the hell's this?

405
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,725
Some kind of sports game.

406
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,477
I can't tell what the
rules are, though.

407
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,479
[KEI]
Not that, moron, you!

408
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,730
What the hell are
you doing here?

409
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:16,525
[TILARNA] Oh. I see now.
I changed my mind.

410
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,651
[KEI]
Huh?!

411
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,945
We're not sure
Zelada's really dead.

412
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,531
And this city is still
full of villains.

413
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,701
I figured I could help.
So, I decided to stay.

414
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,495
[KEI]
You kidding me?

415
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,294
[KEI] You're a detective now?
And in my department?

416
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,923
Yes, it appears so. Therefore,
I'll be staying here a while.

417
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,343
Are there any
further questions, partner?

418
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,595
[KEI grunts]
Partner?

419
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,727

[TILARNA giggles]

421
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,772
[KEI] Well, we've got an
early morning tomorrow.

422
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:55,898
I'm gonna hit the hay.

423
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,109
[TILARNA] Yeah, sounds good.
Goodnight, Kei.
