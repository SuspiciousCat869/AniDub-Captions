[TILARNA]
Zelada?

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,347
[KEI] He's gonna use that
bomb any minute now.

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,226
Better stay close to me, Kei.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,103
I'm the only one who can
spot the enemy's ambush.

00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,481
We're partners. Trust me.

Wait! It's a trap!

12
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,169
[TILARNA] I don't care.
I have to save her!

13
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,463
[KEI]
I know that, but‐‐Dammit!

14
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,550
[KEI]
What do I do with this thing?

15
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,093
I don't know, just smash it!

16
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,261
[KEI]
Are you kidding?

17
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,597
That's a good way
to make it detonate.

18
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,099
Gotta disarm it somehow.

19
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,935
I don't know. Is this even
technically a bomb?

20
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,689
[ZELADA] What a reckless,
futile endeavor.

21
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,608
You cannot stop what's coming.

22
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,818
So, you might as
well run for it now.

23
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,904
Hurry and you'll escape. Go!

[TILARNA]
Damn you!

25
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,324
[KEI] Something about that
stupid grin on your face

26
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,243
makes me even more
motivated to take you down.

27
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,287
[ZELADA] Charming, but we
both know you won't.

00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,164
Shut up!

[ZELADA] Well, that's
unfortunate, Sir Matoba.

38
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,307
It appears that you've
lost once again.

And now, for your little friend.

[KEI] Dammit, where is he?
I can't see him.

00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:22,119
No. Don't rely on vision.
Follow the sound.

Yes. Nicely done.

00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,528
I haven't been wounded like this
in a hundred and three years.

53
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,158
You're wasting
your last moments.

54
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,827
It's time to make your peace
and prepare for death!

00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:04,703
Not yet.

56
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,581
I'm afraid I cannot bring
shame upon the Marzeny Sect

57
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,543
by dying at the hands
of a mere Barshe.

58
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,961
Therefore...

Kei!

65
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,897
I got rid of Zelada.

66
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,151
But I don't have any elixir
to heal you, I'm sorry.

[KEI grunts]
Go. Run. Now!

[TILARNA]
No. No time for that.

69
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,415
I suppose we'll just spend our
last few moments together.

70
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,792
You should be grateful.

71
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,127
A boorish, uncouth,
sarcastic man like you

72
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,713
getting to die next
to someone like me?

73
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,966
Please go. You can make it.

[TILARNA] As I promised.
I've come to rescue you.

77
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,853
When I was child lost in the
forest, you did the same for me.

78
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,273
You showed me the way out‐‐
helped me get back home.

79
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,234
Remember the promise we made?

80
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,153
That, no matter what,
we'd always be friends.

81
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:24,908
That's why I'm here. I had
to uphold the oath we swore.

82
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,702
At least I saved you
from dying alone.

83
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,039
So, please, Leahyah.
Don't be afraid.

I used a healing spell.

[gasps]

93
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,711
[TILARNA]
I needed an elixir.

94
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,797
One that could counteract the
damage caused by the poison.

95
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,508
Something with very
powerful latena.

An elixir?

97

[TILARNA] I was able to
make one from her body.

98
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,765
So, the fairy died, anyway?

99

[TILARNA whimpers]
She did.

100
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:38,690
The bomb needed a living
fairy as a catalyst.

101

To save all of us.

I'm going home in shame,

00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,821

I'd hoped, but I leave knowing

that there are some good

And this city is still
full of villains.

One move and you're dead.

That's your only warning,
you hear me?

Hey, Chief Zimmer. What's up?

177
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,991
Can it!

178
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,827
Word is you chopped off one
of the gang member's arms.

179
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,662
It wasn't me, actually.
It was her‐‐

180
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:03,496
[ZIMMER]
Shut up!

181
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,749
I don't care which one of you
did it. You work as a pair.

182
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,752
You see, if that alien decided
to rape a hundred‐year‐old man,

183
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,504
I'd treat you like you're
the one who did it,

184
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,089
and I'd be calling
you a freakin' sicko

185
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,549
for the rest of
your natural life.

186
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,009
‐‐[KEI] Wait‐‐
‐‐Don't get worked up.

187
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,719
I'm a fair boss, Kei.

188
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,888
So, if you decided to
take a shit on the floor.

189
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,057
I'd make that alien clean
it up with her toothbrush.

190
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,059
Are we clear?

191
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,519
[KEI]
Sure.

192
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,395
[ZIMMER]
I'm glad.

193
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,647
So, then, why'd you
chop off the guy's arm?

194
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,232
His lawyer's gonna have
a field day with that,

195
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,734
and there'll be hell to pay.

196
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,861
[TILARNA] It wasn't his
whole arm, just a finger.

197
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,114
Also, Chief Zimmer, don't call
me an alien anymore.

198
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,657
It's racist, you know.

199
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,744
Oh, oh, oh!
I said something racist?

200
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,288
Thank you for pointing that out!

201
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,247
You know Garner from the

202
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,874
District Attorneys
office, right?

203
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,084
I'll have a talk with him,
but you better have a report

204
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,046
on my desk by 9am tomorrow,
do you understand?

205
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,006
It better not be a
single minute late!

206
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,300
Yeah... Got it.

207
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,385
[ZIMMER]
Alien! You, too!

208
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,472
Hell maybe Matoba can teach
you how to write one!

209
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,474
That guy sucks.

210
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,477
But hopefully he's not a
mole like our last boss.

211
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,270
How dare he chastise
me so harshly?

212
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,272
I was carrying out justice!

213
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,274
Yeah, well,
you took it too far.

214
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,984
Because you let
your guard down!

215
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,653
So it was your fault! And‐‐

216
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,696
I don't seem to remember
asking for your help

217
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,822
in the first place.

[TILARNA gasps] Excuse me,
but I was not finished.

219
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,701
Would it kill you
to say a simple,

220
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,245
"thank you" for
once in your life?

Over here!

We're being called.
You can berate me later.

He is such a jerk...

226

[KEI grunts] Hey! Geez!
What is your problem?

227
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,262
You are!

228
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,265
[KEI grunting]
Stop! You're embarrassing me!

00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,516
[TILARNA]
<i>Rakebye</i>!

230
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,768
Why are you flirting with her?

231
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,938
What?! I'm not!
Did something happen?

232
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,815
[TONY]
We're not quite sure.

233
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,317
This garage belongs to
the guys we just cuffed.

234
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,694
[KEI]
Hm?

235
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,121
[KEI]
A coffin.

236
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,082
[TONY sighs] It gets a
whole lot weirder than that.

237
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,376
Do you think it
belongs to a Semanian?

238
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,627
[TILARNA]
I don't know.

239
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,463
I've seen letters like
these in ancient texts.

240
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:23,011
Moon. Forbidden. Blood.
That's all I can decipher.

241
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:23,928
[KEI]
What's inside?

242
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,097
[TONY]
Could be some valuable artifact.

243
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,432
We have to be careful with it.

244
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,350
[GODNOV] Who gives a shit?
Just smash it open.

245
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,768
[TONY sighs]

246
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,606
[TILARNA gasps]

247
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,527
Is that thing... a mummy?

248
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,572
[TILARNA] It appears to be
some kind of princess to me.

249
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,250
[CECIL] At this point,
I'm not totally certain,

250
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,127
but it looks like
a Semanian woman.

251
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,587
Oh, you really think so?

252
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,922
It's a mummy we found
in a Semanian coffin,

253
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,134
wearing Semanian clothes.
What else would it be?

254
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,386
[CECIL] They have a different
number of teeth.

255
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,640
Humans have 32 teeth,
but Semanians only have 28.

256
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,933
[KEI]
Hm!

257
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,185
[TILARNA]
Uh?

258
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,188
[gasps]

259
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,732
[CECIL] I can perform
an autopsy, if you want,

260
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,985
but we typically deal with
fresh corpses, not mummies.

261
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,363
You might be better off taking
her to an archaeologist,

262
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,530
don't you think?

263
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,824
[KEI] We can send her to
a lab when you're done.

264
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,993
Time of death,
cause of death, age.

265
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,621
I want that stuff tonight,
if possible.

266
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,873
Kei. Just for your information,

267
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,666
I've been on the clock
since this morning.

268
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,170
Well, hey, isn't that a
weird coincidence? I have too!

269
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,963
[CECIL]
You are such a jerk.

270
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,423
I heartily agree.

271
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,424
Thank you!

272
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,551
I'm totally shocked that
you decided to stay here

273
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,928
and work with this guy!

274
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,973
It was temporary insanity.
I deeply regret that choice now.

275
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,810
[CECIL] I know, right?
He's mean and cold‐hearted.

276
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,854
But every once in a while he'll
be nice and catch you off‐guard.

277
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,856
It's exhausting,
but don't let him fool you.

278
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,484
[TILARNA] I don't quite follow,
but I'll keep that in mind.

279
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,944
Hey.

280
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,488
You would never believe what
he did the first day we met.

281
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,824
He comes in here with the
cadaver of some gang member

282
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,368
he had just killed, and do
you now what he says?

283
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,829
"Don't steal the change from
his pockets." Like, what?

284
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,704
I know what you mean!

285
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,623
I literally saved
his life today.

286
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,917
And all he said was he didn't
"ask for my help"!

287
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,420
So the next time, I think
I'll just let him die.

288
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,921
[CECIL]
Yeah, you should.

289
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,799
And then maybe we can
dissect his body together.

290
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,093
Let's cut him open
and take a selfie!

291
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,558
[TILARNA] Great idea,
Bozah Epps! I can't wait!

292
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,853
You can call me Cecil,
Miss Exedilica.

293
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,856
[TILARNA] Okay, Cecil.
And you may call me Tilarna!

294
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,151
[KEI] Oh, great.
You're best friends now.

295
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,488
Uh, Dr. Epps, the results
for the lab work came in.

296
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,407
Glad you're so friendly
with our clients,

297
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,160
but don't forget that we
have other work to do here.

298
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,079
I won't forget.
I'll be right there.

299
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,206
[CHAPMAN]
Tsk.

300
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,753
[TILARNA] What's his problem?
Isn't he your apprentice?

301
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,423
[CECIL] My assistant.
He doesn't like me.

302
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,674
No idea why.

303
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,967
Or maybe he does.

304
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,386
Seems to me like he might
have a crush on you.

305
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,139
Oh. You jealous?

306
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,392
Ah, come on now.
I'll wait to hear from you.

307
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,652
[TILARNA]
I'm a little concerned.

308
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,489
Bodies like that aren't
something to be taken lightly.

309
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,283
[KEI] If you're worried about
bacteria or something, don't.

310
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,409
Cecil's a pro.

311
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,744
[TILARNA]
Not that.

312
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,205
