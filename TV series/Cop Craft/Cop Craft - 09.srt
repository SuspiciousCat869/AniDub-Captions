The shooter is John Ennaji.

308
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:18,942
He's a male Semanian,
32 in Earth years.

309
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:21,317
Single, a clerk at a
convenience store.

310
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,817
No criminal record, except for
a few speeding tickets.

311
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,525
Everyone who knows him
says they can't believe he

312
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:28,108
would do something like this.

313
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:30,650
Got no underworld
connections, either.

314
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:34,942
This isn't our case. There's no
role for us here, but...

315
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:36,692
What, is there a problem?

316
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:40,858
I read your old report, Kei,
about your former partner, Fury.

317
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,817
Zelada?

318
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,567
We never found his corpse.

319
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,067
I wouldn't be the
least bit surprised

320
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,067
if he survived that
fall somehow.

321
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,983
So, is that what you're
trying to get at, Chief?

322
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:03,608
You think the shooter who
killed Kahns was manipulated

323
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:05,692
using magic, like those others?

324
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:07,817
I didn't wanna say it, but...

325
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,233
...we're just
covering bases, got it?

326
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,817
I want you and Exedilica to
head to the coroner's office

327
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,400
and see what you can figure out.

328
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:16,525
You want us to go now,
dressed like this?

329
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,775
That's exactly what
I want, Burger Boss.

330
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:23,900
[TILARNA] I had a strange
feeling it might have been

331
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,275
another controlled
corpse, as well.

332
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:28,733
I didn't expect Zimmer to
pick up on that, though.

333
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:32,233
[KEI] Sometimes it's surprising
how perceptive he can be.

334
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:35,233
Man, I really wanted to go home.

335
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,150
[TILARNA] You mean you're
not excited about the chance

336
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,858
to catch whoever was behind
Kahns' assassination?

337
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:41,692
[KEI] I'd rather not
waste a weekend off

338
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:45,442
avenging some politician's
demise, to be perfectly honest.

339
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:46,192
Kei.

340
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:48,275
What? I'm kidding.

341
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:50,233
[TILARNA] I have to admit,
I've been pretty impressed

342
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:52,650
with the way your
democracy works on Earth.

343
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:55,483
I think any system that truly
reflects the will of the people

344
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,608
is a good thing.

345
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,858
And this shooting feels
like a declaration of war

346
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:01,525
against that system.

347
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:04,358
[KEI]
That's a good speech.

348
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:07,608
Or, it would be, if you
weren't wearing a swimsuit.

349
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:10,108
Stop staring, people.

350
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:12,942
That's precisely why I
didn't want to come here.

351
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,608
[TILARNA]
I don't get what you mean.

352
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:16,733
Are you saying these people
are mocking our clothes?

353
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,317
Just forget it.

354
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,275
[knocking]

355
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:26,983
[KEI] You in there, Cecil?
We're coming in.

356
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:29,358
[CECIL]
Kei? Stop!

357
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:31,108
And, who might you be?

358
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:34,400
Uh, we'll be quick about this.

359
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,567
Hot enough for ya out there?

360
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,733
[TILARNA] The chief was
right about this case.

361
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:41,733
[KEI]
Hm?

362
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:44,192
This man was already dead.

363
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,858
His corpse was taken
over to murder Kahns.

364
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:47,858
[KEI]
By Zelada?

365
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,775
I can't be entirely certain.

366
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:52,192
Although, this form
of magic is rare.

367
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:54,942
I can't think of any
other obvious suspects.

368
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:57,650
[KEI, BUSINESSMEN exhale]

369
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,858
Urgh...

370
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:01,192
[TILARNA]
So, what now?

371
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:03,692
[KEI] We have to go
to Chief Zimmer first.

372
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:08,942
Tsk. Damn alien.

373
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,275
[TILARNA sighs]

00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:13,733
[KEI] Wait a second. You!
What did you just say?

375
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:15,567
[SANDERS stammers]
Nothing.

376
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,858
[KEI] Don't lie. What did
you say when you saw her?

377
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,858
[SANDERS]
I-I don't know.

378
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:25,692
[KEI] I heard you, you coward.
You called her a "damn alien."

379
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:28,775
You too scared to repeat it?
You insulted my partner.

380
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,942
What made you think
that was cool?

Please. I just--

Kei. Stop.

388

you a question! Tell me why!

[SANDERS]
Please! Please forgive me!

390
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:53,608
My family's conservative.

391
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:56,692
We were really excited
about voting for Kahns!

392
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:58,275
And, then I dunno, man.

with the killer being, you know,

[KEI] So, you think my
partner killed Kahns?

00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:08,858
No, I don't.

397
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:11,567
[KEI] Well, did she do
something to hurt your family?

[SANDERS]
No.

00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:16,233
[KEI] Christ. So, you had no
real reason to insult her.

400
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,650
What the hell is your problem?
Is this how you treat

401
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,858
the citizens you were
sworn to protect?

That's enough--let it go.

I just can't.

[KEI grunts]

407
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:07,025
You embarrassed me. I wish
you wouldn't have done that.

408
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:08,650
[KEI]
Sorry.

409
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,150
But I still appreciate it.

410
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:14,358
I didn't do it because I
wanted your appreciation.

411
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:15,775
It just pissed me off.

412
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:19,025
Heh! I knew you'd say that.

413
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:21,067
Seems kinda
hypocritical, though.

414
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,983
You call people
"damn aliens" all the time.

415
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:27,775
[KEI] That's different.
It's just me teasing you.

416
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:30,483
Like when a gangster calls his
girlfriend a bitch because he's

417
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,358
trying to look
cool or something.

418
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:36,692
But if somebody else says the
same thing to her, he gets mad.

419
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:38,025
It's sort of like that.

[ZIMMER sighs]
I see.

430
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,942
[TILARNA] It was probably
Zelada, we think.

431
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:06,567
So, Chief Zimmer, It looks
like your hunch was right.

432
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,233
That's a shame. I was really
hoping I'd be wrong about that.

433
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:10,942
Oh? But why?

434
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:12,650
Because it's a pain!

435
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,192
Now I have to go around to
every department involved

436
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,192
and brief them on it.

437
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,858
Which means telling them,
"Watch out for wizards."

438
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,483
Better you than me.

439

Oh and don't forget the
Semanian who shot and killed

It's gonna be a trash fire.

What makes you call it that?

442
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:33,817
It'll cause racial tension.
Like what you saw earlier.

00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,650

Oh...

[ZIMMER] Even if Zelada,
also a Semanian,

00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:40,817
is behind the whole thing,

we even find the guy, Chief?

449
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:49,858
It's not like you can just
catch a wizard with

security camera footage,
we all know that.

It seems like the best
thing would be to go back

to the basics
of police work.
