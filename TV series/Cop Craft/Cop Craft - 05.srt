She's probably just trying
to stay out of sight.

A K‐9 unit could track her.

Our vampire doesn't
seem too smart.

I'm not so sure.

134
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,813
She didn't attack the
witnesses after the crash.

135
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,066
Maybe she meant
for this to happen.

Let's ask 'em.

00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,697
[MALE WITNESS A] Huh? No,
she definitely had both arms.

138
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,866
[TILARNA]
She must have regenerated it.

139
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,827
She got out of the truck and I
swear she looked straight at us.

But then she took off.
Going that way.

00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,500
[KEI] Was the woman naked
when she left the scene?

142
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,502
[MALE WITNESS A]
I actually couldn't tell.

143
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,672
It kind of looked like she
had a little black dress on.

00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,256
[FEMALE WITNESS A]
But not like a normal dress!

There was this haze
floating around it.

Oh my god, exactly!

"Vau e..."

00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,233
[KEI]
What's that?

153
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,276
[TILARNA] It's a basic

be worn as clothing.

155

Meaning, she's recovered
enough of her powers

that she's now able
to use magic again.

that spell? The Val, er. Vow.

158
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,499
[TILARNA]
Vau e Deie, and I do.

159
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,794
Can you show me?

160
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,548
[TILARNA] No I can't. It won't
work if I have my clothes on,

161
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,092
and it disappears
if you're not focused.

162
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,844
[KEI]
Is that so.

163
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,599
[TILARNA]
Don't imagine it.

164
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,851
[KEI]
Don't flatter yourself.

165
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,104
No. I can see it on your face!
You were picturing me naked!

166
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,940
Ugh. What gives a commoner
the right to even think about

167
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,568
seeing me nude? Get my body
out of your filthy mind‐‐

168
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,862
[KEI]
Whatever man, enough.

169
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,114
We've got a vampire to
catch here. Where'd she go?

170
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,200
Ah, yeah, you're right.
Let me see.

171
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,889
[TILARNA]
That big building.

172
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,266
[KEI]
That's called a shopping mall.

173
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,685
[TILARNA]
I think she's hiding there.

174
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,313
The witnesses said she took
off the other way, though.

175
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,898
The dogs, too.

176
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,649
[TILARNA] But if she wanted
a view of this area,

177
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,777
she would have gone
to that building.

178
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,820
[KEI] So what you're getting
at is she left the body

179
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,323
for us to find because she
wanted to see how the cops

180
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,824
would react.

181
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,037
Yes. She's done feeding for now.

182
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,457
So she'll be trying to gather
information about the city.

183
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,126
I don't think she's worried
about anyone catching her.

184
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,796
Even if they manage
to surround her.

185
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,632
[KEI]
I see. Good detective work.

186
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,633
That's sarcasm.

187
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,135
[KEI]
No, I'm genuinely impressed.

188
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:58,598
Liar. I know when you're
making fun of me, you vile man.

189
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,142
[KEI]
On my life, I swear it's true.

190
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,187
Screw it, let's just
get to the mall.

191
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,276
[KEI]
Yes, everyone.

192
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,946
As many guys as you
can give me, right now.

193
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,864
Just make sure nobody
goes in alone.

194
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,700
And if you run into her,
don't try to catch her.

195
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,912

196

[KEI]
One second.

197
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,959
[TILARNA] I picked up
the smell of her latena.

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,211
This is where she went inside.

199
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,420
[KEI]
Got it.

200
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,757
[TONY] Security cameras
aren't showing a thing.

201
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,927
She hasn't tripped any
of the lasers, either.

[KEI]
You sure?

[TONY] You think vampires
can see infrared?

204
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,432
[KEI] We'll just have
to go in after her.

205
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,560
Let me know if you
pick something up.

206

Anything?

207
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:58,241
Yes, she's close by.
Not sure what direction.

208
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,075
A trap?

209
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,619
Maybe. Stay sharp.

I think so.

Those pieces are too
