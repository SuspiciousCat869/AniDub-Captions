You can brief her later.

[ZIMMER] It's about the
Mozeleemay case.

His lawyer's been pitching
a fit to the media,

him up, that he's being framed.

Yeah that's the plan.

If we push hard enough, there's
a real chance he'll give in.

mean we can't be friends?

about you, she'll feel betrayed.

she may refuse to testify.

Wow, you came prepared.

313
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,868
[gasps] There's more here
than there should be.

314
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,788
I think you know
what that's for.

315
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,622
[ZOEY]
Do I?

316
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,417
You agreed to meet 'cause
you wanted it, right?

317
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,129
[ZOEY]
Stop it, Mr. Mozeleemay.

318
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,922
[MOZELEEMAY] If all you
wanted was to make a deal,

319
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,674
you could have done it online.

320
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,635
But you haven't been able to get
me off your mind, have you?

321
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,470
[ZOEY]
That was just business.

322
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,681
I quit that line of work.

323
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,434
[MOZELEEMAY] Why not get back
into it, just one more time?

324
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,521
I can satisfy you. Wasn't I
always a good customer?

325
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,606
Huh? Yeah?

326
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,816
Look.

[MOZELEEMAY gasps]

328
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,530
[ZOEY] You know,
you're far too careless.

329
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,489
[MOZELEEMAY]
Give me that!

330
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,075
This one's free. Cheers.

331
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,995
You bitch. Screw you!
You'll pay for this!

332
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:58,040
I'm being nice. Trying to
teach you a valuable lesson.

333
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:58,624
[MOZELEEMAY]
Get out!

334
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,878
[ZOEY] Gladly, you'll get the
data you want very soon.

335
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,005
[MOZELEEMAY]
I said get out! Now!

336
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,592
[ZOEY grunts]
A pleasure!

337
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,560
[KEI] Uh‐huh. Got it. Take care
of that, too, would ya?

338
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,687
[TILARNA gasps]

339
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,522
[KEI groans]
Another dead end.

340
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,733
I'm starting to think
Mozeleemay and his people

341
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,444
might not have access to
any of our data after all.

342
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,237
Kei.

343
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,989
Could the person
who's leaking it,

344
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,283
be one of the girls who
used to work at the club?

345
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,286
[KEI] You think one of the
workers had the client list?

346
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,497
I don't know.
If they were smart,

347
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,665
they'd get into another line
of work after getting busted.

348
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,543
[JAMIE] Listen, about that.
Can I butt in?

349
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:44,962
Whatcha got?

350
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,006
I was looking through
the hard drives of the PCs

351
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,967
we confiscated. Or copies
of them, specifically.

352
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,011
I know that. Spit it out.

353
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,597
[JAMIE] I was able to restore
the logs from the webcams.

354
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,058
I found photos of everyone
who accessed the client list

355
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,226
before we got it.

356
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,395
Most of the time it's the owner
and her cronies, but, look.

357
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,608
One of the girls also accessed
it several times. There she is.

358
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,569
[gasps]
Zoey.

359
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,997
[GARDNER] At this rate,
we won't be able to prosecute.

360
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,625
We have to find some way to
convince the judge what's real

361
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,586
and what's fabricated.
Or, at the very least...

362
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,505
...we'll have to prove
that the list going around

363
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,591
isn't actually a leak from
the police or the DA's office.

364
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:34,554
[KEI] I have an idea.
Try to buy me some time.

365
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,471
You okay?

366
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,973
[TILARNA]
With what?

367
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,808
[KEI] I can talk
to her, if you want.

368
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,770
[TILARNA] No. I think I
should be the one to do it.

369
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,522
[KEI sighs]
Okay.

371
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:52,071

[TILARNA]
What are you doing?

376
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,428
I should be asking
you the same thing!

377
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,598
What is that sword for?
Never mind, look.

378
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,267
Remember what I promised you?
It's ready.

379
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,312
Zoey, we need to talk.

380
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,897
I had a hard time deciding
which one I should give to you.

381
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,274
In the end, I made
the obvious choice.

382
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,317
[TILARNA]
Zoey!

383
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,152
What?

384
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,613
[TILARNA] The client
list from the brothel.

385
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,698
Did you sell it to Mozeleemay?

386
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,074
What do you mean?

387
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,202
[TILARNA] Don't play dumb.
I know the answer.

388
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:47,293
You a cop...?
You are, aren't you?

00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,462
I'm sorry I lied.

You disgust me.
