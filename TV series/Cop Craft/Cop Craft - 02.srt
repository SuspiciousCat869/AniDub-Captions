The city of San‐Teres on

00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,774
Kariaena Island, became known
as "Earth's Front Door."

18
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,860
Over two million citizens from
this strange world live here.

A melting pot of races,

the haves and the have‐nots.

But, in the shadows lurk all
kinds of crimes and criminals.

The San‐Teresa Metropolitan

Okay, Miss Don Quixote,

did it occur to you that we

[KEI]
Hey, answer me!

28
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,484
Someone else was controlling
him via mildey.

29
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,860
Even if we had captured him,

30
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,446
we wouldn't have been
able to learn anything.

[KEI
"Mildey?"

32
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,159
Yes. Magic used to
control the dead.

33
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,413
He'd been totally
devoured by evil latena,

34
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,915
and it transformed him
into a living corpse.

35
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,750
[KEI] So, you're blaming
your choice to shoot a perp

You're obstructing

[KEI]
Nothing, I said it, flat‐out.

44

I wonder how much you're getting

If you value your life, do not
insult my integrity again.

I read the report, Cecil.

What I wanna know is what
these two have in common.

00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,854
That's an easy one.

This man here, the one
who killed your partner.

76
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:20,529
And this one, who very nearly
killed you... were dead.

77
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,656
Quite some time
before they died.

78
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,533
[KEI] You're gonna have
to spell it out.

79
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,744
t's about their blood oxygen
and lactic acid levels.

80
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,412
Your shots should've
killed them,

81
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,540
but for some reason,
they kept moving.

82
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,542
And their blood only reached
the levels a dead person

83

would have after the fact.
It's a fascinating puzzle.

00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,338
But, that's what they
have in common.

85
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,841
[KEI] So, they were
basically zombies.

86
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,678
I'm not quite sure. Depends on
the official definition.

87
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,514
I didn't see any signs
of major drug use.

88
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,807
They both seemed to
drink and smoke,

89
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,892
but that had no effect
on their health.

You're wrong about the drugs.

[TILARNA] This one's
the same as the other.

I smell the evil latena on him.

100
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,001
[CECIL]
What's latena?

101
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,961
[TILARNA]
Latena is latena.

102
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,922
[KEI] It's some kind of magical
energy source or something.

103
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,883
I have no clue, either.

104
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,927
Fairy latena that's
been horribly warped.

105
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,346
These men ingested it
on a regular basis

106
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,640
and became dead men.

107
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:34,561
[CECIL ehales] Are you telling
me that it's some kind of drug?

108
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,771
A Semanian substance?

109
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,775
[KEI] Fairy dust. These guys
were habitual users, right?

110
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,527
[TILARNA] If you can
call the dead "users,"

111
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,112
then yes, they were.

112
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,157
The Marzaney Sect has spells
that can control the dead.

113
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,242
[CECIL] Well, that would
explain why it didn't show up

114
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,120
on their labs. That drug is
a complete mystery to us.

115
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,664
All we know is that
it's made from fairies.

116
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:59,878
What terrible people.
To do that to a fairy.

117
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,213
[KEI]
So, can you use magic, too?

118
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,883
[TILARNA] It's called mildey,
and I can use it a little.

119
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,760
[KEI] Then why don't you
act as my police dog‐‐

120
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,721
use your mildey to follow the
trail of this latena stuff?

121
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,099
[TILARNA] Quite an imagination
for an idiot, Kae Imatoeba.

122
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,727
Mildey is powerful, but it
can't make one omnipotent.

123
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,480
I know you have a small brain,
but try to remember that.

124
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,065
[KEI] I don't take
advice from useless,

125
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,150
alien aristocrats, but thanks.

126
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,027
[CECIL] So, I guess you
two aren't what I'd call,

127
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,320
"friends," then?

128
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,156
[KEI] You've always been
so observant, Cecil.

129
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,450
Are you implying that
this man has friends?

130
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,744
That some people like him?

131
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,412
Sort of...

132
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,582
Kei?

133
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,458
[KEI, TILARNA]
Hm?

134
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,669
You doing all right?

135
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,337
I think so.

136
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,298
I'm here, if you need to talk.

137
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,384
Yeah, appreciate it.

138
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,137
[TILARNA]
What was that exchange about?

139
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,305
[KEI]
Don't worry about it.

140
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,225
[TILARNA]
No, I'm curious. Tell me.

141
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,685
[KEI]
Fine, she's my ex.

142
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,770
[TILARNA]
Hm? What is an ex?

143
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,146
[KEI]
Forget it.

144
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,442
[ROTH] The timing of the
attack is the problem here.

145
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,571
They were either watching
Alvarez or there was a leak.

146
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,657
[KEI] And there's no way
to tell which it was.

147
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,576
Could be either, or any
number of other possibilities.

148
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,496
But you can rest easy about
our brave little E. T. knight.

149
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,040
She doesn't even know
how to make a phone call.

150
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,084
[TILARNA] I do, so.
I read a book about it.

151
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:25,380
Oh, really? Wow, she knows
how to read! Whoa.

152
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,798
That's great.

153
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,385
So, anyway, I'll be keeping
my reports to a minimum, boss.

154
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,805
[ROTH] Sounds good.
Just be careful out there.

155
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,266

[TILARNA] They say you can't
have weapons in the building.

They demanded to
hold onto my sword.

them hold onto it.

[TILARNA]
I can't do that!

About three months ago, I think.

I was chasing after
a drug dealer.

Kuroi was a stray, and the

And then what?

No one else in the

A total success, my lord.

Judging by the look of them,

both officers are
already deceased.

his coworkers would

Maybe they used gold jewelry.

Gold jewelry?

412
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,524
[TILARNA] It can enhance

But if you want
something this potent,

00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,236

Not even to the width of

Even the best craftsmen
in my country would fail.

I could always
be mistaken, though.

Well, hold on. A craftsman
