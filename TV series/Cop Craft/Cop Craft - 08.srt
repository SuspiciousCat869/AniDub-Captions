alien disease that's making you
act like you lost your mind.

158
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,391
Rest up, I'll see you later.

159
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,187
[TILARNA]
Meow!

160
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,526
[KEI] Oh, right! The trash.
Sorry about that.

161
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:14,572
[meowing continues]

162
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,661
[KEI groans] She left all
this crap out? What the hell?

163
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,791
[KEI] Kuroi, take care
of Tilarna. Be good.

164
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,918
[meowing]

165
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,343
[KUROI meows]

166
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,220
[TILARNA]
This is a nightmare.

167
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,763
That old crossbow,

168
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,808
it was covered in mildey
of Moz Nel Valva.

169
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,396
‐‐[TILARNA grunts]
‐‐[KUROI] Huh?

170
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,525
[TILARNA gasps]
She got on top of Kei

171
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,861
wearing practically
nothing at all!

172
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,321
But he thinks it's me!

173
00:10:55,363 --> 00:11:02,912
[TILARNA panics] I have to
remain calm. I can fix this.

174
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:07,375
First, the crossbow...
It fell off the sofa.

175
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:12,338
And into the garbage! Right!
The bin next to the couch!

176
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,050
But wait, Kei took the bag!

177
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,512
[TILARNA]
<i>Quenishuba</i>. <i>Quenishuba</i>!

178
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:24,934
[TILARNA gasps, yelp]
Oh no. Don't do that!

179
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,696
[TILARNA] Is she going to...
Oh, please, no.

180
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,868
[TILARNA] Don't do it, Kuroi!
Come on, stop!

181
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,912
At least take off your
underwear before you‐‐

182
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,084
[TILARNA]
No, Kuroi! Please!

183
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,880
[TILARNA]
Gross!

184
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,221
[ZIMMER grunts]
A simple raid

185
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,556
turned into a plane
crash in the swamp?

186
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,850
What the hell
happened out there?

187
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,352
[KEI]
I already told you.

188
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,605
The local cops botched the stake
out and the target saw us.

189
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,397
[ZIMMER]
Shut up!

190
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,358
Don't you blame it on them,
you moron,

191
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,194
the Golanbiza County police were
blowing up my phone at midnight

192
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,947
putting it all on us,
and my wife was pissed!

193
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,949
I've been eating raw oysters
and taking zinc supplements

194
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,617
all week to give her
what she wanted,

195
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,786
and 'cause of you, I couldn't!

196
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,915
Wait a second. It was
just the county cops?

197
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,124
[ZIMMER]
What?

198
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,211
The complaints you were getting.
Hear anything from the CBP?

199
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,421
[ZIMMER]
You piss them off, too?

200
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,840
I was on the phone with their
guy, Hellmandes, this morning,

201
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,634
but he didn't say
crap about you.

202
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,303
[KEI]
Hm...

203
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,680
Hold on. Wait!

204
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,182
You got in some kinda fight
with 'em, didn't you?

205
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,226
Don't lie, Matoba!
If I find out‐‐

206
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,521
[KEI] Nothing happened with
the CBP, Chief, calm your tits.

207
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,648
Hey! I'm not done with you!

208
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,865
[sighs] There's no way
she's still asleep.

209
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:14,877
[TILARNA groans]
I can't take it anymore.

210
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,754
I have to do something.

211
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,466
[TILARNA]
I have to find that crossbow.

212
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,593
The trash people
come this afternoon.

213
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,554
The bag should still be
out in the dumpster.

214
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,347
But I have no way
to get out there!

215
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,934
I can't even open a door
with these useless cat paws!

216
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,566
[TILARNA gasps]

[meows]

218
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,072
[TILARNA] That's it.
I have to enlist help!

219
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,286
[CECIL] Tilarna? Weird.
She almost never texts.

220
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,833
[TILARNA] My apologies for
writing so suddenly.

221
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,170
I've a serious problem.
Come to my home immediately?

222
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,760
What is going on here?

223
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,930
[CECIL]
Don't tell Kei? Why not?

224
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,937
[KEI]
See you guys on the flip side.

225
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,609
[busy tone]

226
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,695
Who in the hell would
Tilarna even be talking to?

227
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:26,407
Hello? Tilarna? I got
your texts. What's going on?

228
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,408
[TILARNA meowing]

[meowing continues]

231
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,416
Hello, kitty! You sure
have a lot to say, huh?

232
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,336
Can you put Tilarna on the
phone, I need to talk to her.

233
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,215
Wow. I'm just talking
to cats now, I guess.

234
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,175
Anyway, I'm heading over
to your house, all right?

235
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,760
Be a good girl
until I get there.

236
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,261

[phone buzzes]

238
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,897
[KEI]
Sergeant Matoba.

239
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,399
[HELLMANDES]
What the hell is going on?

240
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,441
[KEI]
With what?

241
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,777
[HELLMANDES] Yesterday there
were 28 Semanian items

242
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,904
on record from the plane
crash in the swamp.

243
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,825
But now there are only 27!
Where's the missing item?

244
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,912
Oh, I see. That is peculiar.

245
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,039
Well, sometimes stuff
just happens, you know?

246
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,333
Things were kind of
a hot mess yesterday.

247
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,710
[HELLMANDES] Cut the crap!
Get me the missing item now,

248
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,879
or I'll have you arrested
for embezzlement!

249
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,132
[KEI] Come on!
This is a minor screw‐up,

250
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,218
not some big conspiracy!
Take it down a notch, turbo.

251
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,885
[HELLMANDES]
Fine.

252
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,889
Just get it to me now and
there won't be any trouble!

253
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,685
[KEI]
What the hell's up his ass?

254
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,000
[bell buzzes]

255
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,836
[CECIL]
Tilarna? Are you there?

256
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,630
She's gotta be. Tilarna?

257
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,681
Still here.

258
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,521
[CECIL]
I'm coming in, okay?

259
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,526
[CECIL]
Tilarna? Huh?

260
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,033
[meows]

261
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:36,245
Kuroi! What's wrong?
Did you make this giant mess?

262
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:40,041
[meowing continues]

263
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,336
[CECIL] Are you telling
me it wasn't you?

264
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,213
[CECIL gasps]
Calm down!

265
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,885
Logically, I know
this isn't possible,

266
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,847
but are you Tilarna, somehow
trapped in Kuroi's body?

267
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:55,932
[meowing quickens]

268
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,310
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I think you are.

269
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,189
[CECIL] You got this
way because of mildey?

270
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,066
[TILARNA meows]

271
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,903
And you need to get the crossbow
in order to switch back.

272
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,865
That's how you two switched
bodies to begin with.

273
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,202
It's in the dumpster.
The one outside?

274
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,413
Why would you put it out there?

275
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,541
The garbage truck should
be coming this afternoon!

276
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,669
If they take it away,
we'll be in major trouble!

277
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,966
[CECIL] I think it's safe to
say you do need it, Tilarna!

278
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,801
No "may" about it!

279
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,805
[CECIL]
Huh?

280
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,140
Ce... Ce...!

281
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,351
Wait, so if Kuroi is
really Tilarna,

282
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,186
then you must be...

283
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,772
[CECIL]
No, don't!

284
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,990

[KENNY grunts]
What?

287
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,794
[KEI]
It's Matoba. Is O'Neill in?

288
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,547
Last I heard, he was
still at this address.

289
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:14,051
[KENNY grunts]
The boss? Hold on a minute.

290
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,346
Ugh. My head's killing me.

291
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,977
[knocking]

292
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,021
I let myself in.

293
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,614
[KENNY grunts]
Hey, Sergeant.

294
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,950
[KEI] Kenny. What's up
with that outfit?

295
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,078
[KENNY] What do you mean?
These are my jam jams.

296
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,413
I always wear them to bed.

297
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,999
I can't go to sleep
without 'em, dude.

298
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,292
This place is a mess.

299
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,587
[KENNY] Yeah. There was
a wild party last night.

300
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,839
That guy on the floor
a friend of yours?

301
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:56,218
[KENNY]
Nope. Never seen him before.

302
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,928
[KENNY]
How did he get in?

303
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,722
[KEI]
Where the hell is O'Neill?

304
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,933
[KENNY] I haven't seen him
since last night. Ugh...

305
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,394
Last I remember, he had
just made a vodka soda

306
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,855
with ketchup and habanero
sauce in it and was doing

307
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,732
pelvic thrusts on
the coffee table,

308
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,068
but it starts to get
pretty fuzzy after that.

309
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,244
I would ask why
there's a goat in here,

310
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,829
but I'd rather not know.

311
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,083
[KENNY] Weird. It wasn't
here when I passed out.

312
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,212
What kind of party
was this, man?

313
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,464
[KEI]
O'Neill isn't here.

314
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:38,010
[KENNY] Heh. Maybe the goat
got hungry and ate him.

315
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,929
[KEI]
Oh You're hilarious.

316
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,640
I gotta find him. I need him
to check on something for me.

317
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,935
It's urgent. Get off me,
goat we're not friends

318
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,440
[BIZ chuckles]

319
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,693
[KEI gasps]
Did you hear something?

320
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,904
[BIZ groans]
Forgive me, Lord.

321
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,198
I am being smothered by
the abundance of your‐‐

322
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,741
Where the hell are you, O'Neill?

323
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:04,495
[BIZ grunts] My lungs.
It hurts to breathe.

324
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,623
I've been chosen to suffocate
for the sins of the flesh.

325
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:11,085
I come to you, Lord, to rest
in your kingdom forever.

326
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,964
[KEI]
O'Neill? You under there?

327
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,174
Hey, lady, get off
the man, will ya?

328
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,218
[KENNY] Can't help ya, man.
When the Virgin Mary

329
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,138
gets like this, she's out
for 12 hours, at least.

330
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,015
[KEI laughs] The Virgin Mary?
But isn't she a hooker?

331
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,601
[KENNY] Yeah. That's just
what they call her.

332
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,315
[KEI exhales]

333
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,738
[KEI]
This'll wake her up.

334
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,742
[chuckles]

335
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,202
[yells]

336
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,706
[BIZ groans]

337
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,460
[KENNY] Sergeant.
That was a mean trick.

338
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,920
[KEI] I didn't think
she'd flip out like that.

339
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,841
Is he okay? You think we
should call an ambulance?

340
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,262
[CECIL grunts]

341
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,140
[CECIL]
Huh?

342
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,393
That's right, you're Tilarna.
It wasn't a dream.

343
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,020
[TILARNA meows]

344
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,523
[CECIL gasps] Garbage truck!
Did it come yet?

345
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,234
[TILARNA meows]

346
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,906
Oh no! I might be able to
catch it. You coming, too?

347
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,406
[TILARNA meows]

348
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,325
Okay, if you insist!

349
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,206
First, we gotta find
that garbage truck.

350
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,333
I couldn't have been
out for very long,

351
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,335
which means it should
still be nearby.

352
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,879
[TILARNA meows frantically]

353
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,840
What is it?
Do you see the truck?

354
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:45,429
[meowing continues]

355
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,390
[CECIL] Mm? Lower the
blinds before we go.

356
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,727
If someone sees me up there
like that, I will die.

357
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,730
Jeez, we don't have
time for your pride!

358
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,456
[CECIL]
Done. Now, let's go!

359
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,847
[KEI]
Next time, on <i>Cop Craft</i>.
