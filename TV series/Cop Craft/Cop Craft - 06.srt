158
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,014
That one's not even illegal.

159
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:38,560
This magazine is...
indecent and repulsive!

160
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,563
I cannot believe this!
You're barbarians!

161
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,314
All earthlings are insane!

162
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,109
[KEI grunts] Your own mom and
dad did some version of that,

163
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:46,818
just so you know.

164
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,070
[TILARNA]
You're lying!

165
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,406
How dare you insult
my parents like that!

166
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,825
That's beyond the pale,
even for you!

167
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,954
My mother and my father?
Never! Ever!

168
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,248
Just keep telling
yourself that.

169
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,751
You must've been formed by
cell division or something,

170
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,252
I guess, like bacteria.

171
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,504
I mean, that makes more
sense than the normal way,

172
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,048
to be honest.

173
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,800
Hey. You all right?

174
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:14,262
[TILARNA]
This can't be. It just can't.

175
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,431
[KEI] Now that I think about it,
your world doesn't have

176
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,309
a lot of photographs
in general, does it?

177
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,312
Makes sense that porn
would be so shocking.

178
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,107
[KEI]
Hey, Cammy, whatcha up to?

179
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,735
I'm not helping you
look for porn, <i>vete</i>.

180
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,363
Jamie, how's my
favorite colleague?

181
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,366
Forget about it, Kei.
Drowning in paperwork.

182
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,994
O...kay.

183
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,954

Uh... Oh, Tony!

187
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,462
Is it me, or have you
gotten even more handsome?

188
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,089
That tie is really something!

189
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,674
[TONY] Oh, this old thing?
I've had it for ages,

190
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,718
but it's great with
my complexion, right?

191
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,597
I think so. But, Kei, you're
kind of creeping me out.

192
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,682
[KEI]
Am I really? Not my intention‐‐

193
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,727
Look, I was hoping you could
help me with something.

194
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,734
[TONY] Kei is officially
the absolute worst!

195
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,986
Flattering me into
his porn mag trap?

196
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,823
The perps are probably
a buncha 12‐year‐olds.

197
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,991
I bet it was bound
for Leto Semani.

198
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,328
If they could smuggle porno
in there, they'd make a fortune.

199
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,872
Most people in that world
don't even have TVs.

200
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,667
[TONY] I guess men are morons,
no matter what world they're in.

201
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,920
[GODNOV] Are you surprised?
We're ruled by our balls.

[phone beeps]

203
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,508
[TONY sighs] And there it is.
That's from O'Neill.

204
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,635
He is fast.

205
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,096
[TONY]
They're not far away. Gun it.

206
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,599
[TONY sighs]

207
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,809
[GODNOV]
You seem upset.

208
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,020
[TONY] Of course, I'm upset.
You know I hate being McCloud.

209
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,605
He's the scum of the earth.

210
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,608
I don't disagree, but I
do like his sense of style.

Transformation complete.

00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,332
Good luck, Detective McCloud.

215
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,669
Cut the crap. Or do you want
me to put a bullet in you?

216
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,671
[GODNOV] Here let me take
a pic for your boyfriend.

217
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,007
Don't you dare! It's secret!

218
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,135
[GODNOV] I'm messing
with you. We're here.

219
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,513
Enough small talk.

220
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,183
Just introduce me to
this little thief. And fast.

Hey, detective McBee, my man.

222
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,730
No, wait. Are you going by
McCloud now? I forget.

223
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,857
Well, I did what you
wanted me to.

224
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,151
I made some enquiries
of my flock if anyone

225
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,236
was trying to
offload some porno.

226
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,487
Social media?

227
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,658
[BIZ] Mm‐hm. Social media.
Nothing's faster. You see?

[GAVIN]
Hm? Who're you?

231
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,460
Did I say you could
sit down there?

232
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,669
[TONY]
Don't look over your shoulder.

233
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,505
[GAVIN gasps] You're the
moving man? Or, the fence?

What's your name?

00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,717
Uh. It's Gavin.

00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,637
Well, I'm McCloud.
This is Ivanov.

237
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,222
We don't do handshakes.

Why don't we get right
down to business?

Yeah, okay, sure. I need
to sell the stuff, fast,

but I need proof that
you've got the money.

Hey, now. You sayin'
I look broke?

Better not piss me off.

Right. Sorry. It's just. I'm in
a hurry to offload, is all.

Can't say the same
for my partner, though.

249
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,042
Last week he got in a fight
with some punk‐ass thug,

250
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,254
and ended up eating his
eyeballs right outta his skull!

251
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,923
You wanna keep your
pretty eyeballs, don'tcha?

Hey, handsy, we're working.

253
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:44,138

you show us the goods now?

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,682
[GAVIN]
Sure, here you go.

255
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,102
Earth has got porn everywhere
you look, but not in our world.

256
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,021
There, even regular
photos are still rare.

257
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,190
That's what gave us the idea.

[TONY]
Hmph.

259
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,902
A little while back, a group
of nobles paid a ton of money

260
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,029
just for a few nude
shots of Miss July.

261

Enough dough to
buy a giant estate!

00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,326
I wanted a piece of that
pie for myself, you know?

00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,661
Porno mags, huh?

264
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,706
Not gonna lie, I've got a major
hard‐on for Miss July, too.

00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,082
Total boner material.

Really? You know who she is?

00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,391
Boobies and dick jokes?
Makes me sick!

274
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,477
Sex isn't about objectification!
It's about intimacy!

275
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,731
Two hearts connecting
through physical communion!

276
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,482
It's the strangest thing,
my friend.

277
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,652
The more you hate it, the more
realistic your acting gets.

00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,237
Such irony, yes?

a life on the stage.

No, don't say that! At least
we have found our next step.

sugar to calm my nerves.

Take me to the donut shop.

Okay.

[CECIL]
Just like that.

302
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,277
Now, press the brakes, gently,
and turn to the right.

Oh, no. Sorry!

You could practice driving
with Kei, couldn't you?

308
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,623
So why me? I was a
little surprised, to be honest.

309

There's nothing on
my mind, really.

No, there is.

311
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:25,341
Listen, Kei seems to think of
you as a friend he can trust.

312
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,969
[CECIL]
A friend he can trust, huh?

313
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,846
Am I wrong?

314
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,973
Yes and no.
We used to be lovers.

315
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,224
[TILARNA gasps]

317
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,312
[CECIL]
What's wrong?

318
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:43,025
[TILARNA] Uh. Sorry!
I just... You and Kei?

319
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,735
[CECIL]
Are you surprised?

320
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,821
[TILARNA]
Is that what an "ex" means?

321
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,533
I didn't think he was saying you
two'd been together in that way.

322
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,910
I'm not saying our
relationship is like that.

323
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,787
[CECIL] Right, you're talking
about your relationship

324
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:55,913
as work partners, then?

325
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,748
[TILARNA]
Yes, exactly! Partners!

326
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,417
[CECIL]
You have nothing to worry about.

327
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,378
When Kei doesn't like someone,
he makes it blatantly obvious.

328
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,880
He shows no mercy.

329
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,047
[TILARNA sighs]

330
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,925
[CECIL] If you don't mind
my asking, do you like him?

331
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,136
Like him? What kind
of question is that?

332
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,262
[CECIL]
You hate him, then?

333
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,807
[TILARNA] No. I don't
hate him. I don't think.

334
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,768
I'll admit, I do want to
slap him sometimes.

335
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,686
But, at the end of the day,

336
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,272
I just want him to
see me as an equal.

337
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:25,109
That's the real reason I decided
to practice driving a car.

338
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,153
I feel bad about what happened.

339
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,072
About wrecking the
car he loved so much.

340
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,575
[CECIL] You two are like a
brother and sister team.

341
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,202
It's kinda sweet.

342
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,536
[TILARNA]
We are?

343
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,205
You're the strong‐willed,
little sister type,

344
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:42,543
that's for sure. Wow.
You know, that makes sense.

345
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,587
Don't tell him I told you this,

346
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:49,258
but Kei had a little sister
who died about ten years ago.

347
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,510
[TILARNA]
Huh?

348
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,429
[CECIL] She was lively
and willful, like you.

349
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:58,309
So maybe he sees something of
her in you, and that's painful.

350
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:06,442
[TILARNA] That does make sense,
but he's never mentioned it.

Eyes here, people!

358
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,422
It's almost time for that gang
of smut thieves to get here.

359
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,175
I need all you guys
to be our backup.

Hey, how'd it go with Cecil?

Oh, shut up.
C'mon we're on the clock.

[KEI]
Hm?

00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,696
[KEI] I've got eyes on
the target. Stand by, kids.

00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,615

Looking good.

365
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,536
[KEI]
Crap. Hold on. What's this?

366
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,163
[CAMMY] I think somebody got
double crossed. He's pissed.

Wait! What are you doing?

Let's go!

It's in reverse! Reverse!

383

this "speed" thing!

it feels like to be high?

you just kill me!

expect things to go south

the way they did back there.

404
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,107
It's fine. Just keep still.

[KEI] We're lucky that
nobody died in all this.

408
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,073
Never drive like that again,
you understand me?

409
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,700
I've been quite useful
in this case!

I don't just mean with driving.

00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,875
I'm studying hard. Every day!

415
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,877
You of all people
should get that.

416
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,338
And if you don't, no one will!

417
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,552
[KEI grunts] Sorry. I guess
I went a too far before.

418
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,929
I don't think
you're useless, Tilarna.

419
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,347
Really?

[KEI]
Yeah.

You're not messing
with me right now?

That's what I said.

423
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,021
Forget about wrecking
the car, it's no big deal.

424
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,566
I think the new
one can be fixed.

425
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,692
Once it's out of the shop,

426
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,444
I'll take you out to
practice driving.

You're finally home.

441
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,038
[KEI] I had to deal with the
aftermath of the car chase,

442
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,207
then I got into a fight
with the real estate agent

443
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,418
about your new place.
What exactly are you doing?

I'll show you. Follow me.

[KEI]
Hm?

00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,930
[TILARNA] Well? From now on,
this is going to be my room.

447
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,432
You're only the second guest
I've ever had, after Kuroi,

448
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,936
of course. I hope
you feel honored.

449
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,980
Um, technically this
is still my house.

450
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,315
[TILARNA]
Don't worry about that.

451
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,608
It doesn't bother me.

452
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,610
For crying out loud.

453
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,361
[TILARNA]
What?

454
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,113
Don't tell me you're still mad
about that silly car thing.

455
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,825
Don't call it
"that silly car thing!"

456
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:10,496
[sighs] No, it's gone, and it's
never going to come back.

457
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,206
I'll get over it someday.
