[TONY] Yes. We're trying to
get more information out of him,

but, you see‐‐

21
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,318
[GODNOV] Eugene Bolai.
A Semanian immigrant.

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,445
He's one of those Lahge guys.

23
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,114
[TONY] He was using the
company's equipment

24
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,157
to make that steel
a little at a time.

So, you just lied

Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

Blow it out your ass, Zelada,

Get on your knees and press your

and beg for mercy while
you piss your pants!

Oh, it breaks my heart to see.

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,598
I've always said nothing good
ever comes from spending

too much time on this
despicable planet.

What have you done with Kei?

Tell me now so I can send you

[ZELADA]
Where is Sir Matoba?

48
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,359
[ZELADA chuckles] Well,
I certainly hope he's doing

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,153
all right. But that FBI
agent seemed violent,

50
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,781
don't you think? He didn't
strike me as the type who would

51
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,742
interrogate a prisoner
with any sensitivity.

52
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,370
The same one who
called himself Chan?

53
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,705
So, what are you two
planning together?

54
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,957
[ZELADA] The same thing I
was planning with Sir Roth.

55
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,294
My interests align with
Mr. Chan's, too, you see.

56
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,173
[CHAN]
I don't have any ideals really.

57
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,593
At the end of the day, I just
want to live a comfortable life.

58
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,638
[KEI] Is that why you
teamed up with Zelada, then?

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,848
He's more cunning
than you think.

60
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,225
[CHAN] You can't get
anywhere in business

61
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,935
without taking a few risks.

62
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,146
Our original plan hinged
on Coal Mozeleemay

63
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,232
becoming mayor of San‐Teresa.

64
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,360
All because he's incompetent.
Easy to manipulate.

65
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,279
If Kahns and Tourte had
died in unfortunate accidents

66
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,033
during the election, Coal would
be a shoe‐in for the job.

67
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,911
Zelada insisted that the
assassins use Earth weapons

68
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,539
to carry out the murders.
He was adamant in fact.

Why would you ever
want to do that?

To ensure everyone
starts to hate each other.

72
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,633
The Semanians and
the Doreany, that is.

[KEI]
And the vaifaht steel gun?

75
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,349
Mrs. Mozeleemay wanted
to gain Semanian support

76
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,226
by any means necessary.

77
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,145
She kept her eye on
every craftsman from

78
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,813
the other world who
wanted to come here.

79
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,732
She would even offer them work.

80
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:56,695
[KEI] When you say craftsmen,
are you referring to the Lahge?

81
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,823
[CHAN] I was astounded by the
complexity of this little thing.

82
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,618
Who'd buy that it could be
a gun? It's real‐life magic.

That thing killed Coal,
your puppet.

choice against our wishes.

The assassin that you and your
partner killed, remember?

00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,231
Ethan was a former marine who
suddenly went missing in action

while over in the Semani
world eight years ago.

95
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,320
Then he inexplicably resurfaced,

00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,364
with a bunch of knowledge about
magic and swordsmanship.

with incredible potential

[ZELADA]
Of course not.

I'm perfectly abysmal
with a sword.

You've figured it out,
haven't you?

You of all people should
have recognized that style.

[TILARNA]
Leeze. That's a Mirvor word.

To be honest,

For Leto Semani.

I have a gnawing,

So, you resort to terrorism?

[ZELADA] I'll say it as
many times as I have to.

119
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,709
The Semani and the Doreany must
be led to hate one another.

If they do not, it will be
impossible to protect our lands

00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,890
[KEI grunts]
Right. So... just me.

312
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,351
[ZELADA] How could you
assail my poor old ears

313
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,604
with this cacophony? So unkind!

314
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,605
[KEI, TILARNA grunt]

315
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,315
[ZELADA] For a moment
I was afraid that my

316
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,944
eardrums would burst! I shall
send you to hell for that,

317
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,780
and ensure you suffer
as much as possible!

318
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,615
[KEI grunts]

319
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:53,161
[ZELADA] You still
haven't learned? How sad!

320
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,914
[pants, grunts]

321
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,127
[ZELADA]
Exceedingly clever of you.

322
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:05,590
And yet, you still cannot
take aim at me from there!

323
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,967
[pants]
I can't.

324
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,260
[ZELADA gasps]

325
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,930
<i>Kizenya</i>. I beg you,
please forgive me.

326
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:17,977
[ZELADA grunts]

327
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,483
[ZELADA]
It can't be. Unbelievable.

328
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,612
[KEI pants]

329
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,614
[ZELADA]
There's no way.

330
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,078
[gasps]

331
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:48,508
[KEI sighs] Nasty.
I'm gonna have nightmares.

332
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,804
Well, that's it, Rick.
I pulled it off.

333
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,976
[KEI]
Can you move?

334
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,354
Yes, a little.

335
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,232
[KEI exhales]
Here you go.

336
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,157
I'm so sorry.

337
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,535
[KEI grunts]
It's nothing.

338
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,787
[TILARNA] Uh, no.
I was talking to the sword.

339
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,039
[KEI]
Uh! Of course.

340
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,552
[KEI]
Right.

341
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,266
It's gonna be a while
before they send backup.

342
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,267
But, why?

343
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,811
Because of the damn
riots and whatnot.

344
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,814
All the cars are out
on calls right now.

345
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,902
[KEI] They said it'd
be about half an hour.

346
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,655
This city's done for, I guess.

347
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,366
[TILARNA]
Maybe. And Randall?

348
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,493
[KEI]
I wasn't able to save him.

349
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,661
[TILARNA]
I see.

350
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,329
[KEI]
Speaking of Randall, though.

351
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,789
[TILARNA gasps]

352
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,624
[KEI]
What do we do with this?

353
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,585
What? Why are you asking me?

354
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,421
If I do what I'm supposed
to and give it to HQ,

355
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,880
it'll be made public.

356
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,925
That means Mrs. Mozeleemay's
career is done for.

357
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,094
Then Tourte will
win by a landslide.

358
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,598
So, are you telling me
you just want to delete it?

359
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,766
Legally, and, well,
ethically, it's wrong,

360
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,686
but it wouldn't be the first
time I've played dumb.

361
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,814
To be honest,
I don't care, either way.

362
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,276
I know the gods of Kizeyna
would never forgive

363
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,905
that kind of transgression.
Interfering with true justice.

364
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,325
But, really, it should be
my decision to make,

365
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,659
not the gods', right?

366
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,911
I think so, but who am I?

367
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,497
Well, then. You should
take the photo...

368
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,877
...and turn it over.
It's important evidence.

369
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,670
You sure that's what you want?

370
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,963
[TILARNA]
I am.

371
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:55,259
And even though this town's
a mess, right now, at least.

372
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,094
No matter who happens
to be mayor,

373
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,055
it's still a good town,
you know?

374
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,556
That's because...

375
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,308
[KEI]
Because what?

376
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,563
[TILARNA]
Well.

377
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,650
Because there are a lot of
good people living here.

378
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,820
You may be right about that.

379
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,824
[TILARNA]
But mostly...

380
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,243
...it's because
you're here, Kei.

381
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,798
[TILARNA] And so, peace was
restored to the city.

382
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,966
All the people who'd been
rioting and raging seemed

383
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,845
to disappear, but maybe
they're just content again.

384
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,639
Before this whole experience,

385
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,307
I might have looked
down on them‐‐

386
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,602
called them barbarians.
But things are different now.

387
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,856
They feel afraid. They worry.
They get confused.

388
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,359
Just like those in my world do.

389
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,028
At the end of the day,
we're all people.

390
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,531
The Knights always
taught me to wipe out evil,

391
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,200
no matter where
I might find it.

392
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,994
However, I'm
learning discernment.

393
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,913
Sometimes there's a
fine line between evil

394
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,125
that can be defeated and
evil that can be forgiven.

395
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,586
Do you think that makes
me weak? Who knows?

396
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,881
If being able to walk that
line also makes me smarter,

397
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,260
then it's a small price to pay.

398
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,972
So, Father. I beg you,
please don't be sad.

399
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,308
I've decided that I'm
staying in this town.

400
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,686
This crazy place
where so many weak,

401
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,647
foolish, and greedy
people live their lives.

402
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,734
I love them, and I'm going to
make my way among them.

403
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,528
Live my own life as
their fellow citizen.

404
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,946
I send my love.

405
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,907
Please give mother and
Shajinna my best wishes.

406
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,369
May the light of Kizenya shine
upon you in all that you do.

407
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,209
[KEI]
Time to go.

408
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:07,099
[SANDERS]
Uh... Hm... Um, 'scuse me.

409
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,350
Whaddaya want?

410
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:14,607
Sergeant Exedilica. I hoped I
might have a word with you.

411
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,817
Got a moment?

412
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,570
[KEI grunts]

413
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,378
[TILARNA] He just apologized
for how he acted that day.

414
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,671
Oh.

415
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,216
[TILARNA] I think he feels
genuinely remorseful.

416
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,884
What would you do here?

417
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:48,265
[KEI] Hm... Have'm spin
three times and bark.

418
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,517
Then you two'll be even.

419
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,017
Excellent.

420
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,020
Uh... Hey, wait!
I'm kidding! Don't!

421
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,649
[TILARNA] Spin around
three times and bark.

422
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:02,655
[SANDERS]
Uh... One, two, three, woof!

423
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,697
[MALE COP A]
Huh?

424
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,491
[TILARNA giggles]

425
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,076
[SANDERS]
Huh?

426
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:14,041
Heh. Okay, Tilarna, time to go!

427
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,004
[KEI] Earthlings aren't so
bad after all, am I right?

428
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,422
[TILARNA chuckles]
