2
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,230
[KEI] Domingo Tourte.
Got his start as a boxer

3
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,940
or competitive yachter
or something,

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,733
then became an entrepreneur.

5
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,945
He's been in politics for
about ten years or so.

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,571
Well, what is he like?

7
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,907
Since Kahns and
Mozeleemay are dead,

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,326
isn't he the last major
candidate in the race.

9
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,411
Tourte's your
typical right‐winger.

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,664
He gets in trouble and gets
bashed in the media for his

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,417
extremist comments, but some
people are crazy about him.

12
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,544
Why, though?

13
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,796
[KEI]
'Cause his position is simple.

14
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,519
[TOURTE] A Semanian cop, huh?
Well, now I've seen everything.

15
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,648
Does she even have the capacity
to understand Earth law?

16
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,068
[TILARNA gasps] I understand
the 15th amendment.

17
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,278
I've heard that one
about a million times.

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,865
Who was it that killed Kahns?
A Semanian, of course.

19
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,159
They have trouble
grasping the rules here.

20
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,371
That's why they always turn to
crime, or accept below‐poverty

21
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:47,084
wages, stealing jobs and money
from hard‐working Earthlings.

22
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,504
For some reason, they think
the city belongs to them now.

23
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,424
The city that Earthlings built.
They'd do well to remember that.

24
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,968
This land originally
belonged to Semanians.

25
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,970
[TOURTE]
That's a lie. You're on Earth.

26
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,889
On an island in the
Pacific Ocean.

27
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,725
If you want the seawater and
fish that got sent to your world

28
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,435
from ours, you can have it.

29
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:06,895
Do you have no shame?

30
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,106
Sounds like another of your
made‐up earth rules.

31
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,982
All right, calm down.

32
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,944
Listen, little girl.
The government's taken care

33
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,113
of the Semanians who
lived here before.

34
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,365
They were paid reparations.

35
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,951
We even have a system
to send you back.

36
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,454
But to no one's surprise, none
of you ever want to go home.

37
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,580
And you know why?

38
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,834
It's because you like the way
we do things better here.

39
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,252
You want to take
advantage of Earth's

40
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,963
advanced civilization so
you can live the good life.

41
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,964
That's a lie!

42
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,049
[TOURTE]
No, it's the truth.

43
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,301
My point of view is
incredibly simple.

44
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,761
Sure, enjoy our world,

45
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,763
but you had better obey
the law of the land,

46
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,224
don't like it, leave.
That's all I'm saying.

47
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,518
[TILARNA gasps]

48
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,021
[TOURTE] So, you tell me,
is anything I said wrong?

49
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,692
[TILARNA]
But, it's just‐‐

50
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,485
[KEI]
I apologize, Mr. Tourte,

51
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,029
but I think she learned a thing
or two from what you said.

52
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,282
I hope so, for her sake.

53
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,992
Hey, Dom. It's time to head out.

54

[TOURTE grunts]

55
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,663
Mind if I ask you
one last thing?

56
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,956
If it's really the last thing,

57
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,916
and not a three‐parter,
then, sure.

58
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,461
Thanks, I appreciate it.
Just this.

59
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,714
When you think about what
you consider yourself first,

60
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,591
would you say you put
being a politician

61
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,217
before being an Earthling?

62
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,344
[TOURTE]
Hm.

63
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,431
Well, Sergeant Matoba,
that's a very unique question.

64
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,141
Never gotten that before.

65
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,018
[KEI] Thank you.
What's your answer?

66
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:32,773
[TOURTE] Hm. I guess I'd
have to say a politician.

67
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,816
You wouldn't say Earthling?

68
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,028
[TOURTE] Correct.
I believe that's who I am.

69
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,531
Even if I had been born in
the other world, odds are,

70
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,409
I would have chosen
the same path.

71
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,788
Ah. Thank you for
your cooperation.

72
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,873
[TILARNA grunts, speaks Farbani]

73
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,083
Domingo Tourte is every bit
as bad as people said,

74
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,919
and you're no better than him!

[KEI sighs]

76
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,464
"I think she learned a thing
or two from what you said."

77
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,215
How dare you?

78
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,926
I've got nothing to learn from
that puffed up old bigot!

79
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,135
What do you want from me?

80
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,845
I blame the idiot
who picked a fight

81
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,180
with the man we
were questioning.

82
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,057
[TILARNA] You've got no
right to call me an idiot!

83
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,768
Why not? You are one.

84
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,437
Anyway, did you learn
anything in there?

85
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,482
I mean, do you think
Tourte's behind all this?

86
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,943
Not sure.

87
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,071
There weren't any dead people
around him, I know that.

88
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,574
And there wasn't any latena,
or, I didn't smell it.

89
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,617
I see.

90
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,704
Kei, that last bit.
What was the question about?

91
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,583
Do you remember
the night Roth died?

92
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,127
The last conversation
I had with him?

93
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,380
[TILARNA]
Yeah. He said the opposite.

94
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,340
That being an Earthlings
was more important to him

95
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,050
than being a police officer.

96
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,386
[KEI] He abandoned his duties
because he was concerned

97
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,930
about Earth's future.
And, knowing him,

98
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,432
I'm sure he wrestled with
that decision a lot.

99
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,768
Remembering that
made me curious.

100
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,938
I wondered how Tourte would
answer the same question.

101
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,523
[TILARNA] So then you think
he's innocent because

102
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,400
he answered the way he did?

103
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,944
[KEI sighs]
I wouldn't go as far as that.

104
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,572
But it is something
to keep in mind.

105
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,489
[TILARNA]
Kei.

106
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,408
[KEI]
Yeah, what is it?

107
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,744
Just. No, never mind.

108
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,135
[STREET WOMAN A]
Um. Yeah, I've seen him.

109
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:29,264
Like, last week? I wanna say
he's one of Lu's clients.

110
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,391
[CAMMY]
Lu? You serious?

111
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,852
[STREET WOMAN A]
Maybe? Ugh, I can't be sure.

112
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,937
I only caught a quick glimpse
of him when she was getting

113
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,940
into his car, so who knows?

114
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,817
There's no answer.

115
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,737
I think we'll just have to
ask her face to face, then.

116
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,572
Thanks, hon. Bye!

117
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,575
That was fun, gimme a heads
up for the next raid!

119

[GODNOV] A venture company, huh?
That's interesting.

120
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,876
[TONY]
Yeah, but there's a ton of 'em.

121
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,670
Gonna be hard to sort through.

122
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,380
[GODNOV]
You have no connections?

123
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,508
[TONY sigjs] Well, there is this
one guy I know who works in

124
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,930
high‐tech venture capital, but
he's an old flame from college.

125
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,348
[GODNOV]
Ah. Awkward.

126
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,558
[TONY] If Ken found out
I was contacting an ex,

127
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,311
he'd be pissed, and no
one wants that, trust me.

128
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,730
Wait. Who is Ken?

129
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,232
He's my boyfriend, duh.
He does hair.

130

Huh? What happened
to the hot dancer?

[TONY]
Mike? Yeah, don't ask.

132
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,321
[GODNOV]
I'm impressed.

133
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,031
You go through them
like toilet paper.

00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,157
How dare you?

135
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,910
I've told you a million times,
I'm looking for true love!

136
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,287
It's this damn job,
if you must know.

137
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,248
The hours are terrible,
and it's just so dangerous!

138
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:37,958
Hm?

139
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,167
[GODNOV]
You can use my phone.

140
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,045
That way Ken won't find
out you called an ex.

141
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,588
Go, get on with it.

142
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,340
[TONY]
Hmph!

143
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,843
Ugh, again? Another riot,
this time in Eastrock Park.

144
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,594
A riot?

145
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,055
A clash broke out between
protestors and police.

146
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,100
Some guys got too riled up and
started tearing things apart.

147
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,560
An appliance store,
a drug store.

148
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:02,148
[JAMIE] Look. There's footage.
That's from ten minutes ago.

149
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,276
Apparently there's similar stuff
happening all over the city.

150
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,528
[CAMMY]
Damn, you're right.

151
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:11,366
Ugh, how awful. Looks like
somebody died. A Semanian, too.

152
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,203
[MAN A]
Shut up, bitch!

153
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,663
[LU] I am sick and
tired of your shit!

154
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,831

155

I don't care!

00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,960
Hey, shut the hell up in there!

158
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,087
Take your lovers' quarrel
somewhere else!

[MAN A]
What? Piss off!

160
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,090
What'd you say to me?

161
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,843
Fine, then, how 'bout
I call the cops?

162
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,262
[MAN A]
Fine, do it!

163
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,849
N‐Nah, wait. Just hold
on a second. Damn.

164
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,770
So, who the hell
are you bitches?

165
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:45,191
Lu's co‐workers or something?
She ain't here, so get lost.

166

Yeah, well, we're here to
take out the trash, baby dick.

You wanna say that
shit to me again?

Why, are you deaf
and dickless?

169
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,703
I called you baby dick, as in
a coward with a tiny penis

170
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,829

[LU chuckles] I love you!
Please marry me?

180

You gotta get out of
the business first.

181
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,649
So. I have a few questions.

182
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,778
They're about a client
of yours from last week.

183
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,571
This guy. Know him?

184
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,492
[LU] Uh. Yeah. I never got
a name from him, though.

185
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,870
Do you remember
any details? Any at all.

186
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,413
[LU]
Well, let's see.

187
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:44,250
He had good manners,
and amazing stamina, too.

188
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,377
[CAMMY] He didn't tell you
anything about himself?

189
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,421
Like where he's from,
or what he does.

190
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,882
[LU] Nope. He was quieter
than most of 'em.

191
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,385
H‐Hold on. Right! He did
have a tattoo on his arm.

192
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,139
Right here. A bulldog.

193
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,351
It looked mean and wore a
stupid‐looking hat.

194
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,230
That is something, but tattoos
are pretty common these days.

195
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,774
[JAMIE] Might be a clue
that he's a marine, though.

196
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:08,900
[CAMMY]
Yeah, why?

197
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,361
Because, bulldogs are
kind of an unofficial mascot

198
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,487
for the marine corps.

199
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,698
And if the tattoo was below
the guys' elbow, then...

200
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,659
...he may have joined
a while ago.

201
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,327
The rules changed recently.

202
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,496
They're not allowed to have
tattoos that can't be covered

203
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,164
by a t‐shirt now.

204
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,291
Are you into military guys?

205
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,252
No, I'm just a
Wikipedia addict.

206
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,796
I learned about all that Marine
corps business, when I fell down

207
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,007
a rabbit hole researching
the M4 carbine for work.

208
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,885
Oh. So, it went, M4 carbine,

209
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,846
American Military Weapons,
Marine Corps?

210
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,100
[JAMIE] Mm‐mm. M4 carbine,
American military weapons,

211
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,145
inertial navigation system,
laser gyro, Sagnac Effect,

212
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,565
Einstein, gravity, astronomy,
solar system, Oort cloud,

213
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,527
asteroid, dinosaurs, Saurischia,
pelvis, fetus, Cesarean Section,

214
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,570
bulldog, and Marine.

215
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,488
[CAMMY, LU gasp]

216
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,504
Y'know. One thing's
quite clear to me.

217
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,505
[KEI]
Mm?

218
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:17,260
As far as I can tell, I am an
incredibly fortunate Semanian.

219
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,638
[KEI chuckles]
Where is this coming from?

220
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,224
Think about the people
I deal with every day.

221
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,102
Nobody really treats
me like an alien.

222
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,354
Sure, Inspector Zimmer
may make comments,

223
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,524
but he still treats
me fairly, overall.

224
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,943
[KEI]
Yeah, that's his way.

225
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,362
Even O'Neill and the others.

226
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,449
They do make fun of where
I come from sometimes,

227
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,577
but I know they don't
mean any harm by it.

228
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,287
[KEI sighs]

229
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,714
[KEI] Remember the
first time we met Kenny?

230
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,090
Same day I met you.

231
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,968
[TILARNA]
Uh. Yeah. In O'Neil's club.

232
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,096
He said, "You're an alien.
I really hate those guys."

233
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,849
[KEI] He still feels that way.
Doesn't like Semanians.

234
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,269
A drunk one stabbed him once.
That's the only reason why.

235
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,063
[TILARNA]
I had no idea.

236
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,523
He's never said
anything about it to me.

237
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,151
[KEI chuckles] He would
never mention that to you.

238
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,904
He likes you. He doesn't want
you to feel weird around him

239
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,405
or act differently.

240
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,823
[TILARNA gasps]

241
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,243
[KEI] Anyway. I bring
this up because,

242
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,495
since you started coming
around more often,

243
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,249
he's even been nicer to the
other Semanian customers.

244
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,125
That's not nothing, you know?

245
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,378
If he were to vote‐‐
not that I think he will‐‐

246
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,714
he wouldn't vote for Tourte,
I can tell you that much.

247
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,428
Does that make you feel better?

248
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,223
Yeah, it does. Thank you.

249
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,988
[NEWSCASTER A] Protests across
the city are escalating

250
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,407
in number and intensity,
and clashes with police

251
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,742
are becoming more
and more frequent.

252
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,495
The riot in Eastrock Park
is due in large part

253
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,415
to the recent assassination
of Cole Mozeleemay,

254
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,875
former mayoral candidate
and staunch supporter of

255
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,044
Semanian rights.

256
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,921
His wife, Marla Mozeleemay,

257
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,965
has entered the race in
his stead, and is gaining...

258
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,259
[TILARNA] What? His wife
is running for mayor now?

259
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,969
Is that kind of thing
even allowed?

260
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,888
She was probably already
registered as an alternate.

261
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,473
They spent a ton of
dough in this race,

262
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,809
and they weren't about to
flush all that down the john.

263
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,103
I'm sure she didn't
have a choice.

264
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,646
She's getting a
sympathy boost,

265
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,940
but her policies are
pretty well thought out.

266
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,818
I think she's the best candidate
in the race, to be honest.

267
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,653
Increased wages
for Semanians,

268
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,947
expanded vocational
training programs,

269
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,033
dozens of new free
clinics all over the city,

270
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,120
you get the gist.
She's got great ideas.

271
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,788
Tilarna?

272
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,125
[TILARNA] To a lot of
Semanians in San‐Teresa,

273
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,586
I can imagine she
represents a renewed hope.

274
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,503
[KEI]
Yeah, you're right.

275
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,548
[TILARNA] But, even though
I don't have any proof,

276
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,217
I have this gut feeling she's
the one who hired the assassin

277
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,053
who murdered Zoey.

278
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,806
Still, that doesn't mean I
would ever vote for Tourte.

279
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,517
It's all so confusing. I don't
know what to think anymore.

280
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,063
Sounds like you're starting
to grasp how democracy works.

00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,314
What do you mean?

282
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,400
Politics is never ideal.
More often than not,

you're just picking the
lesser of two evils.

with strange warnings.

308
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,089
[KEI]
Stay on the line.

309
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,847
[KEI] Hey, man. I don't have
any messages from you.

310
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,640
[RANDALL]
What? That can't be!

311
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,600
I swear, I sent it
around midnight.

312
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,477
Just look harder!

313
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,064
I did, there's nothing.
I'm sure. So, what's going on?

314
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,984
[RANDALL] Look, It's something
really bad.

315
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,779
I can't say over the phone.
Can we meet now? Please?

316
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,615
[KEI] I gotcha. Do you remember
the place you interviewed me

317
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,783
back when we first met?

318
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,952
[RANDALL] Yeah, I think so.
It was at White and‐‐

319
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,496
[KEI] Don't say it! I just
wanted to make sure you knew.

320
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,456
I'll meet you there.

321
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,458
Meanwhile, turn off
your phone, just in case.

322
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,418
[RANDALL]
Right. See you soon.

323
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,677
[ZIMMER] Moirai Materials?
That's an interesting name.

324
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,138
[TONY] A venture capital company
that's made a fortune off

325
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,974
metal and carbon
fiber technology.

326
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,059
My source says it's the only
place that could handle

327
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,895
something like vaifaht steel.

328
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,980
Got it. Go ahead and
take care of things.

329
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,232
[TONY]
Will do. I'm pulling up now.

330
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,863
Hey, Chief! We've got a
positive ID on that assassin!

331
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,116
Well, we're 90 percent sure!

332
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:36,496
[ZIMMER] Sergeant Ethan Dole.
Member of Third marine division.

333
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,372
Force Recon Unit.

334
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,917
Served in the second
Farbani Conflict,

335
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,920
and then he went MIA
in Operation Mirage?

336
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,339
[CAMMY] He's technically
considered dead which is why

337
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,758
the department's database
didn't pull up a match.

338
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,218
We were working in the
middle of the night,

339
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,261
and the marines were
no help whatsoever.

340
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,181
But, we did a ton of research,
and found this!

341
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,183
Why didn't you think to
ask me for help?

342
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,142
[CAMMY, JAMIE]
Hm?

343
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,269
[ZIMMER]
I'm a former marine, after all.

344
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,271
I've got all kinds
of connections.

345
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,981
I know a guy who works
in personnel over at

346
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,443
Norfolk Marine Command. He could
have found this in no time.

347
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,488
What the hell? Why would
you hide that from us?

348
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,740
Jeez. I wasn't
hiding anything!

349
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,325
Jerk! We had no idea!

350
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,911
If we had, we would have woken
your ass up at three AM

351
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,037
to ask you about it!

352
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,748
Maybe then we could have gotten
at least a little sleep!

353
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,211
[ZIMMER] Um, well. I don't
know what to say. I'm sorry?

354
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,672
Anyway, all that crap aside.

355
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,799
This guy went missing
in Semanian territory

356
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,926
during the conflict
six years ago.

357
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,387
Now he just shows up as an
assassin with the ability

358
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,348
to use magic, not to mention
a crazy‐ass sword.

359
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,101
Oh, like, what the hell?

360
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,019
Yep, it makes no damn sense.

361
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,355
Matoba and Exedilica said
they were gonna be late

362
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,398
for the meeting, huh?

363
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,107
[JAMIE]
Right.

364
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,776
They mentioned something
about a new lead, I think.

365
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,403
Okay. We'll talk more about it

366
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,989
as soon as they and
McBee's team get back.

367
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,490
You two go take a nap.

368
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:58,160
[CAMMY, JAMIE sigh]

369
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,622
[TONY] All right. We're here
as investors today

370
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:05,501
because a friend told us
about the company. Clear?

371
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,086
[GODNOV]
What a pain in the ass.

372
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,629
[TONY]
Come on, honey, smile!

373
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,715
You've got the worst case
of resting bitch face

374
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,426
I've ever seen. You're much
prettier with a grin.

375
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,302
[GODNOV]
Heh!

376
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,678
[TONY]
More, show me those teeth.

377
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,346
[GODNOV]
Heh!

378
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,308
[TONY] Okay, you look like a
moron now. Perfect. Keep it up.

379
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,684
It hurts.

380
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,519
Think about your kid, all right?

381
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,856
Imagine he's here now, saying,
"Daddy, I love you!"

382
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,107
It doesn't hurt!

383
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,359
Okay, let's do this.

384
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:37,199
[RANDALL grunts]
Ahem... Uh...?

385
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:37,867
Detective Matoba!

386
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,578
Don't make a scene,
just sit back down.

387
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,872
Right. You watch our backs.

388
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,040
Got it.

389
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,209
So, what?

390
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,296
[RANDALL] The email that
I sent you, or, tried to.

391
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,215
It was in regard to a certain,
recent scandal.

392
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,676
A scandal? Which one?

393
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,471
It involves Cole
Mozeleemay's wife.

394
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,347
Marla?

395
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,767
[RANDALL] Yep. She's been
meeting with this man.

396
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,813
A secret tryst in a fancy hotel.
I got the photos to prove it.

397
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,696
[KEI] Ooh, juicy. Doesn't look
like a planning meeting for her

398
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,657
husband's campaign, does it?

399
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,494
[RANDALL] Detective Matoba!
This is a serious situation!

400
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,704
[KEI] So, Marla was
cheating on her husband.

401
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,831
What's that got to do with me?

402
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,500
[RANDALL]
What do you mean?

403
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,835
You're the one who busted
her husband at a brothel,

404
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,339
didn't you? I thought you
might know more about this.

405
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,675
Like, maybe the guy in the
picture was one of our

406
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,010
undercover agents or something.

407
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,388
Sorry, I've never seen this guy.

408
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,389
Kei?

409
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,976
[KEI] Hm... A bulldog?
Cammy mentioned that!

410
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,063
[RANDALL] This is bad.
I'm freaking out.

411
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,732
I knew this guy was involved
in the case somehow.

412
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,818
I'm right about that, aren't I?

413
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,986
[KEI]
Yeah, sure looks that way.

414
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,031
This is the guy who
assassinated Mozeleemay.

415
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,909
[RANDALL] Shit! They're gonna
bump me off next!

416
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,495
You telling me I'm in possession
of photographic evidence

417
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,539
showing the assassin conspiring
with the target's wife?

418
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,333
[KEI]
Come on, Randall, calm down.

419
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,293
Hey! Listen to me!

420
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,212
You have the
original image data?

421
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,006
No, I deleted it,
the data in the cloud, too.

422
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,883
I printed it out so I
could show it to you,

423
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,927
but that's the only
remaining copy there is.

424
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:24,223
[KEI sighs]
Look. Now there're two copies.

425
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,268
And if I post it to some social
media site, there'll be more.

426
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,769
There's nothing to
be afraid of now.

427
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,021
What are you talking about they
were able to delete the email

428
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,816
I tried to send to you!
This organization is huge!

429
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,985
They'll delete it all!
There's no way we can beat them!

430
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,487
[KEI] Randall, please,
you have to stay calm!

431
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,114
I'm perfectly calm!

432
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:40,948
Kei.

433
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,199
What now?

434
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,242
Uh...

FBI. Hands above your head.

Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

437
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,416

You guys again? Great.

438
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,500
[TILARNA gasps]

439
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,586
Come on, Tilarna,
keep it sheathed.

440
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,422
[TILARNA] But Kei.
One of them is a corpse.

441
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,590
Wait, which one?

442
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,552
[TILARNA] I can't tell just yet,
the latena is distorted.

443
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,721
[KEI]
Still. Don't do anything rash.

444
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,514
Put down your sword.

445
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,311
[TILARNA grunts, speaks Farbani]

446
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:19,028
So, Matoba. Why do we
keep meeting like this?

447
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,280
[KEI]
Hey, I never got your name.

448
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,617
I'm sorry, FBI Special
Agent Ronald Chan.

00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,535
You're coming with us now.

450
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,746
How 'bout you take
off the handcuffs?

451
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,791
One of the men with you...
He's a ticking time bomb.

452
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,250
Time bomb, huh?

453
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,960
A drug addict.

454
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,254
Take him away.

who the corpse is.

Yeah? Which one is it?
