158
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,256
[phone buzzes]

159
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,591
[ROTH]
What's going on?

160
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,760
[KEI] I'm at an old
temple in the Hightails.

161
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,512
It matched the records the
delivery people gave me.

162
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,932
[ROTH] Keep your eyes on them.
SWAT team's on their way.

163
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,350
[KEI]
When'll they be here?

164
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,685
'Bout 30 minutes.

165
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,063
[KEI]
Come on, can't they hurry it up?

166
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:28,526
You just hang tight. I need
to move up the schedule.

167
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,365
One second. Keep an eye on her.

168
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,825
What about the‐‐?

169
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,870
I will question
her in a moment.

170
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,455
[grunts]

171
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,586
[KEI groans]

172
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,345
[KEI]
Hm?

173
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,848
[KEI]
A fire?

174
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,229
[phone rings]

175
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,563
Dammit!

176
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:13,154
[KEI] Shit. I'm about to kick
a hornet's nest, aren't I?

177
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:17,951
[BODYGUARD C]
Huh?

178
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,036

Hey, you keep still!

[BODYGUARD E]
What do you think you're‐‐

184
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,014
Just doin' my job.

185
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,517
[KEI grunts]
I guess I'll say it.

186
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,687
This is the police!
Put down your weapons now!

187
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,857
Tsk. Yeah, I didn't think so.

188
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,860
[BODYGUARDS grunt]

189
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,031
[TILARNA]
Where's the fairy? Tell me!

190
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,792
[TILARNA coughs]

191
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,004
[TILARNA gasps]

00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,133
[gasps]

193
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,764
[TILARNA speaks Farbani]

194
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,976
[ELBAJI] Can you imagine
what it's like for me?

195
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,812
It takes cash to turn them
into the drugs we sell.

196
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,814
And there was the
start‐up capital, too.

197
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:34,652
Now it's all going up in smoke.
All that work down the drain.

198
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,905
It's kinda depressing you know?

199
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,947
[TILARNA]
Shut up!

200
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,574
Oh, no, are you mad?

201
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,620
You're aware that those fairies
are holy and inviolable beings.

202
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,872
And yet you do this to them?

203
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,042
[ELBAJI] It's just my
new product, babe.

204
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,793
The fairies are only the medium.

205
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,338
I can turn everyone within
a several kilometer radius

206
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,174
into a fairy dust addict
in a few seconds.

207
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,426
You could call it a
psychic bomb, I guess.

208
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,928
I'm trying to think of
a catchier name,

209
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,221
if you've got any ideas.

210
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,975
[TILARNA] That's terrifying.
Do you have a soul anymore?

211
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,770
What was that?
Have I lost my soul?

212
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,732
I grew up in the same world you
did‐‐my family were warriors:

213
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,985
sword fighting, mounted combat,
etiquette, and magic.

214
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,363
I had to master it all.

215
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,990
If I followed that path,
I'd spend the rest of my life

216
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,117
being bossed around
by dimwit nobles,

217
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,204
then die in some stupid
territorial dispute.

218
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,498
And they call that
an honorable life.

219
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,874
Pathetic, right?

220
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,918
But things are different
here on Earth.

221
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,255
Now I'm living the
American Dream!

222
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,674
Remember? Money is God.

223
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,759
Money can buy you
whatever you want!

224
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,219
Now that's what I call humanity!

225
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,887
[speaks Farbani]

226
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,472
Oh, no, too bad.

227
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,599
You're one of those morons
who still buys into all that

228
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,434
morality and honor crap.

229
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,771
I hope you know I
won't hold back.

230
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,024
[ELBAJI grunts]
That's right, dance for me!

231
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,277
[ELBAJI laughs]
Ooh, I like this.

232
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,029
If we keep going, I might just
get a little peak at your tits!

233
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,197
[ELBAJI laughs]

234
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,865
[TILARNA]
I wish I had brought my sword.

235
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,117
[KEI]
Tilarna!

236
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,333
[TILARNA grunts]

237
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,254
[ELBAJI] Huh. That stance.
That blade. Vreideni style?

238
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,588
Like I told you.

239
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,757
I refuse to give you
my teacher's name.

240
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,259
[ELBAJI]
This should be fun!

241
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,552
You want some help?

242
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,346
No, thanks! I want the
pleasure of killing him.

243
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,808
[KEI]
Hm! Okay! I'll just watch!

244
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,685
[TILARNA speaks Farbani]

245
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,105
[ELBAJI laughs]
You bitch.

246
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,276
[ELBAJI, TILARNA grunting]

247
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,652
[ELBAJI]
Excellent.

248
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,450
[ELBAJI gasps, shouts]

249
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,289
[TILARNA] Since you're dying,
I'll tell you.

250
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,959
My teacher's name is
Lord Garada Vreideni.

251
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,128
You can tell that
to the demons in hell.

252
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,172
I knew it‐‐screw you.

253
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,554
[KEI] Nice work. He fought
like he was possessed.

254
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,057
I probably would have
turned tail and run.

255
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,892
[TILARNA]
He was fierce enemy.

256
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,478
[KEI] Just outta curiosity,
what's up with the outfit?

257
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,605
I went undercover,
but I hate these garments!

258
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,440
Will you stop staring?

259
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,401
[KEI] Yeah, sure. Now we should
probably get out of here.

260
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,613
[TILARNA]
Wait. I have to get the fairy.

261
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,615
[TILARNA gasps]
This is a fake.

262
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,116
You kidding me?

263
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,786
[TILARNA]
It's only a doll.

264
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,037
[KEI]
Huh?

265
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,955
[TILARNA]
I don't sense any latena.

266
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,124
I feel the real one
getting farther away.

267
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,834
[KEI] So, you think
somebody took it?

268
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,504
[TILARNA]
Quiet. I'm trying to focus.

269
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,633
[TILARNA]
Under here.

270
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,389
[KEI] Those footprints
are definitely fresh.

271
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,848
[TILARNA]
That red wizard.

272
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,935
He must have taken the bomb
she was trapped in and fled.

273
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,186
[KEI]
Hm?

274
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,730
I will explain on the way.
Let's go. Now.

275
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,981
[KEI gasps]

276
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,566
[KEI] A psychic bomb?

277
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,610
I don't know if I understand
all the ins and outs,

278
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,445
but that does explain what
happened to the guys

279
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,280
from the twenty‐second precinct.

280
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,409
Now that wizard, Zelada,
has the bomb. If he uses it,

281
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,327
the consequences
will be horrific.

282
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,579
[KEI] Tens of thousands of
people turned to addicts

283
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,664
in an instant,

284
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,542
and he'll be able to make them
do whatever he wants, huh?

285
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,211
[TILARNA]
Quiet. We're getting close.

286
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,754
I can sense her.

287
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,219
[KEI grunts]

288
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,556
[KEI] Stop...! Put your
hands above your head.

289
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,266
Very slowly.

290
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,978
Oh, you're that undercover cop.

291
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,481
The one from the alley the other
night, nice to see you again.

292
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,066
[TILARNA]
Be careful, Kei!

293
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,985
[ZELADA grunts]

294
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,319
That's for killing Rick.

295
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,530
You'll spend your twilight
years rotting in a cell.

296
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,491
[ZELADA] Please, officer.
There's no need to be so rough.

297
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,785
Show some mercy to an old man.

298
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:56,080
[KEI] Spare me the theatrics.
You're under arrest.

299
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,666
[ROTH]
Matoba. You got him. Nice work.

300
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,919
[KEI]
Huh...? Chief Roth?

301
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,714
SWAT's cleaning up.

302
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:09,051
They caught the terrorists who
were buying the bomb, too.

303
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,930
[KEI] I'm glad to hear it, but
uh, what are you doing here?

304
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,432
[ROTH]
Let me show you.

305
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,896
[ROTH] Don't move.
Let the old man go now.

306
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,356
[growls]

307
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,650
You can take my car. Go.

308
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,652
[ZELADA]
My deepest thanks, Sir Roth.

309
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,570
[KEI]
Wait!

310
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,907
[ROTH]
Put down the gun, Matoba.

311
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,492
But, Chief.

312
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,868
[ROTH]
Do it.

313
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,286
[KEI gasps]

314
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,374
[ZELADA]
Oh, right. Sir Matoba, was it?

315
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,211
You've grown so handsome
over the years.

316
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,881
I barely recognized you from
the time we met in that swamp.

317
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,132
[gasps]

318
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,514
[KEI] You're him.
It was you, wasn't it?

319
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,850
You're the one who wiped out
my entire unit in the war!

320
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,437
[ZELADA]
Yes. Have a lovely evening.

321
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,272
[ROTH]
Don't move, Matoba.

322
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:07,485
[KEI] He killed Rick, Chief!
You were the informant, then?

323
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,696
All along? You were
feeding him our intel!

324
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,157
[ROTH] That's right.
It was me the whole time.

325
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,076
And I'm the one who stuck
you with an inexperienced

326
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,954
Semanian as a way to
slow down your progress.

327
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,790
The one who had an
assassin sent after Alvarez.

328
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,875
And who told Zelada that
their temple hideout

329
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,086
had been discovered.

330
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,840
So you're the one who
killed Rick? Answer me!

331
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,426
[ROTH] Fury was getting
too close to the truth.

332
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,345
He left me with no other choice.

333
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:39,559
[KEI gasps] I don't get it.
Why? You of all people.

334
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,851
Why, Chief?

335
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,812
We want the same things.

336
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:47,316
The old man, Zelada,
he hates our civilization.

337
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,152
He uses acts of terrorism to
sow hate between Earth and

338
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,990
the Semanians, and I want
to grow that hatred, too.

339
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:58,077
Co‐existence, peace,
just lies idealists tell.

340
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,788
Earthlings and aliens
can't ever get along.

341
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,665
We must keep apart.

342
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,543
[KEI] Some of them are
getting by just fine.

343
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,879
[ROTH] And their ability to
adapt is what scares me!

344
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,507
Look at their strength,
their vitality.

345
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,969
In three generations, they'll
usurp us and rule the earth!

346
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,265
[ROTH] The invasion'll be
over before anyone notices.

347
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:23,728
Yes. Not even the invaders are
aware of what they're doing.

348
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,396
[KEI gasps]

349
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,898
[ROTH] The world needs to wake
up and see just how dangerous

350
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,650
these Semanians are.

351
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,778
And the psychic bomb will
make that blatantly clear.

352
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,364
It will plant seeds of terror
in the hearts of men without

353
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,075
doing lasting damage to the
societal infrastructure.

354
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,871
How dare you. You're an
officer of the law!

355
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,581
[ROTH]
An officer?

356
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:48,127
I am that, but I'm a dweller
of Earth first and foremost.

357
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,754
Kei Matoba.

358
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,632
I thought you, of all people,
might see why I had to do this.

359
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,885
[KEI] You thought I'd be
on your side? Screw you.

360
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,887
[ROTH]
Sorry to hear that.

361
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,890
You always hide a revolver
at your ankle, right?

362
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,975
Try to be a hero, if you want.

363
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,528
[ROTH]
Hm?

364
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:20,034
[ROTH groans]

365
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,168
[KEI] I hate that
you made me do that.

366
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,671
You were like a father to me.

367
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:36,133
Was I...? I'm sorry.

368
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,804
[KEI exhales]

369
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,263
[TILARNA]
Kei.

370
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,767
Nah, don't worry. I'm all right.
How'd you survive that?

371
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,894
[TILARNA grunts]

372
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,521
[KEI]
Unbelievable.

373
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,772
[TILARNA]
Isn't it?

374
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,027
[KEI]
We better follow him.

375
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,445
Zelada?

376
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,906
[KEI] He's gonna use that
bomb any minute now.

377
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,953
[MAN A grunts]

378
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,746
[CAMMY]
We found the chief's car.

379
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,040
Forest Tower, in Queen's Valley.

380
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,875
[KEI]
'Preciate it.

381
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,378
[CAMMY]
Kei. I'm sick about the chief.

382
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,424
We can talk later. Call SWAT.

383
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,344
Forest Tower, one of the tallest
buildings in the whole city.

384
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,596
That's where he's
gonna use the bomb?

385
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,390
[TILARNA] It may have more
of an effect from up there

386
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,183
than on the ground.

387
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,062
[KEI] Interesting. So, it's the
same as a nuke that way, huh?

388
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,564
[TILARNA]
What's this place like?

389
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,276
[KEI] Loaded with rich people.
Common folk never go there.

390
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,736
Heh.On second thought,

391
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,988
maybe we oughta let
him go through with it.

392
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,364
[TILARNA grunts]

393
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,742
[KEI]
Come on, that was a joke.

394
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,952
Better be.

395
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:45,786
Kei.

396
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,246
[KEI]
What?

397
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:50,624
This Zelada. Do you know
him from somewhere?

398
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,419
[KEI sighs]
I might.

399
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,213
But that doesn't mean he's
different from any other perp.

400
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,886
[BOTH gasp]

401
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,306
[TILARNA] This is
Zelada's doing. I can sense it.

402
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,809
[KEI]
Inside!

403
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,311
Is he dangerous?

404
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,813
I do fear him. He's a wizard.

405
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,566
They can blind you,
shoot poison flames,

406
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,860
and sadly, your
weapons can't win.

407
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,363
Even this? It's a good gun.
I've been using it forever.

408
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,784
It's still a
doreany weapon. No soul.

409
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:30,039
Although, I feel...
a faint latena from it.

410
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,165
[KEI]
Hm?

411
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:35,002
Feelings for a thing,
create latena, no matter what.

412
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,587
[KEI]
Hm...

413
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,963
[elevator dings]

414
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,928
Better stay close to me. Kei.

415
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,597
I'm the only one who can
spot the enemy's ambush.

416
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,807
Come on.

417
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,226
We're partners. Trust me.

418
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,312
[KEI exhales]
Got it.

419
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,274
[TILARNA gasps]
Back away.

420
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,277
Ahead! Hurry!

421
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,072
[TILARNA] That fire will
burn up your lungs.

422
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,866
You'll lose your ability
to breathe. It's horrible.

423
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,161
[KEI] You mean I'll
choke to death? Damn.

424
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,412
[TILARNA]
There she is!

425
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,250
[gasps]
Leahyah!
