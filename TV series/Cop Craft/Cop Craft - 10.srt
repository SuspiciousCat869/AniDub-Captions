Unworthy of upholding justice!

308
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,065
[ZIMMER]
Quit your bickering you two.

309
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:08,444
I want a report from both of
you jerks by 19:00 tomorrow.

310
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,654
[KEI]
Yeah, and then what?

311
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,739
Are you gonna take us off
the case or something?

312
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,658
[ZIMMER]
Oh, you wish, don'tcha?

313
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,244
We're gonna solve
this one as a team.

314
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,162
They may have made
off with the body,

315
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,289
but we have the photo you
took of the guy's face.

316
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,542
Not a great clue,
but it's something.

317
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,252
I did good police work, huh?

318
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,795
Don't be a dumbass, Kei.

319
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,089
If you'd done a better job
cornering the suspect,

320
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,674
we might have gotten
more out of him.

321
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,758
Well, you're not wrong.

322
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,970
But, Chief! That wasn't
a possibility here!

323
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,846
Our opponent was
a skilled warrior

324
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,017
who could even use mildey!
We stopped him from escaping!

325
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,729
Yeah, yeah... Ugh.

326
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,107
Coal Mozeleemay is dead.

327
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,858
The Paramedics were
able to transport him

328
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,736
to Patterson Hospital,
but he died there.

329
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,947
[KEI]
What a nightmare.

330
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,073
[ZIMMER]
The commissioner's getting ready

331
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,866
to give a press conference.

332
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,453
If you're curious, you can
ask your ex about it later.

333
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,497
She's probably surrounded
by a bunch of VIPs,

334
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,584
telling them the size of
the guy's ass again.

335
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,961
[KEI]
Sounds fun, but no.

336
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,838
C'mon, Tilarna,
back to the station.

337
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,422
[TILARNA]
Right.

338
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,423
[ZIMMER]
Matoba!

339
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,924
Yeah, what is it?

340
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,093
You sure your ass ain't
hiding something?

341
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,808
Man, you're good.
Yeah, we are, actually.

342
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,809
[ZIMMER]
Well?

343
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,104
Listen. I can't tell you here.

344
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,648
Let's talk about it
back at the office.

345
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,361
It's rather difficult
to explain.

346
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,364
Earthlings have trouble with
the concept of vaifaht steel.

347
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,867
The closest thing you have in
your world is the material

348
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,037
you just explained to me:
the shape‐memory alloys.

349
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,457
However, vaifaht steel changes
in response to latena,

350
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,875
rather than temperature.

351
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,836
[ZIMMER] So, it's like a
magic metal? Ridiculous!

352
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,713
This whole thing's ridiculous!

353
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,214
Hey, calm your tits.

354
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:52,923
[ZIMMER grumbles]

355
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,260
[TILARNA] Vaifaht steel is
extracted from certain trees,

356
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,347
and its raw form has a
texture similar to cotton.

357
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,683
From that, it's processed
into thin, strong fibers.

358
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,686
[TONY] I get it. Then you
weave it, like cloth.

359
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,812
[TILARNA]
Correct.

360
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,482
It's woven into cloth
with a special loom.

361
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,107
At this point,

362
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,027
the final shape of the item
you're making is decided.

363
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,529
Occasionally,
it's made into art,

364
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,615
but most of the time,
it's weapons.

365
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,702
[speaks Farbani]

366
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,793
[ALL gasp]

367
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,504
[JAMIE] So, um, the mass
of the object itself

368
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,130
doesn't really change?

369
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:38,886
[speaks Farbani]

370
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,763
[TILARNA]
As my fellow coworkers,

371
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,015
you get the special
privilege of touching it.

372
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:43,849
‐‐[TONY] Oh?
‐‐[JAMIE] Huh?

373
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,725
[CAMMY]
Huh?

374
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,851
[ZIMMER growls]

375
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,687
[TONY]
Heavy!

376
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,730
[TILARNA] All vaifaht steel
weapons are woven by

377
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,441
specially trained
Lahge craftsmen.

378
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,152
No two weapons in the
universe are alike.

379
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,697
[JAMIE grunts] I'm amazed
your shoulders don't get all

380
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,573
knotted up, wearing this
all the time.

381
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,951
[TILARNA] Well, I do train
on a daily basis.

382
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,619
That explains why
you're so short.

383
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,037
That thing stunted your growth.

384
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,247
[TILARNA grunts]

385
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,957
[TONY]
Just to make sure I understand.

386
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,835
You're saying vaifaht steel
items, weapons and other things,

387
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,003
are extremely difficult to make.

388
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,296
[TILARNA]
Correct.

389
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,091
Creating something with
precision parts, like a gun,

390
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,719
for example,
would be impossible,

391
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,012
even for a Lahge craftsman.

392
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,181
Now you know why
this is so strange.

393
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,517
[JAMIE] So, do you think
that gun is maybe a hybrid

394
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,395
of Earth and Semanian
technology, then?

395
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,732
Could it be possible that one of
these Lahge guys is working

396
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,692
with someone from Earth?

397
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,447
I guess... Possibly.

398
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,325
I don't quite see how a Semanian
could make a weapon like that.

399
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,079
Not without the help of someone
well‐versed in your technology.

400
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,414
[clap]

401
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,709
[ZIMMER] Okay, we know what
the next step is, then.

402
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,755
Get to work investigating.
Dismissed. Get lost.

403
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,798
Hold on, Matoba.

404
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,216
[KEI]
Yeah, what?

405
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,051
I want you to pay Tourte
a visit tomorrow

406
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,470
and ask some questions.

407
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,473
I secured permission from his
people for an interview.

408
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,523
[KEI yawns]

409
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,901
[TILARNA]
What do you want me to say?

410
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,571
I don't know! I don't! I‐‐

I'm hanging up.

00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,741
Damn, who was that?

413
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,076
[TILARNA] An officer
from precinct 14.

414
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,037
They got a complaint from the
owner of the three‐wheeler

415
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,205
you commandeered.

416
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,414
[KEI gasps]

417
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,167
[TILARNA] They said he was
furious about the whole thing.

418
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:33,918
What should we do?

419
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,462
[KEI]
Hm. Yeah let's just ignore that.

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,113
