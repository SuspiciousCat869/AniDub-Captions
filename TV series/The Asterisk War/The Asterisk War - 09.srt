[Dirk] Korona,
hurry your ass up.

5
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,227
[Korona] Uh, yes!
I'm right behind you.

6
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,743
Hey, filthy skank.
Still alive?

7
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,145
[Irene] What's it to ya?

8
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,749
Not much. Just got
a small favor to ask you.

9
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,817
[Irene scoffs] Right, a favor.

10
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,187
You gonna shut your damn mouth
and do it or not?

11
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,791
[Irene] Yeah, yeah.
What am I in for this time?

12
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,192
The Phoenix Festa.

13
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,061
‐[Irene] What?
‐[Dirk] Show her.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,564
[Korona] Uh, right.

15
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:07,000
[Dirk] There's no need for you
to win the tournament.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,902
Destroy that little punk.

17
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,303
[Irene scoffs]

18
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,273
Of course, no one will mind
if you do win, either.

19
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,276
You make it sound so damn easy,
don't you?

20
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:19,279
So, why target this guy?

21
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,315
I guess I'll go ahead
and show you.

22

‐Next screen.
‐OK.

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,623
[Dirk] That Ogre Lux of his
is gonna be a major pain
in my ass.

24
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,659
I'd like to get rid of it
sooner than later.

25
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,896
Well, if you're saying that,
suppose it must be
the real deal.

26
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:40,400
Anyone who's ever
laid eyes on it would say
exactly the same thing.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,270
Fine, but I've got
one more question.

28
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,473
You haven't let anyone lay
a hand on my sister, have you?

29
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:50,110
‐[Korona whimpers]
‐No, of course not.

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,246
I am always a man
of my word.

31
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,085
[Irene] Well, I don't
wanna stay cooped up
in this hellhole forever.

32
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,988
So if Dirk Eberwein
is offering me a job,

33
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,624
I should probably
just accept it.

34
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:08,328
Pleasure to be working
with you again, Irene Urzaiz.

35

36
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,336
Finally.

37
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,640
I'm famished. How about a snack
before we start?

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,808

[fanfare plays]

44
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,919
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

45
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,722
I'm chairman of
the Festa Steering Committee,

46
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,823
Madiath Mesa.

47
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,594
That guy's the chairman?
He seems awfully young.

48
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,829
He's a Seidoukan alumnus.

49
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,733
Back when he used
to be a student here,
he won the Phoenix Festa.

50
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,101
Oh, yeah? Wow!

51
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,472
So if he's a Seidoukan alumnus,
then he's a Galaxy exec, right?

52
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,941
‐[Julis] In name only, yes.
‐Huh?

53
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,911
After winning the Phoenix Festa,
his wish was

54
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,847
tojoin the Steering Committee
once he'd graduated.

55
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:41,948
Whoa.

56
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,819
He's a lot tougher than
he may appear, that's for sure.

57
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,288
[Ayato gasps]

58
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,593
But before we get started,
I'll inform you of
some new regulations.

59
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,728
[Ayato thinking]
<i>Did I just imagine that?</i>

60
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,963
[Madiath] ... we never imposed
restrictions on your Luxes,

61
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,100
but we are facing
some interesting challenges
as of late,

62
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,938
specifically, how best to deal
with autonomous machines
used as weapons.

63
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,840
Huh?

64
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,476
[Madiath] To restrict the number
of Luxes would be
out of the question.

65
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,113
And to forbid the use
of this type of weapon

66
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:17,718
would surely invite
the decline of these tournaments
as we know them.

67
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,353
Therefore,
for this Festa only,

68
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,989
we've decided to allow
alternates to enter.

69
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,726
[crowd murmurs]

70
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:29,229
You are all smart people,
so surely you realize

71
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,899
this is not to give
an advantage to one academy
over another,

72
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:38,204
but rather to ensure that
every team is given a fair shot.

73
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,373
Thank you for cheering on
our fighters

74
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,576
and for your continued support.

75
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:46,279
We anticipate these new rules
will lead to the evolution

76
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,182
of a new and improved Festa
for all of us!

80
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,873
Julis, we're already
at our venue,

81
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,908
so I guess we're good
to go, right?

82
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,811
Yes. Our match isn't
for quite a while,

83
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,313
so maybe we should grab
a little lunch first.

84
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,282
Sounds good, let's do it.

85
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,051
Hey, where are Kirin and Saya?

‐Lester!
‐[Lester] Hmm?

87
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,755
Yeah, what?

88
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,257
[Ayato] Hey, man, you wanna
grab some lunch with us?

89
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,859
Uh, you too, Randy.

90
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,194
Say what?

91
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,896
Get it through your thick skull,

92
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,199
I'm not gonna be
your damn friend,
so quit asking me, already!

93
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,668
Relax. Just talking
about lunch, OK?

94
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,572
Anyway, I don't think I ever
thanked you for loaning me
your Lux the other day.

95
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,474
‐I don't need your thanks!
‐Yeah.

96
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,743
[Randy] Ehh.

97
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,813
[Lester] I only have
one thing to say.

98
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,849
You two are the team I want
to take down the most, got it?

99
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:59,786
So don't lose before I get
a chance to kick your ass.

100
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,123
[Julis] Oh, great,
just what we need.

101
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,091
[Ayato] Yeah, I know.

102
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,560
Aaah!

103
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:08,929
Found you, Ayato.

104
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,932
Jeez, Saya!
You gave me a heart attack.

105
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,167
‐[Saya] You let your guard down.
‐That's enough!

106
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,904
‐Where have you been, anyway?
‐[Kirin] Oh, sorry about that.

107
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,774
‐We went to get these.
‐[Ayato] Uh, get what?

108
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,477
Hold on just a moment.
Prepare to be astounded.

109
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,514
[Kirin] It's lunch.
The other day, Sasamiya...

110
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,450
Sorry, Saya and I thought
it would be nice to...

111
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,453
well, you know,
to kind of cheer you on,

112
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,855
so we made you this.

113
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:38,058
We... we really hope
you enjoy it. Here!

114
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,160
[Ayato] Wow, cool!
You made lunch just for us?

115
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,729
I don't know my way
around a kitchen very well,

116
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,465
so Saya had to give me
cooking lessons.

117
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,901
Oh? You're a competent
enough cook

118
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,970
to actually try and teach
others to do it?

119
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,204
Duh.

120
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,542
I am so sorry.

121
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,545
I know they don't look
very appetizing.

122
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,480
No, they look great.

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,617
I can't wait to eat them.
Thanks, Kirin.

124
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,922
All right, Ayato,
what do you think of mine?

125
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,190
[Ayato] Let's see.

126
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,596
These are rather large,
wouldn't you say?

127
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,565
Well, bigger is better.
That's my motto.

128
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,301
So both of you made
rice balls?

129
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,603
Got a problem with that?

130
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,404
Oh, no. I just find it
rather remarkable

131
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:28,008
that you'd claim you actually
taught her how to cook
with these things.

132
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,610
Thank you.

133
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,512
Yeah, that wasn't
a compliment, Sasamiya.

134
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:36,216
Either way, looks to me like
there's plenty of food here
for all of us to share.

135
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,684
[Saya] Yeah, that was the idea.

136
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,786
So, Julis, what do you think?

137
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,689
[Julis] Very well.
In that case, I suppose
we should join them.

138
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,192
All right, then let's eat.

139
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,963
Don't forget me.
You gotta play fair, you know.

140
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,901
Yeah. Just like that.

141
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,904
[clears throat]

142
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,406
Why don't we take this meal
to your waiting room

143
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,576
where we can eat it in peace?
Let's go.

144
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:05,579
[Ayato] Hey, hold up, Julis!

145
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,284
[sighs]
Thank you for the meal.

146
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,721
‐Sorry that it wasn't much.
‐But it was really tasty.

147
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,658
I'm glad you liked it.

148
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,492
You'll have to roll me
to the arena.

149
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:23,196
I'm beginning to think you only
made those giant rice balls
for yourself.

150
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,464
You ate four of them.

151
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,233

reporter,

155
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,644
with live commentary,

156
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,379
and play‐by‐play
will be brought to you

157
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,616
by Pham Thi Tram, Jie Long's
Seventh Institutes alumna

158
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,385
and current leader
of the Executive Aladfar.

159
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,721
What's up?
How's it going, everybody?

160
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,723
The match will begin
momentarily,

161
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,858
so let's take a minute to go
over the rules, OK?

162
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,928
This Festa will last
approximately two weeks.

163
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,897
During the preliminary round,
the first week,

164
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:01,167
our field of 256 pairs will be
whittled down to the top 32.

165
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,304
For the final round,
matchups are drawn in advance

166
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,472
and then it's a completely new
tournament, right?

167
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,009
[Tram] <i>That's right.</i>
<i>Once the finals have started,</i>

168
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,377
<i>each academy will begin</i>
<i>accruing points.</i>

169
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,080
[Meeko] A match ends when
both members of a team

170
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,882
have their school badges
destroyed,

171
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,885
or if a team member
loses consciousness or gives up.

172
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,021
This will also constitute
a loss for their team

173
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,689
as evidenced
by their badges.

174
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,660
<i>And since every match</i>
<i>and every judgment call</i>
<i>is fully automated,</i>

175
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,094
<i>there's no need for referees.</i>

176
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,097
Ayato, I think
your first opponents

177
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,133
are from Garrardworth Academy,
isn't that right?

178
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,803
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure
they're ranked 30 and 41.

179
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,238
Can you beat 'em?

180
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,407
Well, I'll do my best.

181
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,511
Have you devised any special
strategy for the match yet?

182
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,782
Hmm‐mm. In fact,
quite the opposite.

183
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,151
Just wait and see.

184
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,056
[Meeko] <i>Are you ready</i>
<i>for today's second duo?</i>

185
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,825
<i>Block C, round one, match one.</i>

186
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,628
<i>And in the East Corner,</i>

<i>or Murakumo,</i>

<i>only a few short weeks ago.</i>

192
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,312
[Tram]
<i>Among all the contestants,</i>

193
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,481
<i>he's the only student</i>
<i>holding this rank.</i>

194
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:26,252
<i>Judging by those viral videos,</i>
<i>there's no doubt that his power</i>
<i>is the real deal.</i>

195
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,955
<i>Keep your eye</i>
<i>on this one, folks.</i>

196
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,758
All eyes are on you, Ayato.

197
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:35,461
Hey, I'm already nervous
enough as it is.
You're not exactly helping.

198
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,763
[Meeko] <i>And that's not all.</i>

199

<i>Amagiri's tag partner is</i>

<i>don't you?</i>

<i>Just listen to that crowd!</i>

<i>And as far as her abilities</i>

208
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,955
<i>I think she's one of the best</i>

‐Haaaa!

214
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,952
Already coming in
for close combat, are they?

215
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,721
Well, exactly as I had
predicted.

216
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,257
All right, Ayato,
this one's all up to you.

217
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,458
Got it.

218
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,169
With my soul's sword,
I break these celestial bonds...

219
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,538
that my savage force
may be seen!

220
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,844
[Ayato groans]

221
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,155
[energy pulses]

222
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,826
Haaaa!

223
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,174
[virtual ref] <i>Badge broken.</i>
<i>End of battle.</i>

225
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,820
<i>Winners: Ayato Amagiri</i>
<i>and Julis‐Alexia von Riessfeld!</i>

226
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,590
<i>Unbelievable! We didn't have</i>
<i>time to get a single word in!</i>

227
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,392
[Tram] <i>Oh, wow!</i>
<i>That was awesome.</i>

228
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,228
And if his sheer power
weren't enough,

229
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,698
Amagiri's stylish
and flashy performance
made for quite the show.

230
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,935
Looks like the whole crowd
is on its feet.

231
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,240
OK, that's one match down.

232
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,545
After one round, our team
strategy is still under wraps.

233
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:06,747
So let's try and do what we can
to keep it that way.

234
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:11,585
[Ayato] Yeah, I don't want
anyone to know that my full
strength has a short limit.

235
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:14,855
[Julis] That was a smart move,
the way you broke your seal.

236
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,990
Everybody thought
you were performing.

237
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,292
Well, that's not usually
my style.

238
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,528
We've got the victor interviews
up next.

239
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,164
Whatever they ask you,
just be vague and evasive.

240
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,933
Let's keep them in the dark
as much as possible

241
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:30,270
and hold out as long as we can
until the final match.

242
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,372
No problem.

243
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,681
‐[Kirin] Here you go.
‐Thanks a lot.

244
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:44,450
Seriously, it seems
like the media is never
gonna back down.

245
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,254
Compared to them, even
our school newspaper club
is less obnoxious.

246
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,257
Yeah? Well, that news
is good enough to print.

247
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,326
Look, I said "compared to them,"
that's all.

248
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,930
Of course. That's our princess,
as unforgiving as ever.

249
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,532
[Ayato] So what are you up to?

250
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:01,735
There's no way you actually
came here just to cheer us on.

251
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,970
[chuckles]
With those sorry opponents,

252
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,239
it's not like you needed
any help from me today.

253
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,441
No, what I came to see
is the third bout.

254
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:12,312
‐Oh, right. Arlequint's match.
‐[Saya gasps]

255
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,447
After that announcement
at the opening,

256
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,617
I could smell
a pretty major story.

257
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:20,386
So I went over
to Arlequint's waiting area
to get the scoop immediately.

258
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,723
And what were you able
to find out? Anything?

259
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,891
I was out of luck on that one.

260
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,794
They wouldn't even
let me in the door
to try and talk to them.

261
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,095
Bummer.

262
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,532
Well, it's time
to see those things in action.

263
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's go, guys.
The match is about to start.

264
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,803
You don't want our
contestants' passes, do you?

265
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,304
Don't be ridiculous.

266
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,974
Now, come on, or we're
gonna miss the whole thing.

267
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:44,511
[crowd murmuring]

268
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,989
We've been waiting
with bated breath,

269
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,592
but Arlequint's puppets
have finally been revealed.

270
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:01,194
Any thoughts on
these amazing machines, Tram?

271
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,297
They are amazing,
but as you know,
most combat puppets

272
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,267
are externally manipulated
by a human controller.

273
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,636
And with their response time
severely lacking,

274
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,872
they just can't measure up
to the Genestella.

275
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:13,674
[Meeko] <i>Ah, yes,</i>
<i>that makes sense,</i>

276
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:16,510
<i>but I hear these new ones</i>
<i>are completely autonomous</i>
<i>and don't require...</i>

277
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,879
Oh, wait a second.
What do we have here?

278
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,082
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I've just received</i>
<i>some info on these puppets</i>

279
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:26,419
<i>from their very own engineer,</i>
<i>Ernesta Kuhne!</i>

280
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,655
[Tram] <i>Wow!</i>
<i>Talk about perfect timing.</i>

281
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,924
[Meeko] <i>It says here</i>
<i>that this is breaking news!</i>

282
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,759
<i>You're getting it</i>
<i>here first, folks.</i>

283
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,862
Why would you choose to give
an advantage to the enemy?

284
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,898
Calm down!

285
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:39,432
Look, the advantage
is really ours

286
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,234
thanks to those recent
rule changes.

287
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,638
I don't want anyone crying
after they lose cos
they didn't get the memo.

288
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:47,741
If we're defeated,
we'll lose everything.

289
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,843
Relax, we're not gonna lose.

290
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,578
[Camilla sighs]

291
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,080
[Meeko] <i>According to this info,</i>

297
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,396
Such a waste.

298
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,199
What in the world
does that Steering Committee
think they're doing?

299

So, what's the plan?
Got one?

300
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,207
We will proceed as usual.

301
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,409
For now, focus
on backing me up.

302
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,412
[Aldy] Inferior humans,
listen up!

303
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,482
My true objective
is not to gain victory,

304
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:34,755
but rather to display
the dignity bestowed on me
by my master!

305
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:37,758
I shall grant you
a one‐minute grace period,

306
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:40,694
during which time I shall not
so much as lift a finger.

307
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:43,830
Feel free to attack
as much as you wish.

308
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,066
[crowd cheers]

309
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,603
Ha ha ha!

310
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:53,173
Nice idea there, Aldy!
I like it, that's good!

311
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:56,176
Great. They're acting
as foolish as you are.

312
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,581
[snarls] You bastard!

313
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,082
Huh?

314
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,450
[Aldy] Ow, Rimsy, that hurt!

315
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,554
[Rimsy] Be silent.
You are seriously nothing more

316
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,723
than a malfunctioning piece
of feeble scrap metal.

317
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:12,926
Go to the lab for some
maintenance if you know
what's good for you.

318
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,728
And be sure
they check your head,

319
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,730
though that would mean
troubling the master,

320
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,231
and I'd hate for you to do that.

321
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,200
Just call it quits
and break down for good.

322
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,802
[Aldy] Please excuse me.

323
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:26,339
I merely believe that,
in order to prove our competency
to the public,

324
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,209
we should put on...
oh, I don't know,

325
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,111
some sort of performance
or something.

326
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,113
I agree. That would be
an excellent method

327
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,315
to make our master's brilliance
known to all.

328
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,083
I will give you credit
for that.

329
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,753
[Aldy] Ah, yes, indeed, indeed.

330
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:43,890
Wait, if you agree,
then why did you shoot me?

331
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,358
[Rimsy] Because
I find you annoying.

332
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,494
[Aldy] Hmm.
I suppose that makes sense.

333
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,531
Very well, humans, let's begin.

334
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,799
I have no wish
to dishonor my master.

335
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,270
Therefore I will stand
by the arrangement made by
this walking bucket of bolts.

336
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,840
While I do so against
my better judgment,

337
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,708
I promise I will not
launch attacks on you

338
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,545
for a grace period
no greater than one minute.

339
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,915
[chuckles] Is that right?

340
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:12,052
Then I think we'll take you up
on your gracious offer.

341
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:17,190
Gert, you take the little one,
I'll handle that behemoth.

342
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,424
Understood.

343
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,293
The moment has arrived!

344
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,797
Who will be victorious
in the match of the day?

345
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:27,033
[virtual ref] <i>Block H,</i>
<i>round one, match one.</i>

[groan]

348
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:43,049
Wow! Moritz wastes no time
breaking out his specialty move,

349
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,350
the Boreas Spiral!

350
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,787
A skill like this doesn't apply
in a lot of situations,

351
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:49,956
but its raw, destructive power
ranks Moritz highly at ReWolf.

352
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:53,226
You'll be in the junkyard before
you can blink your robot eyes!

Ha ha ha!

354
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,497
You asked for it!

355
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,865
What?

356
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:03,737
Do you really think
you can defend yourself
from a power like mine?

357
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:04,971
Give up, already!

358
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,308
[Aldy] A vain attempt.

359
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,911
[Moritz] In that case...

00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,913

Gert!

363
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,895
There's been a change of plans.

364
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,831
Get over... [gasp]

How is this?
