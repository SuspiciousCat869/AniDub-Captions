1
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:14,658
[Koichiro] That took you
much longer than I expected.

2
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:19,091
I'm very sorry, Uncle.

3
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:21,724
You're a timid, incompetent
little brat,

4
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:23,558
good for nothing
but your swordsmanship.

5
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:25,958
But in my hands, you'll become
the top‐ranked student

6
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,124
and go down
in Seidoukan history.

7
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:32,291
Making my perfect planning
a reality requires
your complete obedience.

8
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:37,091
[Kirin] Yes, Uncle.
Of course.

9
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:39,158
And don't you ever forget that.

10
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:42,558
That is, if you want
your dreams to come true.

11
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,524
I understand.

12
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:48,224
I understand perfectly.

13
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:07,891
[Shiena Nishizawa singing
"Brand‐new World" in Japanese]

14
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:30,291
So, uh, you are mad at me
after all, am I right?

15
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:34,191
Yes, very perceptive.
And do you have an idea
as to why that might be?

16
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:37,758
Yeah. Probably because
of my duel with that girl.

17
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,224
No, that's not it.
You did the right thing.

18
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:43,758
‐[Ayato] Huh?
‐No one should be used
as a tool, not by anyone,

19
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:45,924
especially a member
of their own family.

20
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:49,424
‐Julis.
‐In fact, if you turned
a blind eye

21
00:02:49,424 --> 00:02:53,591
to what that bastard was doing,
I would have been
disappointed in you.

22
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:59,424
If I'd seen what you saw,
I'm sure I would have done
exactly the same thing.

23
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:02,024
Thanks a lot.
I'm glad to hear that.

24
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:03,258
[gasp]

25
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:06,958
It's nothing, not anything you
need to thank me for, anyway.

26
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,691
I mean, well, uh, look,
I'm still angry.

27
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,424
It's just about more than Kirin
and her horrid uncle.

28
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:14,824
What is it, then?

29
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:18,624
‐It's cos you lost, all right?
‐What? But you told me‐‐

30
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:22,991
I know. It's my selfish ego
getting in the way.

31
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:24,891
I just thought that...

32
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:29,158
if anybody stood
a chance against her,
it would have been you!

33
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,691
Though I suppose Kirin Toudou
should be commended.

34
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:36,258
She's only 13, after all,
just a first‐year
in junior high.

35
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,258
[Ayato] What? Thirteen?

36
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,191
She could have fooled me.

37
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,191
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you've taken
an interest in her.

38
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,591
Um, no.

39
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:51,258
[Julis] Oh, never mind.

40
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:54,058
With my current ranking
at Seidoukan,

41
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:56,791
there are still three students
that I can't defeat yet:

42
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,858
you, Claudia, and Kirin Toudou.

43
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:01,258
[Ayato] Claudia?

44
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:02,724
She's ranked number two.

45
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:04,358
Looks can be deceiving,
can't they?

46
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:06,191
Whoa! I had no idea.

47
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:11,324
She's known as Parca Morta
and wields the Ogre Lux
called Pan Dora.

48
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:12,958
With it, she can see the future.

49
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,524
Do you mean, like,
precognition or something?

50
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:19,924
Exactly. And rumor has it,
she can see up to ten seconds
ahead of time.

51
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:21,424
Wow!

52
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:24,491
[Julis] Claudia has
remained undefeated
since she started here,

53
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:27,591
an accomplishment she shares
with Kirin Toudou,

54
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:29,324
though one important fact
sets them apart.

55
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:34,024
Unlike her, Kirin neither fights
with an Ogre Lux
nor is she a Strega.

56
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,024
Even if it's only been
three months,

57
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:39,058
to have defended
her first‐place ranking

58
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:41,791
armed only with a Japanese sword
is extraordinary.

59
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:47,058
So now we'll have to rethink
our Phoenix Festa
battle strategy.

60
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:50,058
With your abilities
out in the open and exposed,

61
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:53,258
our current game plan
is pretty useless.

62
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:55,158
Uh... sorry.

63
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:56,558
[Julis] Ha.

64
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:00,324
But strategy can wait.

65
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:03,524
First we need to get you
a new badge.

66
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:14,358
Oh, hey, this is, uh...

67
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:15,791
[Claudia giggles]

68
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,891
Bigger than you were expecting?

69
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:21,058
These are the Student Council's
recreational facilities.

70
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:22,591
[Ayato] Um, uh...

71
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:26,791
So I was sent down here
to get a new school badge
to replace my broken one.

72
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,158
Yes, I have it right here.

73
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:32,424
Will this do the trick?

74
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:35,724
Yeah, looks great.
Thanks a lot.

75
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:40,658
Wait a second, where exactly
were you keeping this, anyway?

76
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:44,224
[giggles] That's a secret.

77
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:48,858
[Claudia] You know, when I heard
about your duel with Ms. Toudou,

78
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:51,024
I must admit,
I was rather surprised.

79
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:53,458
Well, a lot happened
leading up to it.

80
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,058
[Claudia] With her uncle
Koichiro, you mean?

81
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:57,424
Yeah. You know him?

82
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,658
He's quite a handful
so it's hard not to.

83
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:02,858
He is an employee

84
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,458
of the Integrated Enterprise
Foundation Galaxy,

85
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,024
which runs Seidoukan Academy.

86
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:12,124
He oversees practically all
the student scouting operations
for the school,

87
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:13,858
giving him considerable clout.

88
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,558
[Ayato] So he's
the top brass, huh?

89
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:19,091
[Claudia] Hmm, "a candidate
for top brass" would be
a better description.

90
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:22,591
Mr. Toudou's quite eager
for a position on
the administrative board.

91
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,958
To that end,
he'll stop at nothing,

92
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,024
even taking advantage
of his own niece's talents.

93
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:30,458
Guess it's just as bad
as I thought.

94
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,458
She is being forced
to duel by that guy.

95
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,224
I wouldn't say "forced,"

96
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:38,058
because she appears to be
running her own agenda as well.

97
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:39,458
[Ayato] Hmm?

98
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,091
[Claudia] At any rate,
it should be difficult

99
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:43,958
for Mr. Toudou to secure
an executive position.

100
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:48,824
Anyone as self‐serving
and ruthless as he is
can't hope to advance,

101
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:50,791
not in the IEF.

102
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:54,058
Only those who've undergone
many treatment levels

103
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:56,358
of the psychological
adjustment program,

104
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:58,458
eradicating all
their personal ambitions,

105
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,458
are suited for the job.

106
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,058
You sure know a lot about it.

107
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:09,524
Yes, well, my mother
happens to be one of them.

108
00:07:09,524 --> 00:07:11,124
[Ayato] Huh?

109
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:22,158
[Claudia] <i>So, Ayato, what</i>
<i>are you going to do about</i>
<i>little Miss Toudou?</i>

110
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,924
That is a very good question.

111
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:27,958
‐[students laughing]
‐[Ayato] Huh?

112
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,524
[Eishirou] Yo, over here!
Look who came to see you.

113
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:34,891
Oh, my. Hello, Ayato.

114
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:40,491
Um... so what can I do
for you?

115
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:43,958
I wanted...
to say thank you so much.

116
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,591
Huh? For what?

117
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,358
Well, even though I was
a total stranger,

118
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:49,758
you still protected me
from my uncle

119
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:51,258
and I feel very grateful.

120
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:55,091
And although the duel didn't
really end in your favor,

121
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:58,024
I... well, I'm glad we fought,
so thank you.

122
00:07:58,024 --> 00:07:59,191
No worries.

123
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:03,524
I mean, it's not like
I actually helped at all.

124
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,458
That's not true.

125
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:14,124
[Ayato thinking] <i>It's hard</i>
<i>to believe she's so strong.</i>

126
00:08:14,124 --> 00:08:17,124
[gasps] Ayato!

127
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:19,024
Shh!

128
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:24,758
[groans]

129
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:28,724
You sure are
a dedicated journalist,
aren't you, Eishirou?

130
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:32,758
[Eishirou, awkwardly]
Yeah, thanks.

131
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:39,349
[Ayato] So, Kirin, are you
a little nervous?

132
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:41,649
[Kirin] Huh? Yes, I am.

133
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:43,449
A little. I'm sorry.

134
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:46,449
It's just that I've never
walked alone before,

135
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:49,149
not with a man who wasn't
a relative, anyway.

136
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:50,649
Really?

137
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:52,115
Dad was, um...

138
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,582
My father was very strict,
you see?

139
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:56,282
I get it,
and from what I've heard,

140
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:58,949
the Toudou‐style training
regimen is also strict.

141
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,715
Wait, you mean you know
about our fighting style?

142
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:05,315
Well, yeah, sure.
What kind of a swordsman
would I be if I didn't?

143
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:08,215
Of course I've heard
of the Toudou‐style philosophy.

144
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,415
Like folding
a paper crane, right?

145
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:15,049
Huh? Actually, the Amagiri
style's an ancient one, too.

146
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:17,015
[Ayato] That's right.
I'm impressed.

147
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,815
Oh. Well, I couldn't help
noticing that when we fought,

148
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,015
you would drop down
in your stance on occasion

149
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,215
and you slid your feet
when moving into
a defensive position.

150
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:28,882
You also held the point
of your sword quite high,
aimed at my eyes,

151
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:31,315
all characteristics
of the ancient styles.

152
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:35,415
If I'd gotten to cross swords
with you, I'd have learned more.

153
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:36,782
I... I'm so sorry.

154
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:39,415
‐I'll be quiet now.
‐[Ayato chuckles]

155
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:42,749
You don't have to.
You're all about
swordplay, huh?

156
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,282
[Kirin] Uh, yeah.

157
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:48,815
But that's because I don't have
a talent for anything else.

158
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:50,082
I don't believe you.

159
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:52,149
No, it's true.
I'm not smart.

160
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,915
I'm a big klutz
and a coward, too.

161
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:59,115
But regardless, I know,
as long as I hold a sword,

162
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,182
I can be useful
to someone else.

163
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:04,682
That's the reason why I love it
so much, Ayato.

164
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:06,482
Is that right?

165
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:11,182
<i>Cos like you, I also</i>
<i>cannot afford to lose.</i>

166
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,215
Can I ask you something?

167
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:15,349
Yeah, sure.

168
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:18,282
What is it you're
fighting for, Kirin?

169
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:20,615
Uh...

170
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:24,549
I fight... to save my father.

171
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:29,115
Your father? That why you do
everything your uncle tells you?

172
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:34,882
[Kirin] My uncle has shown me
a path that is most suitable

173
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:37,882
and efficient to achieve
my goal.

174
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:40,315
I'm very grateful to him
for that.

175
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:43,382
[Ayato] Even if he's using you
to further his career?

176
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:48,182
[Kirin] He's showing me how
to turn my dream into a reality

177
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:51,215
and he should be compensated
for that.

178
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:54,982
It's only fair.
The arrangement's
perfectly reasonable.

179
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:57,149
Well, it sure doesn't
seem that way to me.

180
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:02,649
I guess not.
My uncle hates the Genestella.

181
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,482
[Ayato] Uh...

182
00:11:04,482 --> 00:11:07,315
[Kirin] So...

183
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:10,982
I have a question too.
If you don't mind my asking.

184
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:13,882
‐Ask away.
‐It's about your training.

185
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,215
I was wondering what kind
you normally do.

186
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:21,015
Since I started at this school,
I've been training
all on my own,

187
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,915
but that's a little difficult.

188
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,749
I mean, I can't exactly spar
by myself.

189
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:30,582
No problem. You can always join
our training sessions
if you want to.

190
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:33,082
Huh? I can really do that?

191
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:35,182
[Ayato] Well, I should check
with Julis first,

192
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:37,882
but I bet she'll be cool
with it.

193
00:11:37,882 --> 00:11:40,049
That's OK, never mind.

194
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:43,449
My uncle made it clear I'm not
to fight those on the list.

195
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:47,582
More importantly,
I'm to stay away from those
with a Page One ranking.

196
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,249
I understand.

197
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:52,782
Then why don't you come
to my early morning
training sessions instead?

198
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:54,815
To your sessions, Ayato?

199
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,782
[Ayato] Training with me
shouldn't be a problem, right?

200
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:02,149
You mean just the two of us
training together alone,
without anybody else around?

201
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,115
Yeah. It's fine,
I'm not on the list.

202
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:08,649
What's the matter?

203
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:11,515
[Kirin] Nothing. Uh...

204
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:16,749
Um... I'll do it.

205
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:19,415
I'll take you up on your offer.

206
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,182
[leaves rustle]

207
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:33,982
Whoa! Hey! Saya!

208
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:36,982
Are you trying to give me
a heart attack or something?

209
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:39,115
Who was she? Tell me.

210
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:41,615
Ugh! Come on.
Let go of me, would ya?

211
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:45,715
‐I can't breathe!
‐So what? Spit it out.
Who were you talking to?

212
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:48,249
[Ayato] How can I answer
when you're choking me?

213
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:56,982
Sorry. I guess I got a little
carried away and couldn't
control myself.

214
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:58,982
[Ayato] All right,
it's all good.

215
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:02,515
But what were you even doing
up there in the first place?

216
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,482
‐[Saya] Looking for you.
‐What for?

217
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:09,349
[Saya] I want to know
your answer about being
my tag‐team partner.

218
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:11,382
[Ayato] Oh, that.

219
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:15,082
Sorry, Saya, but I've already
teamed up with Julis,

220
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:18,282
and I can't just go back
on my word.

221
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:19,615
Gotcha.

222
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:21,449
Oh, well.

223
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:24,449
Back to my other question.
Who was that girl?

224
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:27,315
Her name's Kirin Toudou.
She's from
the junior high school.

225
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:31,782
Oh. She's the Rank One girl that
you had a duel with yesterday.

226
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:35,315
‐Yeah, that's her.
‐Unbelievable.

227
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,115
How do you get such
a banging body in junior high?

228
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:43,982
Life can be so unfair sometimes.

229
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:47,115
Hey, come on. Now, don't be
so hard on yourself.

230
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:49,149
You two actually have
some things in common.

231
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:51,882
‐Like what?
‐Like you're here
for the same reason.

232
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:53,782
Her dad needs help, too.

233
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:57,582
I don't know any more
of the details, though.

234
00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:59,315
Her dad, huh?

235
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:11,755
[Ayato sighs]

236
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:13,555
[Julis] Ayato!

237
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:16,688
There's something I want
to ask you.

238
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,488
[Ayato] Sure.
Are you about to eat lunch?

239
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:20,722
Since you're here,
we could eat together.

240
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:22,255
Oh, really?

241
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:27,055
Well, if you insist,
I suppose I am a bit hungry.

242
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:29,055
Wait, that's not why I'm here.

243
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:32,055
I wanted to ask you
about Kirin Toudou!

244
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:34,488
[beep]

245
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:46,355
Hey, are you sure?
It looks pretty hot.

246
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:49,222
I said I was fine with it.
And stop dodging the question.

247
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,388
What's up with you and Kirin?

248
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:53,688
Hmm. There's not much to say.

249
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:57,055
We started training together
in the mornings,

250
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:59,288
and that's about it.

251
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:02,155
Oh, I get it now.

252
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:05,255
You're still worried that
someone might find out
about my skills.

253
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:08,655
What? No, that's not it at all.

254
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:10,222
Oh, never mind.

255
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:14,855
As long as you keep acting
like this, I'm sure everything
should be just fine.

256
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:18,055
By the way, I noticed you
haven't touched your curry
at all.

257
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,888
Are you gonna eat it?

258
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:22,922
Look, if it's too spicy for you,
go order something else.

259
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,488
Are you insane?
And waste all this food?
I'd never!

260
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:34,622
No, wait!
That's a huge bite, be careful!

261
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:40,155
[Julis] I'm fine.

262
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:41,888
This is nothing.

263
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:48,888
Look, how about I trade you
for mine, OK?

264
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:50,188
What?

265
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:52,088
[Ayato] I mean,
mine's pretty hot, too,

266
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:54,655
but no way is it as bad
as what you ordered.

267
00:15:56,222 --> 00:16:00,455
Oh, wait, you probably
don't want a plate of food
I've already eaten from, huh?

268
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:02,888
What?
No, that's not the problem.

269
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:06,555
I don't care about eating
after someone, don't be absurd.

270
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:11,155
But I do care about consuming
everything I've ordered.

271
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:12,988
It's my responsibility.

272
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:14,822
I can't very well
hand it off to you.

273
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:18,688
Julis, we have to be able to
talk straight with each other,

274
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:22,022
even about trivial stuff,
or how can we work as partners?

275
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,855
Yes, I... suppose you're right.

276
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:29,088
Then...

277
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:33,788
will you please trade
your plate for mine?

278
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:37,088
Ayato?

279
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:39,788
Oh, right, sure, here.

280
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:42,122
Thank you.

281
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:54,422
[Ayato screams]

282
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,355
[Camilla] Time to wake up,
Ernesta.

283
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:09,155
‐[Camilla] They're on the move.
‐[Ernesta] Wha...?

284
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:12,755
[Ernesta] How can I wake up?
I wasn't even sleeping.

285
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:15,855
I was just deep in thought.
I think better
with my eyes closed.

286
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:21,288
Right. Then I'm sure that you're
fully capable of telling me
the reason I came here, too.

287
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:23,188
[Ernesta] Hmm? Let me guess.

288
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:24,622
The Tenorio guys
are on the move.

289
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:28,188
We must have stirred them up
pretty good, then. [sighs]

290
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:31,188
Yes, well, they've already
gotten started.

291
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:32,922
You'd better hop to it
or you'll miss them.

292
00:17:32,922 --> 00:17:34,255
Quit dawdling.

293
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:37,688
[Ernesta] Right, copy that.
Coming in loud and clear.

294
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:38,788
[gasp] Check it!

295
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:41,388
There's someone else
besides little sword boy.

296
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:43,288
[Camilla] You're never
going to believe this,

297
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:45,688
but that Seidoukan's
Rank Number One.

298
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:46,855
Ho‐ho!

299
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,888
And you're still cool with
launching the maneuver, anyway?

300
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:52,288
Somebody's
pretty pumped up, huh?

301
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:56,422
Oh, hey, how's fishing going?
Did you get lucky?

302
00:17:56,422 --> 00:18:00,388
Tell you one thing,
dragging out the Magnum Opus
won't be easy.

303
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:02,588
That's the understatement
of the century.

304
00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:05,788
Hey, you can't blame them
for being cautious.

305
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:08,355
But who cares, anyway?

306
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:12,488
I mean, if they fail,
it's not like we can't
handle everything ourselves.

307
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:13,655
Am I right?

308
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:17,188
[Camilla] Seriously.
You sure love gambling,
don't you?

309
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:20,155
‐I what?
‐[Camilla] You take
too many risks.

310
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:22,955
[Ernesta giggles] Sorry,
but I can't help myself.

311
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:25,188
It's lots more fun this way.

312
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:28,188
[Ayato] Man, this fog
is intense, huh?

313
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:29,788
Yeah, it's pretty thick.

314
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:32,822
Though I've heard that
in the wintertime around here,

315
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:33,988
it can get even worse.

316
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:38,222
Yeah? The two of us could
probably get lost in this stuff.

317
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:40,888
Maybe we should just hold hands
the rest of the morning.

318
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:44,688
Huh? Well, 'K. Uh...

319
00:18:46,188 --> 00:18:50,455
Um, my bad. I was just kidding.

320
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:52,722
I didn't really mean
that we should hold hands.

321
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:57,155
I'm so sorry!
I should have known better.

322
00:18:57,155 --> 00:18:59,222
It's fine.

323
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:07,855
Under construction?

324
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,455
[Kirin] Ayato, I think‐‐

325
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:12,755
Yeah. There's more than one
of them.

326
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:16,255
Right. But I don't think
that it's a person.

327
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,155
This presence,
it feels more like...

328
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:21,488
[both gasp]

329
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:25,122
[roars]

330
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:32,355
They're kind of cute,
aren't they?

331
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:33,688
Yeah.

332
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:36,588
[creature snarling]

333
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,288
Whoa!

334
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:42,455
Be careful.
Are you all right, Ayato?

335
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:48,422
[Ayato groans]

336
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:01,688
What the hell?

337
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,688
Amagiri Shinmei‐style,
First Sword!

338
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:14,455
Four Wasps!

339
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:20,188
Aaaah!

340
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:31,122
All right, there's gotta be some
way to get rid of these things.

341
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:34,655
The usual slashing
and thrusting attacks
aren't getting us anywhere.

342
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:38,788
But I have an idea.
Would you mind if I
took a swing or two?

343
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:42,655
I'm sorry.

344
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:53,555
You're finished!

345
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,388
Thought so. It was controlled
by some kind of core.

346
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:09,155
[Ayato] Whoa, you've got
a good eye.

347
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:11,488
But I didn't see it,
I felt its Prana.

348
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:14,088
I could tell that it was
a little off.

349
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,722
I guess I've always been
sensitive like that.

350
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:20,355
I think you might be a lot more
powerful than you realized.

351
00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:25,422
It's synthetic.

352
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:28,255
Could this be more
of Arlequint's technology?

353
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:29,922
Maybe they're behind...

354
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,422
[creatures snarling]

355
00:21:35,022 --> 00:21:37,255
Jeez, I thought
those things took off!

356
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:44,822
I'll catch you, Ayato!

357
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:53,055
Are you all right?
Just hang on.

358
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:55,555
OK. You saved me.

359
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:58,522
[Kirin] Here.
Let me pull you up.
