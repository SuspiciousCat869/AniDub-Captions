Aldy's evolving too rapidly
for the system to keep up.

19
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,375
You need to put a stop to this
immediately!

If I had a way to stop him,
I would.

21

But Rimsy's already ceded
Limit Control, so now there's
nothing I can do about it.

I don't know how we didn't
realize this sooner.

there's no possible way
it could take a direct hit
from the Ser Versta.

That's right.

36
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:33,656
Only another Ogre Lux
could block it.

37
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:37,393
So Aldy shouldn't
stand a chance against
the Ser Versta's attacks.

38
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:39,229
There's only one solution.

39
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,697
Aldy's core has to be using
Urm Manadite.

40
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:45,301
Hold on. Does that mean
he's losing control?

42

No, but that amount of power
has to be much more
than he can handle.

This is what it's like
to surpass your limits.

It has to be the power
my master warned me about.

It's under his control?

something like that?

00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,951
[Julis] Listen, I remember
Claudia once telling me,

77
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:16,552
the Ser Versta can change.

78
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:19,555
It can assume any form
that best suits its wielder.

79
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:23,726
If we can make it do that,
wouldn't it at least give us
both a fighting chance?

80
00:06:23,726 --> 00:06:27,763
That would be great,
but I'm no good at making
small adjustments to my Prana.

81
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,399
To be honest,
I'm pretty hopeless.

82
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,035
Well, if that's the case,
let me handle it.

83
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:36,372
I just need one thing from you:
pour your Prana into the sword.

84
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:38,241
Yeah, all right.

86
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,715
the ideal shape and size
for the Ser Versta.

87
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:49,920
Think of it, what form can you
wield the most comfortably?

88
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:26,222
It's ready.
This is yours now.

the perfect form for me.

You're an agent of Shadow Star.

157
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,284
So then, whose orders are you
carrying out, exactly?

158
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:56,319
[Eishirou] You tell me.

159
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:06,129
[Saya] Congratulations
on your win.

160
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:08,131
I always had faith
in you, Ayato.

161
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:10,500
I appreciate it, Saya.

162
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,937
So amazing!
That match was just incredible.

163
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:17,107
You know, I've always had faith
in you, too, Ayato.

164
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:18,908
Well, I owe everything
to you guys.

165
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:21,811
I mean it, thanks a lot.

166
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:24,948
Come on, it wasn't just us
that helped out.

167
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:29,152
Kirin, Yabuki.
Even Lester lent a hand
at one point.

168
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:31,421
[Ayato] He did?

169
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:35,425
Hey, don't even think about
trying to thank me for that, OK?

170
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,427
That bastard Yabuki
blackmailed me.

171
00:13:37,427 --> 00:13:39,695
I had no choice
but to help out.

172
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,732
Well, thank you all the same.
I owe you one.

173
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:46,202
Uh, actually...
where is Yabuki anyway?

174
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:47,437
[Lester] I don't know.

175
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:49,839
The guy left me hanging
in the middle of battle.

176
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,343
I let him drag me down there
then ditch me like a damn fool.

177
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:56,246
Next time he's going down.

178
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:59,815
[Eishirou] It's called
a transformation spell.

179
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:01,584
[Verner groans]

180
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:06,322
There goes my jacket.

181
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:09,892
It was a brand‐new one, too.

182
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,763
[Saya] But unfortunately
we weren't able to catch
the kidnapper.

183
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:15,765
[Ayato] You already did
more than enough.

184
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:19,335
And you all got out
of there safely.

185
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:21,304
That's what matters most.

186
00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:24,607
‐Ayato.
‐[Lester] Huh!

187
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:27,843
All right, I'm outta here.
See ya.

188
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:32,348
Hey, uh...

189
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:34,317
Yeah? What's up?

190
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:36,719
Look, the thing is...

191
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:38,321
What the hell.

192
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:41,891
Just wanted to say congrats.

193
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:43,859
[Ayato softly] Really?

194
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:45,361
[Claudia giggles]

195
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:49,532
Oh, that Lester.
Always acting tough.

196
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:59,775
So, um, can we help...?

197
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,377
What do you want?

198
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:03,213
[Rimsy] Saya Sasamiya.

199
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:06,016
It would be an honor
to face you once again.

200
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,821
But we've already lost to you,
so why would you want a rematch?

201
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:13,689
[Camilla]
During yesterday's semifinal,

202
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:15,992
you proved yourself
with Dr. Sasamiya's Lux

203
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:18,694
and showed you were clearly
superior to Rimsy.

204
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:22,798
Yeah, but not superior enough
to beat the fused Aldy.

205
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:26,169
Aldy's a lot like an Ogre Lux,
at least in his fused state,

206
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:28,171
and we don't accept that.

207
00:15:28,171 --> 00:15:30,640
Ferrovius's philosophies are...

208
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,177
let's just say an Ogre Lux
is too unstable
for us to work with.

209
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:36,079
[sighs]

210
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,551
Therefore, I personally cannot
acknowledge that as a victory.

211
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:45,355
Gotcha. Then let's duel again

212
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:47,157
and settle this
once and for all.

213
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:51,727
Better get ready cos
you're gonna get blasted
into itty‐bitty pieces.

214
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:55,065
I'll leave nothing behind
but spare parts.

215
00:15:56,967 --> 00:16:00,036
In that case, we'll just
have to do you one better.

216
00:16:00,036 --> 00:16:01,537
Right.

217
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:12,382
[Dirk] <i>I need to know</i>
<i>your response to my proposal.</i>

00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:13,883

[Ernesta] Oh, yeah, that.

221
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:20,924
Of course my response is...

222
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:22,158
no!

223
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:23,393
[Dirk sighs]

224
00:16:23,393 --> 00:16:25,528
[Ernesta] You guys
just aren't for me.

225
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,763
I hope you can understand.
No offense.

226

Hmm.

230
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,811
How intriguing!

231
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:45,081
Very well met, because I still
haven't even had a chance

232
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:47,183
to tell Camilla about her yet.

233
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:50,420
Looks like ReWolf's living up
to its reputation.

234
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,790
All right then, guess I'll
at least listen to what
you have to say.

235
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,995
[Dirk] <i>Very good.</i>
<i>I'll be in touch soon.</i>

236
00:16:58,995 --> 00:17:01,231
[Ernesta yawns]

237
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:02,732
Well, that was fun.

238
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:05,901
I wonder what could possibly
happen next.

239
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,071
[giggles]

240
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:10,906
[Kirin] Congratulations, Ayato.

241
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,709
‐I just knew you could do it.
‐[Ayato] Thanks, Kirin.

242
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:18,248
Except, we were only able
to win the match because
you guys did such a great job.

243
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:21,284
You were a big help.
Thanks again.

244
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:23,419
Oh, not at all.

‐I didn't do much of anything
‐[door opens]

246
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:27,223
Oh, hi, Julis.

247
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:29,993
So you've already given
the police your statement?

248
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:32,862
Uh‐huh. I made sure
to let them know

249
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:34,998
what a heinous guy
Dirk Eberwein is,

250
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:37,700
and I gave them
all the evidence that I could.

251
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,602
Isn't that right, Flora?

252
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:42,472
Wait, what are you doing
way over there?

253
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,243
What's the matter?
Something bothering you?

254
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,881
Well, um, everybody...

255
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:55,318
I know I caused you
lots of trouble.

256
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:57,287
And I hope you all
will forgive me!

257
00:17:57,287 --> 00:17:59,822
Slow down,
no need to apologize.

258
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,992
Nothing that happened
was your fault.

259
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:06,196
[Flora] Yeah, but it was
such an important match
for both you and the princess.

260
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:10,300
And Miss Toudou got
these really bad injuries.

261
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,703
It's OK.
You can let it go, Flora.

262
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:16,439
You're such a wonderful,
amazing kid,

263
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,541
but you're still
only 10 years old.

264
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:23,379
You've been through a lot.
It's all right to cry.

265
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:25,481
Your...

266
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:27,150
Your Highness.

267
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:33,089
[sobbing] Your Highness!
I was so scared!

268
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:35,691
[Julis] I know.
You were very brave, Flora.

269
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:39,129
‐But you're safe now.
‐[Flora sobbing]

270
00:18:48,371 --> 00:18:50,840
Nice throw. What's up?

271
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:54,644
[Julis] Uh...

272
00:18:57,213 --> 00:18:59,515
‐[Ayato] Julis?
‐[Julis] Uh...

00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,217
[Julis] Here goes.

274
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:02,953
I did call you out here

275
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:05,922
because there's something
I want to talk to you about.

276
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:08,791
See, when push comes
to shove, um...

277
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:12,095
‐In other words...
‐[Ayato opens can]

278
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:14,064
Well...

279
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:15,365
Listen, OK?!

280
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:17,367
Huh?

281
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:20,570
‐Sorry!
‐Come on, don't worry about it.

282
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:26,676
[Ayato] Thanks, but you really
don't have to.

283
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:29,345
After all, if your handkerchief
was stained somehow,

284
00:19:29,345 --> 00:19:32,148
then you'd probably want to
challenge me to another duel.

285
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:37,387
If I didn't have you
as my partner,

286
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:39,555
I never would have made it
this far.

287
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:42,492
And thanks to you,
my wish came true as well.

288
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:45,061
[Ayato] Yeah.
If you weren't with me,

289
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:47,363
there's no way I could have
come this far either.

290
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:51,701
What's happened to us is
only the beginning of many
checkpoints on our journey.

291
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:53,336
And there's more to go.

292
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:57,740
I'm ready. Let's go down
that road together as partners.

293
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,475
Are you sure?

294
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,945
‐Yeah.
‐Well then...

295
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:05,348
think we should start this off
with a toast.

[Julis opens can]

297
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:09,352
To our Phoenix Festa victory.

298
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,122
Right.

299
00:20:12,122 --> 00:20:15,125
And to all
of our victories ahead.

[Madiath] The perpetrators
have been arrested.

303
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:54,057
As it turns out,
Ms. Klemm was abducted

304
00:21:54,057 --> 00:21:56,659
by the gang running
the casino where she was held.

305

That's absurd.
It was clearly the work of‐‐

306

That doesn't seem
to be the case at all.

We looked into the Dante
that Ms. Sasamiya
and Ms. Toudou fought,

308

but there's no evidence
linking him to any academy.

00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,908
At the moment, this is still
an ongoing investigation.

311
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:16,312
Please be patient as we
sort out the details.

312
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:17,747
If you say so.

313
00:22:17,747 --> 00:22:20,917
‐[Madiath] And, Mr. Amagiri...
‐Yes?

314
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:24,320
I've been told that as
the winner of the Phoenix Festa,

315
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,923
you've requested a formal search
for your sister, correct?

316
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:29,625
[Ayato] Uh... oh, right.

317
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:33,063
If she went missing while she
resided here in Asterisk,

318
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:35,731
then I'm sure we'll be able
to find some clues

319
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,067
to her whereabouts.

320
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:39,802
I'll be looking forward
to her safe return.

321
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:43,373
Thank you for all your help.

322
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,343
[Madiath] Seriously.

323
00:22:47,343 --> 00:22:49,980
I have my work cut out for me
thanks to you.

324
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,615
[Dirk] <i>I only did it because</i>
<i>I was concerned</i>

325
00:22:52,615 --> 00:22:54,084
<i>about your wellbeing.</i>

326
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:57,620
That may be the case,
but your methods
were much too violent.

327
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,291
Next time, I wish you'd try
to hold back just a little.

328
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,393
‐Talk to you later
<i>‐One more thing.</i>

329
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:06,162
<i>Don't you think you've waited</i>
<i>long enough to talk to him</i>

330
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:08,498
<i>about your relationship</i>
<i>with that woman?</i>

331
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:11,601
[Madiath sighs]

332
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:14,904
Are you serious?
That isn't something
for you to worry about.

333
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:17,807
It is a completely
private matter.

334
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:19,342
[monitor chirps]

335
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:30,020
Now then...

336
00:23:32,122 --> 00:23:34,524
What will I do about her?
