1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,933
Mr. MacPhail has chosen
the Ser Versta, too.

2
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:12,733
[Lester]
Why won't you obey me?!

3
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,933
[Lester groans, chains rattle]

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,733
Be careful!

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,033
[Ayato groans]

6
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:32,633
[sighs]

7
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:35,700
As I expected.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,633
Ayato, I feel I can trust you,
so I have a favor
I would like to ask.

9
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,200
[Ayato] What?

10
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:01,466
[Shiena Nishizawa singing
"Brand‐new World" in Japanese]

11
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:42,175
Why'd she even ask me here?

12
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,308
Claudia, you there?
I'm coming in.

13
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:54,875
Uh...

14
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:59,842
Ayato, I'm so glad you made it.

15
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:02,608
[gasps]

16
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:10,042
Please, have a seat.

17
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:13,575
[Ayato] It's so spacious.

18
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,875
Must be nice to be
Student Council president.

19
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,242
[Claudia] It's not that.
The presidency does have
its advantages,

20
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:21,875
but this is a privilege
for top‐tier students.

21
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,608
The Page Ones are granted
private quarters, you see.

22
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,975
If you advance in rank,
you'll have one, too.

23
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:29,775
Incredible. I had no idea
you were a Page One.

24
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:32,742
Oh, dear, how could you not
have known that, Ayato?

25
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:37,542
If it's not asking too much,
I'd like for you to take more
of a personal interest in me.

26
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,642
‐Oh, my bad.
‐[Claudia giggles]

27
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:43,808
[Claudia] Don't worry about it.
To be perfectly honest with you,
being Student Council president

28
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:46,142
is more trouble
than you might think.

29
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,542
If it sucks so much, then why
do it in the first place?

30
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:53,275
Well, the truth
of the matter is,

31
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,942
I like trouble.

32
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,708
[groans]

33
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:03,575
So, is that what this
is about, to ask me a favor
regarding that trouble?

34
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:06,275
That's precisely why
I called you here.

35
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:07,842
Kindly take a look at this.

36
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:12,342
It's a list of students who are
supposed to enter the upcoming
Phoenix Festa.

37
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:15,308
They've all recently sustained
debilitating injuries

38
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:18,208
and were forced to withdraw
from the competition.

39
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,408
At this point,
we're suspecting foul play.

40
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:22,775
But we'll see.

41
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:25,142
So you're saying
they were attacked?

42
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:26,642
Just like with Julis.

43
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,642
That's what we're basing
our investigation on.

44
00:04:29,642 --> 00:04:31,642
[Ayato] Have you found
any proof?

45
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:33,742
We haven't. Not yet, anyway.

46
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:36,742
That being said,
the Disciplinary Committee

47
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:39,208
is currently investigating
Lester MacPhail

48
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,542
as a likely suspect.

49
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:44,575
Neither he nor Randy Hook
have an alibi
for yesterday's attack.

50
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:48,175
Although,
without solid evidence,
aren't your hands kind of tied?

51
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:51,975
They are, but this time
we have an ace in the hole.

52
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:54,708
The committee has obtained
an interesting tidbit.

53
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,375
We know the name
of the next target.

54
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,075
Julis, right?

55
00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:01,808
Bingo. Which brings me
to that favor we were
speaking about.

56
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:05,942
For the time being, I'd like you
to stay close by her side.

57
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:08,608
I fear she'll be attacked again
in the near future.

58
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:12,142
When that happens, I don't think
she'll be able to deal
with them herself.

59
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:14,342
Can someone else guard her?
I mean, why me?

60
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:17,942
As you may know, she tends
to distance herself from others.

61
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,842
Fortunately, however, she seems
to be comfortable with you.

62
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:23,842
Well, I don't know.
Though, come to think it,

63
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:27,108
she is gonna show me around
the city sometime this weekend.

64
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:30,275
[giggling] You really are
oblivious, aren't you, Ayato?

65
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,442
[sighs] I'll do it.

66
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:36,475
But first, mind if I ask why
you're so worried about Julis?

67
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:38,175
If that's OK.

68
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,275
It's simple, really.

69
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,342
I wouldn't be a good
Student Council president

70
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,475
if I didn't do everything
in my power to keep
the students secure.

71
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:46,842
That's all there is to it?

72
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:51,142
Ayato, I'm just trying
to fulfill my purpose,

73
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,708
as is every student
who attends Seidoukan.

74
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,142
I assure you,
that's all it is.

75
00:05:56,142 --> 00:06:00,275
To that end, I'm only doing
what I feel is my duty.

76
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:01,975
Before I forget,

77
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:06,342
I believe you're owed
a reward for taking on
such a dangerous request.

78
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:07,842
Wha...?

79
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:10,308
It's fine,
I don't really need one!

80
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:11,608
Claudia?

81
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:14,442
[Claudia giggles]

82
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:15,975
Aaah!

83
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:21,442
Since you're here,
you might as well act
on your primal urges.

84
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,708
Don't you agree?

85
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:27,075
Be just as rough as you like.
I can take it.

86
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:29,008
There.

87
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:30,075
[Ayato gasps]

88
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:33,842
Hey, take it easy!
So we're all good, right?

89
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:37,208
‐Sorry to run out like this!
‐[Ayato grunts]

90
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,475
Dear me.

91
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:44,775
What a shame.

92
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:46,708
[sighs]

93
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:54,575
[Ayato] Fulfill my purpose, huh?

94
00:06:58,475 --> 00:06:59,875
[gasp]

95
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:08,008
Now, why are you standing there
with your mouth open?

96
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:10,275
Does something about my face
amuse you?

97
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:12,275
[Ayato] No, that's not it.

98
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,342
You just look different today.

99
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,842
[Julis] You think so?

100
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:17,808
Yeah, but I'd say
it's a good different.

101
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:21,008
Wha...? What are...?
Just what are you playing at?

102
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,742
This is nothing more
than an ordinary outfit

103
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:26,408
that I randomly picked from
clothes sent from my country.

104
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:28,075
[Ayato giggles]

105
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:29,975
Anyway, follow me.

106
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:35,142
And this is the main stage,

107
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:37,942
the largest arena
in all of Asterisk.

108
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:39,208
Oh, wow!

109
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,875
This is the building where all
of our Festa finals take place.

110
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,108
Additionally, there are
three large‐scale stages

111
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:46,508
and seven mid‐size ones.

112
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,675
And there are far too many
smaller outdoor stages
to count.

113
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:51,375
[Ayato] That's amazing!

114
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,675
[Julis] It's considered
proper etiquette to use
those smaller ones for duels

115
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,575
instead of doing them
in the street.

116
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:59,175
However, very few adhere
to those rules.

117
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:02,475
[Ayato] Wait, you're saying
people have duels
in the middle of the city?

118
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:03,742
[Julis] Unfortunately.

119
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:06,308
Sounds intense.
Wouldn't want to live here.

120
00:08:06,308 --> 00:08:08,075
Me either.

121
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:13,275
Looks like a good area
to grab some lunch.

122
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:15,842
What do you say, huh?
Uh...

123
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:21,575
Ayato, how about having
lunch here?

124
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:23,442
[Ayato] At this place?

125
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:25,375
You sure you really want
to do this?

126
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,675
‐It's cool with me, but...
‐Of course.

127
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,175
[Julis] Shall we?

128
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:40,642
Are you absolutely sure
you're a princess?

129
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:43,042
Hmm. What's that
supposed to mean?

130
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:46,642
Well, it's just
sort of weird for royalty
to go to a burger joint.

131
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:50,108
Only if you buy into
that nonsense, but since
you're sitting with one,

132
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:53,108
‐I'd say it's perfectly normal.
‐[Ayato laughs]

133
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:57,575
Actually, some of my friends
told me about this place.

134
00:08:57,575 --> 00:08:59,575
[gulp] Your friends?

135
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:01,342
Do you have to sound
so surprised?

136
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:02,675
[Ayato] Uh, sorry.

137
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,708
Though, they're not here.

138
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,042
My friends are back home.

139
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:15,275
Julis, there's something that
I need to discuss with you.

140
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:18,842
‐Go ahead.
‐I'm not sure how much you know
about the attack on you,

141
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:21,275
but Claudia gave me
some details.

142
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:25,142
Now that I filled you in,
you can see why maybe
you shouldn't go out alone,

143
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:26,875
or duel anyone for a while.

144
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,875
Thank you.

145
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:34,175
But it's absolutely ludicrous
that I'd be expected to alter
my routine due to these cowards.

146
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:36,575
I hear ya.

147
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:39,142
I shall be the one
to decide my path.

148
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:42,575
And I won't allow anybody
to choose it for me.

149
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:44,942
[Ayato chuckles,
footsteps approach]

150
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:47,342
Look, guys, the brave princess.

151
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:50,508
It sounds like she doesn't mind
if she's attacked again.

152
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:54,942
I've always wanted
to be spied on, Lester.
Thank you for that.

153
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:58,208
But you should know that I'll
battle anyone worthy
of dueling me.

154
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,908
Huh? That a fact?
Then let's settle our score
right here and now.

155
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:03,908
Did you not hear a word I said?

156
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:06,608
I'm only dueling
worthy challengers.

157
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:09,108
I don't care what you say,
we're gonna do this!

158
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,308
[crowd murmuring]

159
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:16,208
Come on, don't you think you've
taken this far enough, Lester?

160
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,042
Shut your hole,
you little punk.

161
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:20,208
‐[Ayato] No, I can't do that.
‐Say what?

162
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,208
Picking a fight with Julis is
the worst thing you could do
right now.

163
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,475
If you want to look guilty,
then be my guest,

164
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:29,808
but doing this makes you seem
just like the kind of coward
that attacked her the other day.

165
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:32,675
[Lester] Oh, yeah?
Don't gimme that crap!

166
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:36,608
So you're sayin' I'm no better
than the creep sneaking around
in the shadows, huh?

167
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:40,708
Fine, then let me show you
how much we're alike
by ripping you apart!

168
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:46,275
A second ago, you were
all high and mighty, and now
you're just gonna stand there?

169
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:48,042
Who's the real coward?

170
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:51,442
Sticks and stones.
Meaningless duels
aren't my thing, dude.

171
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,175
‐Bastard!
‐[Randy] Hey, calm down, Lester!

172
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,675
Everyone knows you've always
been a fair fighter.

173
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:58,175
You don't have
to prove that here.

174
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,542
Yeah, that's true.
You would never do anything
as cowardly

175
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,575
as watching a duel
for a chance to attack.

176
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,675
[Lester snarls]

177
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:10,275
We're gonna let you guys
off easy today.

178
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:14,042
[Ayato sighs, Julis giggles]

179
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,375
So you are a tough one,
aren't you?

180
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,275
I don't know what you mean.

181
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:22,842
Anyway, more importantly,
you've got some ketchup on you.

182
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:31,042
Oh, dear, whatever are we going
to do with you, Ayato?

183
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,842
[Ayato] Thanks for today.

184
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,975
I really learned a lot
and had some fun, too.

185
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:38,475
Did you?

186
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:43,308
I mean, as I've said before,
I was merely squaring away
my debt with you.

187
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:45,808
‐So there's no need for you
to thank me‐‐
‐[punk] Bastard!

188
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:47,442
[student] Just shut up
and bring it!

189
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:49,075
[Julis] They're from
ReWolf Black Institute.

190
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,375
[Ayato] Looks like they're
about to fight.

191
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,708
Here we go.

192
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,475
‐You want some?
‐[student] Bring it on!

193
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:58,308
[both grunting]

194
00:11:58,308 --> 00:11:59,808
‐This isn't good.
‐[Ayato] Huh?

195
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:01,575
[Julis] It's a setup.

196
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:03,342
[student] Hyah!

197
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:04,742
[Julis] Typical strategy.

198
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:07,508
Surround the target
during a fake brawl.

199
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,375
Then strike
while they're distracted.

200
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:13,275
Does this mean ReWolf
was behind the attack
on you all along?

201
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,042
No, not necessarily.

202
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,942
If you throw enough money
their way,

203
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,408
these miscreants will take on
just about anything.

204
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:20,642
[punk] Shit.

205
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:23,542
I'm gonna go and get
some answers out of them.

206
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,308
We'll call it self‐defense.

207
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:29,575
Just go easy on them,
and hold off at medium‐rare, OK?

208
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:35,475
[punk screams]

209
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:39,575
[Julis] Huh.
That wasn't even a warmup.

210
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:42,108
You there.

211
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,608
Stand up, or else
I'll burn off the rest

212
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:47,575
of that bizarre hairstyle
of yours, roots and all.

213
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:50,575
‐[punk screams]
‐Answer me, right now.

214
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:52,675
Who gave you the order
to attack me?

215
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:54,175
[punk] Some dude
we didn't know.

216
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:57,708
He said he'd pay us pretty good
if we roughed you up a little.

217
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,908
What exactly did
this person look like?

218
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:04,508
He was dressed all in black,
kind of tall, big guy.

219
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:07,842
Hey, there he is!
That's the one who hired us!

220
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:12,242
‐Get back here!
‐Julis, hold up a minute!

221
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:26,675
Julis! Where are you?

222
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,142
Look out! Behind you!

223
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:45,708
Ayato!

224
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:50,408
‐Hey, are you all right?
‐[Ayato] I'm fine.

225
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:54,142
Basically. Think my clothes
are a different story, though.

226
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:59,108
I can't believe you let
your guard down like that.

227
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:01,475
Dodging those attacks
should have been easy for you.

228
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,475
And you managed
to destroy your Lux, too.

229
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,642
Hey, gimme a break.
That's all I could handle
with my current skills.

230
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:10,008
Guess you can't take on
more than one at a time, huh?

231
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:11,375
No matter.

232
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,175
Security should be
arriving shortly,

233
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:15,442
so it would be best
if we take our leave.

234
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:16,775
[Ayato] Good idea.

235
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:18,575
‐Oh, by the way...
‐[Ayato] Huh?

236
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:21,242
You wouldn't still be
available later, would you?

237
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:36,725
I'm coming in.

238
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:39,892
Jeez, I hate that this has
become almost normal for me.

239
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,392
There you are. Now...

240
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:44,592
Let's get this over with,
shall we?

241
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:50,192
‐Take off your clothes.
‐Say what?!

242
00:14:50,192 --> 00:14:52,658
[Ayato] Why would I...? Julis!

243
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,592
Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

244
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,958
Just take off
your clothes and...

245
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:02,892
That's not what I...
Get your mind out of the gutter!

246
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:07,092
You idiot, I merely wanted
to repair the clothing
that was ripped in the fight!

247
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:09,892
You did? Hang on.
You can sew, Julis?

248
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:14,292
I'm not the best,
but I have done it before.

249
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:17,092
And since I'm partly
to blame for what happened,

250
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:21,658
I'm preemptively canceling out
any additional debt to you.

251
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:24,792
All right, have it your way.
Here.

252
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,492
[beep]

253
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,725
So, is sewing another thing
you picked up from
your friends back home?

254
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:45,625
‐Yes, how did you know?
‐It was just a hunch, really.

255
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,725
Hey, Julis, these kids
that are in the picture here,

256
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:59,292
they're your friends,
aren't they?

257
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:04,058
Hmm. Why are...
Why are you looking at that?
Who gave you permission?

258
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:06,958
And that girl who's sitting
in the middle of everyone,

259
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,258
that's you, right?

260
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:13,725
Indeed.
The ones in that photograph
are definitely my friends,

261
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:15,625
without question.

262
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:22,125
I may not look it now,
but I used to be
quite the tomboy back then.

263
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:27,592
I would sneak way
from the palace more times
than I can remember.

264
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:36,525
<i>On one of my expeditions,</i>
<i>I lost my way</i>

265
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:38,725
<i>and I found myself</i>
<i>in the slums,</i>

266
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:41,925
<i>trapped in an alley</i>
<i>by a group of ruffians.</i>

267
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:45,558
<i>All I could do in that moment</i>
<i>was sob helplessly.</i>

268
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:49,558
<i>Then the children</i>
<i>in the picture appeared</i>
<i>and rescued me.</i>

269
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:57,625
After returning to the palace,
I learned that the girls
who'd saved me

270
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,692
were from the orphanage
in those slums,

271
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:02,792
and I began sneaking out
of the palace whenever I could,

272
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:05,392
to spend as much time
with them as possible.

273
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,358
[Ayato] Did they know
you were a princess?

274
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,325
Did you ever end up
telling them?

275
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:12,325
[Julis] No. I kept that part
of my life a secret,

276
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:15,625
though I'm certain
the nuns knew who I was.

277
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,992
[Ayato] Oh, I see.

278
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:21,325
The orphanage was built with
money raised by my late mother,

279
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:23,192
but those funds
have long since run dry.

280
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:25,058
And we need them so.

281
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:27,592
Without them,
they can't stay open.

282
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:30,525
That's the reason
I came to Seidoukan.

283
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:34,725
It's sad, but what the children
of my country need

284
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:36,925
more than anything else
right now is money.

285
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:39,925
But wait, you're the crown
princess of the country,
aren't you?

286
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,725
Wasn't there an easier way
to find the funds you needed
besides coming out here?

287
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:46,892
I don't have money lying around
that I can use at my disposal.

288
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:49,825
Who in their right mind
would authorize
a welfare endeavor

289
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:53,258
with no hope for revenue,
especially in
a figurehead regime

290
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:55,825
of the Integrated Enterprise
Foundation?

291
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,225
I'll do it, trust me.
I'll earn the money myself.

292
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:04,592
Fortunately, I have my talent
as a Strega to rely on.

293
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:07,592
It's fitting, don't you think?

294
00:18:07,592 --> 00:18:10,192
What better title for a freak
than "princess"?

295
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,192
Julis.

296
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,925
This city is vile
and insignificant.

297

00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:39,592
<i>that the city is</i>
<i>the nucleus of all desire.</i>

304
00:18:39,592 --> 00:18:43,592
<i>That said, I too will obtain</i>
<i>everything that I desire,</i>

305
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:47,192
not because someone asked me
to do it, but because
I know in my heart

306
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,758
that I have something
worth fighting for.

307
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:53,492
That is my reason
for going into battle.

308
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:56,058
There!

309
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:59,258
Your shirt's mended,
so it's time for you to be
on your way, all right?

310
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:01,058
Uh, sure, thanks a lot.

311
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,158
My debt has officially
been paid.

312
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:04,825
It looks that way.

313
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:06,758
‐Oh.
‐Huh?

314
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:09,125
[Julis] Oh.

315
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,792
It's from my friends.

316
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:13,825
They gave this to me
years ago as a birthday present.

317
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,292
Even took turns embroidering it.

318
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:20,492
Do you see this especially
heinous part?

319
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,225
It was done by my best friend.

320
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:28,592
It's my special treasure.

321
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:49,607
Good morning, Julis.

322
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:51,374
‐Julis?
‐Oh, sorry!

323
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:53,807
[Julis] Good morning.

324
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,474
[Ayato] Hey,
where are you going?

325
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:06,207
To take care of something.

326
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,141
[Ayato] What's with her?

327
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:15,941
[Eishirou] Looks like she's gone
back to her old self
for some reason,

328
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:19,207
and right when she was beginning
to thaw out, too.

329
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:20,807
[Claudia] Ayato?

330
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:23,607
Is there something
troubling you?

331
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:27,174
[Eishirou] Just the ice princess
reading some letter,
getting pale and running off.

332
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:28,874
The usual stuff.

333
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:32,907
Oh, no. If she's going off
to do what I think she is...

334
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:36,174
‐No way!
‐She's going after
her assailant!

335
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:43,907
If she is, then why'd
she run off without
telling me anything?

336
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:47,207
I thought she was starting
to trust me.

337
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:52,207
Are you saying that she doesn't?
My, how soon we forget.

338
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:55,707
It's everything she can do
to protect what she has now,

339
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:58,274
so she has to hold on tight.

340
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:02,507
Most likely she wanted
to protect you from the danger
that lies ahead.

341
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:06,574
Wait a minute,
she wanted to protect <i>me?</i>

342
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:17,574
Oh, man, you're right.

343
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:19,107
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

344
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:23,541
<i>My purpose in life</i>
<i>is to protect you, forever.</i>
<i>I swear.</i>

345
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,141
<i>I'm gonna have</i>
<i>to protect you, too.</i>

346
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:31,174
<i>I'm sure that's what I'm...</i>

347
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:35,774
I didn't fully understand it
back then, but...

348
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:38,707
‐I'm going after her!
‐[Claudia] Hey, wait!

349
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:42,807
Uggh!

350
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,441
[Ayato] Haruka's sword!

351
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:53,141
[Ayato thinking]
<i>I finally get it now!</i>

352
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:56,474
<i>I know what my true purpose is!</i>

353
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:58,874
<i>And you're the one</i>
<i>who taught me!</i>

354
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:04,607
I'll always be there for her,
and I won't fail.

355
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:08,007
I'll protect Julis!

356
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:11,541
