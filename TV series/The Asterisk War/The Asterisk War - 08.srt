1
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:22,399
Toudou, to your left.

2
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,532
Got it!

3
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:35,932
Sasamiya!

4
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,499
Aaah!

5
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,866
[buzzer sounds]

6
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:07,632
[Shiena Nishizawa singing
"Brand‐new World" in Japanese]

7
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:24,065
[girl] Hey, aren't you
Ayato Amagiri,

8
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:26,065
aka Murakumo?

9
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:27,465
‐Hmm?
‐Huh?

10
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:31,265
[girl giggles] Can I please
have your autograph?

11
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:34,265
Oh, uh, mm‐hmm.
It's no problem at all.

12
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:37,732
[girl] Oh, wow!
This is so awesome!

13
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:39,998
‐[Ayato] Here you go.
‐[girl] Thank you so much!

14
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:43,898
I'll be rooting for you
at the Phoenix Festa!

15
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,365
[Ayota chuckles]

16
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:49,465
[Ayato] Uh... what's wrong?

17
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:51,865
Nothing. But it must get
pretty tiring

18
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,965
to have so many girls
chasing after you.

19
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,932
Ayato, you're a little too nice.
It's pretty disconcerting.

20
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,232
Hah‐hah‐hah.

21
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:00,765
[Ayato] Really?

22
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:01,765
Chill, ladies.

23
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,798
This guy just went
from being unranked

24
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:05,965
to becoming number one
in a single go.

25
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:07,565
Of course he's a star now.

26
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:09,798
I guess you're right.
Makes sense.

27
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:13,398
When I became a Page One,
it was after a single duel, too,

28
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:15,098
but I was only ranked number 11.

29
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:18,965
Ayato's number one, so he's
much more famous than I was.

30
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,898
Wait, I'm famous?

31
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:22,365
Heck, yeah, you're famous.

32
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:26,132
Even our princess here
was a big celebrity
when she became a Page One.

33
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:30,832
That may be true,
but the hype died down
a lot faster in my case.

34
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:35,298
Well, yeah, you're not exactly
the friendliest person
to deal with.

35
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,965
Although I am very thankful
for their support.

36
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:40,665
I only turned them down
as a matter of principle.

37
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:43,265
I mean, think about it,
why would I have any interest

38
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,432
in helping them line
their pockets?

39
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:48,332
[Ayato] Huh?
An online auction.

40
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:49,832
No way!

41
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:53,132
On the bright side,
at least your autograph's
worth something.

42
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,132
[Saya] It's nothing
to worry about.

43
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:58,332
You still have real fans here
that truly believe in you.

44
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,932
Like me.

45
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:01,898
Uh, yeah, that's right.

46
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:05,232
A lot of kids in my class
are your fans
and look up to you.

47
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:07,032
I look up to you, too.

48
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:09,932
Ha. Sure, you say that now,
but what will you do

49
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:12,398
if you actually draw us
in the Phoenix Festa?

50
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:15,898
What else? We will do everything
we can to blow you away.

51
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:17,932
We won't hold back
in the slightest.

52
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:19,798
We're prepared to give it
all we've got.

53
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,798
Honestly, I've been wondering
how you two decided
to compete together.

54
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:24,798
Gotta admit,
it really surprised me.

55
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:28,032
I have a score to settle
with that Arlequint tramp.

56
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:30,665
I'll make her wish she never
insulted my father's guns

57
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:32,332
if it's the last thing I do.

58
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:33,998
And that's why I chose
a strong partner

59
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:36,398
to fight by my side
in the Phoenix Festa.

60
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:39,265
When Sasamiya first approached
me to join up with her,

61
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:40,898
I was a little
on the reluctant side.

62
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:43,898
But now I know that
I made the right decision.

63
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:47,098
Well then, wonder how far
your makeshift team can go.

64
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:48,598
Guess we'll just have to see.

65
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:51,598
Yeah, you're one to talk,
Riessfeld.

66
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:54,365
You and Ayato have been partners
for how many days exactly?

67
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:59,732
Uh... Even so, our teamwork's
still a thousand times better
than yours.

68
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,232
[both sigh]

69
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:03,098
At least your technique's
on point.

70
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:06,132
All you two really have to focus
on is just staying in synch,

71
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:10,065
and building that connection
between you is something
that can't be rushed.

72
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:12,098
Yeah, you're probably right.

73
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:13,532
I see.

74
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:16,898
I now know what kind of training
we're gonna have to do to win.

75
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:18,132
Huh?

76
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:21,865
Sorry, Ayato, but Toudou and I
will be skipping out on practice

77
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:23,265
to do our own thing.

78
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:27,765
We're going to get
to know each other with
some hardcore socializing.

79
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,865
Huh?

80
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:35,332
So, um, what kind of exercises
or activities should we do

81
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:37,398
to get to know
each other better?

82
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:40,465
‐No clue.
‐Huh?

83
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:43,732
I have no idea.

84
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:45,365
I'll give it to you straight.

85
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:47,898
I've never had to socialize
with anybody before,

86
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:51,165
so I don't really know what
to do in this kind of situation.

87
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:53,465
I'd be grateful
if you could show me.

88
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:56,598
Uh... you really want me
to do that?

89
00:05:56,598 --> 00:05:58,732
Cos I can't be of much help.

90
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:01,432
I don't have that kind
of experience myself.

91
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:04,432
That's too bad.

92
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:10,732
Well, today is our day off.

93
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,765
We should at least take
advantage of that.

94
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:13,832
Oh?

95
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,732
[Saya] If we do
something together,

96
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:18,398
we might be able
to strengthen our bond a little.

97
00:06:18,398 --> 00:06:19,798
That makes sense.

98
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:22,998
So, is there anything you'd like
to do today, Toudou?

99
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:25,565
Hmm? Well, let's see.

100
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,565
Hmm...

101
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:32,065
I have no idea.
What about you?

102
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:34,398
All I want to do
is go shopping.

103
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:36,932
Go shopping? Seriously?

104
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:40,798
Uh‐huh. And since
I'm not very good with
directions around town,

105
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:44,398
if you come with me,
I'm less likely to lose my way.

106
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:47,398
Sure, I wouldn't mind.
It sounds like a lot of fun.

107
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:51,465
But if you're worried
about getting lost,
couldn't you just use GPS?

108
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,198
GPS is the worst.

109
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:54,465
Whenever I follow
its directions,

110
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:57,632
I wind up
at a completely different place.

111
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:00,898
I had no idea.

112
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:04,765
[Kirin] So, what are you
planning to buy?

113
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:07,698
[Saya] I haven't decided on
anything specific yet,

114
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,598
but it's going to be for my dad.

115
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,265
His birthday's just around
the corner.

116
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,498
[gasp]

117
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,365
‐Huh?
‐Uh...

118
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:19,765
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

119
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:22,198
Oh. I'm sorry.

120
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:25,298
Come on, let's find him
something special.

121
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:27,798
How about a necktie
or something?

122
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:30,232
He doesn't wear
that kind of stuff.

123
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,332
[Kirin] Well, what about wine?

124
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:35,132
[Saya] He doesn't drink
that stuff.

125
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:36,565
[Kirin] Oh.

126
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:40,798
OK, how about his favorite food?

127
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:42,932
Negative.

128
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:49,198
So, um, Sasamiya,
I've been meaning to ask.

129
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:51,265
What type of person is your dad?

130
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:56,232
I guess the best way to put it
is that he's a mad scientist.

131
00:07:56,232 --> 00:07:58,232
Oh! How interesting.

132
00:07:58,232 --> 00:08:03,498
Uh, earlier you mentioned
that your dad made
all your Luxes himself, right?

133
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:05,932
That sounds so amazing.
How impressive.

134
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:07,165
Yeah, right.

135
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:08,832
In fact, ever since I was a kid,

136
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:12,632
he'd give me a new gun
for my birthday every year. Oh.

137
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:15,532
What? Is there something wrong?

138
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:17,932
[Saya] Here. This place.
Do you know how to get there?

139
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,198
[Kirin] Hmm.

140
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,598
Uh, yeah.

141
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:23,898
I think I can get us there,
but... well, it's just that...

142
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:26,932
It's totally outside
of the shopping districts.

143
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:47,798
‐It's just up ahead.
‐Got it.

144
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,965
[murmurs, soft laughter]

145
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:59,032
OK, I think this is
the place you were looking for.

146
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:00,298
Thanks for the help.

147
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:01,565
I owe you one.

148
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:05,832
Hey, wait, you can't just
leave me alone out here.

149
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:07,965
Not all by myself!

150
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:12,565
Hmm?

151
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,398
[gasp] Hey, what kind of place
is this?

152
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:16,665
Where are we?

153
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:19,498
It's just a used bookshop
specializing in guns.

154
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:22,232
They also sell some stuff
off the black market.

155
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:24,098
Black market?!

156
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:36,765
This is...

157
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:39,432
the DK44V model,

158
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:43,532
and it's even been customized
for the Hermés Special
Infiltration Unit.

159
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:46,332
[merchant] Well, now, that's
a nice piece of hardware.

160
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,565
You've got pretty good taste.

161
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:51,532
This gun,
its generator's genuine?

162
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:55,865
Oh, sure is, but it's a piece
of junk, you can see that.

163
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:58,598
You sure you want it?
There's better stuff in here.

164
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,465
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'll take it.

165
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:03,165
[Kirin sighs]

166
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:05,665
[Saya] Now, that was
a good deal.

167
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:10,232
So, um, is that what
you're giving your father
for his birthday?

168
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:15,498
Yeah, it's a DK44V model
with a special generator
that my dad can use.

169
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:18,098
Hopefully it can help him move
forward with his research.

170
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:21,732
It has some durability issues
and they didn't make
too many of them,

171
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:26,665
so even being able
to find a broken one
is incredibly lucky.

172
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:29,632
It's just what he needs,
I'm sure of it.

173
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:33,698
Wow, that's great.
I'm glad you found it.

174
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:37,232
‐Hey, do you know what?
‐Huh?

175
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:39,098
You get to choose
what we do next.

176
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:42,565
‐What?
‐[Saya] We already did
what I wanted to do.

177
00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:44,298
What do you feel
like doing today?

178
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:48,565
Nothing.
I mean, there's not really...

179
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,565
‐Wait.
‐What is it?

180
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:55,598
Well, um... I don't know,
it's a little embarrassing.

181
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:58,065
But there is something
I could use your help with,

182
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,832
if you don't mind.

183
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,932
[Saya] Hmm?

184
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:12,698
[woman singing in Japanese]

185
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:25,064
Kick your legs up a little.

186
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:27,364
[gasp] 'K.

187
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:30,564
[Saya] You know, I never
would have expected

188
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,298
that this is what
you'd want to do today.

189
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:35,031
Really? What do you mean?
Is it that weird?

190
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:38,431
No, it's not that it's weird.
It's just that...

191
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,998
Just what?

192
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:42,264
Well, if you're gonna have
someone teach you,

193
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:43,964
why did you ask me
and not Ayato?

194
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:46,098
[gasp]

195
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:50,864
Why did you start
freaking out like that?

196
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:52,198
[Kirin] Why wouldn't I?

197
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,964
The question
came out of nowhere.

198
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,098
It really took me by surprise.

199
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:58,131
Sorry, it's no big deal.

200
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:00,698
Yeah, I guess you're right.

201
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:03,698
I just want him to see me
in the best way possible.

202
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:07,598
‐[Saya] Oh?
‐And maybe if I can learn
how to swim without him knowing,

203
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:08,831
then we can both...

204
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,731
I mean, maybe he'll...

205
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,498
Good luck.

206
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,931
Hey, you're not making fun
of me, are you?

207
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:20,164
Not at all. In fact,
I think he might even
try giving you a chance.

208
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:22,931
You are a fearsome rival
after all.

209
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,164
[Kirin] Huh?

210
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:26,464
I'm gonna get us something
to drink.

211
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,764
In the meantime,
keep practicing.

212
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,331
Right.

213
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:40,331
Oh, no! Excuse me.

214
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:43,831
Please move!
I don't know how to stop!

215
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:46,798
‐Oh, no! Watch out!
‐Huh?

216
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:48,731
[boom!]

217
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:54,331
[muffled shouting]

218
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:59,064
Hey, are you OK?

219
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:04,931
What the hell...
do you think you're doing?!

220
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:09,098
Are you looking for a fight?
Because I'm well prepared
to kick your ass!

221
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:11,598
I'll take you on any time,
anywhere, let's go!

222
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:14,364
I'm so sorry,
it was an accident!
I didn't mean to!

223
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:17,298
No. I refuse to accept
your half‐hearted apology.

224
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:20,231
Here I was, simply unwinding,
and you ruined it!

225
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,531
I am absolutely livid!

226
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:24,398
Let's settle this with a duel
so I can knock some...

227
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,031
Hmm? Hold on.

228
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:27,698
[Kirin gasps]

229
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:29,964
[Violet] Are you
by any chance...

230
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:31,831
What? What is it?

231
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:35,164
‐[Violet] Hmm.
‐Why are you staring?

232
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:37,598
Hey, you're Lightning Blade
Speed, aren't you?

233
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:39,464
Seidoukan's Rank Number One.

234
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:40,964
Oh, not anymore.

235
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:43,264
I'm unranked since I lost
my last duel,

236
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,398
so I'm not a Page One now.

237
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:46,498
[clears throat]

238
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:50,664
Well, anyway, perhaps
I overreacted a bit earlier.

239
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,764
But really, what the hell
were you thinking,

240
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:54,298
slamming into me like that?

241
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,298
Did you even bother to look
where you were going?

242
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:57,864
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to.

243
00:13:57,864 --> 00:14:03,231
It's just that I can't swim
very well, so I'm still
trying to learn.

244
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:06,098
You can't swim, huh?

245
00:14:07,364 --> 00:14:10,864
[laughs] Come on,
you must be joking.

246
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:12,531
You can't be serious.

247
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:16,531
You're a Genestella,
a former Rank Number One,
and you can't even swim?

248
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:17,898
How degrading!

249
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,231
[chuckles]

250
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:22,798
Oh, dear! Have I offended you?

251
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:26,564
Well, the thing is,
I unfortunately have
a slight stomach ache today,

252
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:29,198
so I must regretfully
decline your challenge.

253
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:30,698
I hope you understand.

254
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:34,698
Of course. It was all my fault
to begin with.

255
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,331
[giggles]

256
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,164
Yeah, damn straight
it was your fault.

257
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:41,964
Anyway, since you can't swim,
just go splash around
in the kiddie pool

258
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,264
with the rest of the flounders.

259
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:45,398
Bother me again,
and I won't go so...

260
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:46,764
Aaaaah!

261
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:51,198
[Kirin] Sasamiya!
What are you doing?

262
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,664
Sorry I'm late.
Are you OK, Toudou?

263
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:56,631
I'm OK.

264
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,431
That hurt like hell!

265
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:05,431
Who did that, huh?
Who would dare
attack me so rudely?

266
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:06,798
[Saya] I would.

267
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:11,198
And I would really appreciate it
if you'd stop mocking
my partner.

268
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:16,064
Did you say partner?
And who are you, exactly?

269
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:20,198
I'm Saya Sasamiya,
Seidoukan Academy.

270
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,531
Well, I've never heard
of you before.

271
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:23,931
What's your rank?

272
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:26,364
I'm unranked.

273
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:30,431
[giggles]

274
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:33,564
A second‐rate student like you
dares to be so bold

275
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,564
when you're not even listed
in the Named Cults?

276
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:37,564
You're the bold one here.

277
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:38,698
I was watching.

278
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:41,964
You and Toudou collided
with each other, she apologized.

279
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:43,964
Now it's your turn
to do the same.

280
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:46,164
‐Please stop this.
‐[Violet] Come now,
don't make me laugh.

281
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:49,964
‐Just hold on a minute.
‐[Violet] You're the one that
should beg for forgiveness.

282
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:52,498
[Violet] And if you don't...

283
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,431
we'll have to duel.

284
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,598
‐[Kirin] You have to?
‐[Saya] We have to?

285
00:15:58,264 --> 00:16:01,864
[Violet giggles]
If you're frightened,
you can beg for mercy.

286
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:05,798
I happen to be
ranked number 35
at Queenvail Girls' Academy.

287
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,331
I'm known as
the Strega of Bullets.

288
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:14,998
The name's Violet Weinberg,
the one and only!

289
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:18,798
Oh, OK, gotcha.

290
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:20,798
Then let's just get this
over with.

291
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:23,364
Ehh! You insolent wench!

292
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:25,464
I'm going to beat the crap
out of you!

293
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:28,031
Excuse me,
but you have a stomach ache.

294
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:30,331
It stopped hurting
just this second, OK?

295
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:32,064
[bystander] Check it out,
they're gonna duel!

296
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:34,564
[bystander 2] No way.
That's the third time today.

297
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:38,231
[bystander 3] No wonder
this pool's always crowded.
It's amazing!

298
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,998
In the name of the idol
known as the flag of envy,

299
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:43,931
I, Violet Weinberg
of Queenvail Academy,

300
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:47,131
challenge you, Saya Sasamiya,
to a duel!

301
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,298
Challenge accepted.

302
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:54,164
[announcer]
<i>Let the duel begin!</i>

303
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:59,931
[Violet] Since duels between
different schools stay off
the official records,

304
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,431
your loss here won't hurt
your reputation,

305
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:04,898
so you won't have to cry
when I beat you.

306
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,598
All right, time to show you
what I can do!

307

[crowd applauds, whistles]

314
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:42,597
[Saya] Toudou, you need
to stick up for yourself.

315
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:44,364
Have a little backbone.

316
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:53,897
Weren't you angry
she was pushing you around?

317
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:58,164
Not at all. I was
to blame for what happened
just as much as she was.

318
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:01,497
But that's not a valid excuse
for how she was bullying you.

319
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,397
Think so?
I guess I couldn't see it.

320
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:09,864
Maybe it's because I've gotten
so used to the way my uncle's
always treated me.

321
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:14,564
That's no good. You're gonna
have to move past that.

322
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:18,331
You should have more confidence
in yourself, Toudou.

323
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,731
Confidence?

324
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,764
You're a good person
with a lot of great qualities.

325
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:25,264
You're not perfect,
but nobody is.

326
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:27,631
Your imperfections
make you beautiful.

327
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:34,431
Thank you so much.
It means a lot.

328
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:40,831
So, um, can I ask you
something totally random?

329
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:42,397
‐Huh?
‐All right.

330
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:47,931
Well, I was wondering,
why did you choose me
as your tag partner?

331
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49,164
Let's see.

332
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:51,931
For lots of reasons.

333
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,597
Your talent's a no‐brainer.

334
00:18:53,597 --> 00:18:56,664
Strategic compatibility.
Sense of purpose.

335
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:58,931
These traits alone
make you a good choice.

336
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:03,897
But the real reason is,
you and Ayato wield your swords
with the same spirit.

337
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:06,731
After watching
the two of you duel,

338
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,731
there was no doubt in my mind.

339
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,831
True intentions, determination,
and quiet dignity.

340
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:14,431
That's how I knew.

341
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,397
We were meant to be
tag partners.

342
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:23,797
Oh, there's one more thing
before I forget.

343
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:24,864
Um, yeah.

344
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,964
We're more than schoolmates,
we're tag partners.

345
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:29,697
You can start calling me Saya.

346
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:33,564
And if it's OK,
I'd like to call you Kirin.

347
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:38,564
[Kirin] OK.

348
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:51,331
‐Kirin, go right.
‐I'm on it, Saya!

349
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:52,964
Haaaa!

350
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:56,564
[Saya] Kirin!

351
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:01,097
Aaaaah!

[buzzer sounds]

354
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:10,864
Can't believe it.
How did they improve
this much in a single day?

355
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:13,164
Guess we're gonna have to up
our game, too.

356
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:15,997

[Eishirou] As you can see,
the Kirin‐Sasamiya tag team
is looking pretty promising.

379
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:00,164
[Claudia] I'm glad to hear that.

380
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:03,931
After all, Seidoukan
needs those two to do
their best out there.

381
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:07,797
[Eishirou] By the way,
I hear the Phoenix Festa
brackets are out.

382
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:09,297
How do they look?

383
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:11,331
Care to see for yourself?

384
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,897
[chuckles]

385
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:15,764
There's always a ridiculous
number of players, huh?

386
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:19,797
[Claudia] Well, there are 256
tag teams competing this year.

387
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,364
[Eishirou] OK,
so our princess's team

388
00:22:22,364 --> 00:22:23,964
would be over...

389
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:25,997
Oh! There they are.

390
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:28,797
Block C, huh?

391
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:31,364
And Toudou and Sasamiya
are in Block L,

392
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:35,231
so they probably won't face
each other until they're
in the final round.

393
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:37,864
So it's possible
for either of our teams

394
00:22:37,864 --> 00:22:39,931
to win the tournament,
wouldn't you say?

395
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:41,631
It won't be that easy.

396
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:43,797
But compared to the Gryps
and Lindwurs Festas,

397
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:47,097
they do have a better than
average chance at success.

398
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:52,397
Well, the Gryps Festa's
Silver‐winged Knights
and the Lindwurs' Erenshkigal

399
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:54,464
were both on
a completely different level.

400
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,897
Compared to back then,
we might just manage

401
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:59,297
to blow this Phoenix Festa
wide open.

402
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:01,797
[Claudia] Actually,
I don't know about that.

403
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,297
[Eishirou] Oh?
Why the lack of confidence?

404
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:06,231
[Claudia] Did you forget?

405
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:08,397
At least one faction
of this Festa

406
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:09,664
may cause us trouble.

407
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:12,631
Someone from Arlequint, perhaps?

408
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:15,397
[Eishirou] Ah, you mean
those puppets, right?

409
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:19,197
Also, it looks like ReWolf
is planning something,

410
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,864
sending someone
just as dangerous.

411
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:23,864
No way! I didn't expect
to see her in the Festa.

412
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:27,864
The wielder of
the Gravi‐Sheath Ogre Lux,

413
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,764
Irene Urzaiz.

414
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:34,764
I truly hope our players are
able to avoid fighting her.
