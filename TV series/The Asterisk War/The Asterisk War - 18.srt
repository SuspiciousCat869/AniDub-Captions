was able to protect him
from getting injured,

are Arlequint's puppets.

even for him to defeat those
two
without using the Ser Versta.

[Ayato] So far, Saya and Kirin
still haven't found anything.

[Julis] Really?

145

Tomorrow's final match will be
starting at twelve o'clock,

[Julis] And if we start
factoring in the inspection
before the match,

then we have even less time
than we think.

156
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,354
So that's it, huh?

157
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:39,854
It's just
as the president suspects.

158
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:43,554
It's almost a sure bet
that Dirk Eberwein is the guy
who's really behind all this.

159
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:46,754
[Ayato] Grimalkin.
So do you know anything
about them?

160
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:49,554
Nada, but from what
I understand,

161
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:52,121
out of all the academies'
intelligence‐gathering
organizations,

162
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:55,487
‐Grimalkin's the most
secretive.
‐I see.

163
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:58,621
Now, I'd rather not get
mixed up with those guys,

164
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:00,421
cos they're just trouble.

165
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,021
But if you're only out to find
this Flora kid, count me in.

166
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:05,187
Sure, and that's all
we're asking for.

167
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:07,554
I'd almost rather you weren't
involved in this.

168
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:10,954
"Thanks for your support,"
that's what I'd usually say,

169
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:13,721
but seeing as how I'm not
a fighter like you guys,

170
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:15,687
think I'm gonna have to call in
some backup.

171
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:19,987
Let's see, now, I know
I have that guy's number
in here somewhere.

172
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:23,587
I'm not sure what you're up to,
but we don't have time to
waste, got it?

173
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:27,287
Of course, and I'll do my best
to help you guys out
in any way that I can.

174
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:29,721
Just don't put
too much faith in me.

175
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:35,454
OK. Julis, there's another
option I'd really like to try
and take a look at.

176
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,254
You've got some other idea?

177
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:41,354
Fine by me, but I don't think
it's gonna do us much good.

178
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:45,554
It is a long shot,
but we need to keep all
of our options open now.

179
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:49,987
Who knows? It might give us
the clue we've been looking
for.

180
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:04,687
[Irene] So, you came.
Don't turn around.

181
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:09,087
All right, fine, but I still
don't understand why you wanted
to meet me here.

182
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,154
Idiot! Didn't you know
our calls are being monitored?

183
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:14,954
Sorry.

184
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,454
Never mind.
Let's get straight to the
point.

185
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:21,421
I don't have anything
that I can share with you.

186
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:23,787
I see.

187
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,187
[Irene] Don't get me wrong,

188
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:27,121
it's not like I have
a gag order.

189
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:29,454
‐Well, not exactly.
‐What, then?

190
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:32,454
The Tyrant isn't as stupid
as you'd think.

191
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:35,121
He knew you'd try
and contact me at some point.

192
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,654
And yet he hasn't
prevented this meeting.

193
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:43,021
Basically, any information
I do have wouldn't be able

194
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:45,421
to help you out whatsoever,
and he's counting on it.

195
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:47,687
Understood.

196
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:49,387
Sorry, I shouldn't
have bothered.

197
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:50,887
[Irene] Hold on a minute.

198
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:53,254
While I don't have
any new info to offer,

199
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:56,254
I do have some suggestions
that might be of use.

200
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:58,121
Like what?

201
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,287
[Irene] Well, you've narrowed
your search

202
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:02,554
to the Redevelopment District,
haven't you?

203
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:05,287
[Ayato] Yeah.
What about it?

204
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:08,321
Normally, that wouldn't be
a bad place to begin,

205
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:11,687
but I wouldn't look there for
someone who's been kidnapped.

206
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:13,754
I'm not sure what you mean.

207
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,587
[Irene] If I remember
correctly, that place is full
of criminals.

208
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:21,154
And that's why the police
always make sure to patrol the
area.

209
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:25,487
That being the case, it's not
a good place to hide somebody

210
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,954
or to lay low long‐term.

211
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:29,954
And not only that...

212
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:32,287
Grimalkin doesn't really
play nice with others.

213
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:35,854
They'd want to avoid
police interference
as much as possible.

214
00:14:35,987 --> 00:14:38,254
If that's the case,
where else could she be?

215
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:40,254
Who knows?

216
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:44,321
But the place that would
give all of you guys
the most trouble,

217
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:46,221
probably Rotlicht.

218
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:48,154
Why is that?

219
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,987
[Irene] You can search
all you want in
the Redevelopment District,

220
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:55,054
but in Rotlicht, both legal
and illegal shops are together.

221
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:59,187
So you won't be able to just
barge into one of those places.

222
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:03,021
But if that's true, it means
Grimalkin isn't working alone.

223
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:04,987
Somebody must be helping them,
right?

224
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,687
Yeah, that's right.

225
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:10,154
They may be paying somebody
so they can stay hidden.

226
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:28,221
Come on, Camilla!

227
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:31,154
Why you gotta be
in such a bad mood?

228
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:36,121
You know we might have
lost the match

229
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:39,121
if we hadn't gone ahead and
used you‐know‐what, right?

230
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:43,254
[sighs]

231
00:15:48,287 --> 00:15:52,221
You and I, we both want
different things, don't we?

232
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:55,121
You knew that going
into this partnership.

233
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,354
Your goal is to create
ultimate universality.

234
00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:02,454
In other words, a weapon
that can be universally wielded
by anybody,

235
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,654
no matter what kind of person
they are, right?

236
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:06,421
That's right.

237
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:09,587
But to try and create something
like that is nearly impossible.

238
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:13,454
That's why we're making
these combat‐ready puppets
instead.

239
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:16,221
So humans just have to
give orders to use the weapon.

240
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:20,421
They don't need
a free will of their own.

241
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:23,787
And they shouldn't have one,
now, should they?

242
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:25,487
[Camilla] Correct.

243
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:27,287
But that's what I wanna do,

244
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:30,687
produce autonomous puppets that
cry, laugh, and truly evolve,

245
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:35,921
for them to one day gain
the exact same rights as
humans,
that's my ultimate goal.

246
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,154
Do you happen to remember
the day the two of us
first met?

247
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:52,487
Of course. I mean, after all,
how could I ever forget
something as impactful as that?

248
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:54,854
Yeah, good point.

249
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:02,521
When anti‐government forces
attacked my parents' workplace,

250
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,287
every guard died
protecting us.

251
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:08,254
My parents tried their best
to fight back,

252
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:09,921
but it was no use.

253
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:12,554
We couldn't hold our own
against trained soldiers.

254
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:15,821
[gunfire]

255
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:28,754
[explosion]

256
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:35,087
[heartbeats, monitor beeping]

257
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:55,054
[somber soundtrack plays]

258
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:57,254
Half of my body survived.

259
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:00,054
The other half
you had replaced.

260
00:18:01,854 --> 00:18:05,887
And so I swore that I'd
dedicate
half of my life to you,

261
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:07,487
no matter what.

262
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,287
Mm‐hmm. So far, so good.

263
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,587
I don't have the right
to criticize your dream.

264
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,454
I freely admit that our goals
are quite different.

265
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:17,587
But that's not the issue.

266
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,221
Then what is it
you're so mad about?

267
00:18:19,354 --> 00:18:22,654
That stunt back there
was too dangerous!

268
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:26,454
Come on, you know it wasn't
ready for practical use.

269
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:29,954
But if we'd lost that match,
then it would have been
game over.

270
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:31,954
Don't you have enough results
by now?

271
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:34,054
I'm not stopping
until we win it all.

272
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:38,521
Then, you'll see, I'm going
to have Aldy and Rimsy
become students here.

273
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:39,787
[giggles]

274
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,754
If that happens,

275
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,187
people will become more and
more accepting of autonomous
puppets.

276
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:48,087
Seriously.

277
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,754
‐[Aldy] Master.
‐[Ernesta] Huh?

278
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:52,521
[Aldy] I'm so sorry
to bother you,

279
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:55,654
but if possible, I'd like
to make a formal request.

280
00:18:55,787 --> 00:18:58,421
Huh? What's up?

281
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,421
[Aldy] I was wondering
if you could leave the scar
on my face.

282
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:05,987
I completely understand
if that's not something
you're willing to do.

283
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:08,787
No, that wouldn't be
a problem at all,

284
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:10,787
but why would you ask me
for that?

285
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:14,287
[Aldy] Because I want it as
proof of the battle I fought.

286
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:17,154
[Ernesta] Oh. You mean like
a badge of victory?

287
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,387
[Aldy] Uh... no.

288
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:21,221
It's nothing quite as grand
as that.

289
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:24,821
I've learned a lot
through this battle,

290
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:27,121
things that caught me
by surprise.

291
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:31,487
What I noticed when
my imperfections became
exposed,

292
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:35,654
it wasn't purely a matter
of learning data.

293
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:40,254
It's what humans call,
yes, growth!

294
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:44,321
I believe that I may have
actually achieved real growth.

295
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:47,687
And I want to keep proof
of that with me.

296
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:50,154
Ahhh! Marvelous.

297
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:54,087
No way. You mean he's become
self‐aware?

298
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:58,054
[Rimsy] Master, I have a favor
to ask of you as well.

299
00:19:58,187 --> 00:19:59,854
[Ernesta] Oh? You too, Rimsy?

300
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:02,821
[Rimsy] When I transfer
limit control to Aldy...

301
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:04,621
[Ernesta] Yes? Yes?

302
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:06,821
...it would be most helpful
if you could narrow the range

303
00:20:06,954 --> 00:20:09,387
when my external armor
is detached,

304
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:12,254
or otherwise adjust it somehow.

305
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:14,387
It's quite humiliating.

306
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:17,187
Ohhhhh!

307
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:18,654
Hmmm!

308
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:22,387
Well, you see, since there are
a few technical issues,

309
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,087
it would be a little difficult
to do by tomorrow.

310
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:30,087
Yes, I understand, master.

311
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:36,887
I suppose we can all thank
Sasamiya and Toudou
for this too, can't we?

312
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:42,021
Imagine, we might get to see
this kind of growth
in the final, too.

313

[ominous soundtrack]

314
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:50,854
[Ernesta] But who knows
what'll happen?

315
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,954
What am I supposed to do now?

316
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,954
There still isn't one clue
after asking around.

317
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:03,154
Well, maybe if I take a look
further down there.

318
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:10,254
[man] Hey, you there.

319
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:13,787
So, it's you.

320
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:16,187
You're the bastard
that's been sniffing around
and asking questions.

321
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:19,887
What? No. I'm just looking
for someone, that's all.

322
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:22,187
Then how about you come
with us, kid?

323
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:25,854
No, thank you.
I've really gotta get going.

324
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:28,187
Come back here!

325
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:36,387
‐Come on, get the bastard!
‐Where is he?

326
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:39,087
[Ayato thinking] If I stay here,
I might get cornered.

327
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:42,054
Think I should head out
for now.

328
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:44,754
Huh?

329
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,254
Hmm.

330
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,354
What should I do?
I can't make a scene.

331
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:51,454
If the abductor notices
what's going on...

332
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:53,854
[woman] Hey there.

333
00:21:57,787 --> 00:22:00,754
Are you being chased by
someone?

334
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,954
I can help you
if you're in trouble.

335
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:10,854
