Burst into bloom!
Red Crown!

3
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:52,157
Surely, you don't think that
cowardly move sufficient enough
to dispatch me?

4
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:54,891
Come out here and show yourself!

5
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:01,691
Hello, Silas Norman.

6
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:06,291
[chuckles maniacally]

[Shiena Nishizawa singing

8
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:44,381
[Silas] I'm impressed you
realized I was the one
behind the attacks.

9
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:47,381
Your slip of the tongue
helped significantly.

10
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:49,515
Afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

11
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,515
The commercial district
yesterday.

12
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:53,915
You said something when you were
trying to stop Lester.

13
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:57,815
I believe you said you would
never do anything as cowardly

14
00:02:57,815 --> 00:03:00,415
as watching a duel
for a chance to attack.

15
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:02,481
Yeah, so what if I did?

16
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:03,981
A telling statement.

17
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:07,148
The media only reported
that I'd repelled my attackers.

18
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:10,248
There wasn't a single mention
of my having fought Sasamiya.

19
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:13,681
Watching a duel
for a chance to attack?

20
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:15,815
Only a person who'd actually
seen it happen

21
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:18,448
or had been told about it
could say that,

22
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,048
which means it must have been
the perpetrator,

23
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:22,315
or one in league with him.

24
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:26,415
Congratulations.
You're a quick one.

25
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:30,981
So in other words,
Ayato deliberately
provoked Lester yesterday.

26
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:32,615
[Julis] Most likely.

27
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:36,215
He's smarter than you think.
I wouldn't underestimate him
if I were you.

28
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:41,315
Well then, if that's the case,
I see I made the right call
in targeting him instead.

29
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:45,181
I don't need him interfering
when you're the one
I'm really after.

30
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,781
How dare you!

31
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:50,381
Oh, a little sensitive, are we?
Wait, don't tell me.

32
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:55,648
You came here in an attempt
to either convince or force me
to leave Ayato out of this.

33
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:58,948
Let's bargain.
I'm not unreasonable.

34
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:03,048
I've but one condition,
that you withdraw yourself
from the Phoenix Festa.

35
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:09,515
Now, why would I do that
when I could simply annihilate
you right here and now?

36
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:14,515
[Silas] Huh.

37
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,881
[Lester] Is what you just said
true, Silas?

38
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:23,681
[Julis] Lester!

39
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,781
Oh, I was wondering when you'd
grace us with your presence.

40
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:32,481
I came right over when I heard
Julis had accepted a challenge.

41
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:36,548
Only to find out that you're
the one who attacked her.

42
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:40,115
[Julis] He's been hired
by some academy or another

43
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:43,648
to take out
the front‐running competitors
for the Phoenix Festa.

44
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:45,181
Surely you knew that.

45
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:48,181
How could you sell out
your fellow students like that?

46
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:50,215
[Silas] My fellow students?

47
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:51,915
You can't be serious.

48
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:55,615
"My fellow enemies"
would be a better description.

49
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:57,881
We're all here
for one reason alone

50
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,081
and that's to take
each other down in pursuit
of our own desires.

51
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:03,115
And since there's nothing
we can do about it,

52
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:05,381
we might as well make
some money in the process.

53
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,781
I gotta know before
I kick your ass.

54
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:10,148
Why did you make a point
of bringing me out here?

55
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:13,515
So I could have someone
to blame all those attacks on.

56
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:15,048
It was almost too easy.

57
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,648
You would duel each other
and fall by your own hands.

58
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:20,715
Seems legit, doesn't it?

59
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:24,515
[growls]

60
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:28,048
You go to hell!

61
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:32,181
What the...

62
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,381
OK, I get it now.

63
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:38,915
They're buddies from
whatever school hired you.

64
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:42,448
[chuckles] Oh, you don't know
the half of it.

65
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:44,848
[snaps fingers]

66
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,148
Allow me to introduce you
to my little friends.

67
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:52,648
My precious dolls.

68
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:56,715
Puppets!

69
00:05:56,715 --> 00:06:00,181
[Silas] You know, "puppet"
is a rather crude title,
don't you agree?

70
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:04,081
They're much more than
mere machines, or even robots.

71
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:09,048
Well, Silas, now I see
where your true talent lies.

72
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:11,015
[Lester] Huhhh!

00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,581
Great.

[screaming]

[Julis] Lester!

81
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:47,148
[Silas] Don't go.
I've made an adjustment
just for you.

82
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:50,948
Why don't you test the new
threshold for heat tolerance,
Princess?

83
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,148
So, is that the best you've got,
a dirty sucker punch?

84
00:06:57,148 --> 00:07:00,915
[Silas] Oh my, you're
in better shape than I thought.

85
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,115
[Lester] It doesn't matter
how many

86
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:06,648
of your stupid little dollies
you attack me with.

87
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:13,615
[Silas] It doesn't matter
how many, you say?

88
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:16,548
Very well, as you wish.

89
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:20,115
How does 128 sound to you, then?

90
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,615
[laughs maniacally]

91
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,981
The look on your face
is priceless.

92
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,881
Goodbye, now.

00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:38,181

Well, that was quite impressive,

98
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,081
‐but at the end of the day...
‐[snaps fingers]

99
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,181
you're still outnumbered!

[shrieks]

102
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,981
[Silas] Your skills are
certainly prodigious,

103
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:41,581
but the way they prevent you
from viewing your opponent
is a real flaw.

104
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:44,481
Well, they haven't prevented me
from discovering something.

105
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:46,648
[Silas] Oh? And what's that?

106
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:49,481
[Julis] I know who's pulling
your strings.

107
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:51,381
And it's Arlequint!

108
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:56,348
There's no other academy
that can mass‐produce armor
capable of withstanding attacks

109
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:58,615
as strong as mine and Lester's.

110
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,315
[footsteps approach]

111
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:02,848
[Silas] Quite perceptive.

112
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:04,748
But I'm afraid
now that you know,

113
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:07,781
there's no way I can afford
to let you out of here alive.

114
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,081
[shrieks]

115
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:14,181
You know, I can think
of few things more pleasurable

116
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:15,581
than inflicting pain on you,

117
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:17,781
but let's just get this
over with.

118
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:19,981
Been nice knowing you,
your highness.

119
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:39,481
[Ayato] I'm sorry I got here
so late.

120
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,481
[Julis] Ayato!

121
00:09:52,014 --> 00:09:55,014
[Julis] Hold on. I...

122
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,214
What are you doing here?

123
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:04,414
I came here to rescue you.

124
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:08,680
I don't recall asking
for your help.

125
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,280
This is my problem, not yours.

126
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,047
What sort of fool
goes out of his way
to put himself in danger?

127
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,447
You don't get it, huh?

128
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:18,514
OK, you said you were fighting
of your own volition.

129
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:21,047
No one made you, right?
You have an objective,

130
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:23,447
and that's to make sure the kids
in the orphanage are OK.

131
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,880
It's been your plan
since the beginning, hasn't it?

132
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,114
Yes. So what's your point?

133
00:10:28,114 --> 00:10:32,114
Well then, if you're out
fighting to protect them,
who's gonna protect you?

134
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:35,314
Protect me?

135
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:38,247
[Ayato] I've been searching
for a long time now,

136
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:41,147
trying to figure out what I can
do with this power of mine,

137
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:43,314
and what I'm supposed to do
with it.

138
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:47,514
But coming here and meeting you,
I finally understand.

139
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,214
You see, there is something
that I want to do,

140
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,514
and I'm just hoping I've got
what it takes to do it.

141
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:56,680
Because now I know that
it's my true purpose.

142
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,447
And what do you want to do?

143
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:03,114
I want to be the one
who protects you.

144
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,347
You imbecile. How could you
say a thing like that?

145
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:11,080
[boom!]

146
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,380
If you two are done
with your little chat,
we have unfinished business.

147
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,947
The power of the Ser Versta
is remarkable,

148
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:21,514
and also a bit of a pain.

149
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:26,547
However, just because
your surprise attack
happened to work out,

150
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:31,780
that doesn't mean you can expect
the same results against
so many of my dolls.

151
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,447
Doesn't it?
Cos don't forget, I learned
the surprise attack from you.

152
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:37,447
What else have you got?

153
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,980
I beg your pardon?

154
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,114
Perhaps you would care
for a test.

155
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:49,514
[snaps fingers]

That's why.

I've already contacted Claudia.

it's fine, and it's fine,

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,014
[Julis] Anyway, listen.

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,880
About that power
that's restraining you.

259
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,847
Can you tell me who cast it?

260
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:26,147
Uh... cast what?

261
00:19:26,147 --> 00:19:28,247
Don't know what you mean.

262
00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:34,847
It was my sister.

263
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,614
Imprisonment power.

264
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:39,380
It gave her the ability to bind
anything that she wanted to.

265
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,847
Impressive. So what you
unleashed back there
were your true powers,

266
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:45,347
what you're really capable of.

267
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:48,280
Yeah. That's one way
of looking at it.

268
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,947
Can't you give a straight answer
for anything?

Ha. Well, I can only use them
for so long.

Guess I shouldn't brag.
Look at the state I'm in.

00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:05,547
But why would your sister
do that to you?

274
00:20:05,547 --> 00:20:07,480
I'd ask her myself if I could,

275
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,714
but she's been missing
for about five years now.

No, it's all right.

277
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:15,480
Wherever she's gone,
she had her reasons.

278
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Just like she had a reason
for binding my powers.

279
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:22,214
Mind if I ask you a question?

280
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:23,480
Go ahead.

a guy who'd be interested.

286
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,480
Really?

287
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,214
Now, you set the bar high,

288
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:38,980
but I'd say I'm pretty decisive
and determined.

289
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,014
Though you'll have
to give me a pass

290
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:43,380
on the noble dedication,
knightly thing...

I appreciate your offer,
but don't push yourself.

292
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,480
At the Festa level,
your normal strength

293
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,014
simply can't compete with that
of the other fighters.

294
00:20:52,014 --> 00:20:54,214
And you wouldn't want
to end up like this

at every match.

314
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:18,362
Aaaaah!

315
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:29,195
[Eishirou] Man! Now, what did
you go and do that for, anyway?

316
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:31,095
Oh, there's nothing
to worry about.

317
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:32,395
I didn't kill him.

318
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:36,295
After all, he can still be
of some use.

319
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:40,595
I see. So instead of going
public for the sake
of diplomacy,

320
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:43,229
you'll just handle
the entire incident internally

321
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,862
so that Arlequint
will owe us one.

322
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:48,795
I'm going to leave it up to you,
so use your best discretion.

323
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:51,262
Just be sure to get
some information out of him.

324
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:53,562
[Eishirou] You can count on it.

325
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:56,195
Cos it's what
we Shadow Stars do.

326
00:22:56,195 --> 00:22:59,162
Oh, yeah, so how did it go
with those two?

327
00:22:59,162 --> 00:23:00,762
Rather well, I do believe.

328
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:03,995
[Eishirou] OK, then what's
with the forced smile?

329
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:05,195
That's good news, right?

330
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:06,429
[Claudia] Well...

331
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:08,262
<i>most certainly,</i>
<i>and why wouldn't it be?</i>

332
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:11,229
[Ernesta] Okie‐dokie,
that should do it.

333
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:13,895
I gathered plenty of data.

334
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:15,795
Silas performed better
than I could have hoped.

335
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,795
I mean, did you see
those sneak attacks
on the front runners?

336
00:23:18,795 --> 00:23:20,429
Come on. [laughs]

337
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:23,395
They're proficient little guys,
if nothing else.

338
00:23:23,395 --> 00:23:26,029
Of course,
they were designed by me.

339
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,595
[giggles, sighs]

340
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:30,562
Thankfully,
that half‐baked nut job

341
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:33,262
was even easier to manipulate
than these dolls.

342
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:34,729
[sighs]
