1
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,311
Dad's pretty furious
with you, you know.

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,046
I didn't do anything wrong!

3
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,282
Those guys deserved it
after what they said to you.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,424
Ayato, he's forbidden you
from fighting in matches
at the dojo.

5
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,527
‐You know why?
‐[Ayato] Hmm‐mm.

6
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,295
[Haruka] It's because you have
tremendous power.

7
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,998
That kind of strength is
dangerous if you're not careful.

8
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:35,736
You'll wind up hurting
not only your opponent
but yourself as well.

9
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,170
I don't know what you mean.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,440
What I mean is,
you're just too young to fight.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,810
‐Then when can I start?
‐[Haruka] Hmm.

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,014
Probably when you're able to
find your true purpose in life.

13
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,016
My purpose in life?

14
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,553
Mm‐hmm. And by the time
you figure that out,

15
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:56,623
you'll know just what to do
with this power of yours.

16
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:00,293
Have you already found
what it is that you're
supposed to do, Haruka?

17
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,662
[gasps]

18
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:03,797
Yeah, of course.

19
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,834
My purpose in life
is to protect you, forever.

20
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:13,473
I swear, you're
the most important thing
in the whole world to me.

21
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:18,378
[Ayato] Same here.
So I'm just gonna have
to protect you, too.

22
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,817
I'm sure that's what I'm...

23
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,219
[loud whirring]

24
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,625
[groans]

25
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,263
That's it. Her eyes.

26
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,381
[Shiena Nishizawa singing
"Brand‐new World" in Japanese]

27
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,135
[Ayato] <i>Oh, hey, Julis.</i>

28
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,237
This is a coincidence, huh?

29
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,307
‐Is it? Can I help you?
‐Who the hell is this?

30
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,943
Lester, he's that
transfer student!

31
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,513
Yeah? What's he doing here?

32
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:36,116
Hey, I'm Ayato Amagiri.
What's up, man?

33
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,219
‐Go to hell!
‐All right, this is awesome.

34
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,054
Hey, turn that thing off,
would ya?

35
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,256
Come on, drop it for now,
Lester!

36
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,395
Fine, but I'm not giving up.

37
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,432
You will acknowledge
my strength, princess.

38
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,434
[group muttering]

39
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,441
First the duel this morning,
and now your composure
confronting Lester.

40
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,777
You think you're rather tough,
don't you?

41
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,011
Nah, not really.

42
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,148
[Julis] Watching you try to
maintain that feigned ignorance

43
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,783
should be quite entertaining.

44
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,385
This place isn't as forgiving
as you may have imagined.

45
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:16,356
Well, excuse me for asking,
but what are you doing
fighting here, then?

46
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,358
You are a princess, aren't you?

47
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,495
‐[Julis] I do it for money.
‐Huh?

48
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,798
I'm in need of some cash
at the moment.

49
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,300
That's the reason
I've come here to fight.

50
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,603
The Phoenix Festa
is starting soon,

51
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,005
and that's the first thing
I've got to conquer.

52
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,274
[Eishirou] So, does that mean
you already found a partner?

53
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,643
You need a tag team
for that one, you know.

54
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,880
Julis, you do have friends,
right?

55
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,049
I don't see what that has
to do with anything.

56
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,652
It isn't the reason why
I haven't found a partner yet.

57
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:49,022
Although it is true that I have
no friends to speak of.

58
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,857
Still, that's quite irrelevant.

59
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:55,662
To be frank, I simply haven't
met anyone here who measures up
to my standards for a partner.

60
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,532
[Ayato thinking]
<i>So she actually admitted it.</i>

61
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,667
All right, then, what is it
exactly you're looking for?

62
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,470
Well, beggars can't be choosers,
but ideally,

63
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,973
I'd like someone with
Page One‐level combat skills.

64
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,543
Decisive, determined.

65
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:13,113
Someone who fights with a noble
dedication, like a knight.

66
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,782
‐Yeah, good luck.
‐[monitor rings]

67
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,554
Ah, jeez, totally forgot
about my deadline!

68
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,288
I'll catch you guys later.

69
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,758
It's about time
I headed back myself.

70
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,893
‐Wait, uh, Julis.
‐What is it?

71
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:31,331
Could you remind me how
to get to the guys' dorm again?

72
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,700
[giggles]

73
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,670
Really! After the trouble
you got into this morning,

74
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,340
the least you could do is try
and study the campus map
a little.

75
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,909
[giggles] What's wrong?

76
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,680
Nothing. I just wondered
if you laughed sometimes,
and now I know.

77
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,282
Well, of course,
doesn't everyone?

78
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,284
Wh‐what's going on
in that head of yours?

79
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:55,421
Just go straight that direction
and you'll come to a path
that leads to your dorm.

80
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,257
‐Follow it and you'll be fine.
‐Uh...

81
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,592
Now what?

82
00:05:58,592 --> 00:05:59,826
Do you think that maybe

83
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,928
you could give me a tour
of the academy sometime?

84
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,265
‐We could check out the city
while we're at it.
‐Please tell me you're kidding.

85
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,967
Why would I do that?

86
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,504
Cos "you shall have my aid
in one moment of need,"
remember?

87
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,739
[Julis] True, I did say that.

88
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,808
But is that really all you want?

89
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,411
[Ayato] Mm‐hmm. I've got to
figure out this place
sooner or later.

90
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,017
Very well then,
I suppose a debt is a debt.

91
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:27,621
All right, I'll show you
around the academy
tomorrow after class

92
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,856
and we'll tour the city
on our next day off.

93
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,091
<i>How's that?</i>

94
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,437
[students murmuring]

95
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,607
Hey, good morning, Julis.

96
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,308
Good morning. How are you?

97
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,743
[students gasp]

98
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,278
[boy] Hey, did you hear that?

99
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,480
[boy 2] Did the princess
actually return
someone's greeting?

100
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,620
Well! You ingrates are so rude!
Keep those comments
to yourself, all right?

101
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,190
[Ayato giggles feebly,
girl moans]

102
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,962
Huh?

103
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,632
Saya. That you?

104
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,234
Ayato?

105
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,970
Whoa! What are you doing here?

106
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,706
Hey, hold up. You guys
know each other or something?

107
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,543
Uh... yeah.
I can't believe it.

108
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:25,045
I haven't seen you since
you moved abroad, like...

109
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,681
what, maybe six years ago?

110
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,416
Yeah. I'm totally in shock.

111
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,353
Tell me about it.
You haven't changed, really.

112
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,522
You look exactly the same
as you used to.

113
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,691
[Saya] That's not true.

114
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,495
See, I've gotten taller.

115
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,964
[Ayato, awkwardly] Oh, yeah.

116
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,600
It's a small world,
no pun intended.

117
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,135
It's as if fate itself
brought you back together.

118
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:54,741
Huh. Maybe it has.
Yeah, well said, Eishirou.

119
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,211
Oh, by the way,
how is your dad these days?

120
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,317
Good, but a little crazy.
Wish he'd be more careful.

121
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,488
The whole reason that I came
to this school is because
dad told me to.

122
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,724
Are you serious?

123
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,362
Yeah, he invented this new gun,
said it needed some exposure.

124
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,264
That's why you came here?

125
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:22,035
Well, I had reasons
of my own, too, so...
guess I'm cool with it.

126
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:25,405
I see, and what would
those reasons be?

127
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,173
Sorry, that's private.

128
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:31,244
Hmm, private. Well, well...

129
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,548
Keep your dirty schoolboy
thoughts to yourself, got it?

130
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,583
Got it loud and clear.

131
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,352
All right, butts in the seats,
you ingrates.

132
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,954
Homeroom's beginning.

133
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:44,190
Sasamiya, nice of you
to join us.

134
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,959
Yes, good morning, everyone.

135
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,862
So tell me, why were you
a no‐show yesterday?

136
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,533
‐Spill it, I'm listening.
‐I overslept, ma'am.

137
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,401
[laughs] You overslept, huh?

138
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,070
Uggh!

139
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,304
Oww! That hurt!

140
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,006
Dumb ass. Sick of your excuses.

141
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,609
You'll take a makeup class
next time, got it?

142
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,679
You still can't get out of bed
in the morning, huh?

143
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,514
No, it holds me
hostage.

144
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,982
[Ayato laughs]

145
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,962
[Julis] I guess that'll do.

146
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,632
Hey, do you remember
that one park that we
always used to play in?

147
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,434
Mm. There was that huge pond
next to it, right?

148
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,836
Oh, yeah, and that one time,
we saw...

149
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,606
[Julis clears throat]

150
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,375
If you're ready,
we can go now.

151
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,779
Hey, Julis, sounds good.
I'm really counting
on your help.

152
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,048
I have no choice.
A promise is a promise,
after all.

153
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,416
What's this about?

154
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,851
I'm getting a tour.

155
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,821
She said she's going to show me
around the academy today.

156
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,956
Oh, she is, huh? Why?

157
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,826
Because...
well, it's complicated.

158
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,762
‐And it's none of your business.
‐Huh.

159
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,332
‐Come on, let's go.
‐Yeah, let's do it.

160
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,167
Hold on.

161
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,137
‐I'll show Ayato
around the campus.
‐[Julis] What?

162
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,040
Sounded to me like
you didn't want to anyway.

163
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,544
So I thought you'd be relieved
to have someone take your place.

164
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,378
I appreciate your offer,

165
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,716
but I have no intention
of breaking the promise
I've made.

166
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:19,886
Come on, I'd make a much better
tour guide than you.

167
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,522
You're not even that into it.

168
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:22,956
Yes, I am!

169
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,825
And anyway, why would Ayato
want a tour

170
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,593
from someone
who just started here

171
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:30,430
when he can get one from me,
a student who's been attending
since junior high?

172
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,633
[girls grunt defiantly]

173
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,536
Ladies, calm down, OK?

174
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,970
[Claudia]
If that's the criteria,

175
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,373
that makes me the best person
for the job, wouldn't you agree?

176
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:44,477
‐Whoa!
‐Julis transferred during
our third year of junior high.

177
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,715
However, I've been a bona fide
student enrolled here
since first year.

178
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,784
‐Who is she?
‐What are you even doing here?

179
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:54,688
Claudia, would you mind?
I mean, could you let go
of my arm? It's touching...

180
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,691
Oh, you're awful,
every single one of you.

181
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:01,461
All I wanted was to join in
on the fun you're having
since I'm...

182
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,530
‐No.
‐Certainly not!

183
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,168
In that case, I'll just
finish up with my business
and be on my merry way.

184
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,671
My arm's still touching
your, uh...

185
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,306
[Claudia] Now, this is for you.

186
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:17,911
As discussed yesterday,
your Ogre Lux weapon selection
and compatibility test

187
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,345
has been scheduled for tomorrow.

188
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,347
If there are no issues,

189
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,717
just sign those documents
and we're good to go.

190
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,686
Oh, that's why you're here.

191
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,222
If the Student Council president
is delivering documents
in person,

192
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,224
she must have
a lot of time on her hands.

193
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:34,460
Oh, you! Since our students
are all so well behaved,

194
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,829
it makes my job much easier.

195
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,931
I've been wondering
since the duel yesterday,

196
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,433
you two wouldn't happen
to be friends, would you?

197
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,735
‐Not on your life!
‐Absolutely.

198
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:45,305
‐Uh...
‐My, my, you're so cold,
your highness.

199
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,674
[Julis] The two of us are
longtime acquaintances

200
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,276
from the Vienna
Opera House Ball, nothing more.

201
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:54,214
‐If you're finished delivering
your papers, you should go.
‐Shoo, shoo.

202
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,450
[giggles] Well, enjoy your tour.

203
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,487
Try not to worry about the fact
that tomorrow I'll have Ayato
all to myself.

204
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,356
Lucky me! You've been warned.

205
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,025
The nerve of that vixen,

206
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,394
coming in here and rubbing
her giant breasts on people.

207
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,364
Everyone knows they're nothing
but fat, she's not special.

208
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,034
‐Agreed.
‐Uh, anyway...

209
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:17,337
About that tour,
why don't you both take me, huh?

210
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,439
[both] Both of us?

211
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,941
Very well.

212
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,545
Oh, why not? It's pointless
to continue arguing.

213
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:27,313
[sighs]

214
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,455
[Julis] This is
the Club Building.

215
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,723
It's where you'll need to go

216
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,092
if you ever want
to lodge a complaint
with the media clubs.

217
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,294
That's standard procedure.

218
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,629
Oh, cool.

219
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,931
And here
is the Committee Center.

220
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,767
If you have any issues
with your benefits,

221
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,802
then this is the place
to visit.

222
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,637
Interesting.

223
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:54,040
There are seven different
dining options here on campus,

224
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,977
but this particular cafeteria
is often quite empty,

225
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,545
so I suggest eating here.

226
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,914
Really? Well,
that's good to know.

227
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:04,518
[Julis] You do realize,
Sasamiya,

228
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,754
this tour was meant to be
for Ayato, not for you?

229
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,390
Sorry.
Directions are hard for me.

230
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,728
Then it's pretty amazing
that you insisted on
giving this tour yourself.

231
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,897
‐Thank you.
‐That's not a compliment!

232
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,865
Why don't we take
a little break?

233
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,101
I'll go get us some drinks, OK?

234
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,439
‐Hey, Riessfeld.
I was wondering...
‐What is it?

235
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,442
Why did you have to show Ayato
around today?

236
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:33,246
Simply because I owed him.
Are you satisfied?

237
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,515
Owed him how?

238
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,851
Well, we were in
the middle of a duel...

239
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:42,723
Really? Are you saying you
actually got into a fight
with Ayato?

240
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:45,058
[Julis] Yes, really.
You didn't know?

241
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:49,029
‐[Saya] How did it end?
‐[Julis] We were interrupted
midway, so it was voided.

242
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,497
‐[Saya] That doesn't make sense.
‐[Julis] What doesn't?

243
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,401
If you actually dueled with him,
there's no way you'd live
to tell the tale.

244
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,440
Don't get me wrong,
you're powerful, Riessfeld.

245
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,844
But I'd say, at best,
you're at about my level,

246
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,212
and that's not good enough
to take on Ayato.

247
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,616
My, someone thinks highly
of herself.

248
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,852
Very well then,
prove it to me.

249
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,564
[Julis thinking] <i>Those arrows,</i>
<i>like the one from the duel!</i>

250
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,400
<i>Another sneak attack?</i>

251
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,002
Those cowards!

252
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,971
Burst into bloom!

253
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,405
Longiflorum!

254
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,979
Boom.

255
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,953
[Julis] What in the world
is that?

256
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,924
Oh, this is a type 38
Lux grenade launcher
called the Hernekraume.

257
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:54,595
[Julis] What? Are you serious?

258
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,329
[Saya] Burst.

259
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,600
Kapow.

260
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,136
[Julis groans]

261
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,977
[Julis] Guess you're more
formidable in battle
than you look.

262
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:14,848
Yeah, well, right back at ya.
Let's fight. Ready?

263
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:17,483
Uh... no.

264
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,052
Let's not. Call it a draw?

265
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:22,022
Yeah, that's fine.

266
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:25,626
[Ayato] Hey, what's all this?
What happened here?

267
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:30,597
‐Whoa!
‐It's all right,
there's no need to panic.

268
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,534
[Julis gasps]

269
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,238
[Julis] Hey!
Now, don't you dare look!

270
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,140
You better close your eyes,
or else!

271
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,275
OK, they're closed,
they're closed!

272
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,477
We're all wet.
And see‐through.

273
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:49,950
Sasamiya, cover yourself up!
Have you nothing on under there?

274
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,317
Tragic, isn't it?

275
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,387
I don't have anything
to hold up yet.

276
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,791
[Claudia] Heard you had quite
a time of it yesterday.

277
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,392
[Ayato] Yeah,
you could say that.

278
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,194
Think they'll catch
the suspect?

279
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,731
[sighs] Honestly,
I can't promise anything.

280
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,934
The Disciplinary Committee
has been investigating,

281
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,003
but the suspect
is nowhere to be found.

282
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,606
And they have no leads.

283
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:13,740
Disciplinary Committee?

284
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,977
But the incident yesterday
was obviously a crime.

285
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,278
Are there police?

286
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,781
Yes, Asterisk does have
its own police force,

287
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:25,318
though I'm afraid its
jurisdiction doesn't extend
to the school grounds.

288
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,022
[Claudia sighs]

289
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,391
If only Julis were
a bit more cooperative,

290
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,960
there'd be measures
we could take to help.

291
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,461
I know what you mean.

292
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,564
She kept saying there was
no need for an investigation

293
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,733
and that she didn't want
any bodyguards.

294
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:45,639
I think it's everything she can
do to protect what she has now,
so she has to hold on tight.

295
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,642
If she tries to let go
to reach for something new,

296
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:51,812
everything could slip
through her fingers.

297
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:54,515
What does she mean
by "everything"?

298
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,783
‐[bell dings]
‐[Claudia] Here we are.

299
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,385
[Claudia]
Oh, you're here already.

300
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:06,092
Ayato, please allow me
to introduce another
of our Ogre Lux applicants.

301
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,328
You! What do you think
you're doing here?!

302
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:13,266
I'm sorry, I see you two
have already met.

303
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,105
[Ayato] So how does this work,

[Claudia] It's quite simple.

305
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,208
We measure your compatibility

306
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,344
with the particular Lux
you're requesting,

307
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,180
and if it's over 80%, then
you're clear to check it out.

Oh my, Mr. MacPhail has chosen
the Ser Versta, too.

have to commend him

but from the looks of things,

00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:04,978
it will take
more than sheer force
to persuade the Ser Versta.
