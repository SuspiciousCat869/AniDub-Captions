00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:11,211
Hey, everybody, my name's Flora.
I'm from Lieseltania!

00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,214
Hi there.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

3
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,217
[Ayato, Saya and Kirin] Ahh!

4
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,120
Honestly, Flora, you should
have at least let me know

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,022
that you were planning
on coming out here.

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,758
[giggles]
But that's not my fault.

7
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,793
His Majesty said
if I kept quiet,

8
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,663
I could get some tickets
to the Phoenix Festa matches.

9
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:32,498
It sounds like he's
as mischievous as ever.

10
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:36,169
Bet my older brother also put
you up to wearing this outfit.

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,338
Yes. He said if I did,

12
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,340
you'd be able to spot me
right away.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,308
[Julis] He's really
unbelievable.

14
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:45,378
It's fine. This is what
I normally have on.

15
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,213
But why would you wear
a maid's uniform?

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:51,918
Back home, Flora's been working
as one of our maids‐in‐waiting
around the palace.

17
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,855
Well, actually, she's still
going through training
right now.

[Kirin] I would have never even
guessed that.

22
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,220
This entire time,
the reason you've been fighting

23
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,389
was to help save
an orphanage?

24
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,725
Uh, I really don't think
it's a big deal.

25
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,928
‐So, Flora, I wanted
to ask you something.
‐Yes.

26
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:45,131
What was Julis like when
she was back in Lieseltania?

27
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,267
Where'd that come from
all of a sudden?

28
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,603
Oh, I don't know.
Just wondering.

29
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:53,507
Hmm. Let me see.
What was she like?

30
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,376
She's pretty much the same
as she was then.

31
00:02:56,376 --> 00:03:00,514
She was always so kind
and made us feel special.

32
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,450
Then, at the palace,
she was regal and cool.

33
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,820
So she hasn't changed at all.

[giggles]

35
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,661
Now then,
take a look at this!

36
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,363
Here are some of my memories
with her highness.

37
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,066
[Kirin] Wow!
Just look at all of these.

38
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:24,638
[Julis] A nun at the orphanage
said pictures were the best way
to preserve old memories.

39
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,640
And thanks to her,
all the kids there

40
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,476
started getting in the habit
of taking them, too.

41
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,479
Hey, Flora, what's this?

42
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,848
[Flora] Oh, that's when we went
to the bath

43
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,651
and her highness said
she'd help me wash my hair.

44
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,252
Ugggh!

45
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:44,324
There. Did you see that?
You saw it, didn't you?!

46
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,159
No, I didn't see anything!

47
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,162
Now, look, Flora,
I have told you repeatedly

48
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,797
that I want that photo deleted.

49
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,965
Oh, sorry.

50
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,769
That's one of my favorite
pictures of you, your highness.

51
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,939
Julis must be somebody who's
really special to you,
isn't she?

52
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,208
Yes! Her highness is
the best role model ever.

53
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,046
And hopefully I can come here
and be a student myself someday.

54
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,849
That way, I'll be able to help
everybody at the orphanage

55
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,050
like she did.

56
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,785
[Ayato] Sounds awesome, Flora.

57
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:15,188
We've already talked about
this before; there's no need
for you to do that.

58
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,792
But I know if I try,
I can make a difference
in their lives, too.

59
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,596
You're a child, Flora.
Don't worry about those things.
You should‐‐

60
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,998
I heard that the Student Council
president at Jie Long

61
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,200
is even younger
than I am now!

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,703
If she can do it,
then why can't I?

63
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:34,074
It'll be at least two years
before you're even old enough
to enroll at this academy.

64
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:39,613
And by that time,
I will have helped everybody
at the orphanage already.

65
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,448
I told you last time,
don't you remember?

66
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,685
I'm going to save each of you,
no matter what,

67
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,687
and change that country myself.

68
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,690
In order to do that, I'm going
to win every single Festa.

69
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,093
Or are you starting to doubt
I can deliver on my promises?

70
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,261
No, never in a million years.

71
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,963
Now, that's better.

72
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,334
That's our Riessfeld, all right.
Your goals are epic as usual.

73
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,570
But I'm afraid
you're out of luck,

74
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,373
because my teammate and I are
gonna take the Phoenix Festa.

‐Aren't we, Kirin?
‐Huh?

76
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,377
Oh, that's right, Saya.

77
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,446
And I'm never going
to back down,

78
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,381
cos I'm not giving up
on my wish.

79

Ahh! I see Lady Sasamiya
and Lady Toudou

80
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,554
must be her highness's rivals.

00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,463
[Irene] <i>Well, you know, for</i>
<i>that whole Gravi‐Sheath thing.</i>

149
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,800
<i>Listen, I don't want</i>
<i>to admit it,</i>

150
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,101
<i>and, frankly,</i>
<i>since you busted it,</i>

151
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,069
<i>I'm barely even scraping by</i>
<i>these days.</i>

152
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,238
<i>In fact, the whole thing's</i>
<i>driving me crazy.</i>

153
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,509
<i>But if it weren't for you,</i>
<i>I wouldn't be here.</i>

154
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,911
Oh, really?
That's what this is about?

155
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:34,848
<i>You saved me.</i>
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

156
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,388
[Ayato thinking]
<i>The ball's in his court now.</i>

157
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,558
<i>So all I can do is wait.</i>

158
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,930
<i>Haruka.</i>

159
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,170
I'm back, Ayato!

160
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,575
Ah, man, feels like I haven't
been here in forever.

161
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,010
Hey, Yabuki.

162
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,879
Oh, my bad.
Did I wake you up, man?

163
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,414
Oh, no, that's OK.
So how have you been, anyway?

164
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,950
Long time, no see.

165
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,486
[Eishirou]
Well, the Phoenix Festa is
a profitable time for me.

166
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,956
Oh, by the way,
I saw your match yesterday.

167
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,291
Looks like you're in
the quarterfinals now, huh?

168
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,359
Congratulations.

169
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,362
Well, thanks, though we almost
lost that last one.

170
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,566
[Eishirou] Come on,
the important thing is
you guys won either way.

171
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,167
It's all good, bro.

172
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,370
Ahh!

173
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,905
So you're probably gonna go up

174
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,740
against the Jie Long twins next,
aren't ya?

175
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,809
Those two really seem
like a handful.

176
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:39,112
Seriously, their personalities
alone couldn't be worse.

177
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,081
Yeah, I know.

178
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,883
I've looked over
their match data,

179
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,217
and from what I can tell,

180
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,087
those are some fighters who can
hit you where it hurts.

181
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:52,192
Oh, yeah, because nobody's taken
advantage of Star Senjutsu
like they have.

182
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,361
I bet most of their opponents
have ended up begging
for mercy.

183
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,731
What do you mean
by "Star Senjutsu"?

184
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,199
Wait, that's right.

185
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,467
You haven't had to go up against
a Taoist yet.

186
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,703
Here.

187
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,170
The short answer is,

188
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,841
Star Senjutsu takes the power
of a Strega or a Dante

189
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,443
and focuses on generalizing it
as a technique.

190
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,680
Stregas and Dantes each have
their own distinctive powers,

191
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,117
but they lack stability,
making it a lot easier
to launch a counterattack.

192
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,552
Huh?

193
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:22,188
[Eishirou]
Fully trained Taoists aren't
vulnerable to things like that.

194
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,357
Hey, thanks. Good to know.

195
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,360
‐[monitor beeps]
‐Huh?

196
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,029
<i>Ayato, I see you're awake.</i>

197
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,864
[Ayato] Yeah. So, what's up?

198
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,999
<i>Um, nothing, um...</i>

199
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,068
<i>I'm actually calling you</i>
<i>about Flora.</i>

200
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,970
<i>She wants to take you</i>
<i>out to lunch.</i>

201
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,072
<i>Apparently, she has</i>
<i>some questions to ask you.</i>

202
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,273
Seriously?

203
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,276
<i>Now, this is only if you</i>
<i>wouldn't mind going, of course.</i>

204
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,411
No. It's totally fine with me.

205
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,948
<i>Really? Then do you think</i>
<i>you could meet us</i>

206
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,482
<i>in the business district?</i>

207
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,618
<i>The thing is,</i>
<i>it's really crowded</i>

208
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,253
<i>around Main Street</i>
<i>right now.</i>

209
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,089
<i>So I think it might be better</i>
<i>to try somewhere else.</i>

210
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,125
So, you guys looking
for a place to eat?

211
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,928
That's cool. I'd be happy
to recommend one for you.

212
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,730
This is a date, right?

213
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,633
<i>D‐D‐Date?</i>
<i>Not even close, moron!</i>

214
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,769
‐Flora wanted to see him!
‐Okay, then.

215
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,038
‐This has nothing to do
with Ayato and me whatsoever!
‐See? Here it is.

216
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,908
[Eishirou] Not too many
tourists, good food.

217
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,209
Nice atmosphere.
Cool place.

218
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,379
[Ayato] Oh, wow, I gotta admit,
I'm pretty impressed.

219
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,982
What do you think, Julis?
You wanna give it a try?

220
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,450
<i>Uh, I, uh... I guess so.</i>

221
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,788
<i>Though I am annoyed that it was</i>
<i>Yabuki who made the suggestion.</i>

222
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,790
[Ayato] All right.
Sounds like it's settled.

223
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,658
Wanna meet up in, say,
two hours?

224
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,059
<i>Fine.</i>

225
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,830
Hey, thanks again.
I owe you one.

226
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,799
Come on, it was
the least I could do.

227
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,801
Besides, having you owe me one

228
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,169
could come in pretty handy
someday, you know.

229
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,272
[Ayato] Just hope it won't cost
too much when the time comes.

230
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,823
[Flora sighs]

231
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,125
That was so delicious, guys!

232
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,929
Just look at you, Flora.
There's ketchup
all over your face.

233
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,564
All right, I think I got it.

234
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,098
[Flora] Thank you,
your highness.

235
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,368
Well, it seems the food
and the atmosphere
really are good here.

236
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,104
As much as I hate to admit it,
guess Yabuki was right.

237
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,907
You should tell him yourself.
It would make his day.

238
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,609
I'll do no such thing.

239
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,645
Cos that guy has managed
to irritate me

240
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:26,780
more times than I even
care to count.

241
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,215
He's got a long way to go
before we talk.

242
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:33,319
So, what were
some of those questions
you wanted to ask me, Flora?

243
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,791
Oh, right!
Hold on just a second, please.

244
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,961
Uh... now, let's see.

245
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,864
‐Huh?
‐[waitress] Thanks so much
for waiting.

246
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,231
[kids] Awesome! Wow!

247
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,068
[waitress] Here's
your jumbo parfait!

248
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:53,339
What is it? You want one
of those, too, Flora?

249
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,210
Yes.

250
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,413
[waitress] Here's your
jumbo parfait!

251
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,049
[Flora] Whoa!

252
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,055
‐Why are you staring at me?
‐Huh? Oh, uh...

253
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,058
I'm just surprised at what
a softie you are around kids.

254
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,628
Well, I can't help it.

255
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,765
After all, kids like her don't
get a chance to be spoiled
too often.

256
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:22,669
And besides, at the orphanage,
treats like this
are a pretty rare thing.

257
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,971
Once in a while
shouldn't hurt, right?

258
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,439
Oh, but do you know what?

259
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,875
Since you've been sending
some money back home for us,

260
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,977
things have gotten
a lot easier lately.

261
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,013
Even the sisters said so.

262
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,081
Wow! You send money home, huh?

263
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,250
It's really no big deal, OK?

264
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,352
I just give them
my Page One bonus money.

265
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,956
And it's not like there's
something here I really need
to spend it on.

266
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,691
[Flora] Your highness,
your highness!

267
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,959
Yes?

268
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,662
Now open up and say "Ahh."
Ready?

269
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,064
Ahh.

270
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,002
No wonder you wanted this.
It is pretty tasty.

271
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,839
See? It's the most
amazing thing ever.

272
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,473
Oh, right.

273
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,476
Would you like to taste
my parfait, Mr. Amagiri?

274
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:07,247
‐[Julis] Huh?
‐What? You mean I can
have some, too?

275
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,414
Course you can.

276
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,050
At the orphanage,
the nuns and her highness

277
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,853
always taught us that food
tastes even better

278
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,855
when you can share it
with friends.

279
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,156
Right, your highness?

280
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,059
Well, yes, of course,
that's true, but...

281
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,527
but that sp‐spoon
was just...

282
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,495
Well, what I mean is,
I, uh...

283
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,231
Say "Ahh," Mr. Amagiri. Ahh!

284
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,834
Ahh...

285
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,703
Whoa! This is great!

286
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,972
You guys weren't kidding,
were you?

287
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,708
‐Nope.
‐[Ayato] Thanks for letting me
try it, Flora.

288
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,543
[Flora] Aww! [giggles]

289
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,946
[Ayato] Hey, uh, Julis,
is something wrong?

290
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,848
What do you mean?
I'm perfectly fine.

291
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:45,652
Now, anyway, Flora,
what about those questions
you wanted to ask?

292
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,387
It's time to get them
over with.

293
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,955
OK.

294
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,256
[Julis sighs]

295
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,926
All right, finally getting down
to business.

296
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,961
Um, where is it?
Where is it?

297
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,263
Oh, great! I found it!

298
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,166
OK. Here's my first question.

299
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,236
Um, I'm sure you two are growing
closer every day,

300
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,673
so how far has your relationship
with her highness gotten?

301
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,341
‐Huh?
‐[Julis] Wait a minute!

302
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,277
[Julis] What kind of question
is that, anyway?

303
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:17,718
You didn't honestly think that
one up by yourself, did you?

304
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:21,487
Nope. His Majesty told me
he wanted me to learn more

305
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,891
about the boy who might become
a future member of the family.

306
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:28,529
Uhhh! Curse you, brother,
enough of this!

307
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,563
Hmm?

308
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:32,098
‐You won't be needing that!
‐[Kirin] Aaaah!

309
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,200
[Kirin] Hold on!
He's counting on me.

310
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,437
Please put it down!
I don't wanna go back
empty handed.

311
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,772
You'll be fine.

312
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,974
[Korona] Excuse me.

313
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,844
I hope I'm not intruding, but...

314
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:46,346
could I talk to you
for a minute?

315
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,347
Hello, uh.

316
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:50,250
Your name's Ayato Amagiri,
isn't that right?

317
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,353
‐It is, but...
‐I hate to bother you like this,

318
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,122
but I was wondering
if you could come with me.

319
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,960
Oh, that's right. So sorry.
I haven't introduced myself yet.

320
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,964
I serve as secretary
to the Student Council president
at ReWolf.

321
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,431
My name is Korona Kashimaru.

322
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:10,336
And actually he's outside now,
wanting to speak with you.

323
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,238
You've gotta be kidding me.

324
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:15,308
What in the world could
the tyrant possibly want
with Ayato?

325
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,878
‐[Korona squeals]
‐Hey, it's OK, Julis.

326
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,546
Actually, I asked
for this meeting.

327
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,682
[Julis] Why would you do
something like that?

328
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:23,584
I can explain later.

329
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:26,052
Everyone just wait here, OK?

330
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,889
Oh, no, if you're doing this,
I'll go, too.

331
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,957
I mean, we are partners,
aren't we?

332
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:34,394
What? But he only wishes
to see Mr. Amagiri.

333
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:38,231
I'm going,
got a problem with that?

334
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,534
[Dirk] <i>Fine.</i>
<i>Bring them over, Korona.</i>

335
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,804
<i>After all, it will give me</i>
<i>a chance to finally see</i>

336
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:45,906
<i>the Glühen Rose in person.</i>

337
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,208
Of course.
Then, I'll bring them both, sir.

338
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,245
Hey, Flora, I'm sorry,
but I have to do this.

339
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,548
You can get to the hotel
on your own, right?

340
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:57,518
Sure! I'll be just fine.

341
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,126
‐[Korona] This way, please.
‐[door opens]

342
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,397
Now, get in.

343
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:17,137
So, you're Murakumo, huh?

344
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:20,006
Huh. You don't look
so impressive to me.

345
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,375
If someone like you
is ranked number one,

346
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,711
Seidoukan must be
nothing special.

347
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,447
I wonder who could have possibly
given the order

348
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,850
to destroy
such an unimpressive opponent.

349
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,117
Strange, isn't it?

350
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,119
[Dirk] Don't know what
you're talking about.

351
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,621
You're a lying bastard!

352
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:38,024
Irene Urzaiz already told us
all about it.

353
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,026
‐Give it up, now!
‐Look, it's no use.

354
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:44,130
Only reason she told us that is
cos she felt like she had to.

355
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,132
‐We don't have any proof.
‐Come on!

356
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:50,571
Besides, if we don't drop it,
we might make trouble for her
in the long run.

357
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:56,610
Ahh. I see your wits are
reasonably quick at least.

358
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,113
Well, none of that has anything
to do with what I'm needing
to ask you.

359
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,282
[Dirk] Oh, yeah, that's right.

360
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,018
But let me warn you
before we start.

361
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:08,589
Just cos you ask a question
doesn't mean I have to answer.

362
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,457
So just be sure
to keep that in mind.

363
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,028
Fine then, but if that's
the case, why are you here?

364
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,362
I don't know.

365
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,799
Let's call it a whim
and leave it at that.

366
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,802
With all you've got going on
as Student Council president,

367
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:23,303
you're meeting me on a whim?

368
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,905
I kind of doubt it.

369
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:26,339
[Dirk groans]

370
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,741
[Ayato] We're sitting
in this car

371
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:31,344
because you want something
from me, too, don't you?

372
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,446
You catch on fast, huh?

373
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,348
To get something,
you have to give.

374
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,683
Without some kind of exchange,

375
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,052
there's just no way
a deal can be made.

376
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:42,222
All right, fine, guess you pass.

377
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,990
What is it you want?

378
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,260
OK. My sister is missing.

379
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,362
Tell me what you know
about Haruka.

380
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:53,667
[Dirk] The truth is, I'm not
gonna be able to give you much.

381
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,703
I've only ever seen her
once before.

382
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,104
[Ayato] Where was that?

383
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,973
Eclipse.

384
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,241
[Julis grunts]

385
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,176
Hold on, you've heard
of it, Julis?

386
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,745
Well... yes.

387
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:07,514
The Eclipse Festa was created
by scumbags

388
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,316
who weren't satisfied
with the other games

389
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,585
and wanted something
more violent,

390
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,920
illegal tournaments
with no rules.

391
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,321
Unbelievable.

392
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,558
The matches were decided
when one of the players

393
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:21,327
would either lose consciousness
or worse.

394
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,897
Sometimes they died, too.

395
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:29,335
Apparently it had a strong
following among some wealthy
patrons and managed to thrive,

396
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,804
but that was years ago.

397
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:34,741
Yeah. Eventually they put an end
to the Eclipse Festa,

398
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:39,012
because the captain of the guard
just couldn't stand it anymore.

399
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,781
When I saw Haruka Amagiri,

400
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,783
it was as a contestant
in one of the matches.

401
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:46,787
Wait a minute, are you saying
she took part in it?

402
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:50,891
[Dirk] Yeah. I remember it well
cos she was using

403
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:52,626
that damn Ser Versta.

404
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,228
[Ayato] So, uh...
how did the match end?

405
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,598
[Dirk] She was defeated
by her opponent.

406
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,365
[Ayato gasps]

407
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,835
Hey, Ayato, are you all right?

408
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,537
Uh... yeah.

409
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,738
I'm fine.

410
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:08,308
[Dirk] Well, I heard
she didn't die that day.

411
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:11,377
Not that I know what became
of her afterward,

412
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:15,616
but that was the first
and last time I ever saw her.

413
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:18,418
Oh. I see.

414
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,954
[Dirk] I held up my end
of the bargain.

415
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,723
Now, it's your turn.

416
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:26,727
Tell me, what does the name
Madiath Mesa mean to you?

417
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:28,061
Huh?

418
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,429
[Ayato thinking] <i>Madiath Mesa?</i>

419
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,865
<i>Chairman of the Festa</i>
<i>Steering Committee?</i>

420
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,068
Hmm.

421
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,537
Fair enough.

422
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:38,171
Doesn't seem like
you're playing dumb,

423
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,973
so you can just forget it.

424
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:42,543
Right here. [snaps fingers]

425
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,782
Now get out of my sight.
We're done.

426
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,885
Hold it. There's just one thing
I can't figure out.

427
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:55,255
How did you find us?
Cos you knew exactly
where we were.

428
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,723
[Dirk] Huh?

429
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,424
We only decided to go
to that restaurant

430
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,060
a couple of hours
before we left.

431
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,462
I mean, I could understand
if we'd made a reservation,

432
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,231
but how did you track us
with such short notice?

433
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,833
Idiot.

434
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,403
What the hell makes you
think I have to give you
an answer to that?

435
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,951
[Korona]
Uh, come to think of it,

436
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,954
when I went
to pick up Mr. Amagiri
and Ms. Riessfeld before,

437
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:31,357
there was an adorable
little girl who was sitting
at the table with them.

438
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:34,327
Seriously, she looked
like a doll.

439
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,563
I wonder who she was, anyway.

440
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,198
Wait, what did you say?

441
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:41,568
[Korona] I didn't see her listed
in any of the data you gave me,

442
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:43,904
but she seemed pretty tiny.

443
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,740
And I don't remember seeing
a school emblem anywhere,

444
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,743
so I doubt if she's
a student at Asterisk.

445
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,077
[Dirk] Hmm.

446
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,445
One more thing.

447
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,881
That girl was even wearing
a little maid's uniform.

448
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,317
I couldn't believe
she really had one on!

449
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:01,054
But I have to admit,
she looked so cute!

450
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:03,056
