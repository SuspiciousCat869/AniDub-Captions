somewhere before?

Hmm. I'm pretty sure
this is the first time.

[Ayato] What do you mean?

[Sylvia] As you know, there's
a Festa going on right now,

39
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:24,510
so the police have been
cracking down a lot more
than usual.

to figure out my identity
like that?

Aside from the fact
that you're a celebrity,

you should probably put
more effort into that disguise.

You're really willing
to do that?

[Sylvia] Of course,
but before we get started,

114
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:52,184
let's go somewhere more private.

to figure you out.

[Ayato] What do you mean?

123
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:18,077
You're the type who always
puts others first,

124
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:21,080
even if it means putting
yourself in harm's way.

125
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,650
Also, you take all
the responsibility on yourself

126
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,253
and can't seem to rely
on others.

during yesterday's semifinals,

128
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:32,358

who you're looking for.
What are they like?

00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:48,574
I, uh...

134
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:52,278
Don't worry. It's not like
I'm planning to tag along.

135
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:58,650
The thing is, you just need
the location of the person that
you're searching for, right?

a detection‐type Strega?

138
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:09,628
[Sylvia] I wouldn't
call myself that, but...

139
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:13,299
well, I guess I can do
something pretty similar.

140
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:16,335
Anyway, I need some information
to visualize her.

141
00:08:16,335 --> 00:08:19,838
All right, then, I happen to be
looking for a little girl.

142
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:22,408
She's just 10 years old.
Her name is Flora.

143
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:23,910
She isn't lost, is she?

144
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,711
Well, no. She's been kidnapped.

145
00:08:25,711 --> 00:08:29,115
And I'm not sure
who's behind it,
but I have my suspicions.

146
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:34,286
[Sylvia] OK, let's just move on.
What can you tell me about
her looks and personality?

147
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:37,589
Uh, let's see. Will this do?

148
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:42,761
It should.
I think we can start now.

149
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:46,532
But first, there's something
I want you to promise me
before we do this, OK?

150
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:48,134
No problem.

151
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:52,704
You can't tell anybody about
what you're going to see here.
Keep it between us.

152
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:54,673
I promise, I won't tell a soul.

153
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:57,443
All right, let's get started
by opening up a map,

and for this,
the bigger the map, the better.

It looks like she's being held

I'll find Flora?
‐That's right.

No, you've done way more

[giggles] Not bad.

‐Yeah, sure.

To be honest, I've been
interested in meeting you

220
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,745
<i>It would be pretty reckless</i>

221
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:56,415
<i>Right now you both need</i>

<i>If we're successful</i>

<i>Yeah, if you can rescue her</i>

[Number Seven] All clear.
And the others?

[Dirk] <i>They seem to be</i>
<i>cooperating.</i>

<i>There's no movement</i>
<i>from Shadow Star, either.</i>

244
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:55,141
However, there was
an incident with a couple
of suspicious‐looking punks

245
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,109
who were casing
the joint earlier.

And, as you've probably
realized by now,

247
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:02,214
there's no love lost
between Rotlicht and me,

248
00:14:02,214 --> 00:14:04,350
so that intel may
have been falsified.

crashes the party?

those unexpected guests
have arrived.

255
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:23,936
[Eishirou] This building used
to be a fairly well‐known casino
back in the day,

256
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:27,339
but one of its customers went
berserk and trashed the place,

257
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,840
or so I hear.

258
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,442
That sounds kind of scary.

259
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:32,644
Well, it's actually
not that uncommon.

260
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:36,983
But I was told that they stopped
construction a few days ago.

261
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:38,250
Are you sure about that?

262
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,352
So it's basically like
a vacant house now?

263
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:42,754
Pretty sketchy, huh?

264
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:46,358
OK, now, how about we go inside
and check it out?

265
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:48,928
Sure, but how are we
going to get inside?

266
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:51,931
[Eishirou] Just stand back
and leave it to the master.

267
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:54,733
Be sure to keep
an eye out for me, will ya?

268
00:14:58,604 --> 00:15:01,607
[humming]

269
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:04,243
Nice!

270
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:06,245
Now, that is what
I'm talkin' about.

271
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:09,015
We can go ahead and...

272
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:11,583
[both murmuring doubtfully]

273
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,652
[Eishirou] Ah, come on,
what's with those looks?

274
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:15,721
I only unlocked the door.

275
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:17,789
I just used some tools
I found online.

276
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:20,059
It's not like I do this
on the regular.

277
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,361
You're too good at that.

278
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:23,562
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

279
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:25,965
OK, let's get going, already.

280
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:32,939
It looks like it's been
deserted for a while.

281
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:37,109
[Saya] Upstairs or down?

282
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:41,547
[Kirin] Either way,
we should probably try
to stick together, right?

283
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:43,582
[Eishirou] I completely agree
with that.

284
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:45,351
I'm not much
of a fighter, you know.

285
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:49,155
So shouldn't you be saying,
"Let your knight
in shining armor handle this"?

286
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:50,856
This isn't the Middle Ages,
anymore.

287
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:54,460
Besides, it's not like
I haven't already done
my due diligence here.

288
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,861
[Saya] Seriously?

289
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,863
I mean, look,
I may not be that useful,

290
00:15:57,863 --> 00:16:00,732
but I can call on somebody
who would be.

291
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:03,835
‐[gasp]
‐[Eishirou] What the hell
is that?

292
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:06,572
I don't know.
Is it even human?

293
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:08,774
There's a lot of Mana
in that area.

294
00:16:08,774 --> 00:16:11,277
Whatever it is,
it's using a Setting skill.

295
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:12,878
[Eishirou] I guess
that settles it.

296
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:15,847
There's no doubt, we're
definitely in the right place.

297
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:22,989
What?! Guess it wasn't
as strong as it looked.

298
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:25,491
I bet even I could handle
one of those.

299
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:35,401
[Kirin] Oh, wow!
How many are there?

300
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:37,136
[Saya] No clue.

301
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:41,573
[firing]

302
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:48,814
Hey, hold up, this is
an autonomous‐type power.

303
00:16:48,814 --> 00:16:52,884
These guys can only execute
simple commands
for the most part.

304
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:55,988
They must have been ordered
to get rid of any intruders.

305
00:16:55,988 --> 00:16:59,926
If that's the case, then we
should get this over with
as quickly as possible.

306
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:00,960
Kirin!

307
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,063
‐[Kirin] Over here.
‐[Saya] Can you cover me?

308
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:06,098
[Kirin] On my way!

309
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:09,168
My leg!

310
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:16,142
[Saya] Thirty‐nine‐type
Lux Ray Gun, Wolfdora.

311
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:18,844
Burst!

312
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:21,447
Strafe.

313
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:23,215
[boom!]

314
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,256
[Kirin] Great job!
Are you all right?

315
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:31,723
[Saya] I'm OK.

316
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:36,562
I have two,
maybe three shots left.

317
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:40,132
Hey, you two, this isn't
the time to let our guards down!

318
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:44,436
[Kirin] What? Again?

319
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:46,538
If this keeps happening,
it could be endless.

320
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:50,409
Kirin, this might sound
a little crazy, but we're
gonna charge in.

321
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:53,045
Right. We may have
no other choice.

322
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:58,184
[Lester grunts]

323
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:02,654
[scoffs] Come on.

324
00:18:02,654 --> 00:18:04,756
What in the hell are you doing?

325
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:07,159
Ha ha! You finally made it!

326
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:10,162
‐What's Lester doing here?
‐Yeah, why are you here?

327
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:13,065
Well, I wouldn't be if it wasn't
for that damn Yabuki.

328
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:16,102
Don't blame me when all I did
was ask you for a favor.

329
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:19,371
I mean, it's not like I
forced you to come help us
or anything.

330
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:20,906
No, you blackmailed me.

331
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:23,575
Is that any way to ask someone
for a favor?

332
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:25,544
It's more of a threat
than anything.

333
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:28,514
Right, we'll head out.
You take it from here.

334
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:31,183
Hold on, what did you say?

335
00:18:31,183 --> 00:18:32,751
Uh, sorry about this,

336
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:34,886
but we're counting on you
to handle it.

337
00:18:34,886 --> 00:18:37,789
‐Hey, where are you‐‐
‐That's my cue.
Best of luck, man.

338
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,125
You guys just wait up?

339
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,528
So, what do you think,
upstairs or down?

340
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:44,130
Which one sounds best to you?

341
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,497
Down.

342
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:47,066
Me too.

343
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:52,704
[Lester] I heard all about
what's going down here,

344
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:54,773
but I still don't understand.

345
00:18:57,176 --> 00:19:01,380
Why the hell do I have to be
involved in something that has
nothing to do with me?

346
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,982
Damn it, Yabuki!

347
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,718
[crowd cheers]

348
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:12,758
It's almost time.

349
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:14,860
[Julis] Let's do this.

350
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:24,270
Saya and Kirin must not
have found anything.

351
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,605
Julis.

352
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:30,342
Now, don't give me that look,
Ayato.

353
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:32,344
Come on, let's go.

354
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:36,148
I've been thinking.

355
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:40,019
It's really nice to have friends
that you can actually trust,
isn't it?

356
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,155
‐[Ayato] Huh?
‐The thing about me is that...

357
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:47,126
not just Flora,
but everyone back home matters
more than anything to me.

358
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:50,930
That's why I swore I'd do
whatever I could to help them.

359
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,966
And I always figured they were
all I'd ever need.

360
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:57,736
But now that I've thought
about it a little more,

361
00:19:57,736 --> 00:20:00,839
I realize I was closing
myself off from the world.

362
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,444
Truth is, it's because
you're my, uh...

363
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:07,679
because you're my partner,

364
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,016
and it really hit home.

365
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:11,283
[Ayato] Julis.

366
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:14,820
Now I see I'm not alone
and that I'll keep on
making friends

367
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,390
that I can treasure,
like Saya and Kirin.

368
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,359
You know?

369
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:24,663
More than ever,
I believe I can wholeheartedly
put my faith in them.

370
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:27,266
So don't worry about me.

371
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:29,335
My focus is on this fight.

372
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:31,237
All right, then.

373
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:34,706
That sounds good to me.

374
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,877

[Tram] <i>I'm so excited,</i>
<i>I can't wait.</i>

383
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:05,938
[Julis] Hard to believe, but...

384
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:07,406
despite everything
that's happening,

385
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:11,777
I want to win this match
almost more than anything else.

386
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:14,580
‐[Ayato] Yeah. Same here.
‐[Julis] Good.

387
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,517
Then it's time to show them
that we're in this together
until the very end.

388
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:21,587
We'll make those damn puppets
wish they never even
made it this far.

389
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:26,358
Mm‐hmm. And then we'll take
our heart's desires
when we triumph.

390
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:29,561
[Aldy laughs]

391
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:33,599
[Aldy] I've been waiting
a long time for this,
Ayato Amagiri.

392
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,204
I assure you, you have no clue
how much I've been looking
forward to this day.

393
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:42,808
I've heard astounding things
about you from my master

394
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:46,478
and have high expectations
for this battle to be quite
the challenge.

395
00:21:46,478 --> 00:21:50,449
Kirin Toudou left an impression
and I was inspired.

396
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:52,018
Can you do the same?

397
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:55,221
Show me you're a true warrior!

398
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:59,691
Unfortunately, that's not
something I can guarantee.

399
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:03,295
But just know this.

400
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,297
We will be victorious.

401
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:07,533
That's a promise!

402
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:11,303
