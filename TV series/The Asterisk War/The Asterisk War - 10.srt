[Meeko] <i>Was that unexpected</i>

<i>The winner has been decided</i>
<i>in less than a minute!</i>

00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,547
<i>With a fearsome display</i>
<i>of power,</i>

5
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,315
<i>Aldy and Rimsy</i>
<i>have shown everyone</i>

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,417
<i>that they're a force</i>
<i>to be reckoned with.</i>

7
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,020
Those guys never stood
a chance, did they?

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,824
[Saya] Unless we get past that,
neither will we.

9
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:28,895
[Julis] Getting through
that wall of light will
take everything we've got.

‐[monitor rings]
‐[Saya] Huh?

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,999
Just a sec.

12
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,601
[Souichi] <i>Did you</i>
<i>see that match just now?</i>

13
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:38,972
‐I did.
<i>‐Those puppets are controlling</i>
<i>over 5 Manadites concurrently.</i>

14
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,807
<i>That's far beyond</i>
<i>a human's ability.</i>

15
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:44,477
<i>But an artificial intelligence</i>
<i>could handle it, no problem.</i>

16
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,613
Dad, wait,
you're going way too fast.

17
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:50,216
Hang on a minute,
is that Uncle Souichi?

18
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,185
[Souichi]
<i>Well, if it isn't Ayato.</i>

19
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,821
‐It's been quite a while.
‐Yeah, no kidding.

20
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,757
‐So, Dad, what's up?
<i>‐Right.</i>

21
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:59,626
<i>I took the liberty</i>
<i>of sending you a new gun.</i>

22
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,195
‐Has it arrived yet?
‐No, not yet.

23
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,699
<i>Unfortunately, that means</i>
<i>it won't get there in time</i>
<i>for your first match.</i>

24
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,268
<i>Would you mind heading over</i>
<i>to Customs to double‐check?</i>

25
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,671
[Saya] OK, but it won't
be a problem.

26
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:14,975
‐[Souichi] Hmm?
‐I've got the Arcwandels
so I'll be fine, trust me.

27
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,743
<i>Of course I trust you, darling.</i>

28
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,446
<i>As long as you're</i>
<i>wielding one of my guns,</i>
<i>you're unstoppable.</i>

29
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:22,983
<i>All right, I await news</i>
<i>of your victory!</i>

30
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:25,218
He hasn't changed much, huh?

31
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,154
[Saya] Nah. I'm heading
over to Customs now.

32
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,691
Oh, if you don't mind,
I'll come with you.

33
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:34,227
As for me, I'm gonna
see if I can sneak into
the press conference.

34
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,729
Wish me luck.

35
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,334
So what should we do
in the meantime?

36
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,136
We could celebrate
our first victory,

37
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,639
but we can't afford
to just rest on our laurels.

38
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,441
So maybe we should get
some practice in?

39
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,511
Sounds good.

40
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,382
Whoo‐hoo! Nice job, you two!

41
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,352
That was a spectacular
performance!

42
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,724
[Rimsy] You are too kind,
master.

43
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:04,791
[Aldy laughs]

44
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,628
[Aldy] Honestly, were you
expecting anything less?

45
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,166
‐Ohh! Aaah!
‐[thud!]

46
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,970
[Rimsy] How dare you present
that sort of attitude
before our master!

47
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,304
Have you no shame?

48
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,041
[Aldy] Rimsy,
quit joking around.

49
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,843
It's no joke.

50
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,378
If you continue showing
our master disrespect,

51
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,447
you'll be punished
just like any other.

52
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,917
Now, Rimsy, why don't we let him
off the hook just this once?

53
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,720
If that is your wish.

54
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,357
[Aldy] Master,
I have a question.

55
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,125
Very well, speak your mind.

56
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,327
[Aldy] As far as our specs
are concerned,

57
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,296
Rimsy and I are
more or less equal,

58
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,065
so why am I helpless
against her?

59
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,133
Well, that's just
the way it is.

60
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,035
Listen, it's like
that old saying:

61
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,039
"Woman is nature's contrivance
for perpetuating
its highest achievement,

62
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,476
whereas man,
man is woman's contrivance

63
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,646
for fulfilling nature's behest
in the most economical way."

64
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,916
People had such a way with words
in the olden days.

65
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,019
[Aldy] So what you're saying is
a male type like myself

66
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,222
will never be able to defeat
a female type like Rimsy?

67
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,224
It would appear so.

68
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,094
But anyway, we should probably
start heading back to our room,
don't you think?

69
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,663
We don't want to keep
Camilla waiting.

70
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,064
[Aldy sighs]

71
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,801
[Aldy] Then that's the way
it's to be.

72
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,406
[Ernesta thinking] <i>Poor Aldy,</i>
<i>I can't tell you that Rimsy</i>
<i>is your limiter,</i>

73
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,343
<i>so for now, that explanation</i>
<i>will have to do.</i>

74
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,595
[Shiena Nishizawa singing
"Brand‐new World" in Japanese]

75
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,477
‐Hurry up!
‐Julis! Hey, hold on a minute!

76
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,715
It's not like we're gonna
make it for the start
of the match anyway.

77
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:18,284
I'll just let them know
we're running
a little bit late.

78
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,486
All right, fine.

79
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,422
Come on, don't look so sad.

80
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,925
We both wanted to practice
till the last second.

81
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,192
[Irene] Take that!

82
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,729
[Julis] What's that? A fight?

83
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:37,938
[Julis] Wait.
That's Irene Urzaiz.

84
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,506
[Ayato] You know her?

85
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,308
[Julis] She's a Page One
from ReWolf.

86
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:46,713
[Irene] Jeez. Don't you dumb
asses know settling scores
is so played out?

87
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,381
Uggh! Shut up!

88
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,785
If we don't go through
with this, we'll lose face!

89
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,720
[Irene] Hyaaah!

90
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,663
Buzz off, it's not a sideshow.
Huh?

91
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:12,038
Just as I thought.
How's it going, Murakumo?

92
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,273
Huh?

93
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,241
What exactly
would the likes of you

94
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,544
want with my partner,
Lamirexia?

95
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,813
If it isn't the Glühen Rose.

96
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,415
This doesn't concern you,
so take a hike.

97
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,750
I can't do that.

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,386
Do you realize how many people
you put in danger

99
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,821
by dueling
in the middle of a crowd?

100
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,356
They're the ones who started
that free‐for‐all,

101
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,625
so don't go blaming me.

102
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,594
Regardless,
remember where you are.

103
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,896
One wrong move
and you're disqualified.

104
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,363
Hey, take it easy.

105
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,766
Then by all means, Glühen Rose,

106
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,402
why don't you teach me
proper dueling etiquette?

107
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,470
[energy pulses]

108
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,646
[Irene] Nice.

109
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:56,983
Pretty good reaction time.

110
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,085
Enough!

111
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,486
Oh, no!

112
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,922
[Priscilla] You've gotta be
kidding me, sis.

113
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,990
You're fighting
without permission again?

114
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,661
[Irene] Priscilla.

115
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,605
Apologies. Please forgive
my sister for causing
all this trouble.

116
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,974
Oh, there's no need.

117
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,578
All right, you apologize,
too, sis.

118
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,680
You want me to say
I'm sorry. Why?

119
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,714
Because.

120
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,717
I'm so sorry
for my sister's behavior.

121
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,519
[Irene] Come on, knock it off!

122
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,523
I'll be sure to give her
an earful.

123
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:40,493
OK, then,
let's get going now, sis.

124
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,095
Fine. Let's go.

125
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,765
[Ayato] I wonder if they're
really sisters.

126
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:48,468
I think there may be an entry
in the data Claudia sent.

127
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,170
Pricilla Urzaiz.

128
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,006
She's unranked, and there isn't
a shred of data on her

129
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,475
except that she's
Irene's partner.

130
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,777
I see.

131
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,746
By the way, why did you provoke
Irene back there?

132
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,281
That's not like you at all.

133
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,583
You heard what she said.

134
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,685
Her business didn't concern me.

135
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:08,088
I find that strange considering
I called her out.

136
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:13,059
Which means, for some reason,
her target was you.

137
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,195
But I don't even know her.

138
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:19,700
Knowing ReWolf, this could all
be part of some sinister scheme.

139
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,202
I wish I had more than just
a hunch to go on.

140
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,604
[Ayato] Yeah.

141
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,739
‐Uh!
‐What's wrong?

142
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,875
Saya and Kirin's match
has already started!

143

[Nanna] <i>Holy cow, just listen</i>
<i>to that crowd roar!</i>

144

<i>And it's no wonder</i>
<i>why they're so excited.</i>

145

She might have lost
her title the other day,
but don't let that fool you.

Ms. Toudou's still
the super rookie

Number One Rank when she
was just a junior high student!

The small one with the blue hair
is Saya Sasamiya.

Huh? For real?
No way she's in senior high!

[Saya] And where the heck
is Ayato?

157
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,318
They said they were
on their way, so I'm sure
they'll show up soon.

158
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,254
But for now...

159

[Kirin] They seem
pretty competent, don't they?

Huh? Oh, uh,
I'll just take whichever.

165
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,442
Gotcha. Then I'll take
the bigger guy.

166
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,278

Hey, Saya, your gun,

190
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,831
it seems to be more than just
a hard surface from what I saw.

191
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,934
Mm‐hmm. In order to suppress
some of the excess output,

192
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:44,037
it's been modified to function
as an energy field.

193
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,106
So is that the reason
you were able to tolerate

194
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,474
all that close‐combat fighting
during our match today?

195
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,710
[Saya] Yeah.

196
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,612
[Kirin] From the way you were
handling yourself,

197
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:55,081
I would have guessed
that you were a student
of the Amagiri Shinmei style.

198
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,718
[Saya] I got most of my moves
from watching,

199
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,453
but Ayato did teach me
a few things.

200
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,455
I'm gonna head out.

201
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:12,432
Saya, wait! You'll catch
a cold if you don't
dry yourself properly!

202
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,767
Ahh.

203
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,969

[Kirin] What are you doing?

207
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,080
[Saya] Since ancient times,
it's been said that massaging

208
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,815
can increase the size
of your breasts.

209
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:32,819
[Kirin] I don't know
where you heard that,
but it couldn't be more wrong.

210
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,189
No fair.

211
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:39,593

trouble, could you wait
just a minute?

‐It took you long enough.
‐Hey!

<i>by the deadly scythe.</i>

307
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:48,034
[Lester] We're also trying
to take advantage of
that thing's tragic flaw.

308
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,770
It's an energy waster

309
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,974
They say no wielder has ever
been able to withstand
its side effects.

310
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:56,877
So, the longer we drag out
this fight,

311
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,478
the better our chances
of winning.

312
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,281
[Randy] We might as well
have some fun
while we're buying time.

313
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:04,084
So let's find out
what this girl's made of!

314
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,452
Hmm. When will you people learn,

315
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,454
this strategy isn't
gonna work on me?

316
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,802
Randy!

317
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:23,236
Ugggh!

318
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,938
Didn't you hear me before?

319
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,173
I told you
that's not gonna work!

320
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,443
Hyaaa!

321
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,648
I'll deal with you
a little later.

322
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:38,885
Get back here, damn it!

323
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,188
So, what's it gonna be?
Give up?

324
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,592
Yeah, right, keep dreamin'.

325
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,060
Feisty.

00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,706
Oh, looks like you're
as tough as I thought,

330
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,342
Raging Axe.

331
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,778
You know who
you're dealing with?!

332
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,850
Take this, you bitch!

Oh, Irene!

337
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,697
What do you think?

338
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:25,265
[Irene] Damn it.

339
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,971
That wasn't bad.

340
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:32,873
I guess I don't have
a choice, then.

341
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:36,309
Out of respect for your power,
I'll go all out.

342
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,978
[Lester] What the hell?

343
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:40,380
Are you hurt?

344
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,550
[Irene] Sorry, but I need
a little.

345
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,271
[Ayato] What's she doing?

346
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,740
[Julis] Unless I'm mistaken,

347
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,275
that kid sister of hers
must be a regenerative.

348
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,877
[Ayato] Hold on, a regenerative?

349
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,079
You don't mean she can use
her powers to heal wounds,
do you?

350
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,717
[Julis] Yes.
And if she's capable
of replenishing lost blood,

351
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,852
she's even more elite
than I thought.

352
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,454
That's an insane trump card.

353
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:25,526
My Gravi‐Sheath.

354
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,327
In return for its powers,

355
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,229
it yearns for the taste
of blood.

356
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:33,834
If you don't keep feeding it,
this baby gets all dried up
before you know it.

357
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,937
So to keep the blood coming,
it alters its wielder's body

358
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:40,240
and allows said body
to absorb more blood.

359
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,610
So you really are
a vampire, aren't you, lady?

360
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,379
‐Arrrggh!
‐Good. Bring it.

361
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,949
Cos now we're playing
for keeps!

362
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:58,424
Go!

363
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,664
Uhh! What the...

364
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:06,232
Don't worry, I just gave
the gravity a little boost.

365
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,702
Didn't want you escaping.

366
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,370
[Lester groans]

367

an Ogre Lux if you're gonna

368
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,146
try blocking my gravity balls
head‐on again.

369
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,048
Piss off!

371
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:30,991
[Irene] Now then, Raging Axe
of the Distant Thunder,

372
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:33,660
still wanna fight?

373
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,904
[Lester] Enough!

374
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:45,405
I give up.
