1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,800
[Aldy] I've been waiting
a long time for this,
Ayato Amagiri.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,400
You have no clue how much
I've been looking forward
to this day.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,533
I've heard astounding things
about you from my master

4
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:24,533
and have high expectations
for this battle to be
quite the challenge.

5
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:28,666
Kirin Toudou left an impression
and I was inspired.

6
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,100
Can you do the same?

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,333
Show me you're a true warrior!

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:38,000
Unfortunately, that's not
something I can guarantee.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,100
But just know this.

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,100
We will be victorious.

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,266
That's a promise.

12
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,500
[Aldy] Hah hah!
We'll see about that.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,333
I only hope that you two
live up to my expectations

14
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,166
and are worthy
of my respect as‐‐

15

‐[Aldy] Uggh!
‐[Rimsy] You walking scrapyard.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,666
[Rimsy] Your body is inefficient
enough as it is without you
running your mouth like that.

17
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,333
Stop the inane chatter, already.

18
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:08,833
And if you don't, I'll make sure
you never open that mouth
of yours again.

19
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,533
[Aldy] Ugggh!

20
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:14,366
Why must I stop talking
when you're obviously speaking
far more than I am?

21
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:18,466
And not only that but my mouth
doesn't even open!

22
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:21,933
[Rimsy] That's just what I'm
talking about, you and that
insolent mouth of yours.

23
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:25,066
Who do those two
think they are, comedians?

24
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:28,566
[Ayato chuckles]
You know, the way I see it,

25
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:31,433
the two of us are actually
pretty lucky to be
facing them in the finals.

26
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,766
Why is that?

27
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:36,333
Because we can
attack those things
without holding back at all.

28
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:40,033
Guess you're right.
They truly are worthy opponents,
aren't they?

29
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:48,533
Whoa! Amagiri's ready
for battle!

30
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:52,200
<i>And it looks like</i>

<i>There may also be some issues</i>
<i>we just don't know about.</i>

36
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,866
I just assumed he didn't have it
during the semifinal

37
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:13,433
because he'd sent it in
for routine maintenance.

Yeah, good idea.
It might actually work out.

I should be able to get a read
on the whole arena that way.

That's what I thought.

73
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:40,352
Since you can pick up on Rimsy
and my movement simultaneously,
we can focus on Aldy.

Of course, I did.

124

It takes forever to prepare

and we don't plan
on passing up this shot.

150
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:29,619
[Meeko] <i>Camilla Pareto,</i>

‐[boom!]
‐[crowd cheers]

152
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:36,186
[Aldy] Looks like you were just
a moment too late.

153
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:40,119
The fusion has completed.

154
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,619
[Rimsy] Seriously?

155
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:45,386
I'll leave it up to you
to finish this.

156
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:48,052
[Aldy] Right.
I'll take care of them.

157
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:53,752
OK, now show me what kind
of warrior you truly are.

158
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:07,352
Are you ready?

167
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:13,986

‐Interesting.
‐[Kirin gasps]

Kirin Toudou, huh?

173
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:47,619
They must be taking this
pretty seriously
if they sent you.

174
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:50,119
[Kirin] You're the kidnapper,
aren't you?

175
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,186
[kidnapper] Hmm.

176

‐[muffled scream]
‐Please, you don't
have to do this!

177

[kidnapper] If you get
in my way, this girl
may never see tomorrow.

178
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:02,352
If you hurt her, then we're
going to take you down.

179
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:07,186
[kidnapper] Give it your
best shot, but there's one thing
you really should know.

180
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,152
You can go ahead and threaten me
all you want,

181
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:13,552
because it doesn't matter
what happens to me.

[muffled scream]

183
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,586
First, toss away your weapon.

[Saya] Kirin!

[kidnapper] Who's the sniper?
Saya Sasamiya, huh?

187
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:34,352
Hurry up and take Flora!

188
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:37,852
Got it!

189
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,852
You won't touch her!

190
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:51,352
Thanks for the backup.
That was a close one.

191
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:53,252
Come on, we'll get you out.

192

‐[Flora] Lady Toudou!

‐[Saya] You OK?
‐[Kirin] Don't worry, I'm fine.

194
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:10,486
Now we just have to get Flora
out of here.

195
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,319
But, Lady Toudou, you're...

196
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,986
I need you to run through
that door for me, OK?

197
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:17,086
Hmm... yes.

[Saya] Kirin!

204
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:54,252
[kidnapper] Don't move
another muscle.

205
00:14:57,686 --> 00:14:59,186
You're bleeding out.

206
00:14:59,186 --> 00:15:01,419
If you don't have that
treated immediately,

207
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:04,086
it'll be a slow death.

208
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:07,019
‐[Kirin] I'm not... finished.
‐[kidnapper scoffs]

209
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,086
[kidnapper] What else
could you possibly do?

210
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,652
[Kirin] You'll find out.

211
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,886
[kidnapper]
What's this technique?

212
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,286
[Kirin] Toudou‐style
art of sword drawing.

213
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:39,786
[kidnapper gasps]

214

[kidnapper groans]

215
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:51,686
The Folded Wing.

216
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:54,219
[kidnapper] What the hell?!

217
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,752
Get ready.

218
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:05,652
[kidnapper] Impossible!
That illusion showed me...
my death?!

219
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:07,552
[Kirin sighs]

220
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,586
[kidnapper] Remarkable skill,

221
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,786
but it's still not good enough.

222
00:16:11,786 --> 00:16:14,619
[Saya] Oh, really?
How about this?

223
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:30,542
[whimpering, panting]

224
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:33,642
[Saya] Kirin! Hang in there.

225
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:35,609
[Flora] Lady Toudou!
Lady Toudou!

226
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:37,776
Are you OK? Say something!

227
00:16:37,776 --> 00:16:39,676
[Kirin thinking] <i>Wait a minute.</i>

228
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:42,609
<i>Ayato and Julis</i>
<i>have a match right now.</i>

229
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:45,342
<i>I wonder how that's going.</i>

230
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:47,176
[boom!]

231
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,176
Hyaaa!

232
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:55,676
[Aldy chuckles]

233
00:16:55,676 --> 00:16:58,676
[Aldy] Is this your best?!
I expect more from you.

234
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:10,009
Ayato!

235
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:13,676
Burst into bloom! Primrose!

236
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:17,542
‐[Aldy] Hmm!
‐What the hell?

237
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:21,509
How can this even be happening?
He's definitely more powerful
than before.

238
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:24,109
Seriously,
it doesn't make sense.

239
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,509
Since the semifinals,
he's on a whole different level.

240
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:30,909
[Julis] I know.
He hasn't even had to use
multiple defense barriers

241
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:33,276
like he did
in previous matches.

242
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:37,109
[Aldy chuckles]

243
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:41,276
This surging power,
it has become mine to harness.

244
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:46,609
And now that I have learned
to control it, I will use it
to crush any opponent.

245
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:49,342
I've never felt so free!

246
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,776
I've never felt so energized!

247
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:57,242
My master granted me this power
and with it I have reached
my true potential!

248
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,642
His true potential, huh?

249
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:03,442
Hey, Julis, this might
sound crazy,

250
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:07,876
but what if this is just Aldy
without all of his powers
being sealed away?

251
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:10,076
Like how your powers
were sealed away?

252
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:12,542
It's not entirely impossible,
but...

253
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,542
why would he go through
so much...?

254
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:17,242
[Aldy] All right, are you ready?

255
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:20,142
Let's see how you fare
against my...

256
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,509
[Ayato] Not good!

257
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:23,976
[Aldy] ... Wolnir Hammer!

258
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,776
Here it comes,
now get ready to move.

259
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:43,276
Seems his hammer's power's
been increased, too.

260
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,309
[Aldy chuckles]

261
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,009
[Aldy] Come on!
I'm not even close
to finished with you.

262
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:53,142
Hyaaa!

263
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:56,709
‐There's no cool‐down period?
‐Don't just stand there, run!

264
00:18:59,242 --> 00:19:01,009
[Aldy] Hyaaa!

265
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:13,076
You think you can just keep
running from all my attacks?

266
00:19:13,076 --> 00:19:14,742
[energy pulses]

267
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:16,809
[Julis] What the hell?

268
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:18,676
[Ayato] Oh, crap!

269
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:20,209
[Aldy chuckles]

270
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:23,876
[Aldy] You won't be escaping
my next attack so easily.

271
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:27,442
Wolnir Hammer!

272
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,176
Fire!

273
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:32,676
Burst into bloom!

00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:35,076
Anthurium!

275
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,542
[Ayato] Julis,
are you all right?

276
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:46,376
Yeah, but that was a close one.

277
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:49,042
[Aldy] Impressive.

278
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:51,842
You were able to find a way
to survive a direct hit.

279
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:53,642
Now, that's the spirit.

280
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:56,176
[Ayato] He's got us trapped.

281
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:58,809
We've gotta find a way
out of this box.

282

[Meeko] <i>Incredible!</i>

283

<i>What an amazing showing</i>
<i>of Aldy's overwhelming power.</i>

284
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:09,509
Question is, will this be
the moment

285
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,976
that decides the outcome
of the final match or... Huh?

‐[Meeko] <i>Hey, come on.</i>

<i>What's going on?</i>

288
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:21,109
[Claudia] <i>Um... Ahem.</i>

289
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:22,276
[Julis] Claudia?

290
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:27,242
Oh, Ayato, Julis, can you two
hear me down there?

291
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:31,742
I'm glad to say Flora is safe.
You have nothing to worry about.

292
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:37,376
Well, anyway, go show them
what you're made of.

293
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,909
[Aldy] Wait! What's going on?

294
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:46,176
[Claudia] Thank you.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

295
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:52,142
Wait. Correct me if I'm wrong,

296
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:55,042
but that was Seidoukan
Student Council President,
right?

297
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:58,209
[Tram] <i>Uh, yeah.</i>
<i>Pretty sure that was her.</i>

298

[Julis giggles]

299
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,676
Can you believe that girl?

300
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:05,309
I mean, really, she went
way too far this time.

301
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,476
[Ayato] You said it.
Who would have expected

302
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:10,742
that she'd barge into the studio
like that just to deliver
a message to us?

303
00:21:10,742 --> 00:21:14,542
She's done so much for us.
We can't lose now.

304
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,909
For Saya and Kirin's sake
as well, right?

305
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:22,542
[Aldy groans]

306
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,842
I have no idea
what that was about.

307
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:26,142
But it doesn't matter.

308
00:21:26,142 --> 00:21:30,109
You're going to witness
the full extent of my abilities!

309
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:32,976
Wolnir Hammer!

310
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:37,109
OK, let's do this.

311
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:44,176
Ser Versta!

312
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:47,042
[Aldy] You're finished!

313
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:53,942
[Aldy] What the...?

314
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,176
[giggles]

315
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:02,142
[Dirk] Shit.

316
00:22:02,142 --> 00:22:04,009
[energy pulses]

317
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:06,142
It's time for a counterattack.
