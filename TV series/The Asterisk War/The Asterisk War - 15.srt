them both a sizable advantage,

<i>venues have come to a close,</i>

158
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,873
<i>three slots for the semifinals</i>
<i>have already been locked up.</i>

159
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:51,712
<i>The question is,</i>
<i>which team will claim</i>
<i>that last semifinal spot.</i>

160
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:57,383
<i>First up, from Seidoukan,</i>
<i>it's Ayato Amagiri</i>
<i>and Julis‐Alexia von Riessfeld.</i>

161
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,587
<i>And their opponents</i>
<i>from Jie Long</i>
<i>Seventh Institute,</i>

162
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,889
<i>Li Shenyun and Li Shenhua.</i>

163
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,691
<i>This is the one to watch.</i>

164
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,594
<i>Now both teams</i>
<i>have taken their places.</i>

165
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,996
Oh, wow, you didn't try
to back out

166
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,633
even after a glaring weakness
was revealed.

167
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,801
Means you've either got
nerves of steel

168
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,402
or you're incredibly foolish.

169
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,406
Or maybe you actually have
some kind of strategy.

170
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,608
Oh, you'll find out.

171
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,578
That's right, we only have
one plan and that's to win.

172
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,879
Is that so?

173
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,682
Well, I have no idea what
you have up your sleeves,

174
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,984
but I am looking forward to it.

175
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,119
In the end, we're going
to win anyway.

176
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,354
[both] Humph!

177
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,922
Stay focused.

178
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,324
We've got to do all we can
to bring them down.

179
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,760
I'm ready, let's do it.

180
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:45,231
With my soul's sword,
I break these celestial bonds

181
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,268
that my savage force
may be seen!

182
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,772
[energy pulses]

183
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,907
[Meeko] <i>Wow! Just look at that!</i>

184
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,176
<i>Amagiri sure knows how</i>
<i>to put on a show!</i>

185
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:59,445
<i>Hold on, this is more than</i>
<i>just a performance, isn't it?</i>

186
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,882
[Tram] <i>That's right.</i>
<i>From what I understand,</i>

187
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:05,151
<i>this is a way of releasing</i>
<i>all his sealed powers</i>
<i>and preparing for combat.</i>

188
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,452
[Meeko] <i>Oh, how fascinating!</i>

189
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,956
<i>But now the time has come,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

190
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,093
<i>so let's get this underway!</i>

191
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,730
<i>The Phoenix Festa's fourth</i>
<i>match of the quarterfinals.</i>

192
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,299
<i>Battle begin!</i>

193
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,804
[Shenhua] You're fast.

194
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,674
But not so fast
that I can't dodge
if I see your sword coming.

195
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,111
Burst into bloom!
Primrose!

196
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:36,282
Make it happen at once.
Eat it!

197
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:41,722
What was that?

198
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:44,190
[Shenyun chuckles]

199
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,560
[Meeko] <i>Whoa! Didn't think</i>
<i>there'd be a smoke screen</i>

200
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,828
<i>this early in the fight.</i>

201
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,763
<i>They're not planning</i>
<i>to go the entire match</i>

202
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,397
<i>hidden behind it, are they?</i>

203
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,600
[Julis] I had no idea
they'd try to pull this.

204
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,438
Hey, Julis, don't let
all the smoke throw you.

205
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,140
It's probably fake.

206
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:04,645
I see now.
It's only a mirage.

207
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:05,846
[crowd jeering]

208
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,749
[man] Come on,
show us the match!

209
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,316
[Shenyun] Listen to them.

210
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,555
Audiences today can be so
impatient, now, can't they?

211
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:15,956
[snaps fingers]

212
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:21,394
[Shenhua] Well, I suppose
we don't need
all of that anymore.

213
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,731
[Meeko] <i>All right, one minute's</i>
<i>past since the match began.</i>

214
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,301
[Tram] <i>For Amagiri,</i>
<i>who only has five minutes</i>
<i>to use his powers,</i>

215
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,337
<i>I'd say that's</i>
<i>pretty significant,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

216
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,407
Those two, they're even more
twisted than I thought.

217
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,511
Well, well, they're as ready
to go as we are.

218
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:48,421
I guess it's my turn, huh?

219
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,790
[applause]

220
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,560
OK, it looks like
everybody's here now
so we're all ready to go.

221
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,996
[clone 1] But standing around
just waiting for you
to make a move

222
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,964
would be kind of boring,
don't you think?

223
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:02,769
[clone 2] Indeed. And it would
probably be pretty dull for
the people in the audience, too.

224
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,238
[clone 3] If we don't
do something to get
this crowd pumped,

225
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,773
we'll be booed a second time.

226
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,742
[clone 4] Well, in that case...

227
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:12,112
we should wake 'em up and
give 'em what they came for.

228
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,881
‐Hey, Ayato, stay sharp.
‐Got it.

229
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,917
Only one of them
is the real one, right?

230
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,185
[Julis] That's true, but...

231
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,221
Haaaa!

232
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:27,661
[Ayato thinking]
<i>That was an illusion?</i>

233
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:30,096
Too bad. You're wrong again.

234
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,199
‐Explosion.
‐[Ayato screams]

235
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,202
‐Are you all right, Ayato?
‐[Shenhua giggles]

236
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,072
[Shenhua] Have you already
forgotten about me?

237
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:42,075
Cos that won't do.

238
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,447
‐Aaaah!
‐[Ayato] Julis!

239
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,252
[crowd applauds, twins chuckle]

240
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,191
I'm OK, but we're gonna run
out of time.

241
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,993
Now, I'll help cover you,

242
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,462
so you can take out Shenhua
right away.

243
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,697
Then let's do it.

244
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,431
Burst into bloom!

245
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,434
Livingstone Daisy!

246
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,771
Haaaa!

247
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,940
Look at that.
Guess they're gonna
come for me after all.

248
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,744
‐Haaaaa!
‐[rumbling, explosions]

249
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:27,387
[Shenyun clone] You know,
you should really be
more careful,

250
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,591
since you can't see
the talismans Shenhua released.

251
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:33,193
[Ayato thinking] <i>Talismans?</i>

252
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,663
<i>They were hidden by the smoke!</i>

253
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,033
If that's the case,
then all we have to do

254
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,301
is blow each one of them away.

255
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,204
[Shenhua] Thought I told you...

256
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,007
I'm in this battle, too,
you know.

257
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,475
‐Summoning Thunder!
‐[Julis screams]

258
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,444
No, Julis!

259
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,985
[Julis] Ayato!
Don't worry about me now.

260
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,021
Just focus on
taking down Shenyun.

261
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,490
All right.

262
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,395
Aaaah!

263
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,873
Well, well, not bad.

264
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,744
[Ayato] I might as well slash
all five, just to make sure!

265
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:30,350
[Shenyun clone] Oh, no, too bad.
You guessed wrong again.

266
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,521
[Ayato] Just two more to go.

267
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,057
Which one's real?

268
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:42,696
Amagiri Shinmei‐style,
First Sword!

269
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:45,566
Twin Dragons!

270
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,200
This one, too?

271
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,038
Uhh!

272
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,641
[crowd roars]

273
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,877
Hmm. How unfortunate.

274
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,845
Have you already reached
your limit?

275
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,481
‐Ayato!
‐[booming counterattack]

276
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,986
‐[crowd cheers]
‐[Shenhua chuckles]

277
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:07,654
That felt amazing.

278
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,856
[chains rattle]

279
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,692
[Ayato groans]

280
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,764
[Ayato collapses]

281
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,534
[Shenyun clone] I don't know
the reason why you have
that thing,

282
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,837
but that seal of yours seems
rather inconvenient to me.

283
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:29,109
[chuckles] Doesn't look like
you're feeling too well.

284
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,945
‐[Ayato chuckles]
‐[Shenhua] What the hell
are you laughing about?

285
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,281
[Ayato] It's... nothing, really.

286
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,084
Just that... this match hasn't
been decided yet

287
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,420
and it's not over!

288
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,990
[Meeko] <i>Amazing!</i>
<i>Drained and exhausted,</i>

289
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,026
<i>Amagiri still pulled off</i>
<i>a victory!</i>

290
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:48,695
I get it now.
He pretended to fall
for their tactics

291
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:50,597
and acted like he wasn't
able to move.

292
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,899
Then he lured both of them
into letting down their guard.

293
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,543
[Ayato] No way!

294
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:07,180
[Shenyun] I've gotta admit,
that was pretty close,
wasn't it?

295
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,815
It's like they say:

296
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:13,687
"He who understands destiny
does not stand beneath
a crumbling wall."

297
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,856
[snaps fingers]

298
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:18,859
[Ayato thinking]
<i>So, after the smoke screen</i>
<i>came down,</i>

299
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:22,929
<i>every person I've been fighting</i>
<i>against was just a clone?</i>

300
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,865
[Shenyun chuckles]

301
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:27,167
You think I only
use those things

302
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,869
to get within striking distance
of you?

303
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:33,607
Please, why would I ever
want to do an idiotic thing
like that?

304
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,310
Now, in such a weakened state,

305
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,847
even these will be almost
impossible for you to evade!

306
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,816
Haaaa!

307
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,289
[Shenyun chuckles]

308
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,658
So, how do you plan
to get past those?

309
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,196
‐[Ayato] Not yet.
‐[Shenyun] Huh?

310
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,801
I said not yet,
cos there's no way I plan
on giving up so easily!

311
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:05,205
Oh! So even you get that look
on your face sometimes.

312
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,608
Well, now you've got me
fired up.

313

[energy pulses]

314
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,846
That's it. I love watching
your futile struggling.

315
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:16,216
Aaaaaah!

316
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,018
It's so wonderfully thrilling!

317
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:20,420
Yaaaah!

318
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,888

[crowd cheers]

321
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,232
All right, though I don't
really want to,

322
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,601
I think it's finally time
to put an end to this.

323
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,303
[Julis]
Ayato, give me your hand!

324
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,807
[Shenyun] Damn it!

325
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,216
That was pretty close.
I owe you one.

326
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,218
No need.

327
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,020
Just sorry I couldn't
get here sooner.

328
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,590
I had a little trouble
getting away from Shenhua.

329
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,793
‐[Ayato] Uggh!
‐Now, don't push yourself.

330
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,928
The two of us
are in this together.

331
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:05,031
We each have a dream of our own,
which means we need to do

332
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,067
whatever we can for each other.

333
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,368
Julis, I...

334
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,571
The problem with you is,
no matter what happens,

335
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,806
you're always taking things
on alone.

336
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:15,175
You asked me a question
once before,

337
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:18,078
and I think now would be
a good time to ask you
the same one.

338
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,514
It went something like...

339
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:24,450
"If you're protecting others,
who's going to protect you?"

340
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,293
What was that?

341
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,562
[Shenhua] Are you two
finished chatting?

342
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:37,497
Because if you are...

343
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,700
[Shenyun] ...then I think it's
time for us to end this match.

344
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,837
All right. I bet they have more
invisible talismans ready,

345
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:46,172
and if we don't do something
about that, then...

346
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,174
‐[Ayato] Julis.
‐Huh?

347
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:50,043
Thanks a lot.

348
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:52,513
Where'd that come from?

349
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:56,449
Well, thanks to you,
I can see things clearly.

350
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:57,884
For sure this time.

351
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:02,956
OK. So, I was wondering if maybe
I could ask you for a favor.

352
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:05,391
Would you mind?

353
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:10,831
