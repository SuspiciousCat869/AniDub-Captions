1
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:36,631
Greetings, Madam Enfield.
You're as punctual as ever.

2
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,564
[Claudia giggles]

3
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,364
Good afternoon.
It's a pleasure.

4
00:00:42,364 --> 00:00:44,231
I'm glad to see
everyone looking so well.

5
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:48,631
Yes, indeed. And now that we've
finally all gathered here,
we can begin.

6
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,631
‐[Claudia] Where is‐‐
‐[Ernest] Oh, yes.

7
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,498
She's currently in the middle
of her European tour.

8
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:56,164
That diva songstress
doesn't rest, does she?

9
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:57,964
Though it's par for the course.

10
00:00:57,964 --> 00:01:00,698
[Dirk] If you ask me,
it doesn't make a difference

11
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:03,231
whether that little brat
is here or not.

12
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:08,398
Please refrain from insulting
the other academy's delegates,
if you'd be so kind,

13
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:10,498
Double Sword Overlord.

14
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:13,431
Hah! All depends
on that bitch from Queenvail.

15
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:14,898
I mean, how many times
has she been...

16
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:16,864
[thud!]

17
00:01:16,864 --> 00:01:18,964
I asked you not
to speak that way.

18
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:22,664
[Dirk] Well, well.
Wanna take me on,

19
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:24,931
Lord Holy Knight?

20
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,264
[energy pulses]

21
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:31,231
[scoffs] And what is that
kiddie toy supposed to do?

22
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,664
So sweet.

23
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:35,598
It seems like you two kids
are as chummy as ever.

24
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:37,331
Really adorable.

25
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,964
But a piece of advice.

26
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:40,831
Give the childish horse playing
a rest.

27
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:45,231
Otherwise, I'll start itching
to join the fray.

28
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,031
[Ernest scoffs]

29
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:53,964
I believe it's
in our best interest
to not upset the princess.

30
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:57,131
‐[Dirk] By the way, Claudia.
‐[Claudia] Yes, what is it?

31
00:01:57,131 --> 00:02:01,664
[Dirk] I keep hearing rumors
that Seidoukan and Arlequint
have joined forces

32
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,898
to develop a new type of Lux.

33
00:02:03,898 --> 00:02:05,498
Is that true?

34
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:07,564
‐Interesting.
‐Really?

35
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:10,364
Goodness, it would appear
news travels fast.

36
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:15,364
It's true, we will indeed
be sending some of our
finest engineers to Arlequint.

37
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:17,164
Are you trying
to pull a fast one?

38
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:21,031
Secret deals between schools
are prohibited under
the Stella Carta.

39
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:23,831
And besides that, how would
the collaboration even work?

40
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:27,364
Arlequint is light‐years
ahead of Seidoukan
in terms of technology.

41
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:28,798
It's almost as if
they're saying,

42
00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:31,531
"Help yourselves to as much of
our technology as you'd like."

43
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:34,664
What are your feelings
about this, Mr. Arlequint?

44
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:36,998
Uh... well, actually...

45
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:39,698
all I did was press
an approval button,

46
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:41,431
so I don't really know
all the particulars.

47
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:44,931
[Claudia] There seems to be
some kind of misunderstanding.

48
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,631
This project isn't
some clandestine deal
or anything of the sort.

49
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:53,498
Rather, it's an official
agreement between Seidoukan
and Arlequint Academy.

50
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:56,131
We'll eventually go public
with the details.

51
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:57,264
[Shuma sighs]

52
00:02:57,264 --> 00:03:00,131
So you're saying that it's
an equal partnership, huh?

53
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,498
One‐hundred percent.

54
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:05,164
Since Arlequint has
graciously allowed us
to use their facility,

55
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:08,498
Seidoukan will cover 70%
of the R and D budget.

56
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:09,964
That reminds me.

57
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:12,964
Seems Seidoukan had
some internal strife recently

58
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:15,598
and they were forced to send in
the Shadow Stars.

59
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:17,698
Could that incident have
anything to do with this?

60
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,298
I've no clue what you mean.

61
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:21,064
Right.
You scheming little shrew.

62
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:23,864
I do believe this topic
has worn out its welcome.

63
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:28,464
Quite. With that, we will wait
for the official announcement.

64
00:03:28,464 --> 00:03:31,698
All right, moving on.
Let's begin the meeting.

65
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:33,864
[Shuma] Uh, excuse me.

66
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:37,364
I'm sorry.
It's a bit sudden,
but I need to say this.

67
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:40,864
There's something that I'd like
to add to our discussion,
if it's OK with you.

68
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:43,531
Really? Well, whatever
could it be?

69
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:45,298
[Xinglou] Seriously,
what is there to add?

70
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:50,264
Well, uh, I want to propose
the use of artificial
intelligence in Asterisk.

71
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:55,098
And I'd also like for us
to grant their usage
in the Festas.

72
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:12,831
[Shiena Nishizawa singing
"Brand‐new World" in Japanese]

73
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,797
[panting]

74
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:34,664
[Ayato thinking] <i>This is bad.</i>
<i>Julis is gonna kill me.</i>

75
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,730
[both gasp]

76
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,864
Huh?

77
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,397
[crash!]

78
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:51,964
[sobs]

79
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,764
Oh no. Are you...?

80
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:58,330
Yes, I'm OK. I just...

81
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,664
Huh?

82
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:01,730
[shrieks]

83
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,030
It's my fault. Sorry.
I should pay attention.

84
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,964
No, I'm the one who should be
apologizing to you.

85
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:21,997
Hang on. There's something
stuck in your hair.

86
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:25,497
Huh? Where is it?
I can't see!

87
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:27,730
Hey, just hold still.

88
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,764
Tha...

89
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:34,030
Thank you very much.

90
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,197
Sure, but I...

91
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:39,064
Kirin! What are you doing?
Hurry up!

92
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:42,130
Nothing. Sorry.
I'll be right there.

93
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,764
See you later.

94
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,830
See ya... later.

95
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:54,397
Uhh! No, Julis.

96
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:58,664
Burst into bloom! Now!

97
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:01,064
Livingstone Daisy!

98
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:08,664
And go!

99
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,897
I see that you're still
relying on cheap tricks.

100
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:19,930
All right, can you dodge
this one?

101
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,297
Bring it on.
I'll take whatever you dish out!

102
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,464
Show yourself.

103

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,930
Ten Linked Thistles!

106
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:02,730
[buzzer sounds]

107
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,230
[sighs] I was sure I'd be
the victor this time.

108
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,230
Well, to tell you the truth,
you almost were.

109
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,164
You've got a whole arsenal
of moves, don't ya?

110
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:14,564
I, uh, suppose so.

111
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:17,030
Anyway, are you holding up
all right?

112
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,030
I'm fine. I can manage
for about three minutes.

113
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,230
Good to know.

114
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,097
Assuming you can maintain
full strength for that long,

115
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:27,164
finding a way to deal
with opponents at my level
should be easy.

116
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:28,530
[Ayato] Wait a sec.

117
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,030
There can't be that many
students who are stronger
than you, right?

118
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,830
Thank you for the vote
of confidence,

119
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,164
but to be honest, I can name
quite a few students who are
more powerful than I am.

120
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:38,497
Who are they?

121
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:41,530
[Julis] Well, the Gallardworth
Student Council president,
for one.

122
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,197
His swordsmanship is unmatched.

123
00:08:43,197 --> 00:08:46,630
Not to mention
Jie Long's president
and her monstrous power.

124
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,497
That being said,
she's still a bit too young
to take part in the Festas.

125
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:54,230
Oh, yeah.
Speaking of contestants,

126
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,064
there is one
that's pretty well known.

127
00:08:56,064 --> 00:08:59,030
Last year, she became
the second person in history

128
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,630
to win the Lindwurs Festas.

129
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,430
I think she was from ReWolf.

130
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,364
[Julis]
She was Ereshkigal Ophélia.

131
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:09,064
Ophélia, that's her.

132
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:10,564
What's wrong?

133
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:12,430
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

134
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,297
Anyway, it's good that we have
at least one thing
in our favor.

135
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:20,764
You're new at Asterisk
and no one knows about
your skills yet.

136
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:24,197
Your wielding the Ser Versta
may be public knowledge,

137
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,730
but even if someone has
that info, no one knows
how to deal with it.

138
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,897
It would be best if you could
try using the sword's power
without unsealing your own.

139
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:34,897
True, but unless I'm using
my full power,

140
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:37,197
this thing won't acknowledge me
as its wielder.

141
00:09:37,197 --> 00:09:40,197
At any rate, the Phoenix Festa
is a month away.

142
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:43,564
So don't go revealing your hand
in any meaningless duels.

143
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,164
[Ayato] You got it.

144
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:47,130
[monitor rings]

145
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:50,430
[Saya mutters]

146
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,797
No fair. Listen up, Riessfeld,
you're totally monopolizing
Ayato.

147
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:57,964
I caught you red‐handed.
Just admit it.

148
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:01,897
I'm fully aware that you've been
stealing away to a secret room
with him after school

149
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:04,197
and engaging in all kinds
of unspeakable acts.

150
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,364
Don't hurl slanderous
accusations at me.

151
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,630
All we're doing is training
for the upcoming Phoenix Festa.

152
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,697
So, Lester, glad you're out
of the hospital.

153
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:12,064
Uh, yeah, thanks.

154
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:14,264
[Ayato] Come to think of it,
what brings you here?

155
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:16,264
And of all people,
how did you end up with Saya?

156
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:19,764
I just picked up the little
squirt on the way over here.

157
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,830
Hey, who are you calling
a little squirt?

158
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,564
But I owe you for
getting me here, so thanks.

159
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:26,030
You're welcome, I guess.

160
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,097
So about that thing with Silas,

161
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:30,897
there's no denying that you
saved my hide back there.

162
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,197
And, well, you know,

163
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:36,064
you... you did me
a solid, all right?

164
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:38,130
‐There you go.
‐[Ayato] Uh, OK.

165
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,930
[Claudia] My, my!

166
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,264
I'm happy that the four of you
have arrived.

167
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:47,564
Amazing! So this is
the Seidoukan training room
I've heard so much about.

168
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,164
Oh, squeaky clean!

169
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:52,264
Ernesta, please calm down.
We're guests here.

170
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:54,230
Oh! Oh!

171
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,264
[Ernesta giggles]

172
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,163
Allow me to introduce you all.

173
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:10,630
On my right is
Ms. Camilla Pareto
of Arlequint Academy.

174
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,463
And accompanying her
is Ms. Ernesta Kuhne.

175
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,997
‐[Ernesta giggles]
‐So, why are they here?

176
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:19,063
It's simple.
Our schools have joined forces.

177
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:23,197
We hope this partnership
results in the development
of a new type of Lux.

178
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:26,697
And today, these ladies have
come here to sign the contract.

179
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:29,397
‐Greetings.
‐Clever, Claudia.

180
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,763
Whaddya mean?

181
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:34,430
In return for not
charging Arlequint for
the incident with Silas,

182
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,430
Seidoukan secured
this collaboration.

183
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,397
‐[Lester] What?
‐[Claudia] Dear me,
where is this coming from?

184
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:41,630
Deny it all you want,
but first,

185
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,597
tell me the real reason
for bringing these two here.

186
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:46,830
[Claudia] Well, it's
as I explained earlier.

187
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,497
I know! We came here because
I told everyone I needed
to see it to believe it.

188
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:56,097
And to be perfectly honest,
I just had to see him
with my own two eyes!

189
00:11:56,097 --> 00:12:00,930
[giggles] The young swordsman
who shredded all those puppets
created by...

190
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,030
‐...me!
‐[both] Huh?

191
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:09,230
You little brat.
Step away from Ayato
right this minute.

192
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,030
Yes, I see.
This is very promising, indeed.

193
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,930
Hmm. No, not too shabby
at all.

194
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,630
I like what I'm seeing here.

195
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,230
What are you...?

196
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,063
[Ernesta] But don't expect
the same outcome next time.

197
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:24,997
What's that supposed...?

198
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:27,230
[gasp] What the hell
did you just do

199
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,430
‐to Ayato, you bitch?!
‐That's not good.

200
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,530
Uh...

201
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:35,530
[Saya] Thieving hussies
must be destroyed!

202
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,930
[Ernesta] So scary!

203
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,630
It was nothing more
than a little hello.

204
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,397
I apologize.

205
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:45,730
What you've just witnessed
is the real Ernesta.

206
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,297
Excuse her rudeness.

207
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:51,663
This isn't something you see
every day.

208
00:12:51,663 --> 00:12:55,263
Three Manadites
forcefully linked in the core
to boost output.

209
00:12:55,263 --> 00:12:57,863
Haven't run across
that design in a while.

210
00:12:57,863 --> 00:13:00,163
Correct.
How could you know that?

211
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:02,597
Because I'm a specialist
in this field.

212
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:06,197
Fact is, it's not really
a practical weapon.

213
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:10,563
First off, the tech was
shelved over a decade ago
for being incomplete.

214
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:14,497
To maintain its effects,
you'd have to constantly use
the Meteor Arts

215
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:17,430
to boost Lux output by pouring
Prana into the Manadites.

216
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,597
[Ayato thinking]
<i>Jeez, he did it again, huh?</i>

217
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:23,897
What's more, due to this,
an interval is required
between every attack.

218
00:13:23,897 --> 00:13:27,530
And from the looks of it,
your model hasn't improved
on that flaw.

219
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:30,830
Well, I hate to admit it,
but you're right.

220
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,930
That said, I won't stand by
while you sling insults
at my father's gun,

221
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,763
so you'd better take it back.

222
00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:39,997
Hold on. You wouldn't be
Dr. Sasamiya's daughter,
would you?

223
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:41,597
And what's it to you?

224
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:45,163
If you are, then that's one more
reason why I can't take it back.

225
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:49,797
Because of Dr. Sasamiya's
renegade tendencies,

226
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:51,497
he was cast out of Arlequint.

227
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,697
He was also ousted from
our faction, Ferrovius.

228
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:57,297
Speaking as the representative
of that faction,

229
00:13:57,297 --> 00:14:01,263
I cannot acknowledge
your father's perverse notions.

230
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:04,263
‐[clears throat]
‐Now that you've all
been acquainted,

231
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:07,130
I think we should get back
to business, don't you?

232
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,597
Good idea. Pardon me.

233
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,597
[Saya] Wait. I insist
you retract your statement.

234
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:17,097
You're not gonna get through
to her, you know.

235
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:19,497
Although, if you're that
hell‐bent on it,

236
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:22,297
there's just one way:
you'll have to try and make her.

237
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:24,397
[Saya] You mean we should
start dueling?

238
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,263
[laughs] Please! She'd never
accept a challenge here.

239
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:32,363
But just so you know,
we will be taking part
in the upcoming Phoenix Festa.

240
00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:36,263
[Camilla] Ernesta,
we're leaving.

241
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:40,597
Yeah, I'm coming!
Catch ya later! Bye!

242
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:42,163
[giggles]

243
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,697
‐[Saya] Ayato.
‐[Ayato] Something wrong, Saya?

244
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:49,830
I'm fighting in
the Phoenix Festa,
it's settled.

245
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,263
Huh? Well, you know it's
a tag‐team tournament, don't ya?

246
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:55,130
Do you have somebody
to team up with?

247
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,530
‐That would be you, of course.
‐No, he's my partner!

248
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,397
I've had it with
these ridiculous assertions!

249
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:02,397
[Saya] Stop monopolizing him.

250
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:05,163
What are you talking about?
I am the one who
asked him first!

251
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:08,930
[arguing continues,
Lester groans]

252
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,530
[Lester] What could go wrong?

253
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:18,762
What's up?
It was pretty rare
to see you lose your cool.

254
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:22,329
I wasn't expecting you to go
and provoke that blue‐haired
chick like that.

255
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,229
I did nothing of the sort.
I just gave her
my frank opinion.

256
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,929
Anyway, what are your thoughts
on him?

257
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:33,529
Hmm. Honestly, I think I'm gonna
need a little more data first.

258
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:35,395
The prez has done his part.

259
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:37,629
Because of his help, we're ready
for the Phoenix Festa.

260
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:41,695
Now the only thing we have
to worry about is that boy.

261
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:44,462
You're not planning
another stunt, are you?

262
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:48,329
[giggles] You know the lengths
I'm willing to go to.

263
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:50,995
I'll do anything in order
to realize my dream.

264
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:57,829
[Eishirou] At Arlequint,
the students are in two groups.

265
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:00,029
The research class develops
the Luxes,

266
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,062
and the practical skills class
uses them in Festas.

267
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:05,629
Apparently the research class
has way more clout.

268
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,662
‐Really?
‐Yeah. Get a load of this.

269
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:09,529
There are factions
within the research class.

270
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:13,695
They're always fighting
over R and D facilities
and top‐tier students.

271
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:17,395
Right now the group
with the most influence
of all is Ferrovius.

272
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:19,195
I had no idea.

273
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,329
[slap!]

274
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:23,929
Kirin, how many times
do I have to tell you,

275
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:26,395
it's none of your concern,
stupid girl?

276
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,629
But... but, Uncle, I just...

277
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:31,729
I don't recall giving you
permission to talk back.

278
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:37,029
Now, that's enough.

279
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,295
[gasp]

280
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:40,562
[Koichiro] Who the hell
are you, brat?

281
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:42,629
[Ayato] I'm not sure
what this is about,

282
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,495
but I don't approve
of raising a hand to a girl.

283
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:49,462
Outsiders should stay out
of our family affairs.

284
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:51,229
Disciplining my niece
is well within my rights.

285
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:52,595
[Ayato] Your niece?

286
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,729
That's right.
I'm Koichiro Toudou.

287
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:58,629
I'm Kirin Toudou's
beloved uncle.

288
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,595
Now you know, so beat it.

289
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:05,729
Besides, if I'm not mistaken,
you Genestella freaks

290
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:09,662
are basically immune
to taps like that, right?

291
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:13,695
Even if we're Genestella,
it doesn't mean
that we don't feel pain.

292
00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:15,662
I see.

293
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:17,695
Now tell me,
what's your name, boy?

294
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:20,362
‐[Ayato] Ayato Amagiri.
‐[Koichiro] Amagiri.

295
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:24,895
Well now, a rank‐and‐filer
who's not even in
the Named Cults, huh?

296
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:27,629
Hmm. Ah.

297
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,729
Very well.
Since you have a problem
with the way I do things,

298
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:33,429
what would you have me change?

299
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:37,562
You have but to say the word
and I shall comply.

300
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:39,529
So, whatever I say, huh?

301
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:43,895
Then would you promise me that
you'll never get violent
with Kirin again?

302
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,562
Sure, no more.

303
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:49,295
But only on the condition
that you win a duel. Deal?

304
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:50,729
Seriously?

305
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:55,462
And your opponent will be
my niece.

306
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:58,229
[Ayato] What?
‐But, Uncle, no, I can't!

307
00:17:58,229 --> 00:18:02,662
Kirin, you're not
disobeying me, are you?

308
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:05,562
No, sir.
Of course I'm not.

309
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:09,295
[Koichiro] Bear in mind,
if you defeat the Ser Versta,

310
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:11,829
it'll bolster your resume
even further.

311
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:16,062
I'm so sorry about this.

312
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:21,929
I, Kirin Toudou, challenge you,
Ayato Amagiri, to a duel.

313
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:28,029
Please, don't do this!
There's no reason for us
to start fighting each other.

314
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:31,895
There's only one way to avoid
all of this: refuse to duel me.

315
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:37,095
Tell me something.
If I do, what happens to you?

316
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:38,695
It doesn't matter.

317
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:41,695
I honestly don't care
what happens to me.

318
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:44,462
I couldn't change
my fate anyway.

319
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:49,362
If that's the case, then I can't
afford to say no.

320
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:52,529
You're really a kind‐hearted
person, Ayato.

321
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:58,295
However, you leave me
with no choice.

322
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:01,862
Cos like you, I also cannot
afford to lose.

323
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:10,962
I accept your challenge.

324
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:16,862
[energy pulses]

325
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:20,162
Hmph!

326
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:24,762
Kirin, avoid parrying
that Ogre Lux of his
at all costs.

327
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:28,095
It'll slice you
along with your sword.

328
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:29,529
Here I come!

329
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:43,495
You're very powerful.
I have to admit,
I wasn't expecting that.

330
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:46,362
Right back at ya.
You're incredible.

331
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:53,662
[Julis thinking]
<i>Didn't I tell that imbecile</i>

332
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:57,095
<i>not to get involved</i>
<i>in any meaningless duels?</i>

333
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,029
Ayato is on the defensive?

334
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,095
[Eishirou] Well, well,
if it isn't her highness.

335
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:04,795
‐Eishirou.
‐Quite the spectacle,
wouldn't you say?

336
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:08,662
That bastard's been keeping
his moves under wraps
this whole time.

337
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:11,962
I know, but at this rate,
it's not looking too good.

338
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,162
Well, of course not.

339
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:15,595
He's up against the notorious
Lightning Blade Speed.

340
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:20,229
Not only that, it seems like
Ayato still has a hard time
controlling the Ser Versta.

341
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:25,162
Plus, Kirin's been able to dodge
every blow without taking
a single scratch.

342
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:28,862
[Julis thinking] <i>How could he</i>
<i>possibly be following</i>
<i>the duel at this speed?</i>

343
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:30,429
Never mind that.

344
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,929
I need to know how long
this has been going on.

345
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:36,462
Chill out. I don't know, maybe
around four or five minutes.

346
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:43,662
[Kirin thinking]
<i>Amazing! I never thought</i>
<i>it would be like this.</i>

347
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:46,162
[Ayato thinking] <i>Damn it!</i>
<i>I'm almost out of time.</i>

[weapon pulses]

<i>Come on,</i>

350
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:53,862
<i>Dodge at the last second</i>
<i>and strike her out!</i>

351
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:06,529
[Kirin thinking]
<i>He's panicking, but why?</i>

352
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:10,729
[Ayato thinking]
<i>I'll dodge this one, too!</i>

00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:24,562
Uh...

358
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:31,462
Rookie mistake.
Forgot the rules and got
his badge sliced in two.

359
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:34,595
Kirin, we'll be taking
our leave. Come.

360
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,995
OK. Um...

361
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:41,795
Again, I'm really sorry.

Uh...

363
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:45,629
Come on, we need to get going
right now.

364
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:48,362
It won't be much longer
until you reach your limit.

365
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:49,729
[Ayato] Oh, right.

366
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:53,395
You have some explaining to do.
Why would you take her on?

367
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,795
That girl is ranked
the number‐one duelist
at Seidoukan Academy.

368
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:58,762
Uh...

You're kidding.

Kirin Toudou

371
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:04,862
is the school's top duelist?
