1
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:15,266
Gustave Malrow?

2
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,868
Yeah. The man from last night.

3
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:20,771
He's apparently known as
an internationally wanted
criminal.

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,574
He was also a member
of the terrorist group

5
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:26,943
that claimed responsibility
for the Jade Dusk incident
in Asterisk.

6
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,246
Are you telling me
we're facing a terrorist?

7
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:32,083
[Claudia] Not exactly.
It seems he took part
in Jade Dusk

8
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,218
as a mercenary
and did it more for the money.

9
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:38,689
When it comes to last night,
I doubt it was
politically motivated.

10
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:41,158
[Kirin] It did sound like he was
following somebody's orders,

11
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:44,195
so maybe there could be
a big organization behind this.

12
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:47,164
Though why doesn't he want us
to join the Gryps Festa?

13
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:49,300
Well, the police believe
you're all in danger

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,536
and would like to put you
under their protection.
Interested?

15
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:54,471
I think I can take care
of myself.

16
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,008
I won't need protection either.

17
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:01,212
Think we're all capable
of handling ourselves.

18
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:05,016
All right then, I'll let them
know they won't be needed.

19
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:08,352
If that'll be all, I have
research I need to get back to.

20
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,287
Please excuse me.

21
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:15,192
If that's everything,
then we'll be leaving as well.

22
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:18,529
[Jolbert] Actually,
just a second, Julis.

23
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:21,032
Can you and Mr. Amagiri
spare me a moment?

24
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:23,634
You remember what I said
yesterday.

25
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:26,170
We need to talk.

26
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:53,164

<i>♪ This is the Asterisk War ♪</i>

28
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:07,404
So tell me, what's this
important matter you need
to discuss with us?

29
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:09,606
Right.

30
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,408
There are two things, actually.

31
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,477
Mr. Amagiri.

32
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:15,046
Yes.

33
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:18,415
Would you mind taking
Julis's hand in marriage?

34
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:19,950
Huh?

35
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:25,222
Just what do you think
you're doing asking
that kind of question?

36
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:27,258
Is this some kind
of sick joke to you?

37
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:32,396
OK, what if you take things
slow then and start out
with a nice short engagement?

38
00:03:32,396 --> 00:03:35,799
Whoa! Hold on, I'm sorry,
but I think you've got
the wrong idea about us.

39
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,302
Julis and I really aren't in
that kind of a relationship.

40
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,171
‐Exactly!
‐Right.

41
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:43,240
Flora told me everything I need
to know about your relationship,

42
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,311
but none of that really matters,
not considering
the circumstances anyway.

43
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,545
Well, it matters to me.

44
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:51,715
You know I'm only doing this
out of concern for you, Julis.

45
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:54,418
Cos if you don't act soon...

46
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:58,422
Huh! Mind your own business,
all right?

47
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:00,891
‐[Ayato] So,
what's all this about?
‐I'm just worried.

48
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:04,996
I don't want her to wind up
like me, married off
to somebody convenient

49
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:07,698
for the Integrated
Enterprise Foundation.

50
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,370
I'm just saying,
you should marry someone
you actually get along with

51
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,771
before it's too late.

52
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:17,941
And you do get along well
with Mr. Amagiri, right?

53
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:22,313
Well, of course, but it's not
a matter of us getting along.

54
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:25,816
Wait a minute, don't tell me
that victory parade yesterday
was just so you could...

55
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:29,420
Yep, to casually
introduce you two.

56
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,457
[Julis] B‐But why are you
trying to do all this now,

57
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:37,794
especially when I refuse to be
part of these absurd ideas
of yours each time?

58
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:40,397
It's quite a different situation
these days.

59
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:44,568
Don't you understand
the effect your winning
the Phoenix Festa had?

60
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:48,805
Until now, you weren't on
the Integrated Enterprise
Foundation's radar.

61
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:54,345
However, because of your recent
victory, you've gotten them
to pay attention to you.

62
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,646
Yes, well...

63
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:57,748
[Jolbert] But there's still time
for us to make the first move.

64
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:02,886
His status as your partner
in the Phoenix Festa makes him
the perfect candidate.

65
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,688
What do you think, Mr. Amagiri?

66
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:08,659
We may be a small nation,
but I'm sure we can afford you
a comfortable lifestyle.

67
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:11,662
Not such a bad proposition,
don't you think?

68
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:13,965
Not bad at all.

69
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:17,868
However, living out here would
mean giving up some freedoms,

70
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,603
isn't that right?

71
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:21,973
As long as you're living
in this world,

72
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,874
it would be foolish
to expect real freedom.

73
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:28,879
Your only choice will always be
to accept the restrictions
that have been put on you.

74
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,348
That may be true, but you should
still be able to choose

75
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:33,350
which restrictions
you're willing to accept.

76
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,388
After all, Julis came
to Asterisk to try and rid
this place of those constraints.

77
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:45,162
So no, I won't let myself become
the shackles that bind her.

78
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,502
You're a lot more serious than
I expected you to be, you know?

79
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:53,070
But hey, I get it, I get it.

80
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,440
Let's forget
we ever talked about it.

81
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,443
‐Of course,
if for some reason...
‐[Ayato] Yes?

82
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,747
If Julis decides she does desire
you to be her shackles,

83
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:06,517
would you accept what I proposed
at that point?

84
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:08,419
How can you even ask him that?

85
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,988
Well, I wouldn't know
unless it actually happens.

86
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:14,591
Good to know.
Then there still might be
a chance to get this to work.

87
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:17,962
[Julis] If there's nothing else,
we need to get going.

88
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,164
‐[Julis] Come on, Ayato.
‐[Jolbert] Hold on a second.

89
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:22,433
Didn't I say there were
two things to discuss?

90
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:24,768
If you're about to make
another ridiculous request,

91
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,703
then you can just stop
right here.

92
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:28,439
[Jolbert] It won't take long,
OK?

93
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:34,411
Julis, would you mind
not competing in next year's
Gryps Festa?

94
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,016
You can't be serious.
What's with you?

95
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:42,419
‐[Jolbert] I am being serious.
‐[Julis] And why is that?

96
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,189
[Jolbert] You saw the crowd
at the victory parade.

97
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:48,592
The way they cheered you on,
the people adore you.

98
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:52,463
You're becoming a greater
influence on this country
than their king.

99
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:56,667
That's why you should stay out
of the Gryps Festa.

100
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:00,271
No way.

101
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:01,805
[door slams]

102
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,540
Oh, what am I gonna do?

103
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,542
You weren't really being serious
just now, were you?

104
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:09,746
I was totally serious.
I meant every word of it.

105
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:12,449
Only one thing
keeps me on the throne,

106
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,785
and that's the Integrated
Enterprise Foundation.

107
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:20,124
At the end of the day,
I'm a good‐for‐nothing king
with not interest in politics.

108
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:22,893
If Julis were to win
the Gryps Festa as well,

109
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:25,096
she'd likely become
a larger influence than me.

110
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:30,034
Wouldn't be surprised if they
decide to place the crown
on her instead.

111
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:34,271
And then she'd try to change
our country and probably try
to help the poor.

112
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:38,242
She doesn't realize just
how much the Foundation
has control over.

113
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:43,047
If Julis were in charge,
she'd wind up suffering.

114
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,750
So, Mr. Amagiri,
I must ask you again,

115
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,121
do you think you can find a way
to change Julis's mind?

116
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,090
I can't.

117
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,160
[sighs] I see.

118
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,862
All right then.
Man, that sucks.

119
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:03,067
Time for plan B.
Just have to work harder
at being good for nothing.

120
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:07,671
And knowing Julis,
you'll find her at the orphanage
across the lake, by the way.

121
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:12,076
Since we were little,
she always goes there
whenever she gets upset.

122
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:15,646
Sorry, but you'll have
to deal with her.

please handle it quickly.

Welcome back, Julis.
I saw the Phoenix Festa.

143
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:34,425
Not bad!

144
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,793
Huh! Well, would you expect
anything less?

145
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,429
Getting pretty cocky, huh?

146

‐What happened to the crybaby...

00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:50,841
in the blink of an eye.

151
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:54,378
Yeah, but how many princesses
do you know that wind up winning

152
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:55,679
something like
the Phoenix Festa?

153
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,549
‐[nun] There's only one.
‐[Therese] I'm so very happy.

154
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:02,219
Happy that Julis chose someone
like you by her side.

155
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,788
Thanks, but we're not...

156
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:06,190
Don't be shy.

157
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,926
I can tell by the way
you looked at her just now.

158
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:11,362
That's enough, girls.

159
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:14,098
No more chitchat.
Time to get back to work.

160
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:15,566
[all sigh]

161
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:18,202
‐[nun 1] Good to see you!
‐[nun 2] So nice
seeing you again.

162
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,137
[nun 3] She hasn't changed
a bit.

163
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,505
It's so nice of her
to stop by.

164
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:25,942
I know the incident with Flora
caused a lot of trouble.

165
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:28,079
I can't tell you
how grateful we are.

166
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,082
Um, but... I wasn't the one
who saved Flora.

167
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:33,017
It was really our friends.

168
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:36,453
Stop being so humble
and accept her thanks
on behalf of the group.

169
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:39,756
‐Right. Thank you.
‐[kids shouting]

170
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:41,925
[Ayato] About the sisters,

171
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:44,895
it seems like some of them
are Genestella, aren't they?

172
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:48,465
[Therese] Including myself,
there are four of us
living here now.

173
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,401
Sister Therese
is my Strega mentor.

174
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,936
She taught me everything I know
about my powers.

175
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,505
[Ayato] Really?

176
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:57,674
[Therese] And I still teach
self‐defense to these children
as well.

177
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:02,679
[Ayato] Over there,
is that a greenhouse?

178
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:08,285
[Therese] Yes. One of the girls
who lived here
loved that greenhouse.

179
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:10,154
It was her favorite place.

180
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:12,589
The mere idea of fighting
disgusted her.

181
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,160
She was truly
a kindhearted girl.

182
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:20,497
[Julis] Excuse me.
I think I'll go get some air.

183
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:24,568
[Ayato] Julis?
I'm sorry, we'll be right back.

184
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:30,774
[Therese] I can see that she
still hasn't moved on.

185
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,851
[Julis] I'm sorry.

186
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:44,021
I must look like a crazy person
with the way that I'm acting.

187
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:49,026
When I was talking
to Jolbert earlier, he seemed
to be really worried about you.

188
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:51,795
I know he is.

189
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:55,399
I know my brother cares,
and I realize that I mean
more to him

190
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,734
than anybody else does
in the entire world.

191
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:00,637
Honestly, it makes me feel
so fortunate.

192
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,775
That's why I can't ignore
the awful conditions
running rampant here.

193
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:07,078
[Ayato] I think you're doing
the best you can.

194
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,247
I mean, that orphanage doesn't
have to worry about anything
anymore, does it?

195
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,116
[Julis] That's true.

196
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:16,753
Winning the Phoenix Festa has
allowed me to finally accomplish
my goal of saving them.

197
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:21,325
But it isn't enough.

198
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,127
I took care of a symptom.

199
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:27,331
At the end of the day,
the system this world's
built on is diseased.

200
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:30,134
More and more, these slums
keep popping up.

201
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:32,436
Or that orphanage.

202
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:34,938
Or children who have no choice
in what happens to them,

203
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:36,940
their innocence stolen.

204
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:44,381
At the very least,
I want to cure this place

205
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,517
and prevent anyone else
from suffering.

206
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:51,355
[Ayato] Then will that
be your wish?

207
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,757
At the Gryps Festa, I mean.

208
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,465
[gasp]

209
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:10,074
That's impossible.
It can't be!

210
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:11,308
What's wrong?

211
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:14,078
No, I'm sure of it.
I just saw my...

212
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,180
‐Ahh!
‐Hold on, Julis!

213
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,983
[Ayato] What's this all about?
What's going on?

214
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:20,851
[panting]

215
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,861
[wind howling]

216
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:42,639
Uhh!

217
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,414
Something about the dirt here
smells rotten.

218
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:06,463
It's been quite a long time,
hasn't it, Orphelia?

219
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:08,966
Did you say "Orphelia"?
No way!

220
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:11,835
[Orphelia] Why'd you come here?

221
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,477
How long has it been, a year?

222
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:22,213
This is the last place
I thought I'd see you

223
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:27,651
Didn't I tell you before?
You'll regret ever trying
to stand in my way.

224
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:32,456
[Julis] I still haven't
given up on you.

225
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,958
Come back, Orphelia!

226
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,860
You don't understand the world
you've become a part of.

227
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,996
[Orphelia] You can stop now,
Julis.

228
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:41,532
I'm only following the path
that's been laid before me.

229
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:46,137
Don't you see, there's nothing
you can do to reverse my fate.

230
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:48,372
Stop lying to yourself!

231
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:50,874
[Orphelia] This is where
my destiny has led me.

232
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:56,047
But if you continue to insist
on forcing me away
from that destiny...

233
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:57,548
Yeah? This time I'm ready.

234
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:00,417
Just don't expect me
to go easy on you.

235
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:04,621
Hey, just wait a minute,
stop it!

236
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:06,757
[Julis] Stay back.
This doesn't concern you.

237
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:08,993
This is between Orphelia and me!

238
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:11,062
But, Julis...

239
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:15,166
[Julis] This time for sure,
I'll break that badge of yours.

240
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,367
Burst into bloom!

241
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:19,570
Livingstone Daisy!

242
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:40,958
So that's what
Orphelia Landlufen's power
is capable of.

243
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:45,029
[Orphelia sighing]
There's no point, Julis.

244
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,965
Why can't you see
you're in over your head?

245
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:54,138
This isn't over!

246
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:56,907
Burst into bloom!

247
00:15:56,907 --> 00:15:59,176
Anemone Coronaria!

248
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:03,347
Let's go! Take that!

249
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:05,416
[boom!]

250
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:15,459
There's no way.
She can't possibly be
blocking it with just her Prana.

251
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:16,760
[Julis]
That's impossible.

252
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,331
[Orphelia] There is no
conviction in your destiny.

253
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:22,599
You're fated to remain weak.

254
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:41,185
Kur... Nu... Gia.

255
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,497
[screams]

256
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:58,735
Julis!

257
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,143
Julis, wake up!

258
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:07,744
[groaning]

259
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:13,384
Miasma. It's the miasma
of the Erenshkigal.

260
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:16,453
And you are Ayato Amagiri, yes?

261
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,223
[Ayato] Can't you see
you've already won?

262
00:17:19,223 --> 00:17:20,657
You've gotta stop this!

263
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:24,461
[Orphelia] It's unfortunate,
but even I can't stop
the wheels of fate

264
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,030
once they start turning.

265
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:29,633
If you don't want
to become a part of this,

266
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,169
you must leave right away.

267
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:35,606
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm not going anywhere.

268
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,243
How regrettable.

269
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,614
Amagiri Shinmei‐style,

270
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:45,649
Repulsing Crow!

271
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:55,926
[Orphelia] Oh,
so that's the Ser Versta.

272
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:58,529
[Ayato] Honestly, what are
the chances I can beat her?

273
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,170
What the...?

274
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:11,175
[Ayato thinking] <i>I get it now.</i>

275
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:16,580
<i>Her miasma,</i>
<i>it's completely undetectable.</i>
<i>How is she doing this?</i>

276
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:20,051
I'm sorry, it's over.

277
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:22,119
You'll be out
of your misery soon.

278
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:42,739
[Gustave] Would you be so kind
as to hold off for a bit,
young miss?

279
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:50,547
Because if you don't mind,
I've been hired specifically
to do away with them myself.

280
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:54,118
And I get paid
on a per‐head basis.
I hope you understand.

281
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:56,120
So if it makes
no difference to you,

282
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,790
could you possibly let me
take these two to finish off?

283
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:03,127
[Dirk] <i>Hey, Orphelia.</i>

284
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:05,162
<i>Where the hell</i>
<i>did you run off to?</i>

285
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:08,599
<i>Which part of</i>
<i>"don't leave the lab"</i>
<i>don't you understand?</i>

286
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,767
I'll start heading back
immediately.

287
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:13,304
[static whirring]

288
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:19,176
You may do as you wish.

289
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:24,181
I am truly very grateful.

290
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:27,151
[Ayato] Hold on!

291
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:34,191
[Gustave] I must admit,
that was quite
the bone‐chilling experience.

292
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:39,696
I've heard the stories
about her, but I never believed
she'd be such a monster.

293
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:41,565
Truly terrifying.

294
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:45,769
Anyway, I'm on a pretty tight
schedule, so we should go ahead
and finish this quickly.

295
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:46,971
Shall we begin?

296
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:50,107
[dramatic music plays,
energy pulses]

297
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,578
[roaring]

298
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:56,380
Please allow me
to introduce my pets.

299
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,584
These are my creations,
namely Orthrus and Cerberus.

300
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:03,354
Impressive beasts, aren't they?

301
00:20:03,354 --> 00:20:06,523
More imposing than the legends
describe them to be.

[Ayato thinking]
<i>We're surrounded.</i>

Amagiri Shinmei‐style...

307
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:37,088
First Sword!

308
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:38,422
Fugaku!

309
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,925
Hyaaa!

310
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:51,035
Ah, there's our
Phoenix Festa champion.

311
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:53,804
However...

312
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:56,140
[Ayato thinking] <i>This time...</i>
<i>I can't escape!</i>

313
00:21:10,154 --> 00:21:12,656
Sorry to have kept you waiting,
Ayato.

314
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:15,192
That was a close one,
wasn't it?

315
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,928
Thanks, Claudia.

316
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:22,066
Well, well, isn't this
quite the predicament?

317
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:25,269
I didn't expect other guests.

318
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:28,072
[Claudia] So, Gustave Malrow,
what's your next move?

319
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:31,542
I wouldn't mind taking you on
myself, right here and now.

320
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,910
But that's not what you want.

321
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,613
No, it's not.
You're an annoyingly
astute young lady,

322
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:38,315
are you aware of that?

323
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:42,486
I'd hate to miss
this opportunity, but I know
when it's time to call it quits,

324
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:45,289
so I'll withdraw for now.

325
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:53,564
[thud!]

326
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,799
[Claudia] Ayato!

327
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:59,170
Are you all right?

328
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,573
Ayato!

329
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,875
Ayato!

330
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:12,083
