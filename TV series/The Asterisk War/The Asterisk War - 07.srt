1
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:14,358
What? That's so lame.
I'm not impressed with Act One.

2
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:16,591
And those are Tenorio's
big guns?

3
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:18,058
You've gotta be kidding me.

4
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:20,724
[Camilla] Well, I hear
the real deal is
what comes next.

5
00:00:20,724 --> 00:00:22,291
[Ernesta] You don't say.

6
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:26,891
Then let's hope that Act Two
will bring down the house.

7
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:45,958
[Shiena Nishizawa singing
"Brand‐new World" in Japanese]

00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,958
[both gasp]

9
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:11,024
Please forgive me.
I... never learned how to swim.

10
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:12,791
Sorry.

11
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,691
No, this is all my fault.

12
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:17,024
I'm sorry for dragging you
into this mess.

13
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:18,624
It's OK.

14
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:20,924
Those things sure are huge.

15
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,258
[gasp]

16
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:24,658
What's wrong?

17
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:28,091
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
Please don't look at me!

18
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:31,591
I'm not, I swear. I meant
this ballast area is huge.

19
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,558
Watch out!

20
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:37,024
[Kirin screams]

21
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:42,058
‐[Kirin gasps]
‐[Ayato] Look at that.

22
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:44,724
[roars]

23
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:48,691
[Kirin] A dragon, feels
just like the smaller ones
from before.

24
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:52,124
In that case, we'd better not
stay around here much longer.

25
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,624
Haaaaa!

26
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:16,958
Ayato, did it hurt you?

27
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:20,024
Nah, I'm all right,
except that...

28
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:23,124
we're kind of in a sticky
situation here, huh?

29
00:03:23,124 --> 00:03:26,358
Listen, if I'm holding you back
in any way,

30
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:28,724
‐then just let go of me, please.
‐Huh?

31
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:32,824
If you should get hurt
because of me, then I...

32
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,258
I couldn't...

33
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:36,691
What's wrong? Are you OK?

34
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:38,724
[Kirin] I couldn't
bear it again,

35
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:42,358
somebody else having
to pay the price
for the likes of me.

36
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:45,658
[Ayato] It's gonna be fine.

37
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,624
You don't have anything
to worry about.

38
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:49,358
But, please, I just...

39
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:53,458
Come on. Any other time,
I know you could totally
annihilate a monster like this,

40
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,991
so it's only fair
to give me a shot.

41
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:58,324
I put up a good fight
against you, didn't I?

42
00:03:58,324 --> 00:03:59,891
Have a little faith in me.

43
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,058
‐But that was...
‐[Ayato] And another thing.

44
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:05,491
[Ayato] Don't ever say
"the likes of me" again.

45
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:07,791
You should give yourself
more credit.

46
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,791
You really are a special girl.

47
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,791
I am?

48
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,358
Thank you.

49
00:04:14,358 --> 00:04:16,124
OK.

50

‐[Ayato] Up you go.
‐[Kirin] OK.

54
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:30,691
[creature roars]

55
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:38,991
She's right,
it is like the smaller ones.

56
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:43,124
Hey, Kirin, you got a read
on the location of its core?

57
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:45,491
[Kirin] Well, yes, I do, but...

58
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:47,391
It's hard to pin down.

59
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:49,158
It's constantly moving
inside him.

60
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:53,058
I gotcha. In that case,
time to give it a try.

61
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:54,758
Try what?

62
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,691
See, I haven't ever had
an Ogre Lux

63
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:59,691
that could withstand my Prana,
until now!

64
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:06,924
No way.

65
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:15,958
[roar]

66
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:21,924
Aaaah!

67
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:32,458
That was amazing.

68
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,924
Thanks, I...

69
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:35,191
Uggh!

70
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:36,424
[gasp]

71
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:38,424
[screaming]

72
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:41,191
Ayato, what's wrong?

73
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:43,824
Are you gonna be all right?

74
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:47,024
Ayato, please,
please stay with me!

75
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:55,791
[Kirin] So, you can only
fight at your full strength
for about five minutes?

76
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,658
‐[Kirin] That's all?
‐[Ayato] Yeah.

77
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,524
But if I really pushed it,
I bet I could go
a little longer.

78
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:03,791
But why would you want
to do that?

79
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:07,491
Why would you go
to such lengths just to fight?

80
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,591
Well, there's somebody
that I'm trying to help out.

81
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:12,958
You mean Miss Riessfeld,
don't you?

82
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,858
[Ayato] Uh... yeah.

83
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:18,458
I think I understand.

84
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:23,391
You and, uh,
Miss Riessfeld, uh...

85
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,224
you're in love with her, right?

86
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:29,724
[Ayato] Uh, I admire her, sure,
as a person and all that, but...

87
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:33,658
So you're not together, then?

88
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:36,858
Never mind,
that's none of my business.

89
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,191
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:39,558
[Ayato] Uh... no problem.

91
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:41,224
[Kirin] Then maybe there's
still a chance.

92
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:44,524
‐What did you say?
‐Nothing! I didn't say anything.

93
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:47,558
The rescue squad sure is taking
a long time to get here.

94
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:53,624
[Ayato] So... mind if I ask
you something now?

95
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:55,091
[Kirin] No, go ahead.

96
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:58,191
[Ayato] Why exactly are you
fighting here at Asterisk?

97
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:01,524
To save my father.

98
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:03,158
He's being detained
as a criminal,

99
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:05,958
so I fight to try and get him
released from prison.

100
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,491
[Ayato] Huh?

101
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:12,291
[Kirin] Five years ago,
a man held up a cafe
my father and I were in.

102
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:16,024
I was held at knife point,
and in the struggle to save me,

103
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:18,491
my father ended up taking
the man's life.

104
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:23,191
Normally, this would
have been excused as
a case of self‐defense,

105
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:26,524
except my father's
a Genestella.

106
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:30,258
I see. So the charges
against him were more serious.

107
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:34,124
[Kirin] Yes. Looking back,
even though I was only eight,

108
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:36,924
I could have easily
taken that man down myself.

109
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:40,491
But I was a coward
and I just stood where I was,
frozen and terrified.

110
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:45,358
That's why I must do something,
or it will be decades
before father gets out.

111
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:49,658
And my uncle told me there was
only one way to save him.

112
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:52,824
‐So you came here to Asterisk.
‐[Kirin] Mm‐hmm.

113
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:56,358
I had no choice.
I'm at the mercy of my uncle.

114
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:58,491
I do what he tells me.

115
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:00,624
I have to.

116
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:03,191
‐You don't have to.
‐What do you mean?

117
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,024
There must be some other option.
You didn't really choose
this path.

118
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:09,024
If you continue, then you're not
going to last very long.

119
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:13,524
And trust me, this is a lesson
I'm only just now starting
to learn for myself.

120
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:18,424
But without my uncle,
I couldn't possibly...

121
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:20,191
There's no way.

122
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:21,824
[Ayato] You'll be fine.

123
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:25,058
Because you're not alone, Kirin.

124
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:27,458
If no one else,
at least you've got my help.

125
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:31,424
Well, just so long as it's
a path you've chosen
for yourself, that is.

126
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,691
Do you really mean it, Ayato?

127
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:40,991
‐[Ayato] Uhh!
‐[Kirin] Huh?

128
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,358
‐Oh, jeez!
‐What?

129
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,858
‐[Kirin shrieks]
‐[Ayato] I'm so sorry!

130
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:49,658
No, it's not your fault.
I wasn't paying attention.

131
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,058
Let's change the subject.

132
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:53,291
Anyway, I hope you don't mind
my asking,

133
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,024
but I couldn't help noticing
you like to pat me
on the head a lot.

134
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:59,158
Oh, uh, sorry.
Does it make you uncomfortable?

135
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:02,791
No. It reminds me of my father.

136
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,124
He used to do that all the time.

137
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:06,224
I see.

138
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:08,691
‐[man] Someone down there?
‐[man 2] See anything?

139
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:11,024
[man 3] Look, there they are!

140
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:13,124
[men shouting]

141
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:18,558
[Koichiro] For the love of God,
Kirin, stop making me
worry so much.

142
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,158
Please forgive me, Uncle.

143
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:23,724
Hmm. Never mind about that.
Let's talk about
your next opponent.

144
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:27,158
Yes, sir, but first there's
something I'd like to ask you.

145
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:28,191
What is it?

146
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:31,691
Just now you said that you
were worried about me,

147
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:34,991
but were you worried about
Kirin Toudou your niece

148
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,091
or about the Kirin Toudou
you use as your tool?

149
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:40,391
Hmm. All I'm interested in
is your power,

150
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,391
nothing more, nothing less.

151
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:45,191
Of course, I understand.

152
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:49,491
And speaking of power, you were
just with that Ser Versta
wielder, weren't you?

153
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,991
‐[gasp]
‐[Koichiro] I hear he had
something to do

154
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,091
with that recent incident
with Arlequint.

155
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:57,658
I don't need him dragging you
into any of his messes.

156
00:09:57,658 --> 00:10:00,224
You're not to see him anymore.

157
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,691
‐I'm not going to agree to that.
‐What did you say?

158
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,458
In the short time
I've known him,

159
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,258
Ayato's taught me
a very valuable lesson,

160
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:12,058
and I believe that there's
still a lot more that I
can learn from him

161
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:13,391
if given the opportunity.

162
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:15,324
Come on,
gimme a break, Kirin.

163
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:19,391
You wanna learn something,
all you need to do is exactly
what I tell you, understand?

164
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:21,724
‐No, I...
‐[Koichiro] Ugggh!

165
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,491
How dare you defy me, girl!

166
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:30,091
Do I have to remind you
that I made you Rank One?

167
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,591
You think Asterisk
is some kind of a joke

168
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,824
or that you could actually
win a Festa?

169
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:36,491
You can't do anything
without me.

170
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:38,691
Well, I know that it won't
be easy.

171
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:41,091
Then shut your mouth
and do exactly as I say.

172
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:43,491
You do want your father
released, don't you?

173
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:47,991
Of course, but I don't think
your methods are the best way
for me to accomplish that.

174
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:52,291
Grr. You got a smart mouth
on you, you little brat.

175
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,658
I am terribly sorry, Uncle.

176
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:57,291
[Koichiro groaning]

177
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,124
I am grateful
for all of your help.

178
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:03,758
However, I've made up my mind
to start fighting my own way,
from this moment on.

179
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:06,758
Because I know if I don't,

180
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:09,858
I'll only live
to regret it someday.

181
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:13,558
Come back here! How do you think
you're gonna make it?

182
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:15,491
First things first.

183
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:17,824
I'm gonna challenge someone
to a duel.

184
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:21,358
And I will pick
the opponent myself.

185
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,458
That's right.

186
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,624
This time,
I choose my own path.

187
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:39,199
Ayato, thank you so much
for agreeing to duel with me.

188
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,799
I'm very grateful.

189
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,765
Yeah, sure, but why pick me?

190
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:44,899
I mean, we just fought
each other the other day.

191
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:48,665
I chose you because I feel
this is the best way for me

192
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:51,399
to take my first true step
on my own, like you said.

193
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,099
‐You've chosen your own path?
‐That's right.

194
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:55,865
Good for you.

195
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,332
But if we're really gonna
do this,

196
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:58,799
then I'm going all out,
all right?

197
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,499
[Kirin] I expect nothing less.

198
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:04,232
[Ayato] Of course, it's not
like I didn't go all out
the last time we fought.

199
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:07,132
What about your Ogre Lux?
You're not going to use it?

200
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:08,799
The Ser Versta slows me down.

201
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,232
I can't keep up with that
speed of yours if I use it.

202
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,665
And I can't lose to you
the same way.

203
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,165
Julis will never let it go.

204
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:18,232
‐[energy pulses]
‐I'll use my brain instead.

205
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:20,532
Looking forward to it.

206
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:30,432
Seriously. Was providing
a stage this elaborate
really all that necessary?

207
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,465
Of course.
Why wouldn't they?

208
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,932
It's a must‐see match
with the Rank One student.

209
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:36,132
But even still...

210
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,099
Look, you gotta chill out,
Riessfeld.

211
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:41,965
Kirin is tough.
Her sword skills are probably
better than Ayato's.

212
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:44,499
‐Exactly.
‐[Saya] Ah, don't
worry about it.

213
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:47,065
[Saya] He's fought a way tougher
opponent before.

214
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:49,865
What opponent?
Who are you talking about?

215
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:53,732
‐Haruka, his older sister.
‐Sister?

216
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,232
Well, the dude definitely has
some kind of plan figured out.

217
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:57,932
Wait, what do you know about it?

218
00:12:57,932 --> 00:13:01,232
Not much, but he did ask me
to loan him an Ogre Lux earlier.

219
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:03,832
Yeah? He asked me for one, too.

220
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:05,432
What does he want them for?

221
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:09,199
Ah, who knows? But I bet
we're about to find out.

222
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,665
‐[buzzer sounds]
‐[announcer] <i>Let the duel begin!</i>

[crowd cheers]

224
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:15,232
Here I come!

225
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,632
It's exactly as I expected.

226
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:33,599
When I hit you,
it felt like thick steel.

227
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:36,665
[Ayato] Well, it's nice to know
my Prana's doing its job.

228
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:40,965
[Kirin] That was also
the first time anyone has
evaded my Conjoined Cranes.

229
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,965
So that was
the infamous technique, huh?

230
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:46,199
Nesting State,
Citrus Bloom,

231
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,499
Side‐by‐side Wings,
Blue Sea Wave.

232
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:52,599
In the Toudou style, there are
49 of these conjoined skills.

233
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:57,165
When they're all combined,
it results in an unbeatable
multi‐hit attack:

234
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:58,732
Conjoined Cranes.

235
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:02,032
With this move, I am invincible.

236
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:04,665
There's no doubt,
I'll be victorious.

237
00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:09,332
Then if you're so sure about it,
I better not hold anything back.

238
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,499
Haaaa!

239
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,965
[Kirin] I've got him.

240
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:18,665
[gasp]

241
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:23,599
[Kirin thinking]
<i>Did his Météo arts fail?</i>

242
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:31,865
Amagiri Shinmei‐style,
Spear Skill.

243
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:34,065
Ninth Cloud Wasp.

244
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:35,432
Spear Skills?

245
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:38,199
That's right!
Did I catch you off guard?

246
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:41,332
[Kirin] Yes, but that was
nothing but a cheap trick.

247
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,099
No way.

248
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:48,132
Well, bring 'em on.
More where these came from.

249
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:49,599
[Kirin] Haaaa!

250
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,765
Amagiri Shinmei‐style,
Short Sword Technique.

251
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:54,332
Reaper!

252
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,332
This is it!

253
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:04,732
Amagiri Shinmei‐style,
Grappling Technique Skill!

254
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:06,465
Purifying Sweep!

00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:13,532
[gasps]

256
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,632
You doing OK?
Those were some nice moves.

257
00:15:20,632 --> 00:15:22,132
You really fooled me.

258
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:25,265
Both the spear and
the short sword were decoys.

259
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:32,199
I concede defeat.
I've been beaten.

Amazing. Who could have guessed
that you'd win?

Congrats, Ayato.
You looked cool out there.

265
00:15:50,923 --> 00:15:52,656
Well, that's good to know.

Sure.

269

Forgive the intrusion.

270
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:02,423
I brought a guest.
Now, don't be shy.

271
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:05,523
Um, hello. Pardon me.

272
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:07,323
Hey, Kirin.
What are you doing here?

273
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:10,856
[Claudia] Yes, well,
apparently, she has
some business with you.

274
00:16:10,856 --> 00:16:12,223
[Kirin] Oh, um...

275
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:16,290
if I may be so bold,
I was wondering if
the offer still stands

276
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,090
to join in
on your practice sessions.

277
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,656
[all] What?

278
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:23,590
[Kirin] Oh, uh, well,
Ayato had invited me
to join him before,

279
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,390
but unfortunately, at the time,
I had to decline his offer.

280
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,056
Well, that's news to me.

281
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:32,490
Sorry, but just think
about how much better
our practices could be

282
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,290
if somebody of her caliber
joined us.

283
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,890
You make a valid point, but...

284
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,223
Yeah. Iron sharpens iron.
Bring it on.

285
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:40,623
It's not your call.

286
00:16:40,623 --> 00:16:43,523
And while we're on the subject
of practice, who invited you

287
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:45,956
to start joining our sessions
every single day?

288
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:48,256
Oh, would you like to file
a formal complaint?

289
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:50,990
Because I'm not going anywhere.
Get over it.

290
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,556
I will not be undermined,
you little weasel!

291
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:56,423
They're like this all the time,
but are you still interested?

292
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,523
Yes, absolutely.

293
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:02,523
That's great. You're in.

<i>Open up the door, damn it!</i>

296
00:17:19,023 --> 00:17:21,990
What kind of idiot are you,
you brainless girl?

297
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,923
You duel without my permission,
and not only do you lose,

298
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:28,690
but you're humiliated, too,
so is it clear to you now?

299
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,090
You can't do anything
without me helping you!

‐Ugh!
‐I'm sorry, Uncle, I really am,

‐I've decided.
‐Shut up, just shut up!

How many times do I have
to tell you to obey me!

[thwap!]

305
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,290
I hate to break it to you,
but she's on her own path now
of her own choosing.

306
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,523
She doesn't have to obey
anyone, not anymore.

307
00:17:55,523 --> 00:17:58,290
Who the hell do you think
you are, raising a hand to me?

308
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,023
I'm not a Genestella.

309
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:01,856
You sure about this, Kirin?

310
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:05,623
Don't forget, I'm the one
who covered up the truth
about your father.

311
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:08,290
If you refuse to leave
this room with me right now,

312
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,423
I'm gonna tell everybody
the whole story!

313
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,523
You don't say?
What an interesting
choice of words.

314
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:16,323
What the...
Why, you're Enfield's daughter.

315
00:18:16,323 --> 00:18:20,890
Of course, it isn't my intention
to interfere in matters
between you and Miss Toudou.

316
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,690
That said, she is a student
of Seidoukan Academy,

317
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,690
making her an asset
to this school

318
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,756
and to the Integrated
Enterprise Foundation.

319
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:33,223
Any intention to corrupt her
for your personal gain

320
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:35,423
simply cannot be overlooked.

321
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:37,856
And I'm sure that,
were she here,

322
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:40,490
my mother would make
the same judgment.

323
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,490
[Kirin] Wait, Uncle!

324
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,090
I appreciate everything
you've done for me,

325
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,623
and I truly mean that.

326
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:54,590
If it hadn't been for you,
I never would have come
to Asterisk

327
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,556
and I never would have met
anyone here.

328
00:18:56,556 --> 00:19:02,156
And so I'm very... grateful...
for everything.

329
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:05,323
Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.

330
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,323
Uncle.

331
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:17,956
See you at training tomorrow.
OK, Kirin?

332
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,356
OK.

333
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:22,623
I wouldn't miss it.

334
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:26,856
‐Oh, um, before I get going...
‐Yeah? What's on your mind?

335
00:19:26,856 --> 00:19:29,923
Well, there are a couple
of things I've been
meaning to ask you.

336
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:32,790
Actually, they're more like
two favors.

337
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,023
Like what?

338
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:36,356
If it would be all right
with you,

339
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:38,656
apart from our being
training partners,

340
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:41,423
would it be OK if I called you
my friend, too, maybe?

341
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:44,490
Is that all? Sure, no problem.
Of course you can.

342
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,223
So, what's the second favor?

343
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:49,856
[Kirin] Oh, right.
Well, Ayato, um... I...

344
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,490
What's up?

345
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:57,656
I was just wondering if maybe
you wouldn't mind considering me
as your friend also.

346
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:01,956
Sure, Kirin, no problem.

347
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:03,956
Thanks!

348
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:06,190
[Ayato] Well, we've got
some training to do.

349
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,690
[Kirin] Right,
let's get started.

350
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:12,290
‐[boom!]
‐[student] Damn it!

351
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,890
I only came along
because he said this
was just a puppet test.

352
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,656
I didn't know the two of us
were going to have to fight
something like this.

353
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,490
[explosion, screams, static]

354
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,790
And that, my friend,
is how you get it done.

355
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,190
Victory may not be
a pipe dream after all.

356
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,890
Course not. You had to know
that I wouldn't have settled
for anything less.

357
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,390
And I was able to collect
some data on our "red flag"
of a swordsman.

358
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,390
[Ernesta giggles]

359
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,956
Oh, I love this part.
Just look at him go!

360
00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:46,790
I think I'm drooling.

361
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,156
[Camilla] Tenorio have
certainly lost face now,

362
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:52,023
and the fact that you've
acquired this data

363
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:53,390
simply by watching
their failures,

364
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,590
that's icing on the cake.

365
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,956
[sighs] Now then,
ladies and gentlemen of Tenorio,

366
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:03,156
and Seidoukan Academy as well,
I humbly thank you

367
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:05,290
for your efforts,
all for my sake!

368
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,123
I couldn't have done it
without you.

369
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:10,490
Now, please, sit back, relax,
and enjoy the main event.

370
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,756
I'm sure you'll each be glued to
your seats until the bitter end!

Oh, it's just you.
You startled me, Sasamiya.

393
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:06,623
I didn't see you there.

394
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:08,823
‐Hey, Toudou.
‐What is it?

395
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:12,023
[Saya] I heard you're here
fighting for your father's sake.

396
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,290
Is that true?

397
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,523
Why, yes it is.

398
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:17,956
That's admirable of you,
very admirable.

399
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:19,223
[Kirin] It is?

400
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:22,523
Actually, my father
is the reason why
I'm fighting also.

401
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:24,423
What? Really? You are, too?
