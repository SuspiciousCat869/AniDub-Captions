Yo. So you're
this Irene Urzaiz, huh?

Try using this.

All right, tell me
what your heart desires.

You OK?

18
00:02:09,332 --> 00:02:12,099
I'm fine.

19
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,665
We have to go soon.

00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,365
OK! Then what do you say

21
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:20,565
we go and get
this task out of the way?

22

Are you sure?

23
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:27,499
[Irene] Hey, don't worry.

24
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:29,532
You just need to focus
on doing your thing

25
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,965
and let me handle
all the fighting, all right?

00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:35,932
Though, to be honest with you,

27
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:38,199
we'll have to come out
using everything we've got,

28
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,932
or things will get messy.

Sorry about this.

It's fine.
I really don't mind it, but...

32
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:22,965
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:25,765
You're such an idiot.

34
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:28,232
You have nothing
to apologize for.

35
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,099
[Priscilla] Right.

36
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:41,789
[Julis]
OK. It's almost show time.

37

Oh. Mm‐hmm. Guess so.

38
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:48,856
What's with you?
Don't tell me you're
spacing out before a match.

39
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:52,856
Not quite, but there's something
I'd like to try out.

00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:04,223
‐[Julis] Ayato?
‐[Ayato] Hmm?

41
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,289
[Julis] I'm winning this match
no matter what.

42
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,223
I don't care who
our opponent is.

43
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:11,856
I have no intention
of giving up my wish.

44
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:14,623
That's why I'm doing this.
Understand?

45
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:15,989
Yeah.

46
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,923
[Julis] But... how we win
makes little difference to me.

47
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:23,789
If we claim victory doing things
your way, then so be it.

48
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:25,889
Don't forget, we're partners,

49
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,623
and we'll win
this competition together,

50
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:30,223
fighting hand‐in‐hand.

51
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:33,989
Julis, thank you.

52
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:37,689
You idiot, there's no reason
to thank me for doing my duty.

53
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:40,623
Remember, we're facing
the Gravi‐Sheath.

54
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:46,123
Even so, I think it'll work.
Really.

[sighs]

56
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:49,656
It's not like I could
stop you anyway.

57
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,623
That said, I doubt we'll get
more than one chance.

58
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:54,623
At least we'll know
we did our best.

Have it your way.

disappoint, does it?

Gotta say, I never thought that
you'd try and take out

00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:31,423
It's the ultimate fire skill

[Julis] No way.

157
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:59,256
Don't tell me she staved it off

00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:20,729
[Julis] Hey!

316
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:22,296
It's time...

317
00:20:22,296 --> 00:20:23,663
to face this.

318
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:25,963
I need to tackle
my seal head‐on.

319
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:35,463
Ayato, don't try
to fight this alone, OK?

320
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:36,829
[Ayato] What?

321
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:39,329
As I said,
you and I are partners.

322
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:41,829
And since you're so hellbent
on having my back,

323
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:44,996
just know
I'll have yours as well.

324
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:48,429
Thank you, Julis.

[Claudia, Saya and Kirin]
Ayato!

327
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:56,663
Ayato, are you feeling
all right?

328
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,896
Oh, yeah, I'm just fine.
Uggh!

329
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:00,596
[Kirin] Oh, no, Ayato!

330
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:05,129
Gotta say, you don't exactly
look just fine.

331
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,463
Oh, you poor thing.

332
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:09,729
Normally, I'd want you
to take a long rest,
but in this case...

333
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,529
[Ayato] Huh?

334
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:13,396
‐[girls gasp]
‐[Saya] But in this case,

335
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:16,763
I'm gonna take care of you,
in order to speed up
your recovery time.

336
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:18,929
And I'll also take care of you.

‐[Ayato] Ooh!
‐I'll make you rice balls, too!

[Ayato, muffled voice] Kirin!

339
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:27,696
[Julis] Hey, don't you two
have a match to worry about
or something?

340
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:29,996
In that case...

341
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:32,263
I believe I'll be the one
to nurse Ayato

342
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:35,429
given that I have no matches
to attend.

343
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,429
Of course it goes
without saying,

344
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,729
but if you wish,
I'll stay all night.

345
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:41,429
[Ayato] Hey, hold on!

346
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:44,196
Jeez, calm down, you guys!

[girls] Ayato!

[Ayato] You all have
this super‐scary look
in your eyes.

00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:49,863
[Julis] Enough is enough,
you three.

this isn't good for Ayato?
‐[Eishirou] Seriously?

is gonna end.
