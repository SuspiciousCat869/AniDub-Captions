Master, while sparring with
all those prospective students,

12
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,870
I was rather curious
as to what you were watching.

13
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,872
Oh! A match from the Festa.

14
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,510
And I saw a new fighter who was
truly amazing, Hu Feng.

15
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,212
Seidoukan's Ayato Amagiri
or something.

16
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,215
In terms of raw talent,
that kid was the best.

17
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,750
Really exciting to watch.

18
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,120
Think it's too late for him
to play for us now?

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,523
That's easier said than done.

20
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:05,959
Besides, from what I've heard,
his powers are somewhat
limited, right?

21
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,629
[Xinglou] That's precisely
what makes him so intriguing.

22
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,898
[Hu Feng] I believe he is going
up against Song and Luo next.

23

[Xinglou] He is?

24

we're headed for a clash

might go a little overboard.

to Song and Luo?

Honestly, that's really
all I'm in it for.

If Amagiri and his teammate

it will just increase
his capabilities even further.

That's what I'm looking forward
to the most.

the players must have gotten
even more details.

So how much do you think
they already know?

70
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,048
[Julis] Well, for starters,
it's safe to assume

71
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:51,785
the match against Irene
gave them a rough idea about
that time limit of yours.

Yeah, I guess so.

73

they're aware

a lot more than that

Then in that case,

86
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,630
I just need to find out
two things:

87
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,765
How can you still have such
formidable defensive skills

when your powers
have been sealed away?

Oh, well, if it's just defense,
I can get by using experience
alone, up to a point.

OK.

And as for the other thing,

92
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,612
think there's any chance
you'd be able

93
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,781
to release your full power,
even if it's for a split second?

94
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,686
I could probably pull it off
at least one more time.

95
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:03,323
Very well then,
these are our opponents,

If you could fight
at your full strength,

then defeating those two
would be fairly simple.

about both at the same time.

00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:20,426
[Meeko] <i>Although recently,</i>
<i>some rumors have been</i>
<i>swirling around about Amagiri.</i>

152
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,096
[Tram] <i>That's right,</i>
<i>and if what we heard is true,</i>

153
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,798
<i>the disadvantage to his team</i>
<i>could be huge.</i>

154
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,367
[Meeko] <i>Has he recovered</i>
<i>from the damage he sustained</i>

155
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,835
<i>after releasing his powers?</i>

156
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,538
<i>And will he be ready to go out</i>
<i>and fight again today?</i>

157
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,908
‐[crowd cheers]
‐[Meeko] <i>OK, this is the match</i>
<i>we've been waiting for.</i>

158
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,944
<i>Here's Seidoukan Academy's</i>
<i>Ayato Amagiri</i>

159
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,280
<i>and Julis‐Alexia von Riessfeld!</i>

160
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,850
<i>And now their challengers</i>
<i>have arrived.</i>

161
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,321
<i>It's Jie Long's Seventh</i>
<i>Institute's Song and Luo.</i>

162
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:53,860
Hey, Amagiri, whether
those rumors about you
are true or not,

163
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,030
Luo and I aren't gonna
hold anything back.

164
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:02,035
Truth be told, we would have
preferred to go head‐to‐head
with you when you were 100%.

165
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,404
But we must follow the rules
of the Phoenix Festa.

166
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:08,308
‐So don't take it personally.
‐Huh? You don't have to...

167
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,512
[Song] We just wanted to let you
know that before the match.

168
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:13,847
[Ayato] Uh... right.

169
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,181
[Julis] Whaddya know?

170
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,218
Sounds like they really are
true warriors.

171
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,287
Yeah, I didn't know
those still existed.

172
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,025
[crowd cheers]

173
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,227
[Meeko] <i>Both teams have now</i>
<i>taken their places.</i>

174
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,797
More than likely, they're
going to start off
by testing you

175
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,833
to find out if you're
at full strength again.

176
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,369
And they'll know right away.
There's no getting around that.

177
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,804
I suppose so.

178
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,807
[Julis] OK, listen up, Ayato.

179
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,810
This is your mark here.
You need to remember it.

180
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,679
[Ayato] Uh, yeah.

181
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,814
Now, the signal's still
the fireworks, right?

182
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,717
Make sure you've met
all the conditions by then, OK?

183
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,252
[Ayato] Got it.

184
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,958
[Meeko] <i>All right,</i>
<i>which team is going to feel</i>

185
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,293
<i>the sweet thrill of victory</i>
<i>here in the fifth round</i>

186

<i>and head to the quarterfinals?</i>

187
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:07,200
<i>It's match eight, round five,</i>
<i>of the Phoenix Festa.</i>

188
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,102

[battle cry]

192
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,961
As I thought.
The rumors were true.

193
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,030
You're not at full strength.

194
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,131
[battle cry]

195
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:43,336

00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,338
[battle cry]

197
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,709
Aaah!

198
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,313
Ayato, he got past me!

199
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,128
[crowd cheers]

200
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,131
[chuckles] Do you think
you can take this?

201
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,198
Come on.

202
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,067
[Meeko]
<i>Whoa, I can't believe this.</i>

203
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,737
<i>Amagiri is under siege.</i>
<i>Didn't see that one coming.</i>

204
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:21,007
<i>That Song and Luo team's</i>
<i>coordinated attack was</i>
<i>masterfully done.</i>

205
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,543
[Tram] <i>And it looks</i>
<i>like Amagiri's using</i>

206
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:25,879
<i>quite a bit less Prana than</i>
<i>we've seen in earlier matches.</i>

207
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,115
<i>So, maybe those rumors</i>
<i>are true after all.</i>

208
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,288
Come out!

209
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,489
Loropetalum!

210
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:49,970
[Meeko] <i>Aaah! Is this yet</i>
<i>another one of Riessfeld's</i>
<i>incredible skills?</i>

211
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,273
<i>A gigantic wall of flames</i>
<i>has appeared out of nowhere.</i>

212
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,843
<i>And it's divided</i>
<i>the stage in two.</i>

213
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,913
I see, you're trying to keep me
separated from Luo.

214
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,716
Now, let's fight one‐on‐one.

215
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:06,186
[Song] Do you truly believe this
is going to make a difference?

216
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,121
[Ayato] I don't think it's
gonna be easy,

217
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:13,126
but even so, that doesn't mean
I should give up, does it?

218
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,296
Rather impressive.
Guess I was wrong.

219
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,264
Do forgive me.

220
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,469
What's wrong?

221
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,272
I see you've been overhyped,
Glühen Rose.

222
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,775
[Julis thinking] <i>This is someone</i>
<i>who's ranked 23?</i>

223
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,477
<i>At Seidoukan,</i>
<i>he'd easily be a Page One.</i>

224
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,679
Haaaaa!

225
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,516
[Julis] Livingstone Daisy!

226
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:43,056
I get it.
So that's what's going on here.

227
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:46,359
You're expending your power
to keep the flames going.

228
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,362
But you could have turned this
into a one‐on‐one battle

229
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,631
without any of this.

230
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:52,398
Why use these elaborate tricks?

231
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,734
I had no choice.

232
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:57,538
It's the only way
Ayato and I have a shot
at winning this match.

233
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:58,805
[Luo] Ahh.

234
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,040
Then that can only mean

235
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,276
you have something else
up your sleeve, don't you?

236
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,048
‐[crowd cheers]
‐[Ayato panting]

237
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,051
[Song] I have to admit,
I admire you.

238
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,954
Even though you've been
focusing on defense,

239
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:16,456
you've been able to withstand
all my attacks.

240
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,392
And I'm also aware that if you
were fighting at full strength,

241
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,728
then our roles
might well have been reversed.

242
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:26,432
No, I don't think I could have
held out as long as you have.

243
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,435
Well, I'm not sure...

244
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,237
that's necessarily true.

245
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,373
But I simply couldn't live
with myself

246
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,142
if I went on battering you
in this way.

247
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,545
So, out of my great respect
for you,

248
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,147
my next move will finish this.

249
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,586
Well, you'd better hurry...

250
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:48,589
or the battle just beyond
this wall will be over soon.

251
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,125
[Julis] Are you implying my
team partner is about to lose?

252
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,395
[Luo] In his current state,
Murakumo has no chance,

253
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,663
now does he?

254
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,898
I suppose not.

255
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,166
For Ayato to defeat you
in his current condition,

256
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,069
he would have to try and
catch you off guard somehow.

257
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,607
Hah. Well, Song and I would
never be foolish enough

258
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,709
to leave ourselves open.

259
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,311
[Julis thinking]
<i>So it's that side.</i>

260
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,060
Try protecting yourself
all you want,

261
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,494
but my fist is lethal.

262
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,833
I would advise you dodge it
rather than trying to block.

263
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,500
[Ayato thinking] <i>Julis.</i>

264
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,772
This is it!

Oh, no, you don't!

[Julis] Amaryllis Duo Flos!
Aaah!

268
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,417
[Ayato] The signal!

269
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,119

<i>Catching</i>
<i>their opponents off‐guard,</i>

278
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,628
<i>they showed some</i>
<i>stunning teamwork.</i>

279
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,897
<i>Amazing!</i>

280
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:39,065
Actually, what they just pulled
off wasn't quite so simple.

281
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,901
What do you mean by that?

282
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:44,838
[Tram] <i>Song and Amagiri</i>
<i>were battling each other</i>
<i>in some close‐quarter combat.</i>

283
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,575
<i>Meanwhile, Luo was busy</i>
<i>countering Riessfeld's</i>
<i>long‐distance assault.</i>

284
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:52,546
<i>By switching places,</i>
<i>the Seidoukan team messed up</i>
<i>their opponents' timing</i>

285
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:55,649
<i>and were able to catch</i>
<i>each of them off guard.</i>

286
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,551
<i>Pretty incredible!</i>

[footsteps, Ayato sighs]

288
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,123
I guess we pulled it off, huh?

289
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:06,560
The fact that we even
got through the match
is the real victory.

290
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,862
So after you get a full day's
rest in tomorrow,

291
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,065
you should be able
to go all out when it's time
for the next one, right?

292
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,601
Oh, yeah, that won't be
a problem at all.

293
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,737
But I've been wondering
about you, Julis.

294
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:18,171
Are you gonna be OK?

295
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:22,308
[Julis] Well, nothing seems
to be broken, so I'm sure
I can handle it.

296
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,277
Now, about our next match.

297
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,080
Even if you get
all your strength back soon,

298
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,815
our next opponent should be
a handful.

Yeah, that's what I've heard.

00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,556
[Julis] Huh.

301
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,859
I'm sure you didn't come here
to offer your congratulations,

302
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,261
so what do you two want
with us?

303
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,596
[Song] Actually, you're wrong.

304
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:45,799
You were the one who came up
with that strategy,

305
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,133
weren't you, Glühen Rose?

306
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,368
Yes, that's right.

307
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:51,037
The combination you pulled
was astounding.

308
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,973
You must really trust
each other.

309
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:55,609
You both wiped the floor
with us today.

310
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,243
Amazing job.

311
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,314
Well...

312
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,116
But there's something
you both should know.

313
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:06,953
That strategy of yours
won't have any effect
on your upcoming opponents.

314
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,488
[Julis] And what does that mean?

315
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:12,292
It's simply a warning,
nothing more, nothing less.

316
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,394
That's funny.
The next team we're up against

317
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,196
just so happen to be
friends of yours.

318
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,464
How am I supposed
to trust you?

319
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,233
[Song] We might
go to the same school,

320
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,569
but that doesn't mean
we're friends.

321
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:26,640
[Luo] Neither of us sees
eye to eye with Li Shenyun
and Li Shenhua.

322
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,974
Never have.

323
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,678
That said, we're not about
to clue you in
on their weak points.

324
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:36,382
But quite frankly, we feel
more an affinity for you
than for those twins.

325
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,586
Just want you to know,
you both have our full support.

326
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,822
All right, then let me
ask you again,

327
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:44,891
why did you say our strategy
isn't going to work?

328
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:48,595
[Song] Because, when it comes
to deception, trickery

329
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:52,332
and surprise attacks,
those two are highly skilled.

330
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,635
They'll see right through
any plan that you can devise

331
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,236
and then one‐up you
at every turn.

332
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,005
In battle, you see
your opponents as equals

333
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,643
and are willing to face whatever
challenges may come your way.

334
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,477
But those twins
are much different.

335
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,514
They constantly look down
on their opponents

336
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,750
and never expose themselves
to danger.

337
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,352
It's how the Li twins
have always been.

338
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:15,789
And it's the thing we can't
stomach about them.

339
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,758
[Shenyun] Well, well, well.

340
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:21,227
First you go down
in a pitiful defeat...

341
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,396
[Shenhua] And now you're
trash‐talking other people

342
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,599
with the same ones
who crushed you.

343
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,800
Damn you!

344
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,304
[Shenyun] It's nice to meet you,
Glühen Rose, Murakumo.

345
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,107
My name is Li Shenyun.

346
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:37,077
And mine is Li Shenhua.

347
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:40,246
[both]
Hi. It's truly a pleasure.

348
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,148
What is it you want?

349
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,951
Oh, we just wanted
to offer you an apology.

350
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,219
A what?

351
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:49,189
You see, unfortunately,
it appears our friends here

352
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,857
put up quite a lame fight.

353
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:55,696
[both] As students
of the same master,
we couldn't be more mortified.

354
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,365
Well, I didn't think there was
anything lame about it.

355
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:04,671
It simply won't do for disciples
of the Divine Revelations
to be seen as weak.

356
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,707
So we'll do everything
in our power

357
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,610
to show you a world
our elder brothers couldn't.

358
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:14,581
[both] The depths
of Star Senjutsu, soon...

359
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,821
[Julis] Pretty annoying duo,
weren't they?

360
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,657
But, including the two of them,
three more victories

361
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:26,192
and we stand to win
this entire tournament.

362
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:27,594
Three times, huh?

363
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,764
That's a lot more demanding
than it sounds.

364
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:33,433
Well, at least you know
what we can expect.

365
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,770
So, have you thought about
what you're going to ask for

366
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,404
if we pull this off?

367
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,608
Uh, hmm. I can't really
come up with anything.

368
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,477
Kind of had a feeling you might
say something like that.

369
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:47,480
Now look, I'm so grateful
to you for fighting with me,

370
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,252
and honestly, it, uh,
makes me happy.

371
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,854
But, Ayato,

372
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:57,991
it's time for you to think
about what you really
want for yourself.

373
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,259
[Ayato] Hmm.

374
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,428
Yeah, I guess, but...

375
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,599
What about your older sister?

376
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,868
Why don't you
have them find her?

377
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:12,405
[Ayato] I'm sure she must
have had her reasons
for leaving home.

378
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:15,075
So I won't go out of my way
to look for her.

379
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,978
[Julis] But finding your sister
would be the fastest way

380
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:20,313
to do something about
your seal, wouldn't it?

381
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:23,784
Yeah, well, that's true,
but I...

382
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,920
‐Don't tell me you're...
‐[monitor blips]

383
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,321
<i>Yoo‐hoo.</i>

384
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,690
<i>Hello, you two.</i>

385
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,692
You came here
just to see us?

386
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:33,694
<i>We're sure you're both</i>
<i>completely exhausted,</i>

387
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:36,897
<i>so we wanted to congratulate</i>
<i>you as soon as possible.</i>

388
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:38,832
[Ayato] Then I'll open the door
right now.

389
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:41,635
<i>Uh, before you do, I thought</i>
<i>I should let you know</i>

390
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,103
<i>that there's</i>
<i>another guest with us.</i>

391
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:45,672
<i>Think it would be OK</i>
<i>if we brought her in, too?</i>

392
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:46,907
[Ayato] A guest?

393
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:49,409
<i>Yeah. To see Riessfeld.</i>

394
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,778
[Julis] To see me?

395
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,085
‐Hello, your highness!
‐[Julis] But you're...

396
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,788
Long time, no see!
I've missed you!

397
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,156
[Flora giggles]

398
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,926
[Julis] F‐FLora!

399
