00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,933
I would have concluded that we
were in for an easy victory.

157
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:27,300
However, right now
all I can feel is incredible
admiration for you both.

158
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,233
Ugggh!

159
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,166
[crowd cheers]

160
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,233
Saya! Hey, Kirin!

161
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,933
It looks like they did quite
a number on the two of you, huh?

162
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:06,500
We'd still be fighting
if our school badges
hadn't been smashed.

163
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,000
We're really sorry you have
to see us looking like this.

164
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,366
[Ayato] No. There's nothing
to be sorry about.

165
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:15,733
[Julis] Not at all.
And when we face those
puppets in the finals,

166
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,500
believe me, they'll be punished.

167
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,200
Won't they, Ayato?

168
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,133
I mean, we'll give it
our best shot, but...

169
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:25,266
How can you say that with
a straight face after seeing
what happened with our match?

170
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:29,233
You must be even stupider
than I thought if you think
you still have a chance.

171
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,533
[Julis] Guess I am, then.

172
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,866
After all, I've been planning
for a clean sweep

173
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:36,033
from the very beginning,
and I suppose I'm just
stupid enough

174
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,400
to believe something
like that could come true.

175
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,552
Guess I do, too.

176
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:43,318
All right.

177
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:49,085
Make 'em pay.

178
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:52,452
Sure thing. We've got this.

179
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:55,118
[knock on door]

180
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:57,118
That must be Flora.

181
00:14:57,785 --> 00:14:59,885
Please excuse me.

182
00:14:59,885 --> 00:15:02,352
[Kirin] Oh, come in.

183
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:04,852
[Claudia] Ms. Sasamiya,
Ms. Toudou.

184
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:06,552
I'm sorry you lost today.

185
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:10,085
But that said, you should both
be proud of how far you've come.

186
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:15,418
Thanks to you, Seidoukan
is expected to have a rather
strong performance this season.

187
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:17,418
Oh, no, we didn't really...

188
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,785
Honestly, I only did it
for myself.

189
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,385
Flora sure is late,
isn't she?

190
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:25,485
I know.
I'm getting pretty worried.

191
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:29,452
She was supposed to meet us here
after the match was over.

192
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:33,485
[monitor beeps]

193
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:36,018
[Camilla] It's me.

194
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,685
What was that?

195
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:40,785
‐Huh?
‐Just a second.

196
00:15:40,785 --> 00:15:42,952
Dirk Eberwein wants to talk.

197
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:47,085
Ohhh! Yeah, sure, go ahead.
Put him on.

198
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:50,452
<i>Am I speaking</i>
<i>with Ernesta Kuhne?</i>

199
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:52,985
[Ernesta] It's a pleasure
to meet you, Tyrant.

200
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,318
So, what can I do for you?

201
00:15:55,318 --> 00:16:00,185
Cos I thought you people were
getting along pretty well
with Magnum Opus.

202
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:02,752
[Tyrant snarls]
<i>All I did was agree</i>

203
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:06,118
<i>to mutual noninterference</i>
<i>with that crazy woman.</i>

204
00:16:06,118 --> 00:16:08,218
Well, of course you did.

205
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,352
After all, she never
did forgive you

206
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:13,752
for snatching her precious
Erenshkigal from her.

207
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:15,218
<i>Who cares about any of that?</i>

208
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:19,218
<i>I have a proposition.</i>
<i>Join forces with us.</i>

209
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:21,085
Huh. Unbelievable.

210
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:24,218
Hmm, aren't you being
the presumptuous one?

211
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:27,352
Shouldn't you spend a little
while getting to know us

212
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:29,218
before you start making
proposals?

213
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,452
<i>I'm not wasting any time.</i>

214
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:33,818
<i>If you cooperate,</i>
<i>I'll make certain</i>

215
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:36,852
<i>that you're appropriately</i>
<i>rewarded, that's all.</i>

216
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:38,052
Rewarded?

217
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:40,318
<i>I have a souvenir</i>
<i>you can take home.</i>

218
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:42,952
<i>You can each make your decision</i>
<i>after seeing it.</i>

219
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,752
[Ernesta] Huh.

220
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:46,652
[monitor beeping]

221
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:48,418
Hey, it's from Flora.

222
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:51,885
Seriously, what is going on
with that girl?

223
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,685
[static]

224
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:56,018
[man's garbled voice] You're
Julis‐Alexia von Riessfeld,
correct?

225
00:16:56,018 --> 00:17:00,618
‐[Julis] Who is this?
<i>‐The owner of this line</i>
<i>is in my custody.</i>

226
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:03,685
<i>Is Ayato Amagiri there?</i>

227
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:05,485
Yeah, it's Ayato speaking.

228
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:07,518
Flora hasn't been harmed,
has she?

229
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:09,185
[static]

230
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:11,785
[Flora] <i>Your highness!</i>
<i>Mr. Amagiri!</i>

231
00:17:11,785 --> 00:17:13,985
‐Flora!
‐[man] <i>She's unconscious.</i>

232
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:18,118
‐If you meet my demands,
she goes free.
‐What do you want?

233
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:21,685
<i>Apply for an emergency freeze</i>
<i>on the Ser Versta.</i>

234
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:25,085
<i>And remember, if you turn</i>
<i>to the police or special ops</i>

235
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:29,118
<i>or withdraw from the Festa,</i>
<i>her safety will not</i>
<i>be guaranteed.</i>

236
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:31,752
‐That is all.
‐[Julis] Hey, wait!

237
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:34,418
Flora.

238
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:41,085
Claudia, what did he mean by
"apply for an emergency freeze"?

239
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:43,752
When its wielder feels
they're in danger,

240
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:47,052
they can request their Ogre Lux
to be forcefully sealed.

241
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:51,385
Of course it's possible
to have it removed,

242
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:55,552
but you'd never be able to use
the Ser Versta again.

243
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:56,685
[Kirin] That means...

244
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:58,652
That means, if I ever
attempted to seal it,

245
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:02,952
it would never let me return
as its wielder.

246
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:07,885
So, how exactly do you think
I should go about putting in
this request?

247
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,885
Are you sure
you want to do this?

248
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:13,552
‐[Ayato] Yeah.
‐I'm so sorry, Ayato.

249
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,885
But how do we know he'll
actually let Flora go

250
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,718
if he gives in
to his demands anyway?

251
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:19,352
[Julis] What choice do we have?

252
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:21,952
Simple. We can go
rescue Flora ourselves

253
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:25,418
and bring her back here
safe and sound.

254
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,952
This may work.

255
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:29,318
If we pretend to accept
all of his demands,

256
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:32,785
it will give us the time
that we need to find her.

257
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:34,852
[Claudia] I've got it.

258
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:37,418
I know just how we can do this.

259
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:45,485
The only thing that matters
right now is making sure
we get Flora back.

260
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:48,552
Even if that means having
to give up the Festa?

261
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:49,885
I don't care.

262
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,385
To win knowing
she's still out there

263
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:54,252
would go against everything
I've been fighting for.

264
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:56,052
Sorry about that.

265
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,952
It must sound like I'm only
thinking of myself.

266
00:18:58,952 --> 00:19:00,518
There's nothing for you
to worry about

267
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:02,818
cos I feel exactly
the same way you do.

268
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:04,885
Ayato.

269
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:06,385
Really.

270
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:10,652
I hate to say it, but your fear
of loss is pretty excessive.

271
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:15,452
I can't help it.
I've lost someone close.
I won't go through it again.

272
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:19,252
Flora will be rescued
and you will win the Festa.

273
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,852
At least have enough faith
in that.

274
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:26,018
I'm not telling you this
as the Student Council president

275
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:28,018
but as your friend.

276
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:29,485
Claudia.

277
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:33,385
OK, then.

278
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:35,418
The very thought of
that abductor getting his way

279
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:37,252
is starting to make
my blood boil.

280
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:40,418
‐[smack!]
‐Let's get Flora back.

281
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:43,918
All right, then we're gonna
go ahead and get ready.

282
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,685
‐We'll save her.
‐Wait a minute.

283
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,652
[Julis] Sasamiya.

284
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:50,552
Listen.

285
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:52,118
Julis.

286
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:55,718
Look, it's only natural to help
when a friend's in a jam,
you know?

287
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:57,185
You can always rely on me.

288
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:59,518
Yes, you can rely on me, too.

289
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:03,485
I'm sorry.
I guess you're right.

290
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:07,685
Saya, Kirin,
I'm counting on you.

291
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:10,252
We won't let you down.

292
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,043
[Claudia] <i>Ayato, I want you to</i>
<i>do exactly as you were told</i>

293
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:22,343
<i>and apply</i>
<i>for the emergency freeze.</i>

294
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:25,377
<i>I'll delay the process</i>
<i>with my connections.</i>

295
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:29,477
<i>As an internal</i>
<i>Seidoukan procedure,</i>
<i>it's less likely to be leaked.</i>

296
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:33,243
<i>He still wants you</i>
<i>to participate</i>
<i>in the Phoenix Festa.</i>

297
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:37,343
<i>I would assume that this is</i>
<i>to confirm all of the demands</i>
<i>have been met.</i>

298
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:41,110
<i>That said, until we can</i>
<i>confirm Flora's safety,</i>

299
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,477
<i>keep the Ser Versta hidden</i>
<i>and use another Lux</i>
<i>in the meantime.</i>

300
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,510
<i>As for the mastermind,</i>
<i>Dirk Eberwein is likely</i>
<i>behind this,</i>

301
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:54,410
<i>since Ayato and the Ser Versta</i>
<i>are the abductor's targets.</i>

302
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,343
<i>If that's the case,</i>
<i>then the abductor is probably</i>

303
00:20:57,343 --> 00:21:00,377
<i>a member of ReWolf</i>
<i>intelligence, Grimalkin.</i>

304
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:03,177
<i>We can narrow down</i>
<i>the search to their territory</i>
