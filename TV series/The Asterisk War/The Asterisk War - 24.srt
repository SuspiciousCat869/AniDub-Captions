154
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,066
as long as it helps me catch
my prey, that is.

155
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:20,933
So, without further ado,
let's get your friends
to join our party.

156
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,866
‐Hah!
‐[snaps fingers]

157
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,466
[energy pulses]

158
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,300
Hold on, is that a hydra?

159
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,033
[Gustave] Yes, Your Highness,
that is indeed a hydra.

160
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:46,966
Isn't he every bit as
frightening...

161
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:51,000
no, he's more frightening
than what you've read about
in mythology, don't you think?

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,166
Now then, having lured
in my prey, I've no use
for that orphanage.

163
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,633
All that's left is
to finish you off without delay.

164
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,200
It's been fun, but it's time
for me to be on my way.

165
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,066
Do enjoy your last moments.

166
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,533
[Julis] Get back here!

167
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,266
[Ayato] Julis!

168
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:26,500
‐[Julis] Sorry about that.
‐[Ayato] No, don't worry
about it.

169
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,000
[Julis] Damn it.
If I want to protect the city,

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,366
I've got to find a way
to stop this thing.

171
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,166
[Ayato] The police
won't be coming.

172
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,900
We've got to do something
about it ourselves.

173
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,800
Julis, can you help
evacuate the civilians?

174
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Are you crazy?
You can't stop it
all by yourself.

175
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,333
I'll do what I can.

176
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,500
Besides, Saya should be done
with her preparations
pretty soon.

177
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,633
You can't do this!

178
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:49,300
[Ayato] You're more familiar
with this area than I am,

179
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,500
and everyone here would
listen to you, wouldn't they?

180
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,966
All right, fine.

181
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:56,733
Just try and be careful
out here, OK?

182
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,866
So there's no doubt
about it, huh?

183
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:05,466
[Eishirou] <i>None.</i>
<i>I can also send you</i>
<i>the evidence I've gathered</i>

184
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:06,633
<i>if you need me to.</i>

185
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:10,433
Thank you, but right now
that won't be necessary.

186
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,433
[Ayato thinking] <i>That's as far</i>
<i>as you're gonna go!</i>

187
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:28,333
<i>Time to stop this!</i>

188
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,166
Arrrgh!

189
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:38,366
Heh!

190
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah!

191
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,333
[Ayato thinking]
<i>Its head regenerates,</i>
<i>just like in the myth!</i>

192
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,066
[Saya] <i>Hey, Ayato.</i>

193
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:06,000
Let's kick some butt.

194
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:17,237
Thanks for the save.
That was a close one.

195
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,537
‐We're taking down that dragon
with all the heads, right?
‐Yeah.

196
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,170
[Saya] <i>So what's the plan?</i>

197
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,103
[Ayato] Gustave really
went all out when he
made this monster.

198
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:26,870
Just like in ancient mythology.

199
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,737
All of the Hydra's heads
will keep on growing back

200
00:12:29,737 --> 00:12:32,237
until we manage to chop off
the one in the middle.

201
00:12:32,237 --> 00:12:33,870
So we'd better
take him out fast.

202
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,703
<i>Exactly, and we can</i>
<i>both stay in contact</i>
<i>through this monitor.</i>

203
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:39,203
OK, then, let's go.

204
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:41,803
Time to bring it!

205
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,003
Hyaaaa!

206
00:12:58,203 --> 00:12:59,437
[roar]

207
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:00,970
All right, that's two.

208
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,837
<i>Hey, four o'clock!</i>

209
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:13,870
Now it's four down!

210
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,970
[Saya] <i>There's one on your tail!</i>
<i>I've got it.</i>

211
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:22,570
That makes six.

212
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,337
Saya, let's finish it off.

213
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,937
[Saya] <i>Understood.</i>

214
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:33,537
[energy pulses]

215

217
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:41,403
Aaaaah!

218
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,470
[Ayato thinking]
<i>One more head to go.</i>
<i>This ends now.</i>

219
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,803
Ayato, incoming, three o'clock!

220
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,670
[Ayato thinking] <i>Did it speed up</i>
<i>its regeneration by</i>
<i>focusing on one head?</i>

221
00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,937
We're not done!

222
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:28,337
Hyaa!

223
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,837
Great job keeping
that thing distracted

224
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,070
cos I just finished
setting up my attack!

225
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,803
Come out!

226
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,637

00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:47,370
Hyaaaa!

229
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,403
Yaaaa!

230
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,403
[Gustave] How unexpected.

231
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:11,603
What do I have left
to throw at them?

232
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,370
Hmm?

233
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,603
Well, how did you manage
to find me?

234
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:20,437
You're the type
to keep your distance,

235
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,370
but you still want
to see what happens,

236
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,937
so you would find somewhere safe
to watch the battle that isn't
too close to the action.

237
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:28,303
[clang!]

238
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,303
Looks like Julis had you pegged.

239
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,570
[Gustave laughs]

240
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,770
So that's it.
You girls truly are
an annoying bunch.

241
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,737
A little too smart
for your own good.

242

244
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:49,670
Kirin here.
Gustave's been captured.

00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,037
[clang]

246
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,403
[Claudia] Hello, father.

247
00:15:56,403 --> 00:16:00,070
It's my understanding that
Gustave Marlow's been captured.

248
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,903
[father] It feels like ages
since I last saw your face,
Claudia.

249
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:08,537
[Claudia] So a member of Galaxy
hired a criminal to assault
a Seidoukan student

250
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:11,470
and that student happens to be
a princess no less.

251
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,537
Galaxy had nothing
to do with it.

252
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,403
I acted completely
of my own accord.

253
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:17,003
[Claudia] Surely,
such subterfuge

254
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:20,637
wouldn't do a single thing
to help a man stuck
in your position.

255
00:16:20,637 --> 00:16:24,303
My mother would agree,
or do you think she'd
judge you differently?

256
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:25,937
[father] She'd agree.

257
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:29,237
Your mother wouldn't hesitate
a second to throw me
under the bus

258
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:30,837
if she thought it was necessary.

259
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:32,803
That being said,
anything you may have uncovered

260
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:35,603
won't be of any use to you
whatsoever.

261
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:36,670
Probably.

262
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,703
And yet you insist on competing
in the Gryps Festa.

263
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,970
Just let it go.

264
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,370
You already know what will
happen if you do this,
don't you?

265
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,070
Please, think about it!
At least change your wish.

266
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,437
There's still enough time,
Claudia.

267
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:52,937
I've already told you,
nothing will change my mind.

268
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,803
I won't go back on my word.

269
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:58,870
I love you, I love you
more than anything.
You know that, don't you?

270
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,637
Please!

271
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:04,270
[Claudia] I do appreciate
everything that you've done
for me.

272
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,503
I'm truly grateful, father.

273
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:09,703
That's all.
Have a good night.

274
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:11,437
[father sobbing]

275
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,370
[Jolbert] I really do
have to thank you all.

276
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,303
You've helped to restore peace
in our fragile nation.

277
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:24,770
Our citizens are just
as grateful.

278
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,837
By the way, Julis,
the people in the old city
are so fired up,

279
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:30,870
they just might go and throw you
another parade.

280
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,837
Does this mean you're actually
starting to lose the support
of our citizens? Well?

281
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:40,070
Cos if that's the case,
there's something really
important I need you to know.

282
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,537
Yeah, what would that be?

283
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:46,270
I'm going to win
the next Gryps Festa.

284
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,537
Then I'll expand the powers
of Lieseltania's king.

285
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,203
The attacks over the last
few days have convinced me.

286
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:57,037
I want to change this country.

287
00:17:57,037 --> 00:18:00,337
Doing something more fundamental
may be the only way
to do that.

288
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:05,503
Hah. We could use
the Festa money to increase
the king's influence.

289
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:07,137
It would be quite doable.

290
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:11,337
If I do win, you're going
to have to become a more
responsible leader.

291
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:14,703
I know it's a burden,
but please, for my sake.

292
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:18,703
I need your support.
Will you help me change
this country?

293
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:22,770
Hah. Oh, Julis.

294
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,870
You've grown so much
since I last saw you.

295
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,570
I never dreamed
the day would come
that you'd ask for my help.

296
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,870
Thank you.

297
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,403
You've done so much.

298
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,603
I'm glad my sister found
such great friends.

299
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:39,837
Whatever you need,
count me in.

300
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:41,103
I promise, Julis,

301
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:45,037
if you really manage to come out
on top at the Gryps Festa,

302
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:47,437
I give you my word
I'll try harder.

303
00:18:47,437 --> 00:18:49,870
I won't be
such a carefree king.

304
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,437
Thanks so much.

305
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:54,237
We can shape this country.

306
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:58,703
Those two really love
each other, don't they?

307
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:00,370
They really do.

308
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,303
[monitor chirps]

309
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,103
The Committee Chairman?

310
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,870
[Madiath] <i>Mr. Amagiri.</i>

311
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,503
<i>I have news.</i>
<i>Your sister's been found.</i>

312
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,870
[Ayato thinking] <i>Haruka.</i>

313
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,737
[Madiath] Haruka Amagiri
was brought to this hospital
around five years ago.

314
00:19:24,737 --> 00:19:27,903
She's been in a deep coma
ever since she was admitted.

315
00:19:27,903 --> 00:19:32,703
Despite her condition,
she hasn't aged at all
since that day.

316
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:35,403
I believe it's
the effect of some kind
of unidentified power.

317
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:38,703
According to the doctors,
there's nothing they can do
at this time.

318
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:40,870
This looks like the work
of Haruka's ability.

319
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,237
Her Imprisonment Power
allows her to bind all things.

320
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:46,237
I just don't understand why.

321
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:49,237
Why would she ever decide
to cast it on herself?

322
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:52,237
If she doesn't come out
of her coma soon,

323
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:54,803
how long before
her life is in danger?

324
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:57,603
[Madiath] If there's no change
in her current condition,

325
00:19:57,603 --> 00:20:00,370
the doctors say that she'll
outlive all of us,

326
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,570
if you can actually
call this living, that is.

327
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:09,370
[Hilda giggles]

328
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,937
[Hilda] So I understand
they found your sister.

329
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:13,403
Ayato Amagiri.

330
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:19,737
I can cure your sister
and wake her from
that awful coma if you'd like.

331
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:22,970
All right, now, who are you,
and how do you know
about my sister?

332
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,537
[laughing]

333
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:27,537
My name's Hilda Jane Rowlands.
Nice to meet ya.

334
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:31,870
I'm the chairman
of the Arlequint Academy
Research Institute.

335
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,437
But I'm also known as...

336
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,337
Magnum Opus.

337
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,570
Once again, I apologize.

338
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,203
My father's caused
so much trouble for you.

339
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:51,037
But why would your father
willingly try to stage
an attack like that?

340
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:55,337
Probably because it would
inconvenience him if I win
the Gryps Festa.

341
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,270
Inconvenience Galaxy,
I should say, not my father.

342
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,203
[Kirin] Yeah, but wasn't there
any other way he could
have done it?

343
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:06,103
[Claudia] Most likely,
he was desperate to convince me
to drop out of the Festa

344
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:07,837
before Galaxy
could ever make a move,

345
00:21:07,837 --> 00:21:11,537
cos if they came looking for me,
my father knew
what would happen.

346
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,270
They would have taken
very drastic measures.

347
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,470
Do you realize
everything you risk
if you go through with this?

348
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,703
If you're making
an enemy of Galaxy,

349
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:23,270
you're making yourself an enemy
of Seidoukan as well.

350
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,370
I know, but I don't intend
on conceding my wish.

351
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,670
And it doesn't matter what
enemies I make along the way.

352
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,203
All of you, wouldn't you feel
the same in my position?

353
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:37,203
Now, if you decide
to follow me,

354
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:40,003
it could mean making
Galaxy your enemy.

355
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:43,003
I know it's a lot of me to ask,
but I'd still like you

356
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:44,703
to join me in the Gryps Festa.

357
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:48,970
And when you think about it,
isn't being a part of this team
worth it to you?

358
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,970
Everyone in this lineup is
someone I would trust with
my life, no questions asked.

359
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,670
So count me in.

360
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,303
Yeah, me too!
I won't back down either.

361
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:00,737
When I saw you
in the last Gryps Festa,

362
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:04,137
I knew right away that I wanted
to fight by your side,
Ms. President.

363
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:07,603
I'll only do it
if Ayato does it, too.

364
00:22:07,603 --> 00:22:09,970
[Claudia] So, what do you say,
Ayato?

365
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,403
What'll it be?

366
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:15,703
[Ayato thinking] <i>I have</i>
<i>no intention of asking</i>
<i>Magnum Opus for help.</i>

367
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:20,237
<i>But if there's a way to wake</i>
<i>Haruka from her coma...</i>

368
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:25,770
I've decided, you can
count on me to join you
as well, Claudia.

369
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,903
And by working together,
we can win this.

370
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:30,970
No matter what!

371
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:40,003
