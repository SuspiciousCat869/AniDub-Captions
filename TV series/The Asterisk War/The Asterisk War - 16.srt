Congratulations!
Your match was totally cool!

161
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,477
It was really, really amazing
and exciting and awesome,

162
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,880
and I'm so glad you two won!

163
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,782
Thanks, Flora.
Glad you had fun.

164
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,051
Hey, you really should
calm down.

165
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,453
[Claudia] Flora's energetic
as usual, isn't she?

166
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,055
It's good to see you.

167
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,824
[Ayato] Claudia, wait.
You and Flora know each other?

168
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,861
Yes. She is Julis's
maid‐in‐waiting.

169
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:44,798
[Flora] Miss Enfield is
the kindest, nicest person ever!

170
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,633
‐Oh, you don't say?
‐[Claudia] Anyway...

171
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:51,004
I wanted to congratulate
you both for making it
to the semifinals.

172
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,839
Thanks to your great efforts,

173
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,509
Seidoukan is doing well
in the Festa.

174
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,177
As the school representative,

175
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,479
I'd like to express
my gratitude.

176
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,382
Well, uh, there's really
no need for you to thank us.

177
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,483
[Claudia] Don't be silly.

178
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,687
You've done more than enough
to earn my thanks.

179
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,022
And not just as
a school representative,

180
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,957
but from me personally
as well.

181
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,329
So, let me thank you
in my room tonight.

182
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,198
‐[Ayato] Whoa!
‐[Claudia] Come along!

183
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,668
‐[Ayato] Hold on a minute.
‐Time to get going, Ayato.

184
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,737
‐[Flora giggles]
‐[Julis] Wait!

185
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,306
Just what do you think
you're doing?

186
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,875
He looks pretty exhausted
to me,

187
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,311
so I'm taking him back
to my room for some rest.

188
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,515
Might even offer him
a personal massage.

189
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,683
You're not taking him anywhere!

190
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:40,286
We need to sit down and discuss
our strategy for tomorrow.

191
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:44,024
[Claudia] Ayato needs to relax,
you can strategize later!

192
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,826
[Julis] We need to start
planning right now!

193
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,562
‐[Ayato] Come on, you two!
‐[Claudia] Stop keeping him
to yourself, Julis!

194
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,669
[man] The Phoenix Festa
is performing much better
than expected.

195
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,605
At this point, we've already
exceeded last year's box office

196
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,106
and attendance numbers.

197
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,142
Seems it's our best one
on record.

198
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,745
Permitting Arlequint's
surrogates to compete

199
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:07,380
was also quite
the stroke of genius.

200
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,684
[Madiath]
Haruka's younger brother.

201
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,018
‐Hmm.
‐Sir?

202
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,187
[Madiath] It's nothing.
Never mind.

203
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,422
I appreciate you
keeping me informed.

204
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,191
[assistant] Of course.

205
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:31,471
Now... on to the semifinals.

206
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,444
[Kirin] Hey, what's that?

207
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,646
Hmm?

208
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,682
Oh, this is my good luck charm.

209
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:45,586
It's a magical ticket that
grants you any wish you desire.

210
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:47,888
Ahhh! Sounds amazing.

211
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,956
So, what was it
that you were wishing for?

212
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,758
Maybe a victory
in today's match?

213
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,126
Not that.

214
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,128
This is only a good luck charm.

215
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:59,432
Taking down our opponents is
something that we're going to do
all by ourselves.

216
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,037
Yeah, you're right.
This is our win.

217
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:08,374
‐Kirin.
‐[Kirin] Yes? What is it?

218
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,943
I want to thank you.

219
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,978
[Kirin] Huh?
What are you talking about?

220
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:15,649
There's no way I could
have ever made it this far
without you helping me out.

221
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,783
I'm grateful.

222
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,553
Please, you don't have to...
I mean, it's just that...

223
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:22,355
I'm the one that needs
to be thanking you.

224
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:26,793
Because of your help,
I'm so much closer
to finally saving my father.

225
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,262
Your father?

226
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,499
There's something
I want to tell you.

227
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,235
Yes?

228
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,504
Well, my father got
in a pretty bad accident

229
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,705
and lost most of his body.

230
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:41,508
It happened down at the lab
where he used to work.

231
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,876
[Kirin] Huh?

232
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,245
Fortunately his brain
wasn't damaged,

233
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,313
so now he just
has to stay at home

234
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,416
and remain connected
to the central unit
in his workshop.

235
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,920
Don't feel bad for him.

236
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,758
These days he has complete
freedom to research
whatever he wants to

237
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:59,092
with all his heart and soul.

238
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,761
He says he's happier now.

239
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,195
[Kirin] Whatever he wants to?

240
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,998
Yeah, like making
guns and hardware for me.

241
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,568
He only makes them for you?

242
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:08,869
[Saya] Uh‐huh.

243
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:10,804
So in a way, what Camilla said

244
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,539
wasn't all that far
from the truth.

245
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,942
These weapons were made
for me and me alone.

246
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:20,346
They were never created
to be manufactured
and sold to the masses.

247
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,715
And that's why

248
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:26,052
I can never forgive someone
who insults my father.

249
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,429
[Ernesta]
Hey, hey there, ladies!

250
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,064
Long time, no see!

251
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,000
What do you want?

252
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,668
[Ernesta] Oh!
That's pretty cold.

253
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,805
Camilla says there's something
that she simply has to tell you

254
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:47,040
right before
our match starts, so...

255
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,342
It's been a long time,
Saya Sasamiya.

256
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,713
It seems that I may have
slightly misjudged you earlier,

257
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:55,882
and I just wanted
to let you know, in person.

258
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,718
‐[Saya] Misjudged?
‐[Camilla] Yes.

259
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:59,653
I noticed during
your last match.

260
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:04,124
If taken separately,
those Luxes of yours
are all rather defective.

261
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,627
But then, looking at them
as part of you,

262
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:10,831
as a single weapon, I must admit
that they're without any rival.

263
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,999
‐Then‐‐
‐[Camilla] However...

264
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:17,203
that probably means
they're likely to cause
more organic instability.

265
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,673
They're not suited for combat.

266
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:24,410
[Saya] Well, I'll make you
eat those words by crushing
your puppets.

267
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:28,915
‐Impossible
‐[Kirin] Calm down, Saya!

268
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,416
Although...

269
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,353
if you two should win
against our puppets,

270
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,589
I'll gladly take back
what I said.

271
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,026
Ferrovius and I have poured
all our resources and technology

272
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:43,196
into developing
Aldy and Rimsy's systems.

273
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,999
So if you somehow manage
to defeat them,

274
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:49,269
I suppose your Luxes
are suited for combat.

275
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:53,073
[Ernesta] See ya! [giggles]

276
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,412
Come on, let's go.

277
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,855
‐[crowd cheers]
‐[Kirin] Yeah!

278
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,757
[Aldy] Now, listen up!

279
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,693
We're going to grant you...

280
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:18,198
a one‐minute grace period today.

281
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,201
There it is.
I knew this one was coming.

282
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,637
<i>Aldy's trademark declaration.</i>

283
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:26,640
<i>Even with the grace period,</i>
<i>these amazing puppets won</i>

284
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,342
<i>each and every match after</i>
<i>the declared one minute was up!</i>

285
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,912
[Tram] <i>Their opponents haven't</i>
<i>only reached the quarterfinals</i>

286
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:35,281
<i>but are riding a wave of</i>
<i>momentum that's all their own.</i>

287
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,783
<i>Let's see</i>
<i>if the Sasamiya‐Toudou duo</i>

288
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,251
<i>can hold out the minute.</i>

289
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,354
‐Kirin, big one is yours.
‐Right.

290
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:44,725
‐[sword clanks]
‐Let's show 'em what we've got.

291
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,132
[Aldy] Hmm.

292
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,201
[Meeko] <i>Phoenix Festa</i>
<i>semifinals match one!</i>

293
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,137
<i>Battle...</i>

294
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,205
<i>begin!</i>

295
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:02,075
Then ready or not, here I come.

296
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:05,045
‐[Aldy] Well,
Kirin Toudou, right?
‐[Kirin] That's right.

297
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:08,882
[Aldy] If what you're planning
is to try and breach
my defensive barrier,

298
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:12,052
then I believe it would
make much more sense
for Saya Sasamiya

299
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:14,621
to take me on
with her high‐output Lux.

300
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,623
At least that would be
my advice.

301
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,860
‐You should either switch now
or launch a two‐prong‐‐
‐[Kirin] You done?

302
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,828
Come take me on.

303
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,229
[Aldy] Hmm?

304
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,199
[Kirin] You're so certain
that my sword can't
pierce your barrier,

305
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,602
better get ready
to be proven wrong.

306
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:32,839
[Aldy] Very well. If you insist,
then go ahead and try me.

307
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,378
It's futile.

308
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,381
You will never surpass me
in terms of reflexes

309
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:44,350
so long as you're human.

310
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,920
It's clear now, I understand.

311
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,455
That's all I needed.

312
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,594
[Aldy] I said it was futile.

313
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,565
[thwack!]

314
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,100
What?

315
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,803
[Meeko] <i>Wow!</i>
<i>Absolutely incredible!</i>

316
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,037
<i>It finally happened.</i>

317
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,405
<i>Aldy's come under attack</i>

318
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,708
in this tournament
for the first time ever!

319
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,544
[Aldy] Ridiculous!
This is impossible!

320
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,979
[Kirin] Please take back
what you said to me earlier.

321
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,280
[Aldy] What do you mean?

322
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,583
And take this fight
more seriously.

323
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,152
[Aldy] I have no idea
what you're implying.

324
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,655
You've been mocking us
long enough now.

325
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,323
Face us fairly.

326
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:29,696
[applause]

327
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,965
If you're not willing to fight
at full strength,

328
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,300
I'll end this now.

329
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:42,709
[inhales sharply]

330
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,114
Hyaaaa!

331
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,250
[Meeko] <i>I can't believe my eyes!</i>

332
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,052
<i>Aldy's taken a major swing</i>
<i>at Toudou!</i>

333
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:56,990
<i>And it's only been 56 seconds</i>
<i>since his declaration.</i>

334
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,695
[Aldy] Wonderful.

335
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:09,469
I was wrong to underestimate
your abilities as a human.

336
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,273
I humbly retract
what I had stated.

337
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,409
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like you to explain

338
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,679
how you managed to get past
my barrier.

339
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:21,281
It worked because
you're just a machine.

340
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,850
[Aldy] I'm not certain
I understand.

341
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,788
You used all my data
and movements to predict
how I'd attack.

342
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,223
Then you created
that defensive barrier.

343
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:32,859
[Aldy]
Yes. As I am programmed to do.

344
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,795
[Kirin] When using
the Toudou‐style,

345
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,964
you can trick
your opponent by adjusting
your breathing patterns

346
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,233
and muscle movements in battle.

347
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,836
And when two experienced
swordsmen square off,

348
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:47,207
they read each other, preparing
for their opponent's next move.

349
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,409
But because you're a machine,

350
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,378
your natural tendency
is to react to my movements.

351
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:58,451
In other words, your lack
of combat experience
will be your downfall.

352
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,454
[Haruka Chisuga singing

353
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,223
Now, that's my Kirin.

354
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:04,691
[Rimsy] I don't understand.

355
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:11,832
You didn't launch
a single attack during
the one‐minute grace period.

356
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:16,903
It would be fair to say that it
almost looks like you two are
the ones who are mocking <i>us.</i>

357
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:21,407
Only thing I've wanted
was the chance to fight you
while you're going all out.

358
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:25,846
Otherwise, it would be
pointless for me.

361
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,742
[Meeko] <i>Unbelievable!</i>

362
00:22:55,742 --> 00:23:00,714
<i>A single shot from Sasamiya</i>
<i>ends in a clean hit</i>
<i>against Rimsy!</i>

363
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,817
As you can tell,
I won't be holding back either.

364
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,451
Come get some.

365
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,458
[crowd cheers]

366
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,096
[Flora shrieking]

367
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:20,066
Miss Sasamiya and Miss Toudou
are both so amazing!

368
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,268
[deep voice] Hey!

369
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,270
[Flora] Huh?

370
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,039
Aaah!
