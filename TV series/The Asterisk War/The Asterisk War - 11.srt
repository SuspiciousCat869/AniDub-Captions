00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:15,181
Congratulations on making it
all the way to the final round.

2
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,481
I look forward
to your next victory.

3
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:19,481
Thanks, I'll give it
everything I've got.

4
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:22,781
But I'm sure my opponents
will be doing the same.

5
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:26,314
Now the pressure's on me
since I'm drawing your matchups.

6
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:28,181
But enough about that.

7
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:31,148
Now that we're alone...

8
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:32,948
I want to spend
some time with you.

9
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:34,414
It's been a while, you know.

10
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:35,648
[Ayato] Uh...

11
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:37,781
[Claudia] Julis
and those other girls,

12
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:39,748
always keeping you
to themselves.

13
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:44,481
Not fair.
I've really missed you, Ayato.

14
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,248
[Ayato] I'm... flattered, but...

[monitor blips]

16
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:51,481
Um, could you give me
a second?

17

<i>Ayato, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Hope I'm not interrupting.</i>

18
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,548
What's up?

19
00:00:57,548 --> 00:00:59,381
<i>Well, I don't really know</i>
<i>when or how,</i>

20
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:01,214
<i>but I seem to have lost Saya.</i>

21
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:03,481
What? Gone again, huh?

22
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,448
<i>Yes, I even called her, too,</i>

23
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:07,481
<i>and she confirmed</i>
<i>that she's lost someplace.</i>

24
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,881
<i>She doesn't even know where!</i>

25
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,381
Gotcha. I'll help you look,
so don't worry.

26
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,414
You're in the business district,
right?

27
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:16,014
I'll head that way.

28
00:01:16,014 --> 00:01:19,314
<i>I really appreciate this.</i>

29
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:23,081
Sorry, Claudia,
it looks like I have to go.

30
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:26,448
But we're finally getting
to spend quality time together.

31
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:28,448
[Ayato] Look, I'm really sorry.

32
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:30,748
I promise that
I'll make it up to you.

33
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:32,181
[Claudia] Hmm.

34
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:33,981
You do believe me, right?

35
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:36,248
[Claudia giggles]

36
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:38,448
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

37
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:41,781
I guess I got
a little carried away there. Oh!

38
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:44,781
Oh, uh... Come on, Claudia,
give me a break.

39
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:47,781
I really was looking forward
to spending some time with you.

40
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:51,048
I don't see why I can't
at least have a little fun.

41
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:52,648
Uh...

42
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:54,381
Although I suppose
it wouldn't do

43
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,581
to leave poor Sasamiya
lost out there somewhere.

44
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:01,081
You owe me,
and you better pay me back.

45
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:03,048
Right, sure thing.

to hand her over.

‐Oh, sorry.

Thank you so much.

I don't know
what I would have done

if you hadn't been there
to rescue me.

66
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,196
No worries. But why were
those guys after you anyway?

67
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:29,163
I'm not really sure, but I think

68
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,963
they're all from the casino.

69
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:32,630
My sister...

70
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,030
apparently she caused

71
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,430
quite a stir there

Don't get the wrong idea
about her, OK?

My sis is...
Uh, what I mean is,

76
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:45,996
my sister has a temper,
and I guess sometimes
it gets the best of her.

77
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:48,996
But deep down she's
a really kindhearted person.

78
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,063
I let her know those guys
were after me,

79
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:53,563
and she said she'd come
save me right away.

80
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:55,663
Yeah? Sounds cool.

on Priscilla!

Amagiri came to my rescue!
Please, you have to believe me!

That's enough.

87
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,630
Why would Ayato Amagiri want
to try and save you, Priscilla?

He is our enemy, so what
in the hell is in it for him?

Tell me you don't mean that.

Relax, I'm done.

you won't get violent
with Amagiri again?

I won't, I swear.

on your life?

[Korona whimpers]

[Dirk] That's what this
is about?

One of the conditions
of my contract with you

was that my sister
would remain unharmed.

[Dirk] I've not forgotten.

But not everybody at ReWolf
is interested in following
my orders, you know.

Listen, I can't protect her
all the time.

Where are the Cats that you said
are supposed to be guarding her?

Come on, isn't your sister
a regenerative?

What's the big deal if she gets
a little scratch now and again?

Die!

Now, tell me something, Irene.

Who would you be bitching at
if I weren't around?

147
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:18,263
For the record, that little punk
from Seidoukan was playing hero,

148
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:21,563
so the Cats weren't able
to move in and help Priscilla.

149
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:26,263
Under no circumstances are they
to be seen, understand?

150
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:29,196
[Irene] Got it,
but Mr. Chivalry did save her.

151
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:31,330
Now I'm gonna have to pay
the bastard back.

So, what in the hell do you
expect me to do about it?

No way I can fight him
like this.

It's cramping my style.

00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,730
You don't have to do anything.

156
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,096
Just stay out of my way
while I fix it.

00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:46,430
‐Do what you want.
‐[scoffs]

158
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,463
‐[Korona sighs]
‐She's super scary.

159
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:55,796
‐[Dirk] Hey, Korona.
‐[Korona] Yes, sir?

160
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:59,230
‐Do a reading.
‐Huh?

161
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:29,696
OK. Good news, Chairman.

162
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:34,096
According to this,
we can expect a victory
for the Urzaiz sisters.

163
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:36,296
[Dirk] Hmm, no surprise there.

164
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:41,163
Korona, bring me
one of the vice chairmen.
I don't care which one.

165
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,063
Yes, sir.
I'll be right back.

166
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:49,263
[Dirk] The results of her
readings are always accurate.

167
00:09:49,263 --> 00:09:52,130
[groans] I had better be ready.

168
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,930
[beeping]

169
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:01,563
Now put me through
to the Seventh Golden Eye.

170
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:10,896
[Julis] Hold on.
A dinner invitation?

171
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:12,896
Don't tell me you accepted it?

172
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:14,296
I did.

173
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:16,863
You know that Irene
and Priscilla

174
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:19,763
are our next opponents
in the Festa, don't you?

175
00:10:19,763 --> 00:10:21,296
[Ayato] Well, yeah, but...

176
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:24,396
they're kind of doing this
as a thank‐you.

177
00:10:24,396 --> 00:10:25,930
Ehh...

178
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,363
You are hopeless.

179
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:31,563
I suppose if we're going
to continue being friends,

180
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:34,930
I'll have to get used
to this kind of behavior.

181
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:38,130
All right.

182
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,463
I will accompany you tonight
at this dinner of theirs.

183
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:42,563
[Ayato] You'll what?!

184
00:10:42,563 --> 00:10:46,530
[Julis] They invited you
to dinner at their apartment?

185
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,230
‐Why not at a restaurant?
‐I have no idea.

186
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,596
It's a really nice place,
though, huh?

187
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:56,130
Just what you'd expect
for a ReWolf Page One.

188
00:10:57,463 --> 00:11:00,563
‐[bell chimes]
‐[Priscilla] <i>Hello?</i>

189
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,130
It's me, Amagiri.

190
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,463
[Priscilla]
<i>OK, I'll be right there.</i>

191
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:07,963
Good evening, come in.

192
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:11,030
Oh, you must be Ms. Riessfeld.

193
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,763
I never got the chance
to introduce myself.

194
00:11:13,763 --> 00:11:17,163
‐My name's Priscilla.
‐Call me Julis. It's a pleasure.

195
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:20,563
All right, well, we can't eat
out here in the hallway.

196
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:22,096
Follow me, you two.

197
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:24,396
Dinner will be ready
in no time.

198
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:31,463
Hey.

199
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:34,230
Sorry, did you just say "hey,"
Lamirexia?

200
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,163
Is that how you greet
all your guests?

201
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,830
[Irene] No. Only
the uninvited ones, Glühen Rose.

202
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,496
Ha. Well, I'd hate
for something to happen

203
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:43,763
to this fine gentleman.

204
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:45,563
He is my partner, after all.

205
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:48,363
Jeez, girl, quit
your damn worrying, all right?

206
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:51,096
Who are you,
his mother or something?

207
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:53,196
What? What the hell
does that mean?

208
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:55,463
‐[Irene chuckles]
‐[Priscilla] Dinner is served.

209
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:59,096
Now, let's start off
with some salad, everyone.

210
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:05,430
‐[Julis and Ayato gasp]
‐[Irene] I'm starved!

211
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,163
Irene, that's rude.
We have guests.

212
00:12:08,163 --> 00:12:11,030
I just want one bite.
What's the big deal?

213
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,030
Now, come on, you guys, dig in!

214
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,030
We all gotta start together.
Priscilla's rules!

215
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,596
[Priscilla] Irene!
Not with your hands.

216
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,830
Wow, this is amazing!

217
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,096
Really? Thanks,
I'm glad you like it.

218
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:29,430
[chuckles] Yeah, I figured
it'd be awesome.

219
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,230
It's not as if you were
responsible for making this.

220
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,596
It's a pretty comfortable place
you've got here.

221
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:37,030
[Priscilla] Yeah, and it's
pretty convenient, too.

222
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,230
Close to the casino.

223
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,530
Can't stand to be away
from the nightlife, huh?

224
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,863
Look, it's not all fun
and games, all right?

225
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,230
The reason I go out gambling is
because I need to make money.

226
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,230
Money? If that's
what you're after,

227
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,263
why not earn it
from the Phoenix Festa?

228
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:58,696
Um, excuse me for a minute,
I need to go check on the oven.

229
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,130
[Irene] <i>A while back,</i>

230
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,263
<i>I borrowed a whole lot of money</i>
<i>from Dirk Eberwein.</i>

231
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:13,263
<i>I've been paying him off</i>
<i>ever since,</i>

232
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:16,363
<i>little by little,</i>
<i>obeying his every order.</i>

233
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,863
<i>Eh, the tyrant.</i>

234
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,330
<i>He had me sign a contract</i>

235
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,996
<i>that restricts my participation</i>
<i>in the Festas.</i>

236
00:13:21,996 --> 00:13:24,630
And unfortunately I can't put
any prize money

237
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,163
toward paying off my debt.

238
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:29,863
He's one vile son of a bitch,
that's for sure.

239
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:31,396
So, what now?

240
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,596
Do you have something else
in mind besides winning?

241
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:35,163
Damn right I do.

242
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:38,063
Cos the order that Dirk
gave me this time around

243
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:41,696
was to destroy Ayato Amagiri.

244
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,963
[Julis] What?

245
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:45,763
Why would you tell us
something like that?

246
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:49,130
[Irene] Simple. It's because
I owe you for saving Priscilla.

247
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,730
So sit down, princess.
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

248
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,596
I don't plan on picking
a fight tonight.

249
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,430
Why would he go after Ayato?

250
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,230
Because of his Ogre Lux.

251
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,630
Dirk says it's nothing
but a big pain in the ass.

252
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,830
Told me to get rid of it.

253
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,396
The Ser Versta?
It's a powerful weapon,
by why destroy it?

254
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:11,563
I don't know what that guy
has in mind, but...

255
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:14,930
from what I understand,
you're not the first person

256
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,796
he's ever seen wielding
that very same weapon.

257
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:19,330
Uhh...

258
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,296
[Claudia, voice echoing]
<i>It's the data</i>
<i>for a female student...</i>

259
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,930
<i>...no record of it ever</i>
<i>having been checked out.</i>

260
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,230
<i>Parts of its combat data</i>
<i>still remain.</i>

261
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,296
[Irene] Anyway, I figured that
might have something to do

262
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:36,030
with why he's choosing
to target you.

263
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,430
[Ayato] Yeah.

264
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,663
Yeah, it might.
Thanks for telling me.

265
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,630
Sure thing.

266
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,563
Guess you and I
are even now.

267
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:50,030
I hope everybody's still hungry,
because the next dish

268
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,030
is my seafood
and mushroom paella!

269
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,663
All right, my sister's paella
is one of her
five‐star dishes, guys!

270
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,163
It's gonna blow your minds!

271
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,996
All right, that's enough, Irene.

272
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:02,730
Never mind that.
Just start dividing it up, OK?

273
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,796
Huh? Why do I have to?

274
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:07,396
[Priscilla]
Because they're our guests.
Don't be rude!

275
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:10,696
‐[Irene] Come on!
‐[Ayato thinking] <i>Sister, huh?</i>

276
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:17,343
[Priscilla] Sorry about
all the trouble my sister
caused you earlier today.

277
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:22,143
Don't worry, but tomorrow we're
back to being opponents again,
remember that.

278
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:25,143
Yes, I will.
Of course I will.

279
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:28,843
Guess battling in the Festa
really isn't your thing,
is it, Priscilla?

280
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:32,810
Whether it is or isn't,
Irene is fighting for my sake.

281
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,310
And so I can't run away.
It just wouldn't be right.

282
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,610
Fine, but letting her drink
your own blood, that's right?

283
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,943
Oh, I don't mind her doing that,
it doesn't bother me at all.

284
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:47,043
Quite the opposite.
I'm glad I can be of use to her.

285
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:51,443
Except, whenever I'm watching
her wield the Gravi‐Sheath,

286
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:53,243
I feel so frightened.

287
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,210
She becomes ferocious.

288
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,010
Like a completely
different person.

289
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,610
And lately, I think
it's getting worse.

290
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,510
Oh, I'm sorry, forgive me.

291
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,877
I should probably stop
babbling on.

292
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:12,843
[Ayato] So, Julis,
what do you think?

293
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:14,510
[Julis] About the Gravi‐Sheath?

294
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,410
Now don't tell me you're
suddenly feeling some compassion
for our opponent?

295
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,010
No, I'm not.
Well, OK, maybe
just a little bit.

296
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,910
But that isn't really
what I'm asking.

297
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,243
I know, I'm only kidding.

298
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:29,777
And I understand where you're
coming from, I really do.

299
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,910
But we can't be
distracted by that now.

300
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,610
Winning the next battle
should be our top priority.

301
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,077
You're right.

302
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,810
[speaker phone beeping]

303
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,677
[Claudia] <i>My! And how</i>
<i>may I help you this late?</i>

304
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:53,910
[Ayato] Sorry to bother you,

305
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,277
but do you think we could
talk in person?

306
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,610
Hey, Claudia.

307
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,610
[Claudia whimpering]

308
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,710
Are you OK?

309
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,243
‐Uggh!
‐[metal clangs]

310
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:26,610
What's going on?

311
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,943
[Claudia breathing heavily]

312
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,110
[energy pulses]

313
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:41,677
‐Claudia, it's me!
‐[Claudia gasps]

314
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:46,643
Ayato... please...

315
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:49,143
Please forgive me.
I'm so sorry!

316
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:50,443
I...

317
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,977
[Ayato sighs]

318
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:57,643
[Claudia] I hope you know how
sorry I am for attacking you.

319
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:02,377
Of course, and it's my fault
anyway for coming over so late
just to talk.

320
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:04,677
But, um... what happened?

321
00:18:04,677 --> 00:18:07,243
I'm more than happy
to answer that question,

322
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:09,943
but before I do, would you
grant me one request?

323
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:11,043
Huh?

324
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:14,077
I would like for you to enter
next year's Gryps Festa

325
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,310
and participate
as a member of my team.

326
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,810
All right, Ayato?

327
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,277
OK, sure, just as long as Julis
can join me, too, that is.

328
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:25,077
I had a feeling you'd say that,
and honestly,

329
00:18:25,077 --> 00:18:26,977
it makes me a little jealous.

330
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:28,477
But that won't be a problem

331
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:31,777
because I fully intended
to ask Julis to join anyway.

332
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,110
OK, but what does
the Gryps Festa have to do

333
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,577
with what happened
when I got here?

334
00:18:35,577 --> 00:18:40,310
Well, I'm less averse
to revealing my secret
to my teammates.

335
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,177
Ayato, do you know what it feels
like to experience death?

336
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:49,310
[Ayato] Uh... um...

337
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,877
[Claudia] Because I've already
died over 1,200 times.

338
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:53,910
Huh?

339
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,710
[Claudia] This Lux requires
its wielder

340
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,843
to experience their own death.

341
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:02,010
Every time I start
drifting off to sleep,

342
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,543
it causes me to dream
of my eventual demise

343
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,343
and to feel each moment of it.

344
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:12,110
The cruelest part of all is
that the Lux never shows me
the same death twice.

345
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,943
It could be an illness,
an accident, starvation,

346
00:19:15,943 --> 00:19:20,110
freezing, suicide, even murder.

347
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,410
[Ayato gasps]

348
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,910
[Claudia] For this reason,

349
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,643
this Lux has yet to be mastered
by anyone,

350
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:28,577
not even by those gifted
with precognition.

351
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,743
No one who owned it
before me was able

352
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:33,977
to withstand such torment
for more than three days.

353
00:19:33,977 --> 00:19:36,643
[Ayato] I'm amazed
that you can, Claudia.

354
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,577
[laughs] You get used to it
after a while.

355
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,177
Yeah, but...

356
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,343
[Claudia giggling]
Now I feel special.

357
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:45,643
Are you really worried
about little old me?

358
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,943
Well, yeah,
is that so surprising?

359
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:52,510
Everyone has a wish
that they want to come true.

360
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,977
I'm no different.
Wielding this Lux
is a means to that end.

361
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,877
Then what's your wish, Claudia?

362
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:02,677
Sorry. I'm keeping that secret.

363
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,977
[Ayato] Anyway, I came
to ask what you think
about the Gravi‐Sheath.

364
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:09,643
[Claudia] Well, let's see.

365
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:13,310
As you know, every Ogre Lux
has a personality,

366
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,343
much like a person.

367
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:18,877
Some are good while others
can be quite bad.

368
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:20,877
[Ayato] Which one
is the Ser Versta?

369
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:25,343
I would put that into
the good category of Luxes,

370
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:28,310
though it does seem to have
a naughty side.

371
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,010
Then how about the Pan Dora?

372
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,710
Oh, this one is the worst
of the worst, hands down.

373
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,677
Probably as dark
as I am inside.

374
00:20:35,677 --> 00:20:38,177
What about the Gravi‐Sheath?

375
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:42,543
Well, I shouldn't speak
against the Ogre Lux
of another academy,

376
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,843
but I feel that that one
is dangerous.

377
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,210
Yeah, you're not the only one.

378
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,877
The problem with most
of the Ogre Luxes

379
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:50,610
is they interfere
with their wielders.

380
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,010
[Ayato] Interfere?

381
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,443
[Claudia] Sometimes they can
manipulate their wielder's mind,

382
00:20:55,443 --> 00:21:01,010
personality, even physical body
to suit their desires.

383
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,977
Thanks, Claudia.
That info really helped.

384
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:08,310
[Claudia] You're quite welcome.

385
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,910
[Ayato] My match is tomorrow,
so I'd better go.

386
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,310
Well...

387
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:15,910
[Ayato] Uh...

388
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,410
You could always
spend the night here,

389
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,910
if you want to.

390
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,377
Uh, I'm gonna have to take
a rain check.

391
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:28,510
Oh, very well.
Good luck tomorrow.

392
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,810
[Ayato] Thanks.

393
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,877
Irene.
