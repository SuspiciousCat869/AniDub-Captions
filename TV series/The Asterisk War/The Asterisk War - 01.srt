[distant cheering]

10
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,243
[narrator] <i>During</i>
<i>the previous century,</i>

11
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,581
<i>an unprecedented disaster</i>
<i>known as the Invertia</i>

12
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,982

13
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:59,019
<i>and drastically</i>
<i>changed the world</i>
<i>as we knew it.</i>

14
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:02,690
<i>The powers of existing nations</i>
<i>declined significantly</i>

15
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,459

16
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,228
<i>to seize leadership.</i>

17

<i>global perceptions</i>
<i>of ethics and principles</i>

18
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,002
<i>were forever altered.</i>

19
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,572
<i>But despite</i>
<i>this turn of events,</i>

20
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:22,810
<i>the Invertia also gave</i>
<i>the world new potential.</i>

21
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,413
[Julis] Oh, great.
I can't believe this!

22
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,915
[Ayato]I see.

23
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,384
<i>A new species of humans</i>

27
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,494
What the...?

28
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,764
[Julis gasps]

29
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,867

I, uh...

35
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,668
I'm so sorry!

36
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:24,204
I mean, I... Oh, jeez.

37
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,140
I only came up here
to bring you the handkerchief
I found outside.

38
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,042
[Julis] Turn around now.

39
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,780
You heard me! I told you
to turn around right now!

40
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,281
Sorry!

[Ayato, thinking]
<i>Hang on a minute.</i>

43
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,792
<i>The only reason I'm even in</i>
<i>here is to return what I found</i>
<i>to the rightful owner.</i>

44
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:50,063
<i>Maybe if I can find a way</i>
<i>to properly explain that to</i>
<i>her, she'll understand.</i>

45
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,299
‐Ugh.
‐[Julis] OK, I'm done.

46
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:59,973
‐Well, hand it over.
‐Hand wha...?

47
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,243
Didn't you just say something
about a handkerchief?

48
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,279
[Ayato] Oh, that's right.
Here it is.

49
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,719
Thank goodness.

50
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,254
So it is yours.

51
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,558
When I saw the open window,
I thought it might be.

52
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:21,629
Indeed. I appreciate this.

53
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,031
It's something quite dear to me.

54
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,300
Oh, it's nothing.
I just happened
to be walking by.

55
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,470
Still, I'm in your debt.
You have my eternal gratitude.

56
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,440
Hey, let's not go that far.
All I did was bring you
a handkerchief.

57
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,345
[Julis] Now, then...
think it's time for us
to get back to business.

58
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,580
Yeah?

59
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,683
Prepare to die.

60
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,318
This presence...

61
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,755
A Strega?

62
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:51,024
[Julis] Burst into bloom.

63
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,426
Amaryllis!

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,003
Impressive.
There's not a scratch on you.

65
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,039
So be it.

66
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,376
Prepare yourself
because I'm playing to win.

67
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,580
Whoa, weren't you just eternally
grateful like a second ago?

68
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,015
[Julis] Make no mistake,
I'm very grateful
for your efforts.

69
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,617
‐So...
‐[Julis] However,

70
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:20,754
you infiltrated
the girls' dormitory and spied
on an undressed maiden!

71
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:24,224
The only satisfactory punishment
is for you to die!

72
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,126
Wait, that's going a little far.

73
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,695
No need to worry.

74
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:31,364
If you stay put,
I'll appease my anger by
only cooking you well done.

75
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,568
[Ayato] Crap, she's totally
gonna roast me alive.

76
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,904
It's only my first day
at the school,

77
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,139
so I had no idea
that was the girls' dorm.

78
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,407
You gotta believe me!

79
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,910
I see. That much I'll believe.

80
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,879
‐[sighs]
‐But I'm sorry to say

81
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,716
my anger won't be dispelled
that easily.

82
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,951
That said, tell me your name.

83
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,385
Ayato Amagiri.

84
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:56,990
My name is Julis,
and I rank fifth
at Seidoukan Academy.

85
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,327
In the unfaltering name
of the Red Lotus,

86
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,531
I, Julis‐Alexia von Riessfeld,

87
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:08,769
hereby challenge you,
Ayato Amagiri, to a duel!

88
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,337
Gotta be kidding.

89
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:14,407
Should you win, I shall accept
your excuse and humbly withdraw.

90
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:18,979
But if I win, your fate
will be subject to any
and all of my whims.

91
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,814
Hold on a minute,
this is crazy!

92
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:24,818
We have duels here at Asterisk.
Surely you must be aware
of that.

93
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:28,421
Of course I am,
but wouldn't you know it,
I don't even have a sword on me.

94
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,223
[Eishirou] Then try
using this one!

95
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,762
[Julis] Hmm.

96
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,730
[Ayato sighs]

97
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,705
[cheers]

98
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,139
[Julis] Let's go.

99
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:50,744
[cheers]

100
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,213
It looks like the stage
is set, doesn't it?

101
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:57,885
I, Ayato Amagiri,
hereby accept your challenge.

102
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,521
I swear to fight honorably.

103
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,695
I take it you're familiar
with the rules.

104
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,098
Whoever destroys the other
person's school badge wins.

105
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,566
Right.

106
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,969
[Announcer] <i>Starting countdown!</i>

Now let's do this!

112
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,782
Burst into bloom!

113
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,651
Longiflorum!

114
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,525
[Ayato groaning]

115
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:44,231
Next wave. Longiflorum.

116
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,900
Try and dodge the spears
at this speed.

117
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,435
Go!

118
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,613
Aaah!

119
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,252
[boy] The newbie's
holding his own.

120
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,520
[boy 2] Not too shabby.

121
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,488
[girl] The princess must be
holding back, right?

122
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,092
[Julis, thinking] <i>He's strong.</i>
<i>An average opponent would have</i>
<i>been reduced to cinders.</i>

123
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:17,397
<i>Even though I clearly</i>
<i>have the upper hand,</i>
<i>something's off.</i>

124
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:20,300
<i>Let's find out what it is!</i>

125
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,703
Burst into bloom!

126
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,705
Amaryllis!

127
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,048
[Julis thinking]
<i>Dodging and going in</i>
<i>for close combat, huh?</i>

128
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,517
<i>Nice try.</i>

129
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,951
Explode!

130
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:46,126
[thinking] <i>An explosion</i>
<i>at that proximity</i>
<i>should finish him off.</i>

131
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:50,731
[Ayato] Amagiri Shinmei‐style.
Twin Dragons!

132
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,904
No way!

133
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,471
[Ayato] Get down, now!

134
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,813
[both groan]

135
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:08,716
What exactly are you doing?!

136
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,389
[Julis thinking] <i>That spear of</i>
<i>light was clearly aimed at me.</i>

137
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,858
<i>But he saved me anyway.</i>

138
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:21,261
‐[Julis] Why did you do that?
‐What? It wasn't me.

139
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:25,365
[Ayato] I think you should save
that question for the guy
who fired the spear.

140
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:29,469
That's not what I meant.
I want to know why you...

141
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,671
Aaah!

142
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,041
Aaah!

143
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,643
Whoa!

144
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:39,713
Hey, look, I...
I am so sorry.

145
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,816
I know this looks
really bad, but I swear
it's not what you're thinking.

146
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,888
You... how dare you!

147
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,023
[Ayato] But I...

148
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:54,494
[Claudia] Now, now.
I believe that's quite enough.

149
00:09:54,494 --> 00:10:00,100
Unfortunately, I have no other
option but to invalidate
this particular duel.

150
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,337
Oh, it's you. Who gave you
the authority to interfere?

151
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,944
By the power vested in me
as school representative,
this duel is voided.

152
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,217
Sorry, his transfer paperwork
isn't finished.

153
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:22,389
So technically Ayato Amagiri
isn't a full‐fledged
Seidoukan Academy student yet.

154
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,527
Well, what do you know?
Thanks, uh...

155
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:30,230
Right. I've yet to properly
introduce myself.

156
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,566
Student Council President
Claudia Enfield.

00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,002
It's a pleasure to meet you.

158
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,145
[Ayato] What? You mean you're
a first‐year, too,
Madam President?

159
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:49,316
[Claudia] I am.
My tenure began in junior high,
so this is my third term.

160
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,718
[Ayato] Wow.

161
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:53,587
And since you and I
are in the same grade,

162
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,489
feel free to speak to me
in a more informal manner.

163
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,125
How about "Miss Claudia"?

164
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,294
"Claudia" is just fine,
if it's all the same to you.

165
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,263
But you're the school rep,
so I‐‐

166
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:07,067
Call me Clau‐di‐a!

167
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,170
Roger that, Claudia.

168
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,739
There.

169
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:14,441
[Ayato] In that case,
you can call me Ayato.

170
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,343
[Claudia] Certainly, Ayato.
Roger that.

171
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,779
You know, you don't
have to be so polite.

172
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,649
Don't worry yourself about it.
It's merely a habit of mine.

173
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,416
[Ayato] What do you mean?

174
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,318
I'm very devious, you see.

175
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:29,590
Therefore I maintain
a courteous facade
to conceal my true nature.

176
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,191
[Ayato] Devious, huh?

177
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,293
[Claudia] Yes, exceedingly so.

178
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,128
Inside me lurk thoughts
so devious,

179
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,698
it's like they were created
in some pitch‐black abyss

180
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,867
and drenched in black honey.

181
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,369
Actually, would you like
to take a look?

182
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,505
‐[Ayato] Uh...
‐See? Pitch‐black.

183
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,840
Whoa! What do you think
you're doing?!

184
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,077
‐[Claudia laughing]
Just kidding.
‐[Ayato sighs]

185
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,278
[giggles]

186
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,081
You're simply
too cute for words.

187
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,649
[beep]

188
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,118
[Claudia] Right this way,
please.

189
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,391
And here we are.

190
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,628
I humbly welcome you
to Asterisk.

191
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,550
[Claudia] Now then, Ayato...

192
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,186
as a scholarship transfer
student at Seidoukan Academy,

193
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,123
there is just one thing
that we will expect of you.

194
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,025
Victory.

195
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,161
[Ayato gasps]

196
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,232
Garrardworth,

197
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,734
Arlequint,

198
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:47,968
Jie Long,

199
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,236
ReWolf,

200
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,604
Queenvail,

201
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,673
and finally Seidoukan.

202
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,178
The top Genestella in the world
are chosen each year

203
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,582
to attend these six schools,
where they then battle
for supremacy,

204
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:04,518
which is called Festas.

205
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,454
As the Genestella are mankind's
greatest innovation,

206
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:11,224
these desperate clashes
draw a worldwide audience
to witness the melee.

207
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:16,029
In fact, you could say
that the city's existence
is a means to that end.

208
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,868
However, in recent years,
our school's record
has been quite dismal.

209
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:23,937
Ayato, please triumph
at the Festas.

210
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:27,908
Do so, and our academy
will grant your heart's desire.

211
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:33,514
As long as it can be
realized in this world,
you can consider it yours.

212
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,348
[Ayato] Hmm...

213
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:40,253
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but that kind of thing
doesn't really interest me.

214
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:47,961
Is that right? Well then,
why did you pick this school?

215
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,966
Before I go on, there's
something I want to ask you.

216
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,537
Is it true that my older sister
went to this school?

217
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,772
Her name was Haruka Amagiri.

218
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:02,375
I may be able to answer that.

219
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,211
What's all this?

220
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:08,582
[Claudia] It's the data
for a female student who
once attended this school.

221
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:13,420
She enrolled five years ago
and left six months later
due to personal reasons.

222
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,723
But all the other data's
been deleted.

223
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:18,291
[Ayato thinking] <i>It's her.</i>
<i>That's my sister.</i>

224
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,161
It would appear she never
competed in the Festas.

225
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,097
And there's no record
of her name listed
in the Named Cults.

226
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:29,402
To be honest, whether or not
she even attended this academy
is a little suspect.

227
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,171
Although...

228
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,740
[Ayato] What is that?

229
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,010
[Claudia] The Ser Versta,
which is the Ogre Lux
owned by Seidoukan Academy.

230
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,312
‐[Ayato] Are you serious?
‐[Claudia] That's right.

231
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:43,551
[Claudia] It's an extremely
powerful weapon with
a core of Urm Manadite.

232
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:47,921
Among all Ser Versta,
this specific one
is the most infamous,

233
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,357
as well as being
the most feared.

234
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,360
We manage all Ogre Lux
checkout records

235
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,295
and the corresponding
combat data.

236
00:14:55,295 --> 00:15:00,968
However, despite there being
absolutely no record of it
ever having been checked out,

237
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,170
parts of its combat data
still remain.

238
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,173
[Ayato] And this left‐over data
is from five years ago?

239
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:10,177
Precisely.
This is speculation, but...

240
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,947
it's likely that she
no longer attends this academy.

241
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,683
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,458
[Ayato] Thanks. But it's OK.

243
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:29,462
It's not as if the only reason
I came here was to look
for my sister.

244
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,599
Really? Then why are you here?

245
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,867
Well, to put it simply,

246
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:37,838
I guess I came here to try and
find my true purpose in life.

247
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:42,543
[giggles] You're rather
ambitious, aren't you?

248
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:45,012
By the way,
scholarship transfer students

249
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:49,149
are given priority
regarding Ogre Lux weapons,
so take your pick.

250
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,919
[Ayato] Could I choose
the Ser Versta if I wanted to?

251
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,921
‐Of course.
‐Well, since it's available,

252
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:55,789
I might as well
take a look at it.

253
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,290
In that case,
I'll arrange it for you.

254
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,594
But until then, please use
this as your weapon.

255
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:02,663
[Ayato] Thanks.
Oh, by the way...

256
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:05,032
‐Something wrong?
‐[Ayato] What's the deal

257
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:07,801
with that final transfer
paperwork you mentioned earlier?

258
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,837
Oh, so you remembered.

259
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:12,339
The thing about that is...

260
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,176
[Claudia giggles]

261
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:20,714
[Ayato] Hey, wait a minute.
Claudia, what are you doing?!

262
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:24,985
At last, at last,
we're finally meeting.

263
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,321
Uh, I, uh...

264
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,390
[Claudia] Gotcha, huh?

265
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,895
Umm, didn't you say something
about there being some more
paperwork to fill out?

266
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:37,698
‐That's right, I lied.
‐[Ayato] You what?

267
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:39,366
But it's completely justified.

268
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:43,136
I knew Julis would stand
down if I said you weren't
an official student yet.

269
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:46,640
Lying to her was
the quickest way to rescue you.

270
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,009
That girl always plays
by the book.

271
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,913
There are no more i's to dot
or t's to cross.

272
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:55,983
‐Rest assured.
‐[Ayato laughs nervously]

273
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:59,219
[Kyoko] Hey, pay attention,
kiddies.

274
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,122
This dude is Amagiri,
our new transfer guy.

275
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:05,526
‐Nice to meet you.
‐Don't make him cry
or I'll kick your ass.

276
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,394
Now let's see here.
Oh, perfect.

277
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,631
The seat next to your girlfriend
looks free. Go sit in it.

278
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:12,600
Since when am I his girlfriend?

279
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,201
Since this morning, apparently,

280
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,837
or have you forgotten
about the drama you caused?

281
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:19,973
‐Who'd have thought we'd
end up in the same class?
‐[Kyoko] OK, let's get started.

282
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:23,243
[Julis] This cannot be
happening.

283
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,448
[Ayato] We had a rough start,
but I'd like to be friends.

284
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:32,820
Listen, I'm grateful to you
for saving my life this morning.

285
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,454
Don't mention it.

286
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,456
So, are we OK now?

287
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:42,195
I wouldn't go so far
as saying I'm not mad,

288
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,431
but the fact remains
that you saved me.

289
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:47,400
With that being said,
I am now in your debt.

290
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,269
‐My debt?
‐Yes.

291
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,205
You shall have my aid
in one moment of need.

292
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,174
Consorting beyond that
is out of the question.

293
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,208
Uh...

294
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,779
[Eishirou chuckles]
That sucks man.

295
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,982
Though I suppose getting
shot down by the princess
can't be helped.

296
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:05,352
She is pretty good at keeping
people at arm's length.

297
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,787
I'm Eishirou Yabuki.

298
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:10,290
And, if what I'm told is true,
it looks like we're gonna
be roomies.

299
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,893
‐Roommates, huh?
‐[Eishirou chuckles]

300
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,128
Nice to meet ya.

301
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,267
Hey, Eishirou, you said
"princess" earlier.

302
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,369
Is that Julis's nickname
or something?

303
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:25,438
No way. Fact is,
that little lady
is the genuine article.

304
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,776
‐What?
‐Know how monarchies
all over Europe

305
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:31,011
have been returning to power
since the Invertia?

306
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:34,014
Well, one of them is a country
called Lieseltania

307
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,883
and Julis is
its crown princess.

308
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:39,352
And if that wasn't enough,
get this.

309
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,822
She's one of only a few Stregas
in the Genestella.

310
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:43,624
You've done your homework.

311
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,326
Hey, I'm not a member of
the newspaper club for nothing.

312
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,329
But what would a princess
be doing battling it out here?

313
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,232
And that, dear roommate,
is the million‐dollar question.

314
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:56,970
She's pretty, strong,
and a princess on top of that.

315
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,806
You'd think she'd love
the attention.

316
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,874
Instead...

317
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,243
she's like, "Everyone shut up,
leave me alone,

318
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,277
don't look at me."

319
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,848
‐It's crazy, you know.
‐That doesn't surprise me.

320
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:10,050
[Eishirou] The ones who didn't
take kindly to that

321
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,321
challenged her to duels,
only to find themselves
instantly defeated, one by one.

322
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,558
As a result, she quickly soared
to rank five at the academy.

323
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:20,661
In the process, she became
the solitary princess
you see today.

324
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,229
[Ayato] Really?

325
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:25,799
If you ask me, she seemed pretty
popular during our duel.

326
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,468
Oh, almost forgot. Here.

327
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,671
I wanted to make sure
I thanked you for this.

328
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:34,875
Although I have to admit,
without it, Julis might have
let me go,

329
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,144
so I don't know
what I'm thanking you for.

330
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:41,181
‐How'd you know it was me?
‐Huh? Well, your voice, I guess.

331
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:45,152
So you're saying,
out of everybody in that crowd,
you were able to pick out mine?

332
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:47,254
My sister used to nag me
about returning things,

333
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:50,457
so now I do whatever it takes
to make sure that I do.

334
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:53,460
[chuckles] You're a funny guy,
you know that?

335
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,028
[Lester] Answer me, Julis!

336
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,999
Why in the hell would someone
like you duel a newcomer?

337
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,201
And why should I answer that?

338
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:05,172
Whoa, so cool!
Talk about a scoop!

339
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:07,374
[Lester] What did you say?

340
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,977
I've defeated you
three times already.

341
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,979
I see no point
in continuing this.

342
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:13,514
You cocky little bitch!

343
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:17,117
‐Eishirou, who is that guy?
‐Name's Lester MacPhail.

344
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:19,587
[Eishirou] He's ranked ninth
and a Page One.

345
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:20,821
[Ayato] What's that?

346
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,390
[Eishirou] You're aware that
every school here in Asterisk

347
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,158
has a ranking system,
aren't you?

348
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,328
That catalog of rankings
has been dubbed the Named Cults,

349
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,932
and the top 12 among them
are each given the title
of Page One.

350
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,867
[Ayato] So he's pretty powerful.

351
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,335
[Eishirou] No one's
denying that,

352
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,505
but he just doesn't measure up
against our princess.

353
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:40,440
They've dueled three times
and he hasn't won yet.

354
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,442
[explosion]

355
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,280
I don't care what you say,
we're having this duel
right now!

356
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,784
‐[Randy] Lester, calm down!
‐[Silas] Come on, man.
This really isn't the place‐‐

357
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:52,520
[Lester] Don't get full
of yourself.

358
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,122
You still haven't seen anything
close to my true power.

359
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:57,858
Well, if that's the case,
then why don't you prove it?

360
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:00,661
But go bother someone else,
all right?

361
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:02,362
Get back here!

362
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:10,938
No way in hell am I gonna
get my ass kicked by a princess
who only duels for fun!

363
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:21,682
‐Did you say "for fun"?
‐[Lester] Yeah. So what?

364
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,725
Then enlighten me, Lester.
What's your reason for fighting?

365
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:37,097
Cos I'm only here
for one purpose.

366
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,266
[Ayato gasps]

367
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:44,004
And I am bound and determined
to reach my goal at the Festas.

368
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:49,076
"Just for fun"!
If you think that's why
I'm here, you're dead wrong!

369
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:55,282
[Ayato, thinking] <i>Julis.</i>

370
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:59,019
<i>Julis‐Alexia von Riessfeld.</i>

371
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:05,559
<i>This is the GlÃ¼hen Rose,</i>

372
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,729
<i>the Witch of</i>
<i>the Resplendent Flames.</i>

373
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:25,713
