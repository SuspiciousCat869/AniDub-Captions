but have any of you already made
plans for the winter vacation?

Well, for me,
since I learned so much
during the Phoenix Festa,

4
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:23,661
I decided that I should
use this opportunity
to do some intensive training.

5
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:26,231
I'll probably just go through
my usual regimen during break.

getting some time off,
I thought I'd take it easy.

A quiet New Year's holiday
does sound pretty good.

Of course not.

Hope I'll see all of you there.

Wow! It's so beautiful!

66

Uh‐huh. In the springtime,
all of the flowers
begin to bloom,

67
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,992
so it looks
even more beautiful.

68
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:24,996
All I wanted was for you
to see my country,
and all this happens.

69
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:27,632
I'm sorry it's become
such an ordeal.

70
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:30,168
Well, this place
is pretty incredible.

71
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:31,169
Everything's so majestic.

72
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,939
[Julis] Yeah. Both this garden
and the villa

73
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:37,042
were built during the time
of the Holy Roman Empire.

74
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:40,712
It later gained its independence
as the Kingdom of Lieseltania

75
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:43,114
and was wiped out
during the German Revolution.

76
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:44,515
[Ayato] No way.

77
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,885
[Julis] But after
the Invertia happened,

78
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:50,488
an extremely unique meteorite,
a high‐degree Grade‐A Beltis,

79
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:54,059
was discovered in the borders
of one of Lieseltania's
former lands.

80
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:57,162
And that's when the Integrated
Enterprise Foundation

81
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:59,230
began fighting over it
amongst themselves,

82
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,300
but there was no way they would
risk going to war over it.

83
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,303
So the foundation
signed an agreement
to share the wealth.

84
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:08,840
[Julis] From there, they thought
they might as well make
a small paradise for themselves

85
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,408
that they could
have their way with

86
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:13,278
and resurrected the country
that existed there before,

87
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:14,479
Lieseltania.

88
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,848
So it's basically
a puppet state.

89
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:18,884
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

90
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:22,120
Which is why the Integrated
Enterprise Foundation

91
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,389
keeps such a tight grip
on my homeland.

92
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,192
While we do receive some
financial aid and benefits,

93
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:32,998
many never see it
and a lot of our people
are silently suffering.

94
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:34,365
I want...

95
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:37,002
I need to change this country.

96
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:43,875
[Claudia]
I really must apologize.

97
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,545
No matter how many times
you ask, the answer is no.

98
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:50,048
Yes, of course,
I'm entirely aware.

99
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:51,616

What's going on?
Is everything OK?

104
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:09,200
The thing is, I can't find
Ms. Sasamiya anywhere.

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,903
She's not in her room,
and it's almost time for dinner.

106
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:15,506
Saya's directionally challenged,
so she probably just got lost.

107
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:18,609
Oh, wait, I think I might know
where she could be hiding,

108
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:20,846
so I'll help you look.

109
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:30,588
Saya, are you getting hungry?
Cos dinner's almost ready.

110
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:32,690
Ayato.

111
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,128
You OK?

112
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,034
Ayato...

113
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:50,441
I... I've always wanted to...

114
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,579
I've always wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry.

115
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:58,449
Not sure I know what you mean.
What could you be sorry about?

116
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,385
[Saya] After I moved away,

117
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:04,255
you and I somehow managed
to still keep in touch.
remember?

118
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:05,556
[Ayato] Yeah, of course.

119
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:07,258
[Saya] But then it got
too painful

120
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:10,028
and I felt like I couldn't
talk to you anymore.

121
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:11,529
Is that what really happened?

122
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:16,034
Because we used to play together
every day no matter what,

123
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:18,837
but after I moved,
all I could do was talk to you.

124
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:21,339
And then it wouldn't even be
for very long.

125
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:24,142
I looked forward to
our conversations so much.

126
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:26,277
But after a while,
it just hurt me,

127
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:29,781
so I decided it was best
if I stopped talking to you,

128
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:31,416
until we met again.

129
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,351
[Ayato] OK, I understand.

130
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:34,385
[Saya] But that's not all.

131
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:36,888
If I just kept in touch
with you the whole time,

132
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:42,527
I might have been able to be
there to support you when
your sister disappeared, Ayato.

133
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:46,097
Even if I couldn't have helped,
I still could have
cheered you up.

134
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:48,633
I would have found a way
to be there for you.

135
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:51,469
It makes me...
feel so frustrated.

136
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:52,503
[Ayato] Saya.

137
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:55,106
[Saya] I never should have
stopped talking to you.

138
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:58,643
Because even when...
when I wasn't there,

139
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:00,478
I was by your side.

140
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:04,049
So you should know,
you can lean on me, Ayato.

141
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:08,086
And from this moment on,
I'll make sure
I'm there for you.

142
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:09,487
Saya.

145
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:18,596
That really means a lot.

146
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:23,601
And if that day ever comes,
just know I'm counting on you.

Come on, let's go.

148
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:28,473
Everyone's probably hungry
and waiting for us inside.

149
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:30,275
[Saya] OK.

150
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:45,056
Now then, I'd like to take
this opportunity
to discuss something.

151
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:47,358
It's about next year's Festa.

152
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:51,196
I have a request to make.
I want you all to join me
as teammates

153
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:55,333
and enter next year's
Gryps Festa.

154
00:09:55,333 --> 00:10:00,005
I've already invited
Ayato to participate,
but he has one condition.

155
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:01,539
Julis has to join, too.

156
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:04,710
And you aren't going to change
your mind about this,
are you?

157
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,411
No. She goes, I go.

158
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:09,514
[Claudia] What are your thoughts
on this, Julis?

159
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:13,218
Before I answer, there's just
one thing I need to know
from you.

160
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:15,086
[Claudia] All right.
And that is?

161
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:16,587
Why enter the Gryps Festa?

162
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:20,759
In the Phoenix
or Lindwurs Festas,
you could easily advance.

163
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,763
[Claudia] Yes, that's true.
I would definitely be able
to advance,

164
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:27,999
but there's no guarantee
I'd be able to make it
through the finals.

165
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:30,068
And that would be unacceptable.

166
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:31,937
So your best chance
is the Gryps Festa?

167
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:35,707
[Claudia] Well, yes, as long as
I have dependable teammates,
of course.

168
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:39,144
I'll be able to go into further
detail of what I have planned

169
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:42,047
after you've all agreed
to partner with me,

170
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,616
since it has to do
with my Achilles' heel
and this one's.

171
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:47,919
Precognition
has an Achilles' heel?

172
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,922
Mm‐hmm. There's no such thing
as a perfect weapon.

173
00:10:50,922 --> 00:10:53,925
But, President, you're
a really powerful opponent

174
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:55,493
even without your Pan‐Dora,
aren't you?

175
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:57,328
[Claudia] Oh, no, not at all.

176
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:00,098
My abilities are
fairly pedestrian without it,

177
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:03,368
which is precisely why
I need a powerful team
to join me.

178
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:07,105
Remember, anyone who hopes
to become the champion
of the Gryps Festa

179
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:09,274
needs to be able to defeat
the Life Rhodes.

180
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:12,443
Then there's
Zhao Hufeng and Cecily Wong,

181
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:13,478
former Festa runner‐ups.

182
00:11:13,478 --> 00:11:16,314
They'll likely be competing
for Jie Long's team.

183
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:18,449
The Divine Revelation's
number one disciple

184
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:21,519
is rumored to be
a member of their team as well.

185
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,022
Right. Celestial Monarch.
They're Rank Number 2.

186
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:26,124
I hear he has
terrifying dexterity.

187
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:29,294
[Claudia] We also can't
underestimate Rusalka
of Queenvail,

188
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:32,030
or any of the other teams
standing in our way.

189
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,834
Sounds like the next Gryps Festa
will be quite the challenge,
doesn't it?

190
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,302
You read my mind.

191
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:39,237
Which brings me back
to my point.

192
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:43,574
If we enter the Festa together,
I just know we'll have a chance.

193
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:51,082
[Julis] It's settled then.

194
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:53,985
I'll join you in the Festa.

195
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:56,587
After all,
what do I have to lose?

196
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:01,559
[giggles]

197
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:12,470
‐[chuckles]
Mr. Amagiri, that looks nice.

198
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,673
Are you sure?
I've never had to dress up
like this before

199
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:16,942
so I'm kind of nervous.

200
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:18,810
Sorry, Mr. Amagiri.

201
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,848
You're not allowed to carry
weapons or things like that
during parties,

202
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:25,150
but I can hold onto it
for you.

203
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,285
Oh, OK, that's fine by me.

204
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:31,857
Hey, Julis, can I come in?

205
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:34,192
[Julis] Y‐Yeah, of course.

206
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,195
[gasp]

207
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:49,908
Why are you standing there
staring at us like that?

208
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:51,743
She does have a point, Ayato.

209
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:55,380
This is when you're supposed
to be showering us ladies
with compliments.

210
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,715
Yep, agreed.

211
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:58,383
Oh, no, well, I'm not, um...

212
00:12:58,383 --> 00:13:00,085
I'm sure I don't look good
in this.

213
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:02,087
You don't have to say anything.

214
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,422
Well, let's see.

215
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:07,425
I think you all look
really beautiful.

216
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:09,194
[Claudia] Why,
thank you so much.

217
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:10,862
And you're looking
quite handsome as well.

218
00:13:10,862 --> 00:13:15,666
Now then, as much as I'd really
like to be escorted by you,
Ayato,

219
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,469
Julis is the guest of honor,
which means you're all hers.

220
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:22,540
Just remember you still
have to spend time
with us later as well.

221
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,542
All right, go on!

222
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,144
[Julis] Uhh!

223
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:28,914
Well, I suppose I have
no choice then.

224
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:31,216
Here.

225
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:37,956
Now, let me help you.
Just bend your elbow a little.

226
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:39,624
That's it.

227
00:13:39,624 --> 00:13:41,760
[Ayato] Uh... so sorry.

228
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,997
Don't worry about it.
If push comes to shove,
I can take the lead.

229
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:48,566
‐[Ayato chuckles]
‐[door opens]

230
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:51,169
[Flora] Excuse me,
is everyone ready yet?

231
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,072
Time for your appearance
at the banquet.

232
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,648
[laughter]

233
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,618
[sighs]

234
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:10,188
You look like you're
pretty exhausted.

235
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:11,757
It's that obvious?

236
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:14,325
I guess I had no idea there'd be
this many people here.

237
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:16,561
And don't take this
the wrong way,

238
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,697
but I thought you said
your family didn't have
any money left.

239
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:22,067
[Julis] Well, the country may
have plenty of money to spend,

240
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:24,302
but I don't have any
to use myself.

241
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:27,305
Besides, my brother isn't
anything like me.

242
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:29,340
[Ayato] What do you mean?

243
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:33,644
[Julis] He never speaks out
politically,

244
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:36,414
and he has no enthusiasm
at all for his job.

245
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,150
I guess you could say
he's the quintessential puppet.

246
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,020
That's why the Integrated
Enterprise Foundation

247
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,955
is so fond of him
as the country's leader

248
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:47,225
and why they willingly
turn a blind eye when he wants
to have his way.

249
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:50,996
Oh, and all those women,
they're my brother's lovers.

250
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:54,265
Uhh! His lovers?
He's pretty bold, isn't he?

251
00:14:54,265 --> 00:14:55,801
[Julis] Just like
my sister‐in‐law,

252
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:58,837
they were also sent here
by the Integrated Enterprise
Foundation.

253
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:02,107
‐They aren't
exactly spies, but...
‐What about Maria?

254
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:04,642
[Julis] Well, my sister‐in‐law's
a genuine airhead.

255
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:08,679
As the saying goes,
"ignorance is bliss,"
especially in her case.

256
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,682
Although it's not as if
I dislike her.

257
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:14,419
As for Claudia,

258
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:17,989
her father's in charge
of this region
on behalf of the Galaxy.

259
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:22,193
She's visited Lieseltania
with him numerous times
since childhood,

260
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:24,963
which is why she and my brother
get along so well.

261
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:26,331
Is Claudia's father

262
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:28,834
an Integrated Enterprise
Foundation executive, too?

263
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:32,403
Not at all. I think he's
more like her mother's
own personal whipping dog.

264
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:35,473
‐He'd never make it
as an executive.
‐Why's that?

265
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:39,444
Because he's managed
to maintain his humanity.

266
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:41,813
The only way to become
an executive

267
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:44,950
is to lose whatever part of you
that makes you human.

268
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,684
That's why, for me personally,

269
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:49,120
her father made a much more
favorable impression

270
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,655
than her mother ever did.

271
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:52,891
At the very least,
it became clear to me

272
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:55,360
that he cared for his daughter
more than anything.

273
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,896
‐[Ayato] Hmm.
‐[Jolbert] Hey, Julis.

274
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,399
Damn my brother.

275
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,335
I don't want to drag you into
a situation like yesterday.

276
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:05,703
‐Can you...?
‐Mm‐hmm.

277
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:09,240
I think I'll go refresh my drink
and get some air.

278
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:23,288
[man] You're captivating
in that dress.

279
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:25,356
[Kirin, nervous] Oh, well,
thank you very much.

280
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:28,860
[man 2] Your Phoenix Festa
performance was magnificent!

281
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,561
Oh, uh, thank you for your‐‐

282
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:32,497
[woman] Do you happen to have
your sword on you?

283
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:34,565
Well, uh, no, you see, I, uh...

284
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:37,335
[Ayato] Hey, Kirin,
do you have a second?

285
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:38,837
[Kirin laughs]

286
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:42,908
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry. If you'll excuse me.

287
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:46,778
Ayato, thank you so much
for getting me out of there.

288
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:49,014
‐You saved me.
‐Oh. No problem at all.

289
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:53,518
It's just that, it can be
so hard for me to talk to people
that I don't know.

290
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:57,588
Besides, I'm not as pretty
as Julis or the president.

291
00:16:57,588 --> 00:17:00,525
Huh? I don't think that's even
close to being true.

292
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:04,429
But, uh, what I'm saying is,
I think a dress like this

293
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:06,998
just isn't meant to be worn
by a child like me.

294
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:11,136
Huh?

295
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:13,138
I really did mean it
when I said that before.

296
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:17,308
You do look great in that dress,
like a true lady,
gorgeous and refined.

297
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:22,080
Huh? Thank you, Ayato,
for your compliment.

298
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,449
Sure thing.
Um, see you later, then.

299
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,353
[Kirin] Wait, um, I have
a favor to ask of you.

300
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:30,288
‐Is that OK?
‐A favor?

301
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:32,991
Yes. Well, um, if it isn't
too much to ask,

302
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:35,693
I'd like to link arms with you,
if you wouldn't mind.

303
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:38,629
It just looked so lovely when
you did it with Julis earlier,

304
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:40,298
so I would really
like to try it.

305
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:44,870
Well, I don't see why not,
but I don't know if I can be
a proper escort.

306
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,507
That's no problem at all.
If you're OK with this,
then that's enough for me, so...

307
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:53,278
If that's the case, then...
here.

308
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:57,883
Uh, wait a minute, Kirin,

309
00:17:57,883 --> 00:18:01,319
I don't think you have to
hold onto me so tightly.

310
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,221
Oh, sorry, I'm really sorry.

311
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:05,090
Hey, stop hogging Ayato.

312
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,860
Arrgh! Whoa, Saya, what
in the heck's gotten into you?

313
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,797
I want to be able
to link arms with you, too.

314
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,069
[man] Now that's what I call
having a pretty girl
on each arm.

315
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:21,306
And I must say, that's the kind
of spirit I like to see.

316
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:25,576
Just the kind of behavior
I'd expect from one who made
his mark in the Phoenix Festa.

317
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:27,578
Right, thanks a lot, sir.

318
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:32,250
By the way, would you happen
to be planning to take part
in the Gryps Festa as well?

319
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,722
If the rumors are true,
you're thinking of joining
Ms. Enfield's team, yes?

320
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:39,424
[Ayato] Well, I haven't
quite decided.

321
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:42,427
[softly] Hmm.
Haven't decided, huh?

322
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:45,931
In that case...
a word of advice.

323
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,867
I believe it would be
in your best interest

324
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:51,770
not to join her team.

325
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:58,910
Just what are you trying to say?

326
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,079
What do you mean?
Was that not clear enough?

327
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,215
It wouldn't bode well
for a certain someone you know

328
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:06,551
should you decide
to join her team.

329
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:08,720
My job is to simply find
a way to stop you,

330
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,789
using whatever means possible.

331
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,658
And so I've decided
to give you this warning.

332
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:15,761
What if we decided to ignore it?

333
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:19,664
Now, that would be
so very unfortunate.

334
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:23,668
Never have I taken
pleasure in doing away
with an innocent youth.

335
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:29,340
So instead, I'll let my friend
here take care of that job
for me.

If you'll excuse me,
please accept my condolences.

00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:53,164
Come back!

341

What did I say?

347
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:20,358
Didn't I tell you I'd be there
for you, Ayato?

348
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:22,393
‐Thanks, Saya.
‐[Julis] What's going on?

Kirin, let me handle this.

352
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,369
OK.

353
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:33,772

Hyaaaa!

360
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:16,547
Saya, Julis!

361
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:18,750
[Julis] We can take it
from here.

362

[man] Who would have thought,

365
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:45,510
even a beast like that chimera's
no match for him.

366
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,513
And taking it down
without a weapon as well.

367
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:50,982
He's going to be
a bothersome one.

I'd rather not get too involved
at this level of work,

370
00:21:58,023 --> 00:21:59,590
