1
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:12,625
[HAK] I never would've
thought an entire village

2
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,625
was concealed
under this mountain.

3
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:15,500
[YUN]
I know.

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,625
I guess a lot of things aren't

5
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,333
what they appear to
be on the surface.

6
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,083
Ik-su once told me a
story about a village

7
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,041
that fled into a mountain
to escape a horrible war.

8
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,833
Maybe he was talking about them.

9
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,083
Is he here, Gija?

10
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,125
Yes, I'm certain.

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,208
I can feel the Blue Dragon.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,041
[YUN, GIJA gasp]

13
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,000
[YUN whimpers]

14
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,041
[GIJA growls]

15
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,291
Who are these people?

16
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,958
[YUN] I'm not sure what to
tell him. What'll we do?

17
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,208
Bring us the Blue Dragon
Warrior at once!

18
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,791
Don't beat around
the bush, Gija.

19
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,583
Blue Dragon, what?

20
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,416
I'm afraid that I have no idea
what you're talking about.

21
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,708
Don't lie to me! The
Blue Dragon is here.

22
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,541
There's no reason to hide him.

23
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,833
His master is
waiting to greet him.

24
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,625
I'm sorry, but I can assure you
there is no "blue dragon" here.

25
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,833
[GROUP gasps]

26
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,083
[ELDER] Is it possible
you have us confused

27
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,708
with some other village?

28
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,708
We are just a humble settlement
without many resources.

29
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,250
We don't want trouble.

30
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,333
I sincerely hope you
haven't come to start any.

31
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,250
That depends.

32
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,458
[YONA]
Please forgive us.

33
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,916
[YONA] We don't mean
to bring you any trouble.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,250
We're merely looking
for a friend of ours.

35
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,375
We're obviously
in the wrong place.

36
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,041
[YONA] However, we're
exhausted from our journey.

37
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,583
And, one of us is injured.

38
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,791
Would it be alright for
us to rest awhile?

39
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,041
Just for one night?

40
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,541
Your journey must've
been a difficult one.

41
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,541
As I'm sure you can see, we
don't have much to offer you.

42
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,500
But, we can certainly provide
you shelter for the night.

43
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,750
[YONA]
That's all we ask.

44
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,375
Thank you very much.

45
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,083
[ELDER]
I'll show you to your quarters.

46
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,125
[YONA gasps]

47
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,000
[YONA]
Why do they wear masks?

48
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,791
[ELDER]
It's an old clan tradition.

49
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,916
Those who are single
cover their faces.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,375
The masks are removed
during a wedding ritual.

51
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,208
[YONA]
What a fascinating custom.

52
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,958
[ELDER] The few visitors
we've had over the years

53
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,333
always have that reaction.

54
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,833
This is where you'll
stay for the evening.

55
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,125
[YONA]
Thank you.

56
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,625
[ELDER]
Oh, and one more thing.

57
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,166
Huh?

58
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,000
The cave system within this
mountain is an intricate maze.

59
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,958
It would be best for
you all to stay put.

60
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,916
We're not responsible,

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,625
if anything unfortunate
should befall you.

62
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,541
[YUN] How can we be certain this
is the Blue Dragon's village?

63
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,000
Why do you ask?

64
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,958
I find it odd that nobody
made a fuss about your hair,

65
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,750
especially after the
way everyone reacted

66
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,625
in the White Dragon
Warrior's village.

67
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,500
[GIJA]
Princess, trust me.

68
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:36,208
I feel the Blue Dragon Warrior.
He's in these caves somewhere.

69
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,416
I know, I would never
doubt your ability.

70
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,000
Uh... Thanks.

71
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,041
I would.

72
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,458
Shut your mouth!

73
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,291
--Well, no sense waiting.
--[GIJA yelling]

74
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,250
We know the Blue Dragon
Warrior's gotta be somewhere

75
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,333
--in this network of caves.
--[GIJA, HAWK yelling]

76
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,958
We're gonna have to
talk to him ourselves.

77
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's go while no
one's watching us.

78
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,458
But didn't he say it's like
a labyrinth down here?

79
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,375
What if we get lost?

80
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,291
Oh, come on, Princess.

81
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,750
I'm the Beautiful Boy Genius,
remember? I've got this.

82
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,541
I'll make a map of the caves

83
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,833
like we're in a game!

84
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,166
Find the treasure!

85
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,708
Rifle through all the pots
and closets and drawers!

86
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,916
[YONA, HAK]
Find the stuff!

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Find the stu...?

88
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,791
[YUN]
Not another dead end! Damn!

89
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,291
Where are you,
stupid Blue Dragon?

90
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,166
--[YUN grunts]
--[GIJA] He's nearby.

91
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,958
It doesn't add up.

92
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,416
I'm sure he knows I'm here,
why won't he show himself?

93
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,916
Prob'ly 'cause he
thinks you're annoying.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,166
--[GIJA yelps]
--[HAK] Swoosh.

95
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,750
Oh, that's right.

96
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,875
If you feel his presence,
then he can feel yours.

97
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,750
Do you think he's avoiding
us intentionally?

98
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,500
Maybe we should cut
our losses and move on--

99
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,416
[GIJA]
Definitely not!

100
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,208
[YONA, YUN grunt]

101
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,958
We cannot give up on him!

102
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,833
If the Blue Dragon
Warrior's like me,

103
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,708
he's been protecting the
ancient blood his whole life.

104
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,750
He's gotta be waiting for you.

105
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,291
You're his master and he
wants to be reunited with you,

106
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,875
because you need him.

107
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:03,250
The Four Dragon Warriors were
born to protect you, our master.

108
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,333
All we desire in this
world is to serve you.

109
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,416
My father was the White
Dragon Warrior before me.

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,708
Just as I do, he longed
to protect his king,

111
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,750
but he never got the chance.

112
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,875
[GIJA] If the Blue Dragon
could only see you,

113
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,083
he would follow
you in your quest.

114
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,458
[YONA sighs]

115
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,333
Gija.

116
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,375
Hm?

117
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,416
I'm not... the
Crimson Dragon King.

118
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,791
I know.

119
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:40,041
[GIJA]
Although, I believed you were.

120
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,750
I may not be the king
you've waited for.

121
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:43,833
[GIJA gasps]

122
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,750
But, I need you.
I want you by my side.

123
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,541
I'm sorry. I'm selfish.

124
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,416
Ohhhh.

125
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,708
Uh. You're way too nice to me.

126
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,166
Lightning Beast, why are
you making that face?

127
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,208
[YUN gasps]

128
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,416
[YUN] Hold on. Something
feels very wrong here.

129
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,416
[YONA]
How so?

130
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,125
[YUN]
This might sound strange.

131
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,333
But it feels like someone's
watching our every move.

132
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,875
Now that you mention
it, I can feel it, too.

133
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,125
[YUN] Maybe the villagers
know we're exploring.

134
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,125
Let's go back.

135
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,166
Yeah.

Wait up!

Oh, you're so cute!

Look, Hak! I found the
cutest little squirrel!

Why'd they go out?

What should I do?

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,791
[STRANGER]
Are you lost, young lady?

160
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,500
Did you get separated
from the rest of your group?

I, uh, well... Yes, I did.
Do you live here?

162
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:29,000
[STRANGER]
I do. Give me your hand.

163
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,500
[YONA gasping]

164
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,500
[STRANGER] I will show you
the way back to your friends.

165
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,083
Thank you.

166
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,000
[STRANGER]
Didn't the elder warn you

167
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,791
that it's easy to
get lost down here?

168
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,166
[YONA]
Yes, he did.

169
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,750
I should've stayed put,
but I'm looking for someone.

170
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,250
[STRANGER] The Blue
Dragon Warrior, right?

171
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,708
Uh... Yes, sir.

172
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,208
[STRANGER] There's no one by
that name. Not down here.

173
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,791
[YONA] That room
at the end of the hall,

174
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,083
does it belong to someone?

175
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,000
[STRANGER] It's an empty
room. No one's in there.

176
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,625
[STRANGER]
No one at all.

177
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,208
[YONA]
Um, sir?

178
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,375
I don't think this tunnel

179
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,416
is going to lead us
back to my friends.

deeper underground?

He's wearing bells.

And he's got a mask on.
Is he one of the villagers?

191
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,833
[YONA] For some reason,
I feel safe with him.

Dammit! Where did she go?

193

Any sign?

194

wander off like that?

[ELDER] Yes.

217
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,958
A baby boy was born
with the Blue Dragon's eyes.

218

He will grow up to be a

[ELDER] The former

We must follow the ancient rule.

Never mind that,
hand me the mask.

turn them to stone,

end when we die,

Yeah, apparently there's a guy

307

who lives there with
some weird powers.

I'll bet the nobles
would be interested

in a guy with special powers.

Did you watch what I did?

324
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,666
My sword technique?

325
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,083
[BLUE DRAGON]
Yes, sir.

326
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:55,458
Good. Learn it well,
as quickly as you can.

[YOUNG BLUE DRAGON]
Ao, why do you fight?

328
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:02,333
With swords, I mean. Why
not just use your power?

329
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,041
That... would be better, right?

--[AO growls]

331
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,625
Now you listen to me.

332
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,708
Your power is only a curse!

333
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,750
I can teach you to control it,
but you can never use it.

334
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,708
Because if you do, the curse
will come back to haunt you!

335
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,333
You will suffer the same
paralysis you inflict.

336
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,416
It's not worth it
just to win a fight.

337
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,000
--It's a double-edged sword.
--[BLUE DRAGON whimpering]

338
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,208
One that will cut
you if you use it.

339
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,750
Not only that,

340
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,958

pariahs in our own village.

never use my power

343
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,791
and I protect the
village with a sword,

344
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,458
do you think...
I'll make friends?

[BLUE DRAGON] Ao taught
me to fight with a sword.

356
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,166
He taught me how to control
the power of my eyes.

He was strict, but just.
