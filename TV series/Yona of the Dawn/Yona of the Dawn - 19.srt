1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,750
Welcome to the
Cape of No Return.

2
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,500
[JEAHA] If you're
having second thoughts,

3
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,541
now's the time to turn back.

4
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,875
[YONA] I have to risk
my life for the cause?

5
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,666
Ya can't fight or
protect yourself,

6
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,500
which makes ya
a liability to us.

7
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,000
If you wanna join my crew,

8
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,208
you'll have to prove you've
got what it takes to do so,

9
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,791
and show me you've got the
will to fight inside you.

10
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,416
The will to fight...

11
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,833
All right, then. What is
it you want me to do?

12
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,458
I want you to bring me
some Cheonsu Plants.

13
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:13,666
[PIRATES gasping]

14
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,750
[Jeaha grunts]

15
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,291
But, Captain,
there's no way that--

16
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,416
It's not like you
could do it instead.

17
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,250
Not with a figure like that.

18
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,125
[YUN]
What's a Cheonsu Plant?

19
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,916
[GI-GANG] A medicinal
herb that only grows

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,583
on the Cape of No Return,
and drastically shortens

21
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,833
the recovery times for
illnesses and injuries.

22
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,125
Basically, a cure-all.

23
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,166
A cure-all?

24
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,500
[GI-GANG]
If we had those plants,

25
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,916
my injured dumbasses would
make a speedy recovery.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,416
Lucky for you, the boy who
usually gets them for me

27
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,625
is all banged up right now.

28
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,000
So, how 'bout you do his job

29
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,500
and show me that you're more
than just a pretty face.

30
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,750
And, if you're successful,

31
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,916
you can join my ragtag
group of pirates.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,583
I'll do it.

33
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,708
[GI-GANG]
Oh, yeah.

34
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,916
There's one thing
I forgot to mention.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,791
The part of the cape
where the plants grow

36
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,208
is on a dangerously steep cliff.

37
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,916
You have to carry out this
mission all by your lonesome.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
[YUN, GIJA gasp]

39
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,208
[YONA]
I figured those were the rules.

40
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,666
Yona, that's crazy!

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,916
Yun. It's fine.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,125
I have to do this.
To prove my worth.

43
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,375
How very brave of ya.

44
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,041
Jeaha, take 'er to tha cliff.

45
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,708
Aye, aye, Captain.

46
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,875
I guess next time you see me...

47
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,333
...I'll be a pirate.

48
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,833
[JEAHA] See that narrow ledge
carved out of the rock?

49
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,500
If you follow that
around the cliff,

50
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,333
you'll eventually come
across a small cave

51
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,375
just big enough for
you to crawl inside.

52
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,791
That's where you'll find
the Cheonsu Plants.

53
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,166
And there you have it.
Piece of cake.

54
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:42,541
[JEAHA] "Piece of cake."
It's a nearly impossible task.

55
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:46,208
This is one sadistic trial that
Captain Gi-gang dreamed up.

56
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,500
I wouldn't be surprised

57
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,000
if this scared little girl
backs out right now.

58
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,833
[JEAHA]
Uh!

59
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,208
All right!

60
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,250
[YONA]
Everything's just fine.

61
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,458
It's a long way down
and the path is narrow,

62
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,791
but my small body is perfect
for a task like this.

63
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,833
[gasps]

64
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,458
[whimpers]

65
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,208
[YONA]
My legs. Why won't they move?

66
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,041
No! I-I don't wanna
be here anymore.

67
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,875
I'm scared! Somebody help me!

68
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:24,708
[AO squeaks]

69
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,875
[JEAHA]
Keep it together.

70
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,083
The wind could be
much worse than it is.

71
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,208
[JEAHA] The Green Dragon
Warrior before me always said

72
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,375
that when the Crimson
Dragon King appeared,

73
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,708
it would be my duty
to serve him completely.

74
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,750
I often wondered what
kind of man would show up

75
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,916
and command me
to bow before him.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,833
He'd have to be a tyrant
of incredible power

77
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,041
to force me into such slavery.

78
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,791
However...

79
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,500
Yona seems powerless.
Even feeble.

80
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,750
She's nothing like I imagined

81
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,000
the Crimson Dragon
King would be.

82
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,750
And yet the moment
that she touched me,

83
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,375
my blood cried out
and recognized her.

84
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,791
My heart skipped a beat.

85
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,750
Could this fragile girl
trembling on the rocks before me

86
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,583
really be the king of
the Four Dragon Warriors?

87
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,750
Is she the master
I'm supposed to serve

88
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,375
and protect with my life?

89
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,583
Be careful. Take a deep
breath and relax.

90
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,208
There's nothing wrong
with being scared,

91
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,458
but you can't stand motionless
on the side of a cliff forever.

92
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,208
It's okay. You won't be able
to fight Keum-ji with us,

93
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,000
but the others will understand.

94
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,291
Even though the captain
gave you this mission,

95
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,000
there's no one out here
with a knife at your back

96
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,708
forcing you to put
yourself in danger.

97
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,666
[JEAHA]
That's right. Go back.

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,458
This is far too much
for a girl like you.

99
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,375
[JEAHA]
Just give up.

100
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,250
Now, Yona!

101
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:53,166
[YONA]
No, I'm not giving up. I'm fine.

102
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,583
[JEAHA]
Like hell you are.

103
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,750
[YONA] All I have
to do is pick a flower.

104
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,166
[JEAHA]
You'll get yourself killed.

105
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,708
[YONA]
If I can't do this,

106
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,166
there's no way I'll be able
to face Hak, the captain,

107
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,416
or... any of the others again.

108
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,458
[JEAHA]
Uh.

109
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,125
Ao... you're right.

110
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,416
Let's go.

111
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,458
[JEAHA]
She's still terrified.

112
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,250
So what's keeping her
going at this point?

113
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,375
She's moving faster.

114
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,250
Where is she finding
the strength to endure?

115
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,458
[YONA chuckles]

116
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,500
[JEAHA]
What is it, kiddo?

117
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,208
[YONA] I'm happy she sent
me to get something

118
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,583
that will help the others.

119
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,583
Why is that?

120
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,375
[YONA]
I came here to prove myself,

121
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,958
but that's not what matters.

122
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,708
What if one of my friends gets
injured in the middle of battle,

123
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,875
so much so that
they might not survive?

124
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,083
If the Cheonsu Plant
could save them,

125
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,875
there's no way I'm going back
to the captain without it.

126
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,583
It wouldn't matter
if a thousand soldiers

127
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,000
stood between me and that
plant. Nothing will stop me.

128
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,541
[JEAHA]
Uh.

129
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,791
[YONA] Thinking of the others...
makes it easy to keep going.

130
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,958
But your legs are still shaking.

131
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,916
[YONA yelps]

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,333
Is it because you're afraid
of losing somebody?

133
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:16,541
Of course. That's the thing
I fear more than anything.

134
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,916
No one else should
have to go through

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,791
that kind of pain, either.

136
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,875
[JEAHA]
So, it's her care for others

137
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,708
that keeps her moving forward.

138
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:28,125
Even as her legs
tremble with every step.

139
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,791
She has more in common
with the pirates

140
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,208
trying to save the people
of Awa than I thought.

141
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,833
Hmph. No, that's
not exactly true.

142
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,500
At least those
idiots have strength

143
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,916
and don't cry when
faced with a challenge.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,791
Most of the time.

145
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,916
Jeez, I can't stand
watching her.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,625
[YONA yelps]

147
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,166
[JEAHA]
Uh!

148
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,125
[yelps]

149
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,291
[sighs]

150
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,208
[YONA]
Jeaha, are you following me?

151
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,500
[JEAHA]
Uh... Uhh...

152
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,916
Well, uh, the captain
would want me to.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,083
For surveillance.

154
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,333
Thank you.

155
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,000
You're on your own, kiddo.
I'm not going to help you.

156
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,916
Yeah. I know that,

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,916
but it feels good just
hearing your voice

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,875
and knowing I'm not alone.

159
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,333
You being right
there behind me...

160
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,125
...it gives me courage.

161
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,958
[JEAHA]
I wonder...

162
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,208
Why do I feel better, too?

163
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,750
[JEAHA]
It's unthinkable.

164
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,875
Me, of all people, wanting to
see and hear more of her.

165
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,875
To be closer to her.

166
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,291
The feeling is even stronger
than when we first met.

167
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,708
This must be caused by
the Dragon Warrior's blood

168
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,333
coursing through my veins.

169
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,750
There's no other explanation.

170
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,125
What else could it possibly be?

171
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,375
[JEAHA] Having these feelings
forced upon me is a real drag.

172
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,666
[JEAHA] That's it, kiddo.
This is as far as I go.

173
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,416
From here on out the ledge
is too narrow for me.

174
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,583
You go the rest
of the way alone.

175

[YONA grunts]

176
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,375
[YONA]
All right.

177
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,583
I've always wanted
to be stronger.

178
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,458
First and foremost so
I can take care of myself,

179
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,041
but also to protect Hak,

180
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:16,166
who's thrown everything in his
life away to watch over me.

181
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,250
I wanna be able fight
alongside everyone

182
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,041
who's helped me on this journey.

183
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,583
To keep them safe.

184
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,833
[YONA whimpers]

185
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,000
[YONA]
Come on, legs.

186
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,791
A little farther.

187
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,875
One step at a time.

188
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,625
If I can just keep going,
and complete this task.

189
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,041
If I overcome my fear,

190
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,083
then I'll be one step closer...

191
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,750
...to the strength I've
always wanted to have.

[YONA gasps]

193
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,250
[YONA] These must be
the Cheonsu Plants.

Thank goodness.

196
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,916
I can't believe such small
flowers are so important.

197
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,208
[GI-GANG]
Hmm.

198
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,833
What's gotcha so
concerned, Captain?

199
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,708
[GI-GANG]
There's a storm a'comin'.

200
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,541
[DOK]
Really? Looks clear to me.

201
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,041
That girl's gonna find herself

202
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,416
in some dangerous waters out
there if she ain't careful.

What do you want?

207
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,750
[HAK]
Take me to her.

208
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,458
[JEAHA] Hey, kiddo,
are you still there?

209
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,208
[YONA]
Yeah!

[Jeaha grunts]

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,166
Yona! Go back inside!

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,208
Are you okay?

213
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,083
[JEAHA]
Yona!

214
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,250
Yona!

215
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,333
[JEAHA]
How could I let this happen?

216
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,500
I was right there.
I could've saved her so easily.

217
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,916
But she didn't want any help.

218
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,625
And now this fragile
girl might be--

219
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,458
[grunts]

220
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,708
Jeaha!

221
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:10,750
[JEAHA]
Huh?

222
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,000
[JEAHA]
Kiddo!

223
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,416
Are you all right?
Let me help you.

224
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,041
[YONA]
No!

225
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:23,541
I promised Captain Gi-gang...
that I'd do this by myself.

226
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,416
And I'm almost finished.

227
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,416
You're so determined.

228
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,875
Jeaha.

229
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,458
You stubborn girl.

230
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,791
You had me completely
freaked out.

231
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,041
I don't think
anyone's ever kept me

232
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,541
on pins and needles
like that before.

233
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,416
I gathered the plants,
but I didn't do it alone.

234
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,250
[JEAHA] You shouldn't
act so heartbroken.

235
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,166
[YONA]
Huh?

236
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,125
You're here with me.

237
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,458
Some girls would kill
to be in this situation.

238
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,000
Me, soaking wet,
within their grasp.

How can you laugh at the man who
just risked his life for you?

241
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,458
[YONA] Still charming,
even when you're all wet.

242
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:18,125
Thanks. You saved me.

243
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,166
We won't tell anyone
what happened.

244
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,833
But... what about--

245
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,791
[JEAHA]
Those flowers.

246
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,791
You picked the Cheonsu Plants
by yourself and protected them,

247
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,041
even when you were
in over your head.

248
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,958
That means you kept your promise
to the captain, doesn't it?

249
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,750
Grabbing you was actually
just me showing off.

250
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,208
I'm sure you would've
survived that wave.

251
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,833
There's still one thing left
to do before I'm finished.

252
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,458
Bring back the plants.

253
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,708
Everyone else is waiting on me.

254
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,541
[YUN] So, the Cheonsu Plants
grow all the way down there?

255
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,750
For real?

256
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,791
I told ya. It's a
pretty steep path.

257
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,416
[YUN] What?! It's more
than a little steep,

258
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,750
it's flippin' crazy!
The sea is stormy!

already been swept away!

because she wanted to prove that
she's worthy of joinin' my crew.

264
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,375
You got no business decidin'
whether or not she should do it.

But what if something
happens to her?

Yeah, Yona's weak,
she's just a girl.

There're plenty a
moments in this life

when even a woman's gotta fight.

I'm sorry you were scared.

280
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,166

So, where're the plants?

281
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,500

I fell into the sea.

I wouldn't be here right now.

No chance.

00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,125
[JEAHA]
There's that expression.

317
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,541
She always makes you
look so overwhelmed.

318
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,333
[HAK]
You're one to talk.

319
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,833
Looks like ten years were
added to your face today.

320
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,875
What? That can't be
possible. Not my face.

321
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,333
She was so desperate and
unsteady clinging to that cliff.

322
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,041
Watching her was probably
bad for my heart.

323
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,750
[HAK] You sound like
you're pretty into her.

324
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:53,000
What I'm into is pretty
girls, anytime and anywhere.

325
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,750
Although, I've never met
one like her before.

326
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,791
[JEAHA]
Virtuous. Stubborn. Determined.

327
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,083
And yet still somewhat
unsure of herself.

328
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,750
If you ask me, that
combination seems like a pain.

329
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,250
I can't imagine what it's
like to be her bodyguard.

330
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,833
[laughing]

331
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,500
Not easy.

332
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,875
[JEAHA] She must be
very important to you.

333
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,958
[HAK] Well, we've known each
other since we were kids.

334
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,541
Your girlfriend?

335
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,291
[HAK]
No way.

336
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,958
But important.

337
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,708
My responsibility.

338
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,666
Responsibility, huh?

339
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,875
What's with that tone?

340
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,458
Oh, nothing really.

341
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,541
I find it odd that
you two seem so close,

342
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,916
yet there's still such
distance between you.

343
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,291
[HAK]
Huh?

344
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,833
She's a beautiful girl.
Maybe you've forgotten that

345
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,250
because you've been
so busy protecting her.

346
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,250
[HAK grunts]

347
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,875
This is none of your business.

348
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,833
Why you suddenly
so interested?

349
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,291
Oh, good question.

350
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,000
I guess it's because I've
taken quite a liking to her.

351
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,791
[HAK gasps]

352
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,958
Gotcha!

353
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,583
Seeing that look on your
face was priceless.

354
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,833
It was exactly what I needed.

355
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,958
[JEAHA]
She's a beautiful girl.

356
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,166
Maybe you've forgotten that

357
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,500
because you've been
so busy protecting her.

358
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,833
Whatever. Idiot.

359
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,791
[HAK]
I've been like a brother to her

360
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,833
since we were kids growing up
in the palace together.

361
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,083
He was the one she was after.

362
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,458
I thought they'd end up
ruling the kingdom.

363
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:28,958
And me, I'd be
the one to protect it.

364
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,833
The princess is doing all she
can just to survive right now.

365
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,333
To make a move on her

366
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,333
while I'm supposed to be looking
after her would be wrong.

367
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,791
And yet... I can't
help but wonder.

368
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,666
[HAK]
Why the tears, Princess?

369
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,416
[YONA]
It's nothing. Really, I'm fine.

370
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,416
[HAK grunts]

371
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,000
Ow, let go!
Why're you touching me?

372
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,500
[HAK]
What happened to you?

373
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,250
[YONA] Got a bunch of
thorns stuck in my hands

374
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,458
when I was hanging off
that cliff earlier.

375
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,541
And I heard the best way to get
them out was with a needle.

376
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,208
[HAK] You were digging around
in your hands with a needle?

377
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,333
It hurt so bad, and I didn't
even get any of 'em out!

378
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,541
Did you at least
sterilize the metal first?

379
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,625
What? How do you mean?

380
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,875
You're infected!

381
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,708
Your hands are full of
disgusting bacteria now

382
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,958
and they're gonna
rot off by morning.

383
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,208
[screaming]

384
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,541
[HAK laughing]

385
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,041
I'll skewer you.

386
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,208
[HAK]
We'll fix you up.

387
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,958
Here, wash your hands first.

388
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,166
[YONA]
Okay.

389
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,541
[YONA groans]

390
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,791
Yun'll be mad if he finds out

391
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,875
you went through his
stuff without asking.

392
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,416
He can get over it.
You're more important.

393
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,625
Here we are.

394
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,958
[YONA]
Is that honey?

395
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,625
Wait! What do you plan
on doing with that?

396
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,000
[HAK]
If you apply it to your hands

397
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,416
and let it set for a while,

398
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,916
then the thorns will
come out naturally.

399
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,208
Without any help?

400
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,875
[HAK] The old man used to dig
'em outta me when I was a kid,

401
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,416
so I was really pissed
when I found out

402
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,208
there was an easier way.
I almost killed him.

403
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,250
That does sound
like Mun-deok.

404
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,166
[HAK]
Seriously though.

405
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,500
Your hands look
like a warrior's.

406
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,208
Not a princess's.

407
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:07,666
Do you think... I seem
a little tougher lately?

408
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,583
Am I more like you now?
Do I seem stronger?

409
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,083
[grunts]

410
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:16,000
[JEAHA] I find it odd
that you two seem so close,

411
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,625
yet there's still such
distance between you.

412
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:23,041
Shut the hell up. Idiot.

413
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,250
[HAK]
But... maybe he's right.

414
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,208
Is it possible I've been
hiding my feelings for her?

415
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,666
Even from myself?

416
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,541
Hey, Hak. Uh!

417
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,666
Watch out! The honey's dripping.

418
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,666
[HAK]
Oh.

419
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,958
[gasps]

420
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,041
Uh.

421
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,416
Hak, I-- Um.

422
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,708
What're you--?

423
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,916
[YONA gasps]

424
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,875
Stop it!

425
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,041
[HAK]
Uh.

426
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,208
I'm... okay.

427
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,166
What the hell's gotten
into me? I shouldn't--

428
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,458
[HAK]
I'm acting like a damned fool.

429
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:09,541
I should just be happy that
the princess is alive and free.

430
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,833
Let it be, Hak.

431
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,750
You can't let these
feelings show ever again.

432
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,291
[GI-GANG] Thanks to tha
Cheonsu Plants you brought,

433
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,458
my injured dumbasses are
headed for a full recovery.

434
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,583
We're all really grateful
for what ya did today.

435
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,166
I'm so glad.

436
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,625
[GI-GANG]
I don't wanna have to see

437
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,083
any more death in my lifetime.

438
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,083
You've lost someone
close to you?

439
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,458
[GI-GANG]
Of course I have.

440
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,500
I lead a bunch
of pirates, girlie.

441
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,125
It's not exactly the
safest job in the world.

442
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,416
I want this to be our
final fight, though.

443
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,958
Afterwards, I'm disbanding us.

444
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,375
Then the crew can return home

445
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,625
and get back to their
everyday lives.

446
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,958
Yeah. Sure they can.

447
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,666
But one of em's gonna have a
hard time readjusting to things.

448
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,250
A hard time?

449
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,916
[GI-GANG]
I mean Jeaha.

450
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,625
[GI-GANG]
This ship is home for him.

451
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,333
It's tha only place he's felt
comfortable being himself

452
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,958
with that deformity of his.

453
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,375
But then, what'll he do
if you disband the crew

454
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,833
and everyone goes
their different ways?

455
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:16,708
I'm hopin'... that you'll
take Jeaha with you.

456
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,208
I'd love to have him,

457
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,041
but I don't think
he'd like the idea much.

458
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,625
[GI-GANG chuckles]

459
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,750
[GI-GANG] Sometimes I'm afraid
he'll never find another home

460
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,208
like this one.

461
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,333
[JEAHA]
I'm offended by that, Captain.

462
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,666
I'm a solitary person by nature.

463
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,708
Even living here with the crew,
I spend most of my time alone.

464
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,958
And besides, I'd hardly
call it beautiful,

465
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,750
travelling with weird dragons.

466
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,000
I'd think about it if it were
just Yona and me on the road.

467
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,625
But, then again.

468
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,541
Babysitting is hard work.

469
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,750
So, how about we wait

470
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,208
until you've filled
out a little bit more.

471
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,208
[gasps] You're so mean, Jeaha.

472
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,666
You're just like Hak!

473
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,666
Ahh. Now that's interesting.

474
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,083
Well, this is unexpected.

475
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,916
Usually you got nothing
but sugared words

476
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,458
when you're talking
to the opposite sex.

477
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:07,083
[GI-GANG] Is it 'cause you
actually have feelings for her?

478
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,083
You've gotta be joking.

479
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,958
[YONA growls]

480
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,666
[YONA]
Sinha, is everything okay?

481
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,416
[SINHA]
There are ships... in the port.

482
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,916
They're gathering.

483
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,375
[GI-GANG]
How many of 'em?

484
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:29,416
There's seven.

485
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,625
Seven ships?

486
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:35,250
I see... men with weapons, too.

487
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,500
A lot of them.

488
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,916
That Keum-ji.

489
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,583
He must be tryin' to scare us
away with his numbers.

490
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,166
This'll be a good fight.

491
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,208
He's finally being
a man and retaliating.

492
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,833
[YONA]
What's going to happen?

493
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,416
[GI-GANG] The last battle
is about to begin.

494
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,583
Gather the dumbasses, will ya?

495
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,000
[GI-GANG] Keum-ji's
been gradually increasin'

496
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,958
his manpower lately.
His power has grown.

497
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,583
If I had to guess, I'd say
the extra security is a prep

498
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:09,541
for a large-scale transaction.

499
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,208
He's taking his business
to the Kai Empire.

500
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,833
The Kai Empire?

501
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,625
Of course, the extra forces
are most likely from around Awa.

502
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:20,291
And Keum-ji's clients
are a despicable lot.

503
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,291
I don't understand.
What kind of business?

504
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,583
He's a human trafficker.

505
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,541
[YUN] Don't worry, I know
I said I'm a pacifist,

506
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,666
but I can fight if I have to.

507
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,083
She's in good hands,
Lightning Beast.

508
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,000
Next time on Yona of the Dawn,

509
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:47,083
Episode 20: "Chain of Courage."
