1
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,041
[HAK]
Don't look so worried.

2
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,666
You don't really
believe General Hak

3
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,250
could be defeated by a
little snakebite, do you?

4
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,208
Hak, listen.

5
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,375
Yeah?

6
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,583
Don't you think we
should find a village

7
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,708
where we can buy
some food and medicine?

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,500
That would be
way too dangerous.

9
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,708
I don't think we'd be recognized
by the villagers at this point,

10
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,583
but Su-won's troops
could be looking for us.

11
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:43,833
Well, then...

12
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,708
Is there anywhere that's
safe for us right now?

13
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,041
I know of one place.

14
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,208
I think it's our only
option for safe haven.

15
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:55,041
That's the capital of Fuga.
Home of the Wind Clan.

16
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,958
[snoring]

17
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,875
You think Mun-deok
would be okay

18
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,291
with you guys
sleeping on the job?

19
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,083
General Hak?

20
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,333
Yo.

21
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,875
[yawning]

22
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,333
How long has it been?

23
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,791
Like, ten years, right?

24
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:44,666
[HAK] Uh, three.

25
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,041
Whoa, seriously?

26
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,500
So what happened,
you get yourself fired?

27
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,500
You're as lazy as ever, I see.

28
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,958
We're not lazy, we're easy.

29
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,291
It's the way of the Wind Clan,

30
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,583
we always go with the flow,

31
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,375
doing what we want
when we wanna.

32
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,583
If we feel sleepy,
we take a nap. Cool?

33
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,041
[HAK] What genius put you two
in charge of guarding the gate?

34
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,541
Oh wow!
General Hak is here!

35
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,416
[MAN 4B]
I thought that was him!

36
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,416
[WOMAN 4A]
Oh my goodness!

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,541
[WOMAN 4B]
It's so good to see you!

38
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,541
[WOMAN 4A]
You got even more handsome!

39
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,875
I didn't think
that was possible!

40
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:12,250
Whoa, guys,
one at a time, seriously.

41
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,458
[HAK] I guess they haven't heard
any news from the castle yet.

42
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,166
Aw, who's this
sweet thing with you?

43
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,791
Is she your girlfriend?

44
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,875
What? No way.

45
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,458
She's in training
to be a lady-in-waiting.

46
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,250
Well, is that right?
So, what's your name, Miss?

47
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,333
Huh?

48
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,166
[WOMAN 4A]
Are you from around here?

49
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,250
Your clothes look so fancy!

50
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,250
[MAN 4B]
What's it like at the castle?

51
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,375
I bet there's gold everywhere!

52
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,333
[WOMAN 4B]
How old are you, then?

53
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,750
You look younger than Hak.

54
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,833
[WOMAN 4A] Oh no! Is she okay?

55
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:36,916
[WOMAN 4C] Well, my goodness!

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,916
She's a fragile
little thing, isn't she?

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,416
She just needs to get
something to eat and rest.

58
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,416
Am I really witnessing General
Hak being nice to a girl?

59
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,916
Did you hear
what I just said?

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,041
Oh. Yes, sir!

61
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,791
Heang-dea. Is my
grandpa Mun-deok around?

62
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,916
No, he received a
request to go to the castle.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,083
What for?

64
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,791
I dunno, your guess
is as good as mine.

65
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,250
They summoned all five generals
to a meeting at the castle

66
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,500
out of the blue.

67
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,000
A five-general summons?

68
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,291
Yeah, we thought it was weird

69
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,583
that Elder Mun-deok
was called instead of you.

70
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,291
I mean, he's been
retired a while,

71
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,416
and you're the
new clan general and all.

72
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,625
I hope everything's
okay up there.

73
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,541
Hang on, you didn't
really get fired, did you?

74
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,833
You wanna tell us
what's going on here?

75
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,750
We get summoned
to an emergency meeting

76
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,708
only to find out
the king has died?

77
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,333
And rumor has it that
Princess Yona and General Hak

78
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,791
have gone missing, as well.

79
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,250
Do you have any information,
Elder Mun-deok?

80
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,833
He is your grandson, after all,

81
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,750
and protecting him
would be treason.

82
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,916
Is that an accusation?

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,666
Don't jump to
conclusions, Su-Jin.

84
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,375
I am merely
repeating what I've heard

85
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,250
here at the
Crimson Dragon Castle.

86
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,791
Word is Hak murdered the king

87
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,708
and took the
princess as his hostage.

88
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,625
Apparently, he believes
she is the key

89
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,250
to taking over the throne.

90
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,458
Hak isn't here
to defend himself.

91
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,916
And we mustn't make assumptions.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,041
I mean, how do we know
that he and the princess

93
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,166
haven't been captured?

94
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,750
When he was
thirteen years old,

95
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,708
the "Lightning Beast"
was such a skilled warrior

96
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,416
that he surpassed even me.

97
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,291
I seriously doubt
he's been captured.

98
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,791
[KEISHUK]
Silence, gentlemen.

99
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,000
The king's been assassinated.

100
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,708
We don't yet know
who's responsible,

101
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,000
but Princess Yona and General
Hak have both gone missing.

102
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,541
So there's truth to the rumors.

103
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,000
Please leave the details
of the investigation to us.

104
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,250
It would not be wise to jump
to conclusions so hastily.

105
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,291
If you hear anything
of Hak or Yona,

106
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,875
please notify
the castle immediately.

107
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:30,916
But Su-won...

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,875
Don't sensationalize
the situation.

109
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,083
Any publicity
could be dangerous.

110
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,416
We cannot allow the clans
to fall into conflict.

111
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,750
We need them
to work together

112
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,583
to restore power
to the Kohka Kingdom.

113
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,041
We are vulnerable now.

114
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,208
We must rally together to
prevent a foreign invasion.

115
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,541
That is the truth.

116
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,958
King Il always went
about things the wrong way.

117
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,583
His "solution" was to cede land

118
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,458
and give tributes
to other nations.

119
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:55,958
You're right,
this kingdom has fallen

120
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,833
to its lowest point in decades.

121
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,708
The last thing we should do
is fight each other.

122
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,291
Then let's get to work.

123
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,875
The first order of business
is to appoint a new king.

124
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,125
With all due respect,
the choice is quite clear.

125
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,416
We don't know if
Princess Yona is still alive.

126
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,000
Therefore, Su-won is the only
other person of royal blood.

127
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,250
He would've been next
in line to the throne anyway.

128
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,583
So, as far as I'm concerned,

129
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,708
appointing him king
is the next logical step.

130
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,583
I'm in agreement.

131
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,125
And let me state for the record

132
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,000
that I will serve
and support you.

133
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,916
Your Majesty, the entire Fire
Clan is wholly at your command.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,083
[KEISHUK] What do the
other clan leaders

135
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,458
have to say on the subject?

136
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,833
The same.
Su-won has my allegiance.

137
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,416
I support him, as well.

138
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,333
I'm tired.
Too sleepy for this.

139
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,416
All this serious talk makes
an old man very drowsy.

140
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,541
I'm going home.

141
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,875
General Mun-deok.
We haven't finished.

142
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,250
[MUN-DEOK]
I am no longer a general.

143
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,916
Hak leads my clan now.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,875
If you want a vote,
you'll have to get it from him.

145
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,416
You know the
Wind Clan is already

146
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,041
under suspicion of treachery.

147
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,250
If you do not approve
Lord Su-won as king,

148
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,625
you could be putting
your people in more danger.

149
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,708
[sighs]

150
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,000
I need the vote of all
five clans to be the king.

151
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,625
I can't do it
without your approval.

152
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,916
But no kingdom can
survive without a ruler.

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,916
What a conundrum.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
If you had married
Princess Yona,

155
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,916
you'd legitimately be king.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,041
I would have given you
my sincere blessings

157
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,333
if that were the case.

158
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,166
But I know Hak would
never flee the castle

159
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,000
without a
damned good reason.

160
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,708
And I know for a fact he
would never take the princess

161
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,708
as a hostage.

162
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,125
Time will tell.

163
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,708
The coronation
ceremony is in three days.

164
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,166
I hope you will attend,

165
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,375
for your own sake and
for the sake of your people.

166
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,250
It could be very bad for
all involved if you don't.

167
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,750
This truly breaks
my heart, Your Majesty.

168
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,208
I've known you from birth.

169
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,208
You were like a grandson
to me, just like Hak.

170
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,875
[SU-WON]
I appreciate your help.

171
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:01,958
Your Highness,

172
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,291
I think you're making
a big mistake.

173
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,500
You must hunt down
Hak and Princess Yona

174
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,416
and kill them immediately.

175
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,875
If you don't, you risk of them

176
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,250
revealing the truth
to the public.

177
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,291
Hak is not that stupid.

178
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,833
If the truth got out
then chaos would erupt.

179
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,958
That would put Yona
in even more danger.

180
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,333
He'd die to protect her,

181
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,958
so our secret is safe
with him for the time being.

182
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,166
[SU-WON] Thank you again,
General Su-jin.

183
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,375
We should begin preparing for
resistance from the Wind Clan.

184
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,125
[GANG SU-JIN] As you wish.

185
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,250
[horse neighs]

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,583
[SU-WON] Thank you, Mun-deok.

187
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,041
You'll never know
how happy I was

188
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,500
to hear you thought
of me like a grandson.

189
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,250
It means so much to me.

190
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,500
[YONA] Where am I?

191
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,541
Why am I wearing new clothes?

192
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,041
I'm glad you're awake!

193
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,708
That's good.
The fever has gone down.

194
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,583
Now eat as much
as you can, okay?

195
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,000
You need your strength.

196
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,291
Smells delicious.

197
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,666
'Cause it is!

198
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,416
Why are you crying, lady?

199
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,541
Um... Does it taste bad?

200
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,000
No, it's really hot.

201
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,666
Now you're crying
because it's too hot?

202
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,791
You're really sensitive.

203
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,500
This reminds me of my father.

204
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,833
My name's Tea-Yeon.
General Hak is my older brother.

205
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,750
[YONA] I didn't know
he had a little brother.

206
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,375
You must be one of his
friends from the castle, huh?

207
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,916
I guess I am.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,583
--What do you mean, you guess?
--What do you mean, you guess?

209
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,083
How can you be so cruel?

210
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,250
He obviously has no chance
of being your boyfriend.

211
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,500
But to act like you're not
even sure he's your friend

212
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,333
while he pines away
in unrequited love?

213
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,250
That's downright cold-hearted!

214
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,000
So am I your
friend or am I not?

215
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,083
Well, more like my serv--

216
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,500
From now on your name's Lina.

217
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,375
You're training as a
lady-in-waiting at the castle.

218
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,750
You got it?

219
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,583
All right. Atta girl.

220
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,250
[ALL] Whoa!

221
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,750
You shouldn't act naughty
in front of us, General Hak!

222
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,625
Lina, what's my brother like
when he's away at the castle?

223
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,875
Let's see,
how should I put it?

224
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,000
It's your brain that's weird.

225
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,458
[YONA] He's rude.

226
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,000
Completely insensitive.

227
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,041
With no charm whatsoever.

228
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,500
He's brutish and boorish.

229
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,500
Thinks he's--

230
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,791
All right,
that's enough from you!

231
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,916
Joke's over.

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
[muffled laughter]

233
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,500
You're awesome, Miss Lina,

he's got absolutely
no charm whatsoever.

235
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,583
[HAK] Oh, you think
I'm funny, do you?

236
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,541
[YONA] Everyone here seems
so happy and full of life.

237
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,791
Hak grew up in
a wonderful place.

238
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,291
So can you
tell me what it's like

239
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,458
to live at the castle?

240
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,416
Are there fancy feasts
all the time?

241
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,291
Yes, but nobody there can
cook a meal as good as this one.

242
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,708
[TEA-YEON laughs]

243
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,916
There's a lot more, so you can
eat as much as you want!

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,958
[YONA] I will.

245
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,958
[WOMAN 4C] Hello, Lina!

246
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,791
I hope you got plenty of rest.

247
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,250
Excuse me, Lina!

248
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,291
Sorry?

[YONA] I forgot. I'm Lina.

250
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,666
You're kinda spacey, aren't ya?

251
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,416
Is it really true that you
got kicked out of the castle?

252
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,833
That's such a shame!

253
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,625
They say you can't cook,
clean, sew, do laundry, dance,

254
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,083
and you can't even
play a note on the harp!

255
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,791
[laughing]

256
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,458
Well, don't you
worry for a second.

257
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,375
I'll teach you everything
you'd ever need to know.

Go wash these clothes.

00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,375
But I don't know how.

I've got full faith in you!

262
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,666
No, wait!

263
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,708
Follow me, lady-in-waiting.

264
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,166
Why you so mad?

265
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,541
'Cause I can play the
harp and dance a little!

Oh, is that what you
call that awful cacophony?

267

more like yourself.

268

Nothing, don't worry about it.

270
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,041
I didn't know you
had a little brother.

He's so cute.
Not like you at all.

00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,250
Well, excuse me.

273
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,625
Grandpa adopted Tea-Yeon, too.

274
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,458
He's another orphan,
just like I was.

275
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,208
But unlike me,
he's frail and in poor health.

276
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,541
That's why everyone in the clan
keeps a close eye on him.

277
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,375
Yesterday, he
overexerted himself.

278
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,708
[HAK] This is it.

00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,666
Take the clothes down
to the river and get started.

It's the Wind Clan's
only water source,

so show some respect for it.

Seriously?

284
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,291
At least give it a shot
before you give up.

290
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,416
I sent Heang-Dea upriver
to investigate the issue.

291
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,458
We've gotta hurry
and find another water source

292
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,875
or we all could die!

293
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,375
I know, but panicking's
not gonna help our situation.

294
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,583
We'll buy our water from
passing merchants for now.

There's enough in our reserves
to live on for the time being.

I'm so sorry.

I heard your father was murdered
and that you and Hak had fled.

I couldn't believe
what they were saying to me.

been there for you.

are you having trouble eating?

No. They feed me really well.

has been so kind to me.

00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,708
I went upstream to
investigate like you asked

319
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,833
and I found a bunch of Fire Clan
guys damming up the river.

320
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,291
They were all pretty well armed,

321
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,625
but I got so angry I picked
a fight with them anyway.

322
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,291
Of course, I got beat up
and tossed aside.

323
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,708
[MUN-DEOK]
The Fire Clan did this?

324
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,583
How dare they do
something so despicable to us?

325
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,458
What are they
trying to do, start a war?

326
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,750
Master Hak,
let us go fight them.

327
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,500
I'll rip them to shreds!

328
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,958
Wait. We can't
rush in with retaliation.

329
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,375
[TEU] Why not?

330
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,583
They dammed up the river
and injured Heang-Dea, to boot!

331
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,583
If we don't do something,
we're all gonna die!

332
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,041
Stop panicking!

333
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,291
No one in Fuga is going to die.

334
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,583
Get going,
treat Heang-Dea immediately.

335
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,333
Yes, sir.

336
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,333
[HEANG-DEA] Ow! Be a little
more careful would ya?

337
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,750
Well, Grandpa?

338
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,208
This is a warning from
"our friends" in the Fire Clan.

339
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,708
What do you mean?

340
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,916
They are trying to appoint
"His Highness" Su-won

341
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,500
as the successor
to the late king.

342
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,833
[YONA gasps]

343
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,833
Since I wasn't willing
to give my approval,

344
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,291
they're putting pressure
on me where I'll feel it most.

345
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,875
[YONA]
Su-won, who murdered my father.

346
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,250
He's going to be the next king?

347
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,666
[MUN-DEOK] Princess.

348
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,458
It's never going to be.

349
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,958
I won't consent.

350
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,291
If I acknowledge Su-won
as the successor,

351
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,125
I'd be admitting
there's a possibility

352
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,750
that Hak killed your father,
which we all know isn't true.

353
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,166
You're right about that.

354
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,625
Using me as a scapegoat
is the easiest route to take.

355
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,125
Oh, Hak.

356
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,500
There's no need to worry.

357
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,916
The Fire Clan wouldn't
dare do anything worse

358
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
than they already have.

359
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,458
So how are things
going with the Wind Clan?

360
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,083
We haven't seen any movement
from them at this point.

361
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,541
But without their
main water source,

362
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,625
they can't last more than--

363
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,083
No, it's not good enough!

364
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,333
We've got to do more
than just dam the river!

365
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,125
Yes, but I can only
follow the direct orders

366
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,166
General Su-jin gave me, sir.

367
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,000
My sources tell me
that many merchants

368
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,916
trade regularly
with the Wind Clan.

369
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,458
This plan won't work if
they can still purchase water.

370
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,916
We'll crush the merchants
before they reach Fuga.

371
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,416
But we can't.

372
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,291
We'd be acting outside of
General Su-jin's direct orders.

373
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,041
Then we'll make it look
like the work of bandits

374
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,041
and he'll never
know we did anything!

375
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,083
Why have you been so
cranky the past few days,

376
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,583
Master Tea-Jun?

377
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,791
[GANG TEA-JUN] The throne
could have been mine

378
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,291
if only I had been able
to win Princess Yona's heart.

379
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,416
But Son Hak had to go
and get in my way!

380
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,833
Are you serious?

381
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,750
[YONA]
Su-won is going to be king.

382
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,333
I just know it.

383
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,500
All four of the other clans
have agreed to it already.

384
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,041
Then what will become
of the Wind Clan?

385
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,875
Lina!

386
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,750
What's wrong?
Are you hungry?

387
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,875
It's time to eat.

388
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,166
There's a water
shortage going on, so...

389
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,125
I should conserve.

390
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,500
Don't worry about it.

391
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,875
Big brother told me it's
my job to fatten you up.

392
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,833
So eat as much as you can!

393
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,541
And he says it's
a Wind Clan tradition

394
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,333
to show guests
so much hospitality

395
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,916
that they offer us
money for our trouble...

396
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,500
Tea-Yeon?

397
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,500
Are you all right?

398
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,291
What happened?

399
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,166
[YONA] He just collapsed!

400
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,916
An attack.

401
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,750
[MUN-DEOK] His lungs
have always been weak,

402
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,958
and sometimes
he has these moments

403
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,833
of respiratory paralysis.

404
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,000
He'll be fine...

405
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,500
...once he takes his medicine.

406
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,125
Grandpa, the merchants who
were supposed to bring it today

407
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,083
haven't arrived yet.

408
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,541
I'll go and find them.

409
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,958
We've got a problem!

410
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,541
The merchants who
were delivering the water

411
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,625
were attacked on the road!

412
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,833
This is bad!

413
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,750
[MAN 4A] They've all
been horribly injured!

414
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,250
No...

415
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,791
Now we're cut off from our
last reliable source of water.

416
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,791
And Tea-Yeon's medicine.

417
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,875
We have to get it! Now!

418
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,458
[TEU] Dammit!

419
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,708
This has gotta be
the work of the Fire Clan!

420
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,791
We can't stand for it!

421
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,916
[MAN 4A]
Say something, General Hak!

422
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,500
We have to act now,
Elder Mun-deok!

423
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,541
[MUN-DEOK] The royals of
the Sky Clan rule the kingdom

424
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,750
and fully support the Fire Clan.

425
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,250
[HAK] If we engage in
conflict with the Fire Clan,

426
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,458
it puts our people
in grave danger.

427
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,666
[YONA] No...

428
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,875
I can't watch another
innocent person die!

429
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,750
[TEU] Heang-Dea.
You need to rest.

430
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,250
[HEANG-DEA] You dummies!

431
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,291
Ya need to calm yourselves
and leave the Fire Clan alone!

432
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,833
[TEU] You're the one
who started this whole thing

433
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,208
in the first place.

434
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,833
[HEANG-DEA] Yeah, yeah,
what matters most right now

435
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,541
is getting Tea-Yeon's medicine.

436
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,625
It would be fastest if
I rode out to the doctor

437
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,500
in the east woods
and got it from her.

438
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,791
[TEU] You really think
you should be riding

439
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,291
with those injuries?

440
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,958
[HEANG-DEA] Look, everybody
knows I'm the fastest rider

441
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,125
in the clan.

442
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,000
Pretty please,
let me do it, Master.

443
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,958
I wanna go save the day!

444
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,916
Go ahead.

445
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,041
But bargain with her.

446
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,166
Yes, sir!

447
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,125
Great, now he
thinks he's a tough guy.

448
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,916
Listen up, everybody.

449
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,208
We're all angry,
but we can't retaliate.

450
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,333
The Fire Clan's military
far exceeds ours at the moment.

451
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,750
I won't let us get
dragged into a futile war.

452
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,208
But I swear to you
that I will rectify this.

453
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,666
We're a resilient people.

454
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,208
Damming our river
isn't going to kill us.

455
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,166
Trust me to
do right by our clan.

456
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,708
We must stay strong,
go on with our lives.

457
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,791
As your leader,
that's my command!

458
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,083
[MAN 4A] He gave us an order!

459
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,500
That's a first.

460
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,541
[WOMAN 4A] This is the same kid
who didn't want the job!

461
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,708
[HAK]
He's gotten a little better.

462
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,833
You really need to
get some rest, as well.

463
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,125
You're not fully recovered.

464
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,166
Listen. I wanna help.

465
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,791
If you can think of anything
that I could do, tell me.

466
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,875
Well, there is something.

467
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,125
You could definitely try
to be a little bit sexier,

468
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,291
if you ask me.

469
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,208
What? You sicko!

470
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,666
How could you be so crude
at a time like this?

471
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,250
Heh. Kidding.

472
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,958
You just need to focus
on getting some rest.

473
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,458
What's wrong?

474
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,333
You can't sleep, either?

475
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,708
It looks like we're
in the same boat.

476
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,125
Wanna have a drink with me?

477
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,125
I broke out the good stuff.

478
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,708
This is a rare treat.

479
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,916
I don't think you've ever shared
your best booze with me.

480
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,291
Well...

481
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,541
I just kinda grabbed a
bottle from your top shelf.

482
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,291
[coughing]

483
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,291
Don't waste it.

484
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,416
Okay. What is it you want?

485
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,000
I've been doing some thinking.

486
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,875
I know if it were solely up
to you, you wouldn't hesitate

487
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,916
to start a full-on war
with the Fire Clan, right?

488
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,291
You'd do the same.

489
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,250
Don't act all high and mighty.

490
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,625
You're too old to bear this
kind of burden anymore, Grandpa.

491
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,416
I have a favor to ask.

492
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,583
I want you to approve Su-won's
appointment to the throne.

493
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,041
I'll leave tomorrow morning and
give your name back to you.

494
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,291
That's all.

495
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,000
I have to leave the Wind Clan.

496
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,750
We have to place the protection
our people above all else.

497
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:56,041
If you consent, the Fire Clan
won't have any reason to stay.

498
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,708
You know they're
gonna put a hefty bounty

499
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,250
on your head, right?

500
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,750
That sounds fun.

501
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,375
I've always wanted to be
Kohka's greatest villain.

502
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,583
[MUN-DEOK] Do you plan to leave
the princess here with us?

503
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,166
Bringing her here was the best
idea I've had in a long time.

504
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,375
She's starting to
seem like her old self.

505
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,333
I have one more
favor to ask.

506
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,375
Hide Yona from the Sky Clan.

507
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,958
Let her stay here.

508
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,625
Allow her to live in the Wind
Clan for the rest of her life.

509
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,833
I refuse!

510
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,166
I don't grant
favors to my grandson.

511
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,708
I would never abandon
my own family like that.

512
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,583
Grandpa!

513
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,458
If it were an order
from the clan leader,

514
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,208
I could make an exception.

515
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,916
I, Son Hak,
command this of you.

516
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,958
My last order as General.

517
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,500
[MUN-DEOK] As you wish.

518
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,041
[YONA] No!

519
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,916
I didn't leave Fuga
to cower in hiding.

520
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,125
I must be brave!

521
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,041
I can't rely on Hak
to protect me forever.

522
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:43,000
[YONA] Next time, on Yona of the
Dawn, episode 5: "Roar."
