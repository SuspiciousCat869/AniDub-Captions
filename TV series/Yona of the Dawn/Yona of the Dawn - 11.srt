Hey, Mr. White Snake.

I bet you're tired since
you're not used to travel.

I've gotta protect you, too,
if any danger comes along.

Gija, you can tell when the
other dragons are nearby?

Your name's Yun, isn't it?
You're right, I can.

If I focus my
mind's eye intently,

00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,541
I can usually find
my way to them.

In that case, which
one's closest to us?

Let me see.

39
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,708
The Blue Dragon
Warrior is closest.

At least, that's what I feel.

Wow. I'm really impressed
you can sense them. So?

...he's somewhere over
in that direction.

be a little more specific?

be afraid of following someone

You Dragon Warriors
sure are dedicated.

164
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,958
Why don't you tell
me your reason

165
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,250
for protecting the
princess so intently?

166
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,833
[chuckles]

167
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,416
I'm not getting personal with
some idiot that I just met.

[HAK]
Stay focused!

[BANDITS yelping]

172
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,291
[GIJA] It's insane. I thought
he was a weak human,

173
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,916
but his strength, it's...
like nothing I've ever seen.

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,958
I hate to admit it, but he's as
strong as my dragon's arm.

175
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,416
This is unreal! They're gods!

176
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,833
Gija's strength and Hak's
speed are unbeatable!

177
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,083
No enemy could possibly
stand a chance. It's amazing.

178
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,875
[YUN]
Do you wanna help them?

179
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,083
[gasps]

180
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,375
Hak told me to hide and stay
quiet. So, no.

181
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,791
But, isn't this
the kinda situation

182
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,541
you've been practicing for?

183

[YONA grunts]

184
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,666
Based on my calculations,

185
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,208
you can shoot far enough to do
some real damage from here.

186

[BOTH grunting]

187

[YUN] Aim for the guy
behind that tree.

188
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,791
Point just a little bit higher.

189
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,208
Now, shoot 'im!

190
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,708
[BANDIT yelps, yells]

191
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,208
Success!

192
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,750
Wow, thanks, Yun! You're a
much better teacher than Hak!

193
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,208
I can teach you
the ropes any day.

194
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,166
When I tried myself,
it's not so good.

Keep your mouths shut
and don't move, girls.

You'll make such

So, is it over?

205
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,583
How many of those
guys did you take out?

206
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,750
Huh? Oh, I never keep track.

207
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,583
Well, I took down 28.

208
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,958
Then I must've got 40.

209
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,958
Dirty liar! You just told
me you never keep track!

210
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,583
Besides, there weren't
that many to begin--

Gija! Are you... okay?

214
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:59,041
[GIJA] Yes. I'm sorry.
I guess I overdid it.

215
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,791
I wanted my fighting to
impress you, so I went all out.

216
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,625
But I got carried away.

217
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,875
Oh, really? I thought
it was about right.

218

Your fighting style is
better than anyone

who's ever fought beside me.

220
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,916
It makes me happy.
I've found an equal.

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,125
Finally, someone who's worthy
of standing beside me in battle.

222
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,416
One day, you and
I should... spar.

223
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,833
[YONA] Hak!

224
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:22,750
Did he just die?

225
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,541
He's not dead!

226
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,458
[YUN] What an idiot!
He reopened his wounds!

227
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,958
He really hasn't healed
enough to be fighting.

228
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,583
He acts like a god,
but he's human after all.

229
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,583
[GIJA] He fought so well
and with that kind of injury?

230
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,000
Unbelievable. This guy...

231
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,375
He's a monster.

232
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,000
I doubt he'd appreciate
that, coming from you.

[YUN]
It's gonna be getting dark soon.

234

We need find a place
to bed down for tonight.

235
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,458
Do you know of a
lodge around here?

236
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,000
No, we're gonna camp out.

usually how it works.

closely behind us

What do you think
you're doing, Princess?

243
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,875
He's out cold. Someone
needs to carry him.

00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,375

Wow, thanks, Gija!

It's no big deal.

My dragon's arm's ten times
stronger than a normal person's.

Wait. Hold on. That arm
doesn't have special powers.

Don't worry about him.
He's gonna be fine.

What?

252
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,541
He always makes it through.

253
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:38,583
It's just that... my whole
life he's been my protector.

00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,041
Someday I wanna
return the favor.

255
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,208
You're remarkably strong

256
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,375
for a young girl who
grew up in a castle.

257
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,041
No way, that's not true!

258
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,958
How can you say that
when you stayed so calm

259
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,208
in the face of those bandits?

260
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:54,125
You're right, but
bandits don't scare me.

261
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,333
After seeing my father
killed that night,

262
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,166
not much frightens me.

263
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,458
[YUN] Hey!

264
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,000
Hurry up!

265
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,166
[YONA chuckles]

266
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,333
Let's go.

267
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,500
[GIJA]
This feeling.

268
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,041
I can't get over this desire
to protect my master.

269
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,666
Is it because of
the dragon's blood?

270
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,916
I feel the need to care for her.

271
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,208
She is strong, but there's
a vulnerability she's hiding,

272
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,541
and it stirs
something within me.

273
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,625
Uh... What is this?

274
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,958
It's what's for dinner
tonight. Something wrong?

275
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,083
Yes, there is!
This is not a meal,

276
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,500
it's just a bunch
of boiled weeds

277
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,083
you picked from
the side of the trail!

278
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,916
They are not just weeds! They're
nutritious, edible wild plants!

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,333
If you don't shut your mouth,
next time you're eating insects!

280
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,375
Insects? You don't
actually eat bugs, do you?

281
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,416
They have a lot
of nutritional value.

282
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,166
[GIJA]
Princess, do you mean to tell me

283
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,041
you're okay with
eating like this?

284
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,583
I can't stomach eating bugs yet,

285
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,375
but I've gotten used to
pretty much everything else.

286
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,458
I mean, after all,

287
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,291
it's not as though I had
much choice in the matter.

288
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,333
But, thanks to Yun's
amazing cooking skills,

289
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,666
our meals are much
tastier than you'd think!

290
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,666
If you had seen some of the
stuff that Hak made me eat--

291
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,000
Gija, what are you
crying about now?

292
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,666
I feel so sorry for you.

293
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,000
I can't believe the
hardships you've endured.

294
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,208
[HAK] What was that you
said about my cooking?

295
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,458
Oh, Hak. Glad you're awake!

296
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,750
I'm not letting that one slide.

297
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,583
Are you feeling any better?

298
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,166
I'm fine.
Don't change the subject.

299
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,458
Would you care to repeat what
you said about my cooking?

300
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,833
Your cooking?
I said it was great!

301
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,958
So, I'll bet you're hungry!

302
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,083
I see someone's gotten
better at deflecting.

303
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,708
Do you think that you can move?

304
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,666
Better yet, I'll go
get you some food.

305
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,125
Here, now open your mouth.

306
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,333
Ahhhh. Ah?

307
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,750
I've got this.

308
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,833
You don't need to sully
yourself with tedious errands.

309
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,875
White Snake, we were
having a moment.

310
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,250
You've got some nerve, trying to
get the princess to feed you.

311
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,666
[YUN] Okay, now that
we're done with dinner,

312
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,166
let's talk about the
Blue Dragon Warrior.

313
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,708
Gija, do you sense his presence?

314
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,500
I feel something that way.

315
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,500
Right, thanks again
for being so helpful.

316
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,458
Do you know if he lives in a
protected village like you did?

317
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,208
Or is he on his own?

318
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,666
I don't know for sure,
but I've heard things.

319
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,708
According to the intelligence
our scouts brought back

320
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,916
to my village, the Blue Dragon's
people used to live in hiding

321
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,333
within the Earth
Clan's territory.

322
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,583
One day the village
disappeared into thin air.

323
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,875
No one saw or heard from
any of the villagers

324
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,125
or the Blue Dragon ever again.

325
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,500
They disappeared?

326
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,791
But they've gotta be alive
out there somewhere!

327
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,125
[GIJA] Hmm...

328
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,458
If I concentrate hard enough,

329
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:35,125
I can definitely feel the
Blue Dragon's heartbeat.

330
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,208
Ik-su did mention the
other dragons were nomadic.

331
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,291
So, then, what I bet they did

332
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,875
is move the whole
village into hiding.

333
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,541
You've been pointing
towards North-North East,

334
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,541
straight into
Fire Clan territory.

335
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,125
There are about six locations

336
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,458
that could potentially
hide a village like that.

337
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,666
Yun, have you been there before?

338
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,833
No, I haven't, but still.

339
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,916
I do know there are a few
large towns just past Saika.

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,666
This area up here is
used for trade routes.

341
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,000
It's also where a
lot of noblemen

342
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,000
have their second homes.

343
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,333
By process of elimination,

344
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,500
I can surmise there are
only six other areas

345
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,916
out of the way enough
to hide a whole village.

346
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,125
You are smart!

347
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,625
You're the cutest little
"boy genius" I know!

348
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,750
Ugh, stop treating me
like a little kid!

349
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,125
You're only a year
older than me.

350
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,583
That's enough chit chat!

351
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,416
Tomorrow, our Blue Dragon
hunt will start in earnest!

352
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,791
Goodnight, sleep tight,
and all that junk.

353
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,083
Yeah, sleep well--
Wait, out here?

354
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,541
Good night, sweet dreams.

355
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,375
Wait. Wha--

356
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,291
Oh, can it, White Snake!

357
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,500
No.

358
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,708
[GIJA]
So tired.

359
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,041
Gija!

360
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,041
What in the world happened
to your beautiful face?

361
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,083
Oh, sorry for my hideousness.

362
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,958
Ohh, look at that, there's a
centipede on your back.

363
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,041
[GIJA yelping]

364
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,208
[YONA]
Calm down!

365
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,083
H-He was just messing
with you! I swear!

366
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,416
I don't know how much longer
I can handle these guys.

367
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,916
Listen up, we're entering
a town, so try to blend in.

368
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,041
We're in the heart of
the Fire Clan's domain.

369
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,250
Try to play it cool!

370
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,166
[ALL] 'Kay.

371
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,500
[YUN]
This'll never work.

372
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,708
Well, Gija?

373
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,166
I don't sense him here.

374
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,500
Wouldn't want it to
be too easy, right?

375
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,500
Looks like the next stop
is 24 miles from here.

376
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,916
No, wait, that
one's off the list.

377
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,541
The Fire Clan turned it
into a military training camp.

378
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,666
Huh?

379
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,375
Okay, what about this place?

380
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,166
[HAK] There's a lot
of military there, too.

381
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,041
[YUN] Yikes. I guess
we should avoid it, then.

382
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,291
Gija, is something wrong?

383
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,458
No.

384
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,083
Okay, you guys.
We've got it figured out.

385
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,750
There's only three options.

386
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,541
One of them's gotta
be the village.

387
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,875
Uh, really?

388
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,125
You've got some good
intel, Lighting Beast. Wow.

389
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,666
Well, I was one of the
five generals, after all.

390
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,958
It was our duty to keep abreast

391
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,125
of the other clans'
military movements.

392
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,750
I wanna hear about that!

393
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,625
[HAK]
Sure. Let's talk.

394
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,208
[YUN]
'Kay. Move out.

395
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:04,375
Nothing?

396
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,416
Nope.

397
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,166
He's not around here.

398
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:12,583
Here, either.

399
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,041
[YONA, YUN, HAK groan]

400
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,583
[HAK, YUN groan]

401
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,916
[YUN]
Well? Anything?

402
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,416
[GIJA] No.

403
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,666
--[YONA, HAK sigh]
--This is getting ridiculous!

404
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,916
[GIJA]
Something's pulling me that way.

405
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,875
[YUN]
You mean we have to go farther?

406
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,708
It's so strange. He's not in
any of the places we predicted.

407
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:36,916
I guess it's possible

408
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,041
he could'ave crossed
the border, but still.

409
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,750
Maybe your nose is stopped up
or something, White Snake.

410
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,500
I'm not some dumb
dog following a scent!

411
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,666
Princess. I hope you
didn't hurt your feet.

412
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,916
[YONA] Oh, It's okay.
I'm just tired from walking.

413
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,666
Here, drink this.

414
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,375
Oh, wow! That's delicious!

415
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:04,041
That's homemade fruit wine.
It's good for soothing fatigue.

416
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,458
I'll wrap up your
feet in hot herbs

417
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,125
so you can rest for the evening.

418
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,500
You're the best, Yun.
Your wonders never cease.

419
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,166
[GIJA]
I don't get it.

420
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,083
How can anyone sleep out
in the open like this?

421
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,458
[GIJA]
Everyone is so exhausted.

422
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,166
We've been on the road for days.

423
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,458
Hiding, traveling off
the beaten path.

424
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,125
If only my senses
were more acute,

425
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,000
I could pinpoint the Four
Dragons more easily.

426
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,250
Then the princess wouldn't have
to be suffering such fatigue.

427
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,875
Having to rely on Yun and Hak
it makes me feel so helpless.

428
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,666
[grunts]

429
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,708
[GIJA]
Blue Dragon Warrior.

430
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,916
My brother of the
same sacred blood.

431
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,083
I know you're out there.

432
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,916
Your master, she's
calling for you,

433
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,958
longing to be reunited with
you after all these centuries.

434
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,625
I know you must feel
the same desire to serve

435
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,000
and protect her once more.

436
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,000
[GIJA] I guess I must
have fallen asleep.

437
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,750
[thud]

438
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,083
[GIJA] What's that?

439
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,250
[GIJA]
It's the princess.

440
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,458
[GIJA]
But why at this hour?

441
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,625
Princess--Mm.

442
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,500
Don't interrupt her.

443
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,833
[GIJA] How long has she
practiced archery?

444
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,958
Since before we met you.
Every chance she gets.

445
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,750
200 arrows a night, or more.

446
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:36,458
200--?

447
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,000
Keep your voice down.

448
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,750
[GIJA] Why is she
pushing herself so hard?

449
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,333
It's not as though she'll
ever have to fight

450
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,791
with me here to protect her.

451
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,875
[HAK] I dunno. Doesn't
really make sense.

452
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,750
'Cause she doesn't have
to worry with me around.

453
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:54,250
But still, she seems ashamed of
her helplessness sometimes.

454
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,666
[GIJA gasps]

455
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,083
[HAK] Her father was killed.
She's without a home.

456
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,291
The only thing she wants
in this world is to survive.

457
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,416
She knows she can't do it on
her own and it eats away at her.

458
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,125
This is how she
takes back power.

459
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,000
Don't you think you
should stop her?

460
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,375
Weapons aren't
meant for princesses.

461
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,333
Do you think I that
want to see her fight?

462
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,041
It's the last thing
I would ever want.

463
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,375
But I do wanna
see her struggle.

464
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,166
Pain is a teacher.

465
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,041
Through pain we grow.

466
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,208
[GIJA] Ughh. Die, die,
die, you nasty bug!

467
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,250
Get away from me!

468
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,583
[grunts]

469
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,916
[GIJA] If only I could
do what she needs.

470
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,375
All I want is to be
of service to her.

471
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,958
My whole life he's
been my protector.

472
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,208
Someday I wanna
return the favor.

473
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,750
[GIJA] That's right. She
feels the same thing I do.

474
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,333
[GIJA]
Today is going to be the day

475
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,625
I find the Blue Dragon Warrior.

476
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,583
Gija, did you get any sleep?

477
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,625
Huh? Yeah. I guess.

478
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,166
You don't sound too sure.

479
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,791
It's hard to adjust
to living outside

480
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,416
when you've slept in
a bed your whole life.

481
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,625
Take care of yourself.

482
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,083
You're very important
to our mission.

483
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,958
If you're not okay,
then neither are we.

484
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,000
[gasps]

485
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
Thank you, Princess.

486
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,250
Though, I'm curious.

487
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,583
Am I actually helping,
or am I really a burden?

488
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:27,958
[chuckles] Don't be silly.
You are indispensable, Gija.

489
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,208
[GIJA gasps]

490
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,625
[GIJA] What's this?
My heart is pounding.

491
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,791
Is the dragon's blood

492
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,666
in my veins getting
all riled up again?

493
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,833
I've got it!

494
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,375
What?

495
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,750
The Blue Dragon's Village, of
course ! It just came to me!

496
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:47,791
I assumed it was uninhabitable,
but people actually live there!

497
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,791
It's a town on the border.
Deep within that mountain.

498
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:01,250
[YONA]
Blue Dragon. I'll find you.

499
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,000
[YONA] So that was the
Blue Dragon Warrior?

500
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,916
His touch was so
gentle and warm.

501
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,458
[YONA]
Next time, on Yona of the Dawn,

502
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,958
Episode 12:
"The Blindfolded Dragon."
