1
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,333
[GANG TEA-JUN]
Like flames.

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,500
It burns like a fire.

3
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,333
I can't tear my eyes away.

4
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:18,833
She's scorching me.

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,541
I've never seen her eyes
burn with such rage.

6
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,833
Idiot!

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,041
[HAK]
Didn't I tell you not to move?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,875
Why didn't you listen to me?

9
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,166
He must be a demon.

10
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,208
Princess!

11
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,041
Oh no!

12
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:51,875
[HAK] Dammit!

13
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,041
The poison is
starting to take hold.

14
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,041
Now's our chance!

15
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,458
Take him out!

16
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:21,875
Hak!

17
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,458
[GANG TEA-JUN laughing]

18
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,958
Perfect.
Just give him a little push.

19
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,208
The "Lightning Beast" dies now!

20
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,416
[YONA] No, it can't be.

21
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,708
[YONA]
I can't let this happen.

22
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,583
I can't just stand here.

23
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,250
I've got to do something.

24
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,291
I have to stop them.

25
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,458
If I don't...

26
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,750
Hak is... going to die!

27
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,416
Princess!

28
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,291
Don't even think about it!

29
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,583
Oh, I'm afraid not, Princess.

30
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,208
No point in trying
to save him, he's dead.

31
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,583
[GANG TEA-JUN] You are coming
to the castle with me.

32
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,083
Son Hak is going to his death!

33
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,583
[YONA] I have to save him.

34
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,458
Whatever it takes.

35
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,291
I won't let them kill him.

36
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,250
I will not!

37
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,416
[MALE SOLDIER 6G] It's gonna be
such an honor to take you down,

38
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,833
General Son Hak,
the Lightning Beast.

39
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,500
Kohka's greatest warrior!

40
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,750
[YONA] Get away!

41
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,000
I said get away!

42
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,041
Princess...

43
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,791
I'm warning you,
leave Hak alone!

44
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,250
[MALE SOLDIER 6G]
Princess, stop!

45
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,875
Calm down!

46
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,625
You must get a hold
of yourself, Your Highness.

47
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,708
No, stop!

48
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,958
Don't you dare
harm the princess!

49
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,125
But sir!

50
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,458
[MALE SOLDIER 6G] No way.
Is this really the princess?

51
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,041
What are you doing?

52
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,791
[YONA] What's it look like?
I'm trying to save you!

53
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,458
Don't be stupid!
Run away!

54
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,375
You know you can't lift me!

55
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,958
Just run for your life!

56
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,000
[YONA] Shut up! I won't!

57
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,666
[YONA sobbing]

58
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,958
Damn you!
You'd better not die like this!

59
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,166
'Cause I will never forgive you!

60
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,958
Hey!

61
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,541
What are you waiting for?

62
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,375
Get the princess away
from Hak at once!

63
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:34,083
[YONA screaming]

64
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,958
Master Tea-jun!

65
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,375
[GANG TEA-JUN] Find them.

66
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,375
[MALE SOLDIER 6G] What?

67
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,750
Find them now!

68
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,625
Get out of my sight
and go save the princess!

69
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,416
Master, you have to calm down.

70
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,791
It's futile, they can't have
survived a fall like that.

71
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,375
There's no point in
even trying to save them.

72
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,500
[MALE SOLDIER 6G] Be careful!

73
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,833
Let me go!

74
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,000
Stop this!

75
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,500
I have to save the princess!

76
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,708
[MALE SOLDIER 6G]
Master Tea-jun!

77
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,291
The princess...

78
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,708
She's gone.

79
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,875
Yona... is dead?

80
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,791
[KEISHUK] Master Su-won.

81
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,458
What is it?
Do you need something?

82
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,625
I don't mean to disturb you
on the eve of your coronation.

83
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,958
It's Gang Tea-jun.

84
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,375
He's here, insisting
I let him speak with you.

85
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,958
He seems very upset and
he says it's an urgent matter.

86
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,041
[SU-WON] Ah, Gang Tea-jun.

87
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,000
Sorry to keep you waiting
in the dark like this.

88
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,000
What is it you need
to discuss with me?

89
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,291
Apologies for
insisting you see me now.

90
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,791
It's late, and
tomorrow's the big day.

91
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,750
You're about to become king.

92
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,791
But there's something
I need to give to you,

93
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,666
and I'm afraid it cannot wait.

94
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,333
Please open this.

95
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:41,208
I'm sorry,
but the princess is dead.

96
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,833
It was an
unfortunate accident.

97
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,125
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

98
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,666
We found her and Son Hak
in the Northern Forest

99
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,500
between our lands and those of
the Wind Clan.

100
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,791
We almost had them,
but they fell over a cliff.

101
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,083
Stop there.

102
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,833
Are you saying that
they fell into the valley?

103
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,416
You knew your orders.

104
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Su-won told everyone to contact
the castle if they were spotted,

105
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,666
but you took matters
into your own hands.

106
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,791
You cornered
and killed them both!

107
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,000
This is nothing
short of high treason!

108
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,500
You will be punished.

109
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,291
[GANG TEA-JUN] You're right.

110
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,750
I killed her.

111
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,916
I murdered the princess.

112
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,166
[GANG TEA-JUN] I beg you.

113
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,000
Please punish me severely.

114
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,708
[KEISHUK] Master Su-won.

115
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,708
[SU-WON] Why don't you
rest here for the evening?

116
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,041
I'd like you to attend the
coronation ceremony tomorrow

117
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,500
as my guest.

118
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,625
Your Highness!
I have to be punished!

119
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,000
I have to! I...

120
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,291
Master Tea-jun!

121
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,583
I beg of you!

122
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,250
Punish me, Your Majesty!

123
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,500
Put me to death!

124
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:19,166
[BOY singing] Once upon a time,
oh so very long ago,

125
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,583
when the big red sun
was eaten from the sky.

126
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:29,458
And when darkness
swallowed the whole world.

127
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,416
Man, what a pain.

128
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
There goes my evening.

129
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,583
[KEISHUK] Master Su-won.

130
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,333
Elder Mun-deok of the
Wind Clan arrived tonight.

131
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,666
He's accompanied by
the new general-elect.

132
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,458
I just thought you'd
be interested to know.

133
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,625
General-elect?

134
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,583
I suppose they've complied.

135
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,333
[KEISHUK] My feeling is that he
did what he felt was necessary

136
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,333
in order to protect the clan.

137
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,041
Though it does seem rather
uncharacteristic of him.

138
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,958
He's not usually one
to give in so easily.

139
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,208
[SU-WON] I wonder
if he was influenced

140
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,166
by someone to take that path.

141
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,541
A martyr.

142
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,291
One who chose to break
with the clan to save them.

143
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,333
What?

144
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,333
[SU-WON] Nothing.

145
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,916
So, what's your
impression of him?

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,791
The Wind Clan's future leader.

147
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,041
Well, for one thing,

148
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,416
it seems he's even
younger than General Hak.

149
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,833
These upstarts
from the Wind Clan

150
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,291
are certainly full
of drive and energy.

151
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,875
You shouldn't express
your envy like that, Keishuk.

152
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,291
It makes you sound old.

153
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,208
I am old compared
to you, "Boy King."

154
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,166
[SU-WON]
Look. It's already dawn.

155
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,291
Ah. Indeed it is.

156
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,666
What a perfect dawn sky for
the morning of your coronation.

157
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,791
[SU-WON] Crimson Dragon Castle.

158
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,000
It's always been a symbol
of Kohka's Kingdom monarch.

159
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,375
I swore that I would
come back here someday.

160
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,250
And here I am,
about to be crowned king.

161
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,291
[YONA] Su-won!

162
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,916
Great to see you!

163
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,333
Welcome back!

There's pear compote!

Hurry and get some

[HAK] Heads up!

167
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,166
Hi, Hak.

168
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,416
[HAK] You were wide open,
be on guard next time!

169
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,000
You'll get chewed out
by Old Mun-deok

170
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,916
if you don't improve
your speed, buddy.

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,750
[SU-WON]
Don't talk such nonsense.

172
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,166
After all,
he's always told me

173
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,666
that I have a natural
aptitude for combat.

174
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,083
[HAK] Is that so?

175
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,625
Then tell me why you've never
beaten me in practice

176
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,916
even since we were kids.

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,250
[SU-WON] You're unbeatable.

178
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,666
You have to be in order
to protect Princess Yona,

179
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,375
but that's not
how it is for me.

180
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,125
Some excuse! How lame.

181
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,750
To be honest,
I'm a little jealous of her.

182
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,000
I really wish you
could be my servant.

183
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,041
Come on, you already
have a million of them

184
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,250
all to yourself.

185
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,750
You know they're not the same.

186
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,250
I want you to be mine.

187
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,083
Well, just become king
and I'm yours.

188
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,666
[SU-WON] What?

189
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,000
[HAK] Marry the princess
and ascend to the throne.

190
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,083
Then I'll be your servant, too.

191
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,416
[SU-WON]
Me and Yona? No way!

192
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,750
That'd be like
marrying my sister!

193
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,875
You did say you
wanted me, didn't you?

194
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,625
You know that was
just a figure of speech.

195
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,458
Yeah, but that's
beside the point.

196
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,458
You're the only one I'll support
as next in line after King Il.

197
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,791
When you're king,

198
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,375
I'll always be at your side,
your right hand man.

199
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll protect you both.

200
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,583
My life will belong to you
and Yona until I die.

201
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,708
And in return,

202
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,541
I want three meals
and a nap every day.

203
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,541
Put that in my contract.

204
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,166
That's a bargain to own
the "Lightning Beast."

205
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,041
[SU-WON] Yes. As you wish.

206
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,416
I think that'd be
the perfect life.

207
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,083
Su-won, hurry up!

208
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,208
[SU-WON] Hak.

209
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,416
Promise me you'll protect Yona.

210
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,000
[SU-WON] It's sad.

211
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,500
I'm about to be crowned king.

212
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,208
But I can't share this moment
with the two people I love most.

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,166
[SU-WON] It's hard not
to question myself.

214
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,083
Have I chosen poorly?

215
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,416
Here I am, King.

216
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,750
Without my right-hand man.

217
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,166
[SU-WON] I trampled over and
threw away a girl who loved me.

218
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,458
Who gave me strength.

219
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,583
Who trusted me,
and believed in me.

220
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,083
[MALE SUBJECT 6A] That can't
be the new king, can it?

221
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,708
[MALE SUBJECT 6B]
He does look like a child,

222
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,000
but he is the only son
of His Highness Yuhon.

223
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,458
[MALE SUBJECT 6A]
Wow, is that really the case?

224
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,250
[MALE SUBJECT 6C] Then there's
no doubt he'll rule the kingdom

225
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,166
better than his predecessor.

226
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,166
[SU-WON] It's done.

227
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,083
Now, let there
be no more doubts.

228
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,208
[NOBLEMAN 6A] With the unanimous
blessing of the five clans,

229
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,208
it is my honor to
stand before you today.

230
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,916
We're gathered to witness
the coronation of King Su-won

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,708
as the eleventh ruler
of the Kohka Kingdom!

I wish you luck.

Your enthronement is a great
blessing to our nation.

236
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,458
As ruler of the
Fire Clan, Gang Su-jin,

237
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,708
I pledge my undying loyalty
to His Highness Su-won

238
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,541
along with the love and
obedience of all my people.

239

[SU-WON] The Fire Clan.

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,958
They present a
façade of cooperation,

241
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,375
but their hearts
are set on the throne.

242

[SU-WON] The Earth Clan.

The Wind Clan.

247
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,916
They've submitted
for now under threat of death.

248
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,875
But who knows,
their military is fierce.

249
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,458
Mun-deok trained them well.

250
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,208
Once they hear
of Hak's death,

251
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:17,000
it'll only be a matter
of time before they rebel.

The Khai in the North,
Shin and Sai in the South.

They are all paying attention
to my enthronement.

254

But for now...

255
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,958
I have to focus
all of my efforts

256

on uniting the five clans.

[MUN-DEOK] Your Majesty.

As I'm sure you are
no doubt already aware,

259
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,333
the oracle of
this castle is gone.

260

That said,

261
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,250
the heavens are still
watching over this kingdom.

262
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,958
I will watch
along with them,

263
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,208
and take note of what
Your Highness builds here,

264
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,750
what he costs his people,
and how he chooses to rule,

for me is look on idly.

321
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,500
Plus the contusions
and broken ribs.

322
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,041
If I hadn't found
you guys when I did,

323
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,833
he totally would have
bled out and died right there.

324
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,250
Ya know...

325
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,500
I think he protected you
when you fell from the cliff.

326
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,791
[YONA] What?

327
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,250
[YUN] He was underneath you
when I found you.

328
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:42,541
[YONA] Hak.

329
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,041
The trees acted like a buffer
and broke your fall a little.

330
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,333
[YUN] Man, What a pain.

331
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,208
That guy.
He must care a lot about you.

332
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,416
So, boyfriend?

333
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,458
[YONA] Nope. No way.

334
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,500
Wow.
You are cold hearted, lady.

335
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,875
Where are we?

336
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,750
The valley?
Is this where you live?

337
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,875
Yeah, kinda.

338
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,083
So are you a doctor, then?

339
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,958
'Cause I'm looking
for someone in this area,

340
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,166
and you may have treated him--

341
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,666
[MAN] Yun! Where are you?

342
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,166
You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me!

343
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,291
Hey, don't come in here!

344
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,750
Why are you covered
head to toe in mud?

345
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,916
[MAN]
I was praying to the gods

346
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,500
that everyone might
have peace and ease,

347
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,416
and I guess I
kinda got carried away

348
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,875
cause I slipped
and fell in the mud.

349
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,250
[yelling]

350
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,541
Man, what a pain.

351
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,291
The gods have definitely
forsaken you this time!

352
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,791
No!

353
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,750
Oh, you're finally awake!

354
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,583
I'm so relieved!

355
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,041
[MAN] Oh, I'm sorry.
Where are my manners?

356
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,375
My name's Ik-su,

357
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,500
and I suppose I'm what
you'd call Yun's guardian.

358
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,750
Oh, um...

359
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,291
My name is...

360
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,000
[YONA] They seem
like they're trustworthy,

361
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,625
but I think it's still
too soon to tell them.

362
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,583
[IK-SU sobbing]

363
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,041
Sorry, but...

364
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,750
It must have been so painful.

365
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,875
No. It didn't
really hurt that bad.

366
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,375
Hak protected me
when we fell from the cliff.

367
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,375
Good, I'm just so moved

368
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,000
that you were able
to make the journey.

369
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,541
Make the journey?

370
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,458
[IK-SU] It's an honor to have
you stay with us, Princess Yona.

371
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,708
Hold on...

372
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,583
How do you know who I am?

373
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,833
Well, from the
Divine Prophecy of course!

374
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:30,875
Gah!

375
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,458
[laughs awkwardly]

376
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,958
You're such an idiot.

377
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,708
Did you forget
why we're out here?

378
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,833
It's pointless
if you blurt it out!

379
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,708
Come on! Why can't
you lie just a little bit?

380
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,375
Does that mean you're...

381
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,500
[MUN-DEOK] There's an oracle
who has foretold the future

382
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,958
of the Kohka Kingdom
since ancient times.

383
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,625
Oh. My apologies.

384
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,208
I really wanted
to be dressed properly

385
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,416
when I introduced myself,

386
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,625
but I guess the
gods had other plans!

387
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,375
[YONA] This is the oracle?

388
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,916
This guy? Really?

389
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,041
[IK-SU] The odds were
against you, yet you survived.

390
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,916
As a result, a storm is coming--

391
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
one that will turn
the kingdom upside down.

392
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:45,250
Next time, on Yona of the Dawn,
episode 7: "Fate."
