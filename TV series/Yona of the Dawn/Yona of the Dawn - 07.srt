1
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:14,416
[YONA] You mean to tell me
you're the oracle?

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,416
In that case, you must've known
I was coming here before I did.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,458
Yeah.

4
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,958
[IK-SU] It's my job
to sit in contemplation

5
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,000
and listen to the
voices of the gods.

6
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,250
Then I bring their
message to the people.

7
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,791
They tell me all kinds
of things about our world.

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,916
[YUN] You seriously
call that a job?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,750
It's not like you
get paid for it.

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,833
You just sit around
praying all day!

11
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,041
All right, give me
those filthy clothes.

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,875
Remember, all that crazy talk
about hearing the voices of gods

13
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,166
is what got you
kicked out of the castle.

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,333
[YONA] Is that really why
they kicked you out?

15
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,291
[YUN] Are you serious?

16
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,125
You're the kingdom's princess,
you should know these things.

17
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,041
[YUN] Outta the way!

18
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,666
I'm workin' here.

19
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,541
[YUN]
You're the kingdom's princess,

20
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,416
you should know these things.

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,750
[YONA] I was clueless
about things that went on

22
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,333
in my own home.

23
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,083
Hak! I'm with you!

24
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,125
Follow the sound of my voice!

25
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,333
[YONA] Hak!

26
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,625
Here, hold this.

27
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,375
[YUN] Move aside.

28
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,250
[YUN] His fever's high.

29
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,291
[YONA] Hak...

30
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,333
[YUN]
I gave him some medicine,

31
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,833
but his fever
won't break for a while.

32
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,583
Tonight will be the worst of it.
We'll have to watch him.

33
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,000
Please, you have to save him!

34
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,291
I'm trying my best.

35
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,166
You think I want him
to die on me?

36
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,375
Look, I'm not a trained
doctor or anything,

37
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,083
but you shouldn't be taking
my help for granted like this.

38
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,125
[gasps]

39
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,375
It's rude.

40
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,541
You haven't thanked me
once for helping you.

41
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,958
What about him?

42
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,166
Have you thought to thank him
for saving your life?

43
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,833
I bet it's not the first time
he's almost died to save you.

44
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,625
[IK-SU] Don't worry.

45
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,166
The gods have a plan for Hak,

46
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,166
death isn't coming
for him tonight.

47
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,083
He'll get better very soon.

48
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,791
[IK-SU] Yun, you should
speak to her more gently.

49
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,916
You know how
I feel about royalty.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,875
They don't deserve our respect.

51
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,041
[IK-SU] Yes, but remember,

52
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,458
she's fighting a
difficult battle, too.

53
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,583
Why don't you and I
go for a nice walk outside?

54
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,750
Yun knows what he's doing
when it comes to his medicine.

55
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,750
He's saved me from certain
death more than once.

56
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,083
[IK-SU yells]

57
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,833
Are you okay?

58
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,666
[laughs awkwardly]

59
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,708
I'm curious.

60
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,208
Why do you live
all the way out here?

61
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,791
I followed
wherever the gods led me

62
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:02,250
and this is just where
I happened to end up.

63
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,208
But I suppose that
doesn't answer your question.

64
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,208
It's home.

65
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,500
It may be desolate,

66
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,791
but I can still see
the beauty in this place.

67
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,333
Hey, Yun?

68
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,125
Uh...

69
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,500
I want to thank you.
For helping us.

70
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,166
I'd like you to teach me.

71
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,458
About oracles
and everything you do.

72
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,666
I may seem clueless,
but I'm not stupid.

73
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,791
Please, I want
to learn all I can.

74
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,916
Well, you sound stupid.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,708
Because I'm not an oracle.

76
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,583
I just take care of one
since he doesn't seem

77
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,750
capable of
doing it himself.

78
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,208
[YUN] I'll tell you, though.

79
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,458
The oracles used to possess
an authority that no one,

80
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,916
not even the king,
could challenge.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,583
[YONA] Really?

82
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,666
Yup.

83
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,875
The people worshipped
and revered them

84
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,750
as servants of the gods.

85
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,375
The oracles were highly
influential in political matters

86
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,541
and even turned the
course of pivotal wars.

87
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,250
In fact, they once
did away with a king

88
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,916
because they said
he angered the gods.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,208
They had so much power,

90
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,875
the royal family
began to feel threatened.

91
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,166
Under King Junam's rule,

92
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,166
the Kohka Kingdom gained
strength and influence

93
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,291
faster than it ever had before.

94
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,250
This renaissance
was due, in large part,

95
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,708
to Prince Yuhon's
military exploits.

96
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,250
He held the power and didn't
want to lose it to oracles,

97
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,750
who could hold
authority over him.

98
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,541
So my uncle
banished all the oracles

99
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,791
from the castle
to protect himself.

100
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:47,875
Don't you find it difficult

101
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,666
to live in the
middle of nowhere?

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,083
No, I don't.

103
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,750
I'm not fond of
people as a whole,

104
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,250
and Ik-su is more
comfortable out here.

105
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,958
[YUN] The capital cities have
been taken over by the rich.

106
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,291
Meanwhile, the villages
are poor and struggling.

107
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,375
Ik-su's generous to a fault.

108
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,625
He wouldn't stop trying
to save everyone.

109
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,208
All the poor.

110
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,291
When he couldn't,
he almost went crazy.

111
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,541
I don't know what
he'd do without me.

112
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,666
[YONA] Thank you.

113
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,000
I would like to
learn more from you.

114
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,541
[YONA gasps]

115
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,125
Where did Hak go?

116
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,416
[yelps, yells]

117
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,833
[YONA] Stupid Hak...

118
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:03,541
[YONA sobbing quietly]

119
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,000
Where are you?

120
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,833
[HAK] Ouch.

121
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,291
[HAK] Hope you haven't
been badmouthing me

122
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,541
like this the whole time.

123
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,541
If I had known this
is how I'd be rewarded,

124
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,291
then I never would've
saved you in the first place.

125
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,833
[HAK]
Why are you crying?

126
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,458
Did you have a
nightmare or somethin'?

127
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't be silly,
I wouldn't cry over a dream.

128
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,125
Oh, really?

129
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,125
What are you doing out here?

130
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,708
[HAK] I was just trying
to find my glaive.

131
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,916
Why didn't you wake me up
to tell me that?

132
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,791
Oh, I see.

133
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,875
The princess doesn't
like sleeping all alone.

134
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,166
Want me to sleep with you?
I will.

135
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,625
[YONA] I can't believe you!

136
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,250
How could you be so stupid?

137
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,291
Geez, enough
with the name-calling.

138
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,541
You nearly killed
yourself trying to save me.

139
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,958
Please, Hak.

140
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,875
You have to be more careful.

141
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,000
You can't leave
without telling me.

142
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,791
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

143
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,916
I need you by my side!

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,708
[sniffling]

145
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,958
[HAK] You know...

146
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,208
I do kind of wanna die.

147
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,083
[YONA] What?

148
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,333
Even with that ugly face,

149
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,416
you still make me feel
tingly and weird inside.

150
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,458
It'd be worth it.

151
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:17,500
I'd gladly sacrifice my own life
to see how hard you'd cry.

152
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,666
[loud thump]

153
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,166
[BOTH groaning]

154
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,666
If you don't want to,
just dodge it.

155
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,958
Dodge what?

156
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,583
I thought you wanted
to check your temperature

157
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,750
so I pushed out my forehead.

158
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,041
Was I wrong?

159
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,166
Uh... No.

160
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,541
That's what it was.

161
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,375
This high fever's got
my brains all scrambled up.

162
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,750
Really? Because it feels
like your fever's gone.

163
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,166
Eheheh!

164
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,500
[HAK] Your hair...

165
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,291
[HAK] I'm sorry
about that, Princess.

166
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,166
I'm afraid it was all my fault.

167
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,500
No, it's okay.

168
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,583
I feel so much lighter.

169
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,583
I don't mind parting with it.

170
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:02,416
I hated my hair the way
it was, long and unruly.

171
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,416
[SU-WON]
I think your hair is amazing.

172
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,458
Breathtaking.

173
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,666
I kind of like it shorter.
What about you?

174
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,791
Looks good to me.

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,833
[HAK]
"I need you by my side."

176
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,791
She said it like it was nothing.

177
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,541
Well, like I said,
it's not your hair,

178
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,208
but your brain that's weird.

179
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,208
Better shut your mouth
or I'll shut it for you!

180
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,875
[BOTH chuckling]

181
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,958
[HAK] I'm sure you're still
holding on to that hairpin,

182
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,791
even though your hair's
too short for it now.

183
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,875
I guess some feelings never die.

184
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,250
[HAK]
Huh? The oracle lives here?

185
00:10:59,333 --> 00:10:59,958
Seriously?

186
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:00,833
Yeah.

187
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:04,041
Wow. It's not what I expected.

188
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,666
I imagined it would
look a lot more like a shrine,

189
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,458
even out in the wilderness.

190
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,708
I mean, an oracle worships
all the time, right?

191
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,625
Come on!
Ask before you stuff your face!

192
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,250
[HAK] Oh, divine oracle,
thank you for the food.

193
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,500
[YUN]
I'm not an oracle, dumbass!

194
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,500
Speaking of, does anyone
know where Ik-su went?

195
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,166
[YONA] There you are, Oracle.

196
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,041
What's the matter?

197
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,250
[IK-SU sniffling]

198
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,500
[sniffles loudly]

199
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,375
[IK-SU]
I was just meditating.

200
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,750
I chose to focus on you.

201
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,000
This world and
how you fit into it.

202
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,166
The gods have a plan
for you, Princess Yona.

203
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,708
Do you want
to know the gods?

204
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,333
And hear them speak?

205
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,083
[YONA] I'm confused.

206
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,125
Mun-deok said I should
seek out the oracle

207
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,666
and have you
show me the way.

208
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,708
But is that best?

209
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:15,166
To allow you to
determine the way for me?

210
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,791
I'm not sure.

211
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:20,250
I always thought it was best to
stand still and not take action.

212
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,625
But then we were chased.

213
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,041
Hak and I came
so close to death.

214
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,333
My blood boiled in my veins.

215
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,041
I had to do something.

216
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,458
I couldn't be still.

217
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,083
I found my strength.

218
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,541
I can stand for once in my life.

219
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,791
I found my will to live.

220
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,208
I won't die.
I'll protect Hak.

221
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,166
We will survive to the end.

222
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,750
That's the only thing I want,

223
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,791
so I have nothing
to ask the gods.

224
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,333
They cannot tell me
how to do that.

225
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,625
[IK-SU] Not so.

226
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,833
Your life weighs
more than other humans'.

227
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,250
A fate like yours won't
allow you any peace.

228
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,625
The odds were against you,
yet you survived.

229
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,666
As a result, a storm is coming.

230
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,208
One that will turn
the kingdom upside down.

231
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,958
What do you mean by that?

232
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,208
[IK-SU] Let me show you.

233
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,708
If you truly want
to fulfill your destiny,

234
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,875
and you cannot cool
the fire in your blood,

235
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,125
then allow me to deliver
the message of the gods.

236
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,958
[IK-SU] Darkness falls on earth.

237
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:32,208
With dragons' blood,
they arise once again.

238
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,416
Following the ancient pledge,

239
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,875
the Four Dragons will gather
to protect the sovereign.

240
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,125
The sword and shield
will awaken.

241
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:45,458
And the Crimson Dragon
will finally return from dawn.

242
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,291
[IK-SU groans]

243
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,750
One needs
extreme spiritual fortitude

244
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,500
in order to deliver
the message of the gods.

245
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,250
Quit bein' lazy.
I thought this was your job!

246
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,125
I don't know anything about
dragons or gods or oracles.

247
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,750
So how do I know you're not
just trying to con us, huh?

248
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,625
He's not that bright.

249
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,708
In your prophecy, you spoke
of the "Crimson Dragon."

250
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,750
Do you mean the one
from the old legends?

251
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,375
You've heard the legend
of this kingdom's creation?

252
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,541
Yes.

253
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,625
It is said that
the Crimson Dragon God

254
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,166
took a human form and came down
from the heavens to rule.

255
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,041
He was our kingdom's
first sovereign.

256
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,166
He's known as the Crimson
Dragon King to this day.

257
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,208
Father used to tell me
the story all the time

258
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,666
when I was a little girl.

259
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,083
[IK-SU] That's right,

260
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,083
but not long after the Crimson
Dragon God became human,

261
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,458
[IL] he was forced to fight with
the people he loved and ruled.

262
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,750
Evil quickly seeped
into his subjects' hearts.

263
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,916
They forgot the gods
they once adored,

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,625
and the kingdom fell to ruin.

265
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,500
The people, in their
desperate hunger for power,

266
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,500
even seized the
Crimson Dragon King.

267
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,708
Seconds before the people
were set to murder their ruler,

268
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:03,000
the heavens opened and four
dragons descended to the earth.

269
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,541
[DRAGONS] Crimson Dragon,
we have come to save you.

270
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,541
Destroy these faithless humans,

271
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,125
for they have no love,
and return with us to heaven.

272
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,541
[IL] But the Crimson Dragon
refused their request.

273
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,375
No.

274
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,666
Even if the humans hate me,

275
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,125
even if they betray me,
I cannot stop my love for them.

276
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,041
They have taught me
what it is to truly feel.

277
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,625
[IL] The dragons loved their
crimson brother very much.

278
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,208
They respected his wish
but swore to watch over him.

279
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,250
In order to protect
the Crimson Dragon,

280
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,625
the others gave their blood
to four loyal human warriors,

281
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:41,291
thereby granting each man
one of their powers.

282
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,791
One was given sharp claws

283
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,375
that could cut through
any Earthly material.

284
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,333
And to another,
the sharpest eyes

285
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,375
that could see ahead for miles.

286
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,791
A third was given the power
to jump high into the heavens.

287
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:57,125
And the fourth obtained
a strong, invulnerable body.

288
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,625
[DRAGONS] From this day forward,
you shall act as our avatars.

289
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,291
We have granted you our power

290
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,833
so you may protect
the Crimson Dragon.

291
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:09,125
It is your duty to defend
him with your lives.

292
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,083
[IL] These warriors,
with the power of dragons,

293
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,041
led the clans of the kingdom
and protected their brother.

294
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,208
They restored order
to a land mired in chaos.

295
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,041
In time,
the Crimson Dragon King

296
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,000
grew weary of battle, and
retired to his eternal rest.

297
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,791
At long last, the Dragon
Warriors' work was complete.

298
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,041
They mourned the loss
of their master deeply

299
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,375
and cried over
his lifeless form.

300
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,833
They couldn't tell
if they grieved

301
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,291
because they loved the man,

302
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,333
or if it was the divine
blood in their veins

303
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,458
crying out for the
loss of their brother,

304
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,250
the beloved Crimson Dragon King.

305
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,250
[IL] After the king's death,

306
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,208
the Dragon Warriors
felt their powers

307
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,208
were too much
for humans to fathom,

308
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,000
so they left their respective
clans and disappeared,

309
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,083
never to be heard from again.

310
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,916
The people who remained behind

311
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,583
formed the five clans of
the Kohka Kingdom we know today.

312
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,791
[YONA]
That's the story I was told.

313
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,625
But I don't understand
what it has to do with me.

314
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,833
Princess Yona, you told me
you wanted to survive, right?

315
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,083
[YONA] Yes.

316
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,625
Well, as you know,
you can't do that alone.

317
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,041
The moment you
come out of hiding,

318
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,833
they'll be after you again.

319
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,541
Hak is by your side,

320
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,083
and he'll protect you
as long as he lives.

321
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,166
Sadly, though, without
anyone but the two of you,

322
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,916
he will die.

323
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,916
Hey, wait a minute,

324
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,791
you can't just say
I'm gonna die.

325
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,583
I'm no oracle,
but I can predict this.

326
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,291
If-- 

327
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,333
[HAK groans]

328
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,208
Threaten us all you want,
we don't have any money.

329
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,541
Ha. Ha.

330
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,750
So as you can see,
your bodyguard's in bad shape.

331
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,166
You're going to
need formidable allies.

332
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,708
But who? What allies?

333
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,625
You're going to
have to seek them out.

334
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,958
The Four Dragon Warriors.

335
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,916
No way, you've
got to be kidding me.

336
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
They exist?

337
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,541
Are you serious?
They're real?

338
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,750
[HAK] Give me a break.

339
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,583
They're just ridiculous legends.

340
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,708
[IK-SU] No, they exist.

341
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,041
Even after all
of these centuries,

342
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,208
they live in the kingdom

343
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,291
with the Dragons' blood
in their veins.

344
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,458
They will be the allies
you need in order to survive.

345
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:21,666
[YONA] Oracle, I would do
anything to keep Hak from dying.

346
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,041
But are you sure
they'll assist me with this?

347
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,291
It's my problem

348
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,541
and it has absolutely
nothing to do with them.

349
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,833
The night you left the palace...

350
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,250
It was a miracle
you made it out alive.

351
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,958
You were supposed to
die along with your father.

352
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,375
Then you and Hak
miraculously survived the fall

353
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,625
from that cliff.

354
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,208
I call these
twists of fate miracles,

355
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,833
but I believe
it was your destiny

356
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,958
that kept you alive
and guided you here to us.

357
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,666
If you seek them out
and enlist their help

358
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,375
to travel as your allies,

359
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,041
it's not your problem,
it's the gods' will,

360
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,583
and they are entwined in it.

361
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,541
[YONA] The gods' will...

362
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,083
[IK-SU] That being said...

363
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,416
Heaven will only
show you the path.

364
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,708
You must walk it.
You must choose it for yourself.

365
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,000
[YONA] I don't know
anything about the kingdom.

366
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,375
All those years in
the castle... I was blind.

367
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,208
[SU-WON] There is no
helping your father now, Yona.

368
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,250
[YONA] I know nothing.

369
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,166
[SU-WON]
I think your hair is amazing.

370
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,333
Breathtaking.

371
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,208
[YONA] I want to know. I do.

372
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,125
All the things I was
blissfully unaware of.

373
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,208
People's true intentions.

374
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,958
[YONA] I want to become strong.

375
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,083
[HAK] Princess.

376
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,750
[YONA] Who said you
could get out of bed?!

377
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,791
[HAK] Oof!

378
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,750
I'm all healed up now.

379
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,458
I'm not going to die.
You hear me?

380
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,416
Hak, I want to do it.

381
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,000
I want to find the
Four Dragon Warriors.

382
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,500
[HAK] Yeah, and do what?

383
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,625
They might not exist, and if
they do, and we find them?

384
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,625
What if they don't
want to come with us?

385
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,208
[YONA] We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

386
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,541
If we stay here much longer,
we won't be able to leave.

387
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,916
I'll do anything
to keep moving forward.

388
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,125
I want to gain
strength to survive.

389
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,958
I want you to teach me archery
and hand-to-hand combat,

390
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,166
and to use swords.

391
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,625
I refuse to die
without getting justice.

392
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,041
And I can't bear the
thought of losing you.

393
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,958
I'll take any help.
I'll use the gods' power.

394
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,833
I'll choose their path.

395
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,583
Look, I said I'm not
gonna die, all right?

396
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,125
Well, if that's what
the princess really wants,

397
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,166
I guess we'll roll the
dice on this destiny thing.

398
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,208
Hak, you're being
so nice lately.

399
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,625
You're a good boy.

400
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,041
Um...

401
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,375
Would you mind not getting
so close to me right now?

402
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,500
Why not?

403
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,041
Because your breath is awful.

404
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,416
Why, you!

405
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,791
Hey! You've got a few wrinkles.

406
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,041
No, I do not!

407
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,625
[HAK] Careful,
if you keep making that face,

408
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,875
you're gonna look like a prune
by the time you're twenty.

409
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,458
[YONA]
Watch what I do to your face!

410
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,541
Let's see how you like this!
Quit whining, ya big baby!

411
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,500
Have you come
to a decision yet?

412
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,541
Yes.

413
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,625
[IK-SU] If you don't mind,
I have a favor to ask.

414
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,333
[YUN sighs]

415
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,041
'Kay, I think that's
gonna work just fine!

416
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,375
[YUN] Listen, Ik-su.

417
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,958
You might not know this,

418
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,666
but your words have always
been absolute truth to me.

419
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,875
Next time,
on Yona of the Dawn,

420
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,875
episode 8, "The Chosen Door."
