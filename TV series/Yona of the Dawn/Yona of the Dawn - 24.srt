1
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,708
[YONA, YUN, GIJA]
Whoa!

2
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,083
[YUN]
Fawns are so fast.

3
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,958
I can't believe you caught one.

4
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,208
Surely you've realized by now

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,458
that I'm faster than
a typhoon wind.

6
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,791
That leg sure does give
you amazing abilities.

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,083
We'll be able to find the Yellow
Dragon Warrior in no time.

8
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,250
Oh, yeah. The Yellow Dragon.

9
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,250
Without him, our
group's incomplete.

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,791
Who knows what exotic talents

11
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,208
this mystery man
might've mastered.

12
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,583
I'll find him for you.

13
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,791
No, I'm afraid that
honor belongs to me.

14
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,041
I'm afraid you just don't know
when you've been bested.

15
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,791
Hah! Maybe you're forgetting
I'm the one who found you!

16
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,125
Great. Bickering dragons.

17
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,416
Hey. Why don't you start a fire?

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
I'll get dinner going
while they argue.

19
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,708
Yeah.

20
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,166
[JEAHA]
"Fetch"? I'm not a dog.

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,791
[GIJA] Then you should
stop acting like one

22
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,708
and learn to play nice.

23
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,041
[sighs]

24
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,833
Good job.

25
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,000
Gutting animals doesn't
bug you anymore?

26
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,833
It's definitely not my
favorite thing to do.

27
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,333
But it's taught me things.

28
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,750
Lessons I wouldn't have learned
if I stayed at the castle.

29
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,375
I never thought about
what I ate back then.

30
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,791
I didn't value the
lives that were lost.

31
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,791
But I will honor
this animal's life.

32
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,750
Her death won't be in vain.

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,125
[stomach growling]

34
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,250
[STRANGER]
Those nice words

35
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,958
really speak to my
heart, little lady.

36
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,291
[YONA]
Hm?

37
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,083
[STRANGER] I betcha that
fawn can hear your voice

38
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,500
all the way up in
heaven right now.

39
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:40,250
You're showin' a lotta
gratitude for her sacrifice.

40
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,583
I'm sure that she'll forgive
you for what you've done.

41
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,958
Wow, talk about rude.

42
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,458
You're dirty and
you're drooling.

43
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,875
Who the hell are you?

44
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, don't worry, I'm
just a lone traveler.

45
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,250
The thought of meat
makes my tummy go nuts.

46
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,500
And I always end up covered
in drool when I'm hungry.

47
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,500
So gross!

48
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,041
[STRANGER] I was lured over by
the delicious scent in the air.

49
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,666
[YUN] The only thing I
smell besides you is blood.

50
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,833
Would you like to
have dinner with us?

51
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:06,000
That's my favorite question
in the whole world.

52
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,625
[HAK]
Whoa, looks good.

53
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,791
It's a nice change from
the stuff we usually eat.

54
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:13,708
That's an understatement.
We haven't had meat in forever.

55
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,208
Just one question.

56
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,250
This guy. Who is he?

57
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,041
[YUN] Hmm. Some kind
of traveler I think?

58
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,416
Not exactly sure.

59
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,875
He seemed really hungry,
so I invited him to join us.

60
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,416
Food's ready, Gija.

61
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,458
You should take a break from
looking for the Yellow Dragon.

62
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,083
He'd probably be easier to find
if we knew more about him.

63
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,125
According to the legends
that I've heard,

64
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,250
his body is strong and
invulnerable to harm.

65
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,666
Maybe he's covered in
armored dragon scales.

66
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,416
Or he's just completely
made of muscle.

67
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,250
Hey, you three, this
food won't eat itself.

68
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,458
[GIJA, JEAHA]
Hm?

69
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,750
Does this... seem too easy?

70
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,958
Yeah... I guess that's
the weird thing about fate.

71
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,833
Uh? Guys, what's wrong?

72
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,291
Well, it's actually kinda funny.

73
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,333
You see, that dirty blonde kid
who's eating all our dinner?

74
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:02,875
We're pretty sure that he's
the Yellow Dragon Warrior.

75
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,583
[ALL]
Huh?

76
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,833
[STRANGER]
Hm?

77
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,125
What's up?

78
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,583
Wait, am I crazy

79
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,166
or are you the Blue, Green,
and White Dragon Warriors?

80
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,666
Well, I'll be.

81
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,000
Looks like we're
all together at last.

82
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,875
[GROUP]
What?

83
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,291
You mean like, the
Yellow Dragon Warrior?

84
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,375
What the hell?!
Where'd he come from?!

85
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,750
How dare he crash our party and
eat all of our delicious food!

86
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,000
[AO squeaks]

87
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,458
I feel like this party
turned against me.

88
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:35,083
I'm just trying to enjoy all
this good food. Don't sweat it.

89
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,375
Oh, by the way.
You can call me Jeno.

90
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,250
How are you just now getting
to the important stuff?

91
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,041
I felt our final dragon
was somewhere nearby,

92
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,500
but he seemed so close
I thought I was mistaken.

93
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,750
Good job, Gija!

94
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,541
You must've sensed us as well.

95
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,416
Is that why you're here
drooling over our meat?

96
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,083
Nah, I'm a pretty
laid-back kinda guy.

97
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,833
I was more concerned with
gettin' some food in my belly.

98
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,250
I didn't really care about
the other dragons.

99
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,125
Didn't really care?

100
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,708
What's wrong?

101
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,333
You weren't exactly jumping at
the chance to join us in Awa.

102
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,750
Listen to me.

103
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,666
Didn't you feel something
spark within you

104
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,500
when you saw this girl?

105
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,500
Ahem.

106
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,166
This is Princess Yona!

107
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,958
The one true master of
the Four Ancient Dragons!

108
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,333
You're being a
little over dramatic.

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,833
My master... a princess?

110
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,375
Of course I felt
somethin' spark inside me.

111
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,541
You're, like, the cutest
girl I've ever seen.

112
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,750
My heart is racing.

113
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,500
[GIJA]
We already know she's adorable!

114
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,458
That's not what I
was talking about!

115
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,833
Do you mean to tell me

116
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,375
that you never experienced
the sacred initiation?

117
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,875
He must've felt it.

118
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,916
That animal urge
to drop to his knees

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,250
and give his body over
to the Crimson Master.

120
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,458
What kinda initiation is this?

121
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,041
[JEAHA]
He's either made of stone,

122
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,708
or completely oblivious.

123
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,791
If you're a laid-back kinda
guy like you say you are,

124
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:57,750
then I wonder...

125
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,333
You wonder what?

126
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,916
We're not just some random
travelers camping out here,

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,375
we're on a mission.

128
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,875
I've been trying to recruit
the Four Dragon Warriors,

129
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,208
so I wonder if you'd
consider joining me on my--

130
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,333
Okay.

131
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,541
What?

132
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,458
[JENO]
Okay!

133
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,541
It sounds like it
could be a good time.

134
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,916
I don't really have anything
else going on right now.

135
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,500
And besides,

136
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,000
that dinner was the best thing
I've ever eaten in my life!

137
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,375
I've gotta pay you back for
all of Yun's juicy meat!

138
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,666
Don't say it like that.

139
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,833
Happy to join ya.

140
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,208
And please feed me again.

141
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,375
I want more of that
tasty food tomorrow.

142
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,208
I guess that does it.

143
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,583
At least now we won't have
to waste time looking for him.

144
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,791
I think he might only
be here for the food.

145
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,625
He's even more eager to join
her than you were, White Snake.

146
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,833
[GIJA grunts, growls]

147
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,916
It's nice to meet
you too, Tall Guy.

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
[GIJA]
Yellow Dragon Warrior.

149
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,416
[JENO]
Hah?

150
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,458
[GIJA]
I am known as Gija.

151
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,125
The power of the White Dragon
is in my right hand.

152
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,750
If you're serious
about joining us,

153
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,125
then you'll serve the
princess and protect her.

154
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,750
What power do you have?

155
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,791
Power?

156
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,625
[GIJA]
Yes.

157
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,166
[JENO]
Hmm...

158
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,583
[JEN]
Uh.

159
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,958
I know!

160
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,375
I'm not especially powerful,
but my body is strong!

161
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,375
[GIJA]
Ah, just as we thought.

162
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,666
[HAK]
Hmm.

163
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,916
Let's see exactly how strong.

164
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,250
[HAK]
That hurt you?

165
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,791
You're just a weakling!
A normal person!

166
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,458
You can't be the Yellow Dragon!

167
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,625
[JENO]
Hold on a sec!

168
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,916
There's something
weird about this guy!

169
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,125
I'm tellin' ya, his fists
are way too strong.

170
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,333
Take it from someone
who gets punched a lot,

171
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,291
Hak's blows are really
something else.

172
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,708
And yet, for some reason,
you always seem to enjoy them.

173
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,666
Your body doesn't seem
to be particularly hard.

174
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,458
And your skin is really soft.

175
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,125
Thanks, I really believe
in moisturizing.

176
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,375
The Lightning Beast's body
is much harder than this kid's.

177
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,625
I'd be more convinced

178
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,375
if he said he was the
fourth Dragon Warrior.

179
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,333
Way to totally blow
my cover, Yun.

180
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,708
That's right, I'm
actually the Yellow--

181
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,958
If you were one of us,

182
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,875
then you would be the
intolerable Dark Dragon.

183
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,000
[HAK]
The Dark Dragon Warrior.

184
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,208
[HAK chuckles]

185
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,125
Aren't you going to
step up and correct him?

186
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,791
He's making a mockery of
your name and sacred position.

187
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,750
Your pride as a dragon
is on the line!

188
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,541
But look at his smile.

189
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,291
Calm down, Gija.

190
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,958
You have a habit of imposing
your values on others.

191
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,958
Dragon Warrior or not, this kid
should be able to lead his life

192
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,541
in whatever way he sees fit.

193
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,875
Dammit!

194
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,916
The legendary dragons.

195
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,458
We ancient warriors
have finally gathered.

196
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,250
We're bound by destiny.

197
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,208
Thousands of years have
passed since the mythical era,

198
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:30,166
yet we still managed to
find each other again.

199
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,125
I'm just so...

200
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,291
I'm truly overjoyed that
we've finally been reunited,

201
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,291
my dear brothers.

202
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,375
Aw, you're such a big softie.

203
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,375
[YUN] All four of the
dragons are now here.

204
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,166
This is an important moment
if you think about it,

205
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,250
but it feels like it was
too easy this time.

206
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:55,458
[GIJA crying]

207
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,666
[JENO]
Hey, little lady!

208
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,750
[YONA gasps]

209
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,291
[JENO laughs]

210
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,750
[JENO grunts]

211
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,750
[YONA]
Uhh.

212
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,583
Lemme help ya with that.

213
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,541
Whoa! This is heavier
than I thought.

214
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,208
Gija can carry that
much with one hand.

215
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:28,916
Seriously? I've got a
lotta training to do.

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,833
The people in your
group are so powerful

217
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,625
and seem to get along well.

218
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,791
[YONA] That's true, but it's not
cute when they fight each other.

219
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:39,458
Mh-hm. It's still a cute
crew you've gathered.

220
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,375
And you're cute, too.

221
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,916
But you know that.

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,875
I don't care what Yun
and the others may think.

223
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,708
[JENO]
Huh?

224
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,958
I'm sure of it.

225
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,708
I know that you're the
Yellow Dragon Warrior.

226
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,375
There's something
about your aura.

227
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,041
It's kind of hard to explain,
but it makes me feel warm.

228
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,041
Like I'm being bathed
in golden sunlight.

229
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,375
Even though we just met today,

230
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,750
I feel like I know you,
and it fills me with joy.

231
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,541
[YONA] There was so
much excitement earlier,

232
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,000
I never got to introduce myself.

233
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,833
My name is Yona.

234
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:21,666
I'm glad you've joined us,
Jeno, the Yellow Dragon.

235
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,958
[chuckles]

236
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,000
Heaven... thank you
for this day.

237
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:44,333
May this beautiful silver
moon... watch over us all.

238
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,833
[YUN]
Darkness falls on earth.

239
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:51,333
With the dragons' blood,
they arise once again.

240
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:55,708
Following the ancient pledge,
the Four Dragons will gather.

241
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,291
The sword and shield to protect
the sovereign will awaken.

242
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,750
And the Crimson Dragon will
finally return from dawn.

243
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,875
That's it. We'll go back.

244
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,416
[JEAHA] Ah. This is some of
the most beautiful scenery

245
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,416
I've ever seen.

246
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,250
You really used to live here
with the oracle, Yun?

247
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,458
Yeah.

248
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,583
Technically I didn't
leave all that long ago,

249
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,625
but it feels like years have
passed since I've been here.

250
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:30,875
I'm back!

251
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,375
You miss me? Uh!

252
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,541
[YONA]
Oh no!

253
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,833
What happened here? It's a mess!

254
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,333
Ik-su!

255
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,583
You okay?

256
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,541
Yun?

257
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,958
Is that you?

258
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,125
I'm right here.
Let me patch you up.

259
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:52,125
I'm sorry. I forgot
to eat for a few days,

260
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,291
and I guess I got
dizzy and passed out.

261
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,458
[YUN]
Huh?

262
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,500
[IK-SU] I'm glad you guys
showed up when you did.

263
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,125
That was a close call.

264
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,416
Don't act so calm,
you stupid oracle!

265
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,291
How'd you manage to
wreck the entire house,

266
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,666
almost starve yourself to death,

267
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,333
and then fall and
hurt your head?

268
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,666
You're totally helpless when
I'm not taking care of you.

269
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,208
It's embarrassing!
You're a grown-ass adult!

270
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,250
Yay! I've missed having
you here to yell at me!

271
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,416
Now, now, Yun,

272
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,750
this is no time to start
a lover's quarrel.

273
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,333
Why does everything have
to be about lovers

274
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,458
and beauty with you?

275
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,416
Forgive our intrusion.

276
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,833
We've traveled a long
way to see you, Oracle.

277
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,875
It's a pleasure to stand
in your presence.

278
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,916
[IK-SU] Oh, no, no,
the pleasure's all mine.

279
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,416
[IK-SU] You've recruited quite
an impressive group, Princess.

280
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
And you're exuding so
much more confidence

281
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,166
since the last time I saw you.

282
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,666
So, we've gathered the dragons.

283
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,000
What's "the sword and shield
to protect the sovereign" mean?

284
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,083
I can't figure out
whether you meant Yona,

285
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,333
or the current king, Su-won.

286
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,541
[IK-SU] It seems that
more time must pass

287
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,541
before the sword
and shield appear.

288
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,000
So are the ways of fate.

289
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,666
The prophecy can't be rushed.

290
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,750
You'll know when the
right moment arrives.

291
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:10,083
'Kay... but what are we supposed
to be doing in the meantime?

292
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,375
I don't wanna just sit
on my hands and wait.

293
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,958
[JENO] Why aren't we
talking about the stuff

294
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,916
that's actually important?

295
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,625
[JENO]
First tell me,

296
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,958
what do you want from
the Four Dragon Warriors?

297
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,291
[YONA]
Uh.

298
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,333
I understand that you
need a lot of manpower.

299
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,125
After all, you were
kicked out of the castle,

300
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,500
and I'm sure the king's men
are still looking for you.

301
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,000
You need our protection.

302
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,375
But what is the endgame here?

303
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,500
Do you plan to run forever?

304
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,416
No, I don't.

305
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,375
No? Well, then.

306
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,041
Do you plan on killing
Su-won for his treason?

307
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,416
Could you do that?

308
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,458
Take his life, and reclaim
the throne as your own?

309
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,083
[gasps]

310
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,458
No way!

311
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,083
That's impossible! There are
too many castle guards!

312
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,208
Even if we do have the Four
Dragons fighting on our side.

313
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,791
It's not a matter of
whether we can or not.

314
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,958
It's more than that. It's an
issue of will and intention.

315
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,375
Besides, if the four of us
really put our hearts into it,

316
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,541
taking the castle wouldn't
be an impossibility.

317
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,541
Although,

318
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,208
now that I think about it,
I dunno if I'd be much help.

319
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,333
[YUN, GIJA grunt]

320
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,791
The audacity!

321
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,500
Sorry if I overstepped
my place as the new guy.

322
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,708
I have no idea what the
"right" thing to do is

323
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,208
in this situation.

324
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,083
I'm simply curious as to
what I'm getting myself into.

325
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,625
I already agreed to join
up with you little group.

326
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:32,166
So, that means, I'll go along
with whatever you decide.

327
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,666
Anyway, I'm starved,
when are we eating?

328
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,125
[GIJA] Is that the only
thing you care about?

329
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,666
[YUN] I guess I should
start cooking dinner.

330
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,333
[JENO]
Yay, time for some chow!

331
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,166
[JEAHA] Jeno's certainly
full of surprises.

332
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,583
He may be tactless,

333
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,875
but he definitely got Yona
thinking about the future.

334
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,291
[GIJA] True, but still,
his methods were far too harsh.

335
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,750
She's sensitive.

336
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,541
She's grown strong, but her
heart is still vulnerable.

337
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,375
Besides, it hasn't been very
long since she lost her father.

338
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,166
That wound has yet to heal.

339
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,625
This isn't as simple as getting
vengeance for her old man.

340
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,625
We're talkin' about the future
of the entire kingdom.

341
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:18,750
It's easy to forget that
Yona's only 16 years old.

342
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,625
If we get rid of the traitor
king and Yona claims the throne,

343
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,791
she'll suddenly be in
charge of every man,

344
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,000
woman, and child in the land.

345
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,541
It could be too much
for her to bear.

346
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:34,375
Well, Hak, you grew up
alongside King Su-won.

347
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,083
What can you tell us about him?

348
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,833
Nothing at all.

349
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,416
He maintains his silence every
time this subject comes up.

350
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,958
Haven't you noticed?

351
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,750
His eyes glaze over anytime
Su-won's name is even mentioned.

352
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,583
Is it possible he has that
much hatred for the man?

353
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,958
Perhaps.

354
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,083
Or it means he had that
much affection for him.

355
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,708
[IK-SU]
It's a nice night, isn't it?

356
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,458
[YONA]
Ik-su.

357
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:11,166
You look lost in your own head.
Maybe I can help provide a map.

358
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,750
Let's see... No doubt
you're thinking about

359
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,291
the questions Jeno
asked you earlier.

360
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,166
Before this, when I
lived in the castle,

361
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,541
I was sheltered from
everything outside.

362
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,916
But I've experienced so
many new things since then.

363
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,166
I've trained with weapons
and seen new lands.

364
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,916
As I traveled, I met many
people with valid complaints

365
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,375
about my father and the way
he ruled the kingdom.

366
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,250
It's frustrating.

367
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,291
My father loved peace and
made it his top priority,

368
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,583
but that didn't keep
his people fed and happy.

369
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,583
Seeing citizens and families
I was unable to help

370
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,958
made me feel so
useless and weak.

371
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,625
And yet, when I was
desperate and struggling,

372
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,958
there was always someone
willing to lend me a hand.

373
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,416
If I thought I didn't have
the strength to go on,

374
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,250
others would push me
forward and encourage me.

375
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,666
I made new friends.

376
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,375
And now there are so many
people I want to protect.

377
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,291
I do not regret taking
Lord Keum-ji down.

378
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,416
And I can't help but wonder.

379
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,833
[YONA] Are there other
towns out there like Awa?

380
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,750
How can I get them
the help they need?

381
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,500
What must I do to end the
suffering across this land?

382
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,541
That's what's
driving me forward.

383
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,791
I love this kingdom.
And I want to aid its people.

384
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,708
I won't give up fighting
until their suffering is over.

385
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,333
[YONA]
Forgive me, Father.

386
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,000
The only way I'll
be able to protect

387
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:39,291
our beloved Kouka Kingdom,
is with a weapon in my hand.

388
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,083
I promise you that I will
return to the castle,

389
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,916
but there's something
I have to do first.

390
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,458
[YONA gasps]

391
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,583
[SU-WON]
But I can't die now.

392
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,416
There's something
I have to do first.

393
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,833
[YONA] You've probably
already seen this

394
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,958
since you're an oracle,
but I'll tell you anyway.

395
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:04,041
Su-won. I saw him when
I was alone in Awa.

396
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:08,166
Hatred burned inside of me.
I couldn't forgive him.

397
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,166
And... I also couldn't...

398
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,791
...raise a sword to him.

399
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,875
There are some emotions
we're unable to part with.

400
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,750
Even when we know that
they're harmful or foolish.

401
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,833
You may not be able to stop
your heart from feeling them.

402
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:30,333
You may despair because of that,
but it's simply our lot in life.

403
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,541
As the Crimson Dragon King said:

404
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,750
No. Even if the humans hate me.

405
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,541
Even if they betray me, I
cannot stop my love for them.

406
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,083
They have taught me
what it is to truly feel.

407
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,916
That's how we survive.

408
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,916
Good feelings are
just as sticky as bad.

409
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,208
[wooshing]

410
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,250
[YONA grunts]

411
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,083
[YONA grunts]

412
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,458
[gasps]

413
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,041
It's a little late for training.

414
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,625
I know that.

415
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,666
[HAK] You'll catch
cold out here like this.

416
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,791
Let's take shelter in the cave.

417
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,500
[HAK]
Ah, the rain isn't letting up.

418
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,125
Hope it doesn't cause
the river to flood.

419
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,416
[YONA]
Are you upset with me, Hak?

420
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,833
I've got no reason to be.

421
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,916
You've just got me
freaked out a bit.

422
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,333
Because if I have
to fight with a sword,

423
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,208
it means that there's
a chance I might get hurt?

424
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,541
I get scared whenever you
put yourself in danger

425
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,000
on my behalf.

426
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,708
It makes me crazy.

427
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,500
I couldn't stand to see you
get injured protecting me.

428
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,625
[HAK grunts]

429
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,333
While we were all
making our way here.

430
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,333
I asked Jeaha for help.

431
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:19,083
You want me to teach you how to
fight with a sword? Why is that?

432
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,916
'Cause when I asked Hak
he got mad and said "no."

433
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,458
He claims it's much
more dangerous

434
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,833
than using a bow and arrow.

435
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,291
I'm not surprised.

436
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,916
If I were Hak, I'd wanna
keep you as far from danger

437
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,250
as I possibly could,

438
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,000
even if that meant putting
myself in harm's way.

439
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,375
Yeah, but--

440
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,875
[JEAHA] It's not that
I don't respect your desire

441
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,166
to get stronger.

442
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,750
In fact, that's why I'm here.

443
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:42,208
It'll be exhilarating
to watch your progress.

444
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,500
All Hak wants is for you to
be somewhere safe and happy.

445
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,208
You're everything to him.

446
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,083
I honestly believe that's
how he feels deep down.

447
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,833
[YONA]
That's not fair to me.

448
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,458
[JEAHA]
He knows that.

449
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,166
It wouldn't be fair to
hide you away forever.

450
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,791
Or tie you down.

451
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,500
In bed, somewhere
remote and romantic.

452
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,125
Or to lock you high in a tower

453
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,916
where no other man could
ever lay eyes on you.

454
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,125
Just guessing here!

455
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,375
[YONA]
A high tower?

456
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,958
Who are we talking about?

457
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,166
Why, Hak of course, 

458
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,750
and how he wants to
keep you all to him--

459
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,791
[YUN] 
Hey!

460
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,916
Try to keep up, you slowpokes.

461
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,041
We're coming!

462
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,333
[JEAHA chuckles]

463
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,583
[HAK]
I'm gonna murder that bastard.

464
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,500
Listen here, Princess, about
those things he was saying--

465
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,541
Yeah. They were all lies.

466
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,333
I know that's not how
you really feel.

467
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,708
Why would you wanna tie me down
to a bed somewhere romantic?

468
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,416
Or hide me from guys?

469
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,750
[HAK]
Yeah, you got me there.

470
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,166
It's the exact opposite really.

471
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,208
I want you to be seen
by everyone. Everywhere.

472
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,541
By old-man Mun-deok.
And by your father.

473
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,291
By the men who chased you from
the castle, those damned idiots.

474
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,916
I want the whole
kingdom to see you.

475
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And I'll say, "Look,
this is Princess Yona.

476
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,833
She cut off her hair,
grabbed a sword,

477
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,375
and is fighting to support you.

478
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,833
She's stronger
than anybody I know.

479
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,750
She's the ruler you've
been waiting for. Yona."

480
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,875
Oh, wow. Such beautiful
words. It's unlike you.

481
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,375
Oh, man. You're right.

482
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,541
I take it all back.

483
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,458
It's too late for that.

484
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,375
I won't forget.

485
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,000
[YONA]
I'm sorry, Hak.

486
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,000
But when the rain stops,

487
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,416
I'm going to pick
up my sword again.

488
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,583
Oh, it looks like
the sun has come out.

489
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,125
Hey, Princess.

490
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,125
It's an honor to
have you here, Sir.

491
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,291
But aren't you leaving the
capital of Fuga unsupervised?

492
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,583
Oh, don't you worry.

493
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,458
I'm just showing him around.

494
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,541
He's still green, and this old
man has much to teach him.

495
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,833
If he's to govern
our people wisely--

496
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,208
I'm sure he'll do well.

497
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,208
We are grateful
for your allegiance,

498
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,000
as the Wind Clan's
newest leader.

499
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:26,625
The Earth Clan's people
speak highly of your visit.

500
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,375
Exactly what are
you plotting next?

501
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,916
Watch with your own eyes.

502
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,833
Along with the gods...
and the rest of the heavens.

503
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,291
This has all just been a prelude

504
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,666
for the action
that's yet to come.

505
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,125
In order for this kingdom
to keep surviving,

506
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,666
I'll fight...

507
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,083
...and continue to push onward.

508
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,416
[YONA] I'm still not as strong
as I'd like to be, even so...

509
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,833
I refuse to stand by

510
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,875
and pretend I don't see
the troubles that lay ahead.

511
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:07,208
I'll protect the kingdom,
and the people my father loved.

512
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:10,791
I'll bring to this land the
peace that he always wanted.

513
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,916
Lend me your strength. Please.

514
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,375
You can count on me.

515
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,708
Yes, of course.

516
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,958
This beautiful boy genuis
has got your back, Yona.

517
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,500
Anything for you, kiddo.

518
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,208
And don't forget about me!

519
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,375
Your wish is my command.

520
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,625
All right, let's go.
