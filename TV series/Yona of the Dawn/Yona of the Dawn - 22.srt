So not only will I lose
considerable profits,

use the girls as hostages.

The details about what
happened are kinda sketchy,

170
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,791
but it seems like one
of the girls was able

171
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,375
to get a signal to the pirates,

172
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,750
and they immediately attacked
the ship carrying the captives.

You mean one of
the girls was a spy?

It was her.

The strength these monsters
have is terrifying.

Lord Keum-ji, it's advisable
that we disconnect

00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,791
and retreat while we still
have the chance to escape.

Are you telling me,

188

your Lord Yang Keum-ji,

189
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,166

run like a frightened child?

It took 20 years for me
to take control of Awa.

I've ruled the city

A frail little girl and a bunch
of pirates led by an old hag

There.

Keum-ji's in a room hidden
by that map on the wall.

Mercenaries are cheap. I can
easily buy more of them.

Curse those damned pirates.

Once I regroup, I'll come after
them with ten times the men

and tear them to shreds.

Take this as a lesson, boatman.

There's no shame in

You have to protect yourself.

their lives are the

This was but one battle.

Soon, the pirates will see
that all their efforts

is you hitting on them, you--

322
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,083
[ALL]
Pervert!

323
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,291
I only wish that...
we could've been more help.

324
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,041
Nonsense.

325
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,625
[BOTH gasp]

326
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,291
You put faith in our plan and
risked your life to back us up.

327
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,500
Lina.

328
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,958
Yuri...

329
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,958
...you should know
that my name is...

330
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,625
...not important.

331
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,791
I believe that Awa will be fine.

332
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,750
As long as there's
people like you.

333
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,208
Thank you, Lina, for your hope.

334
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,000
So, we were talking, and, um...

335
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,291
We wanna give you something
to show our thanks.

336
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,166
Don't worry about it; we're just
happy that you ended up okay.

337
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,250
Compensation for such heroic
deeds will be expensive.

338
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,708
--Huh?
--[GIRL B] Huh?

339
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,250
We'll need an ocean's
worth of booze.

340
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,375
Enough to get us and
the rest of the city drunk.

341
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,416
Let's celebrate!

342
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
[ALL cheering]

343
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,958
Drinks are coming right up!

344
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,750
Have you completely
lost your minds?!

345
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,333
Everyone's badly injured.

346
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,083
We should be bandaging wounds!

347
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,708
Hey, kid, why don't you get
busy makin' us some snacks?

348
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,958
I'm not your wife,
so quit treating me like--

349
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,500
Aw, lighten up pipsqueak.
It's a pirate tradition

350
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,375
to have a big party
and get completely wasted

351
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,041
when you're
celebrating a victory!

352
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,041
The sun is barely even up.

353
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,875
These drunkards have
the right idea.

354
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,250
I forbid you to take part!

355
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,291
Ohh, a party.

356
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,291
This brings back memories.

357
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,833
Every year on my birthday,

358
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,000
my people would perform the
dragon dance in celebration.

359
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,750
Where are the dancers
and musicians?

360
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,958
[YUN]
Huh?

361
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,750
I can't wait for the
dramatic performances.

362
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,500
There aren't gonna be any!

363
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,875
My stomach is growling.

364
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,833
Ao, quit trying to eat Sinha!

365
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,250
[JEAHA laughs]

366
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,708
[JEAHA]
Let them have their fun, Yun.

367
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,083
Today's a special day.

368
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,166
[YUN]
Huh?

369
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,250
Victory.

370
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,166
Is there anything
more beautiful?

371
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,333
Perhaps only the remarkable,
gorgeous ladies

372
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,333
who inhabit Port Awa.

373
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,583
Jubilation is pumping
through my every vein.

374
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,041
There's only one
way to celebrate.

375
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:27,833
By stripping.

376
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,958
It's not that kinda party!

377
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,000
Keep it in your pants!

378
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,250
Behold my beauty.

379
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,333
Stop bleeding all over
the place, you idiot!

380
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,291
You're flirting with death!

381
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,375
Say, kid, where are
those snacks I asked for?

382
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,833
Get your priorities in line!

383
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:39,916
[MAN A]
Sorry for the wait!

384
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,750
Here's all the liquor
we could find!

385
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,416
[PIRATES, GIRLS]
Whoa!

386
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,750
[PIRATES, GIRLS laughing]

387
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:00,666
[laughing]

388
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,208
[YONA]
It's so peaceful.

389
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,958
It feels as though
years have passed

390
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,500
since the battle
with Keum-ji's forces.

391
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:13,000
I tried to do something good
for the people of this city.

392
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,625
I hope we were able to
make the citizens happier.

393
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,916
Father.

394
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,125
I've become much stronger.

395
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,416
Am I making you proud,
wherever you are?

396
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,875
[YONA]
Oh.

397
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,500
I shouldn't go any farther or
else they'll wonder where I am.

398
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,083
I'd better head back.

399
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,333
[YONA gasps]

400
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,583
[YONA]
I'm sorry. I was distracted.

401
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,583
[STRANGER]
Ah, don't worry about it.

402
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,958
I wasn't paying much attention
to the street myself.

403
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,750
--[heartbeat]
--[YONA gasps]

404
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,166
[YONA]
That voice.

405
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,208
[SU-WON]
I can't die now.

406
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,416
There's something
I have to do first.

407
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,875
Next time on Yona of the Dawn,

408
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:46,208
Episode 23:
"Morning of Pledges."
