00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:18,333
[BLUE DRAGON] My eyes.
They ache more than usual today.

3
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,375
Intruders? How'd
they get down here?

4
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,208
That woman's voice.
She's in distress.

5
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,958
He's trying to trap
her underground.

6
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,500
I have to stop him!

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,041
[YONA gasps]

00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,750
[DRAGON]
The Four Dragon warriors.

10
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,333
[BLUE DRAGON]
What's happening?

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:45,041
[DRAGON] From this day forward,
you shall act as our avatars.

12
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,625
We have granted you our power

13
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:50,041
so you may protect
the Crimson Dragon.

14
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:53,666
It is your duty to defend
him with your lives.

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,666
[BLUE DRAGON]
Whose voice am I hearing?

16
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:07,125
[BLUE DRAGON panting]

17
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:10,458
[BLUE DRAGON]
My eyes are killing me.

18
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,416
When I touched that young woman,

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,041
my blood started rushing
through my veins.

20
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,916
I thought I was
going to collapse.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then, I heard those voices.

22
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,416
[BLUE DRAGON]
Who was that man?

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
And why did I feel some sort
of strange bond with him?

24
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:29,166
The words "white dragon"
kept floating through my mind.

25
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,958
My blood is boiling.
What a strange sensation.

26
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,375
I've never felt
anything like it before.

27
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,291
What's happening to my eyes?

28
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:41,500
Why are they aching so badly?
I need to try to calm down.

29
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:45,708
No one must know about my
cursed power. Never again.

30
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,458
Wait, are you telling me

31
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,750
you were almost kidnapped
by one of the villagers?

32
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,166
The nerve! First, they
disrespect the princess,

33
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,125
and then they try to
trap her underground?

34
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,625
Those miserable
plebeians are lucky

35
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,375
I don't rip their faces off!

36
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,458
There's no need to get violent!

37
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,833
[HAK]
Plebeians, huh?

38
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,958
Big word for a small man.

39
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,000
Why don'tcha settle
down, moneybags?

40
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,458
Let a real man handle this.

41
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,333
Neither of you is
"handling" anything, got it?

42
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,958
Anyway, I dunno about this guy
being the Blue Dragon Warrior.

43
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,416
Are you sure he's the one?

44
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,250
Yes.

45
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,125
[HAK]
Then why'd he run away from you?

46
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,125
Who knows?

47
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,250
There's something
strange going on here,

48
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,875
but I can't put my finger on it.

49
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,291
What really
strikes me as odd

50
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,250
is how this village is
the exact opposite of yours.

51
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,458
What?

52
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,541
Then again, maybe it's
just our perception.

53
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,833
It's possible we've
been lead astray.

54
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,625
What if the White Dragon
Warrior's village

55
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,750
is the exception to the rule?

56
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,125
There we were surrounded
by crimson-hair-worshippers

57
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,791
and Gija's power was revered,
but it's different here.

58
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,666
The people of this village
couldn't care less

59
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,416
about the princess's
crimson hair,

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,250
and they don't idolize
their warrior.

61
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,708
Instead, they seem to
loathe him and his power.

62
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,625
Maybe that's why he doesn't
want anything to do with us--

63
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,166
[GIJA]
That's nonsense!

64
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,500
It's the Four Dragons' sworn
duty to make their presence know

65
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,041
when their master comes calling!

66
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,250
I didn't hesitate to introduce
myself to the princess

67
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,541
for I knew it was
my job to protect her!

68
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,541
Not everybody can be
as perfect as you.

69
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,708
No, guess not.

70
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,083
That was sarcasm, you know.

71
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:45,958
[YONA]
You're wrong.

72
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,291
He didn't hesitate. He saved me.

73
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,041
And I could feel
kindness in his touch.

74
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,708
I wanna see him again.

75
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,333
You don't seriously wanna
go back to the caves, do you?

76
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,750
Yeah!

77
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,416
Most folks would stay
far away from the place

78
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,041
after what you went through.

79
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,250
You've sure got guts,
Princess Yona.

80
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,708
[giggles]

81
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,208
Well, let's go.

82
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,791
All we have to do is find that
secret passageway, right?

83
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,500
Shouldn't be too hard.

84
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,750
[YONA gasps]

85
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,625
You should stay here, Princess.

86
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,791
But, Hak.

87
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,000
[HAK]
It's too dangerous.

88
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,750
Yun and I will find
the Blue Dragon Warrior

89
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,833
and bring him to you.

90
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,833
What about me?
I should go, not you!

91
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,625
[HAK] Okay, then I'll stay
and protect the princess.

92
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,208
You fiend!

93
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,041
Head back to the caves and try
and find the secret passageway,

94
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:35,916
but don't go insi-- 

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,750
[YONA]
No!

96
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,333
Uh.

97
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:42,166
I'm going. Along with Gija and
Yun. You're staying here, Hak.

98
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,500
[HAK grunts]

99
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,458
[YONA] Gija can sense
the Blue Dragon Warrior

100
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,500
and Yun knows his way
through the caves.

101
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,416
I'm sorry, but this might
be my only chance.

102
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,125
Maybe... I can persuade
him to join us. Please?

103
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,583
Geez.

104
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,125
You seriously want me to stay
out here and be the lookout?

105
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,500
And I suppose I don't have
any say in the matter.

106
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,208
Don't worry, I promise
I'll be careful.

107
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,000
You know the only reason
I'm asking this of you

108
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,250
is because I trust you, right?

109
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,458
[HAK sighs]

110
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,000
It's true.

111
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,041
[HAK grunts]

112
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,416
You'd better come back
without so much as a scratch.

113
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,666
Otherwise...

114
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,083
...you're stuck with me.

115
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,750
I'll be right by your side
for the rest of your life.

116
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,833
Really?

117
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,458
Wow, that sounds annoying!

118
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,083
I'll be extra careful now.

119
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,291
Good. I don't wanna be
stuck with you either.

120
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,083
[YONA giggles]

121
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,833
[YUN]
Poor guy.

122
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,666
[HAK]
Hey, White Snake.

123
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,166
I'm part dragon, not snake-- Uh.

124
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,250
Watch her.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,666
[GIJA]
She's in good hands.

126
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,208
[HAK]
The villagers.

127
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,666
They've been spying
on us the whole time.

128
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,125
You sure are a creepy
bunch, aren't ya?

129
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,083
Look all you want,
you're not getting past me.

130
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,666
Admit it, Princess,

131
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,125
aren't you scared to
venture off like this

132
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,625
without the Lightning Beast?

133
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,958
Of course I am, but I was
trying to play it cool!

134
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,541
I need to learn to
do things myself

135
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,041
so I don't have to
rely on Hak as much.

136
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,125
[YUN]
Did you ever stop to think

137
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,500
that maybe he wants
to be relied on?

138
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,833
[YONA]
You think?

139
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,958
I don't know. I seriously
doubt that's the case

140
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,791
because he swore to serve my
father and his kingdom, not me.

141
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:34,916
The only reason he's here

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,583
is he's following
my father's orders.

143
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,625
I dunno, Princess. I don't
think that's the only reason.

144
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,750
[YONA] He's spent his
entire adult life working

145
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,625
as a general and a bodyguard.

146
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,208
It sounds miserable,
if you ask me.

147
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,458
That's why I hope to give
Hak his freedom back someday.

148
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,875
[YUN]
What?!

149
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,666
This is a dead end! There's
no secret passageway here!

150
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,958
[YONA]
Yes, there is.

151
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,583
[gasps]

152
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,958
[YUN]
Whoa! You're right, it opened!

153
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,375
That's so cool!

154
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,791
[YONA]
Mh-hm.

155
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,208
[YUN]
Hey, Gija, you coming?

156
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,250
[YONA]
Is there something wrong?

157
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,333
[GIJA]
Uh. No.

158
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,375
I can sense the Blue
Dragon's location.

159
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,541
He's straight ahead,
so you two go on.

160
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,958
I'll stay here and wait for you.

161
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,208
What? But we need you.

162
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,916
We'll be fine, Princess.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,083
There's no need to worry,

164
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,208
this beautiful boy
genius knows the way!

165
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,125
[GIJA]
Take care of her.

166
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,416
You know I will.

167
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,208
[GIJA]
Now then.

168
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,791
Would you care to tell me what
business you have with us?

169
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,708
[YEODEOL] No one who goes
through the hidden passageway

170
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,500
can ever leave the caves.

171
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,958
[GIJA]
Is that so?

172
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,625
Are you scoundrels
completely unaware

173
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,791
of the Crimson
Dragon's nobility?

174
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,166
I'm charged with
protecting Princess Yona,

175
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,875
so you'll have to get
past me to get to her.

176
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,000
[BLUE DRAGON]
The White Dragon is nearby.

177
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,250
I can feel it.

178
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,125
And I hear footsteps
coming this way.

179
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,458
[BLUE DRAGON]
Ao, go and hide.

180
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,750
[BLUE DRAGON]
Who are these intruders?

181
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,958
[BLUE DRAGON] If they're
enemies, I'll take them down!

182
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,541
[heartbeat]

183
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,250
We meet again.

184
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,000
[BLUE DRAGON]
Who is she?

185
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,166
Why does she make
me feel this way?

186
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,875
[BLUE DRAGON yelling]

187
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:46,916
[YUN gasps]

188
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,041
[panting]

189
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,791
This guy is totally crazy!
Then again, what did we expect

190
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,958
from a creep who wears
a mask and hides in caves?

191
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,208
We should get outta here

192
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,791
--while we still can, Princess.
--[AO squeaks]

193
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,166
Well, hello, furry friend.

194
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,208
[YUN]
Huh?

195
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,625
That glutton's got
way too much food

196
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,250
crammed in his pudgy cheeks.
Watch out, he might puke.

197
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,541
So, does this little
guy have a name?

198
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,666
--Ao.
--[YUN] Uh!

199
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,750
[YUN]
I didn't expect him to answer.

200
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,416
I don't think that
suits him at all.

201
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,291
Okay, let's not piss off
the crazy man, Princess!

202
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,000
[BLUE DRAGON]
I suppose she's right.

203
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,083
It doesn't suit him, does it?

204
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,875
But I didn't know
what else to call him.

205
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,916
I'm Princess Yona.

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,666
May I ask your name?

207
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,875
Blue... Dragon.

208
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,750
No, that can't
possibly be right.

209
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,083
[BLUE DRAGON grunts]

210
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,583
I mean, that's your title,
but what's your name?

211
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,416
Don't have... one.

212
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
I'm just... Blue Dragon.

213
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,666
Stay away!

214
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,708
Who are you people? And why
did you come to this village?

215
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,291
No one has ever come near me

216
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,375
but you and your
white dragon friend.

217
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,708
We're allies.

218
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,541
We mean you no harm,
we've come to speak to you.

219
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,375
[BLUE DRAGON] What is this
feeling that's come over me?

220
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,916
Please, sir.

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,708
I need you to
lend me your power.

222
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,958
Won't you come on
this journey with me?

223
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,791
[BLUE DRAGON]
It feels as if I've been waiting

224
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,083
all my life to find her.

225
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,000
You say you need... my power?

226
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:47,208
[heart beating]

227
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:47,666
[groans]

228
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,500
[gasps]

229
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,458
Let go of her!

230
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,208
Enemy.

231
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,833
I was told that those who
seek the Blue Dragon's power

232
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,458
are the enemy!

233
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,041
[DRAGON]
The Four Dragon Warriors.

234
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,583
From this day forward,
you shall act as our avatars.

235
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,666
I don't know you.

236
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,708
But I feel as if I should.

237
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,708
Why is my hand
shaking like a leaf?

238
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,750
I thought you were the
enemy, but you're not.

239
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,458
So, who are you?

240
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,875
[BLUE DRAGON] Why do I
feel like I want to cry?

241
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,500
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,000
It was never my intention
to upset you like this.

243
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,250
I've come here because
my life is in grave danger,

244
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,333
and I need the power of
the Four Dragons to survive.

245
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,500
Will you join me and
become my comrade?

246
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,666
[BLUE DRAGON]
She wants to be... my comrade?

247
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,958
[BLUE DRAGON]
It isn't meant to be.

248
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,125
[BLUE DRAGON] I'm sorry,
I can't do that. I'm cursed.

249
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,791
What do you mean?

250
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,750
My power's dangerous.

251
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:06,416
It's far too destructive
to ever be used for good.

252
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,000
It must be kept secret.

253
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,625
What nonsense.
Who told you that?

254
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,541
[BLUE DRAGON]
It's the truth.

255
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:17,000
[YONA] But it's not true,
it's what you've been told.

256
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,416
Please, come with us.

257
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,708
[BLUE DRAGON]
Leave.

258
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,250
Leave me!

259
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,083
Let's go, Princess.

260
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,208
[YONA sighs]

261
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,166
[YONA]
One last thing before I go.

262
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,333
When you grabbed my hand...
I felt your kindness.

263
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,375
[gasps]

264
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,916
[YONA] I don't know why
you believe you're cursed

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,583
because I've never felt more
at ease than I did by your side.

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,083
You saved me. I wouldn't be
alive if it weren't for you.

267
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,541
For that, I will
always be grateful.

268
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,250
[BLUE DRAGON]
She's leaving.

269
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,291
Uh.

270
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,791
[groaning]

271
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,166
[BLUE DRAGON]
Why does it feel as though

272
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,125
my heart is being ripped out?

273
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,000
[YONA] Will you join me
and become my comrade?

274
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,708
[BLUE DRAGON]
A comrade...

275
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,250
Ao... all that
I want... is a friend.

276
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,583
[BLUE DRAGON]
How could I forget?

277
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,208
All I ever wanted was a friend.

278
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,916
[YUN]
Um, Princess.

279
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,541
Judging by the look on your
face, you're not too happy.

280
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,458
[YONA growling]

281
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,000
It must be miserable
having to live like that.

282
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,708
He didn't have anything,
not even food.

283
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,708
Why does this hurt?
It almost feels as though

284
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,250
I'm abandoning someone
who's important to me.

285
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,708
I just met him.

286
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,791
Why am I so worried about him?

287
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,916
[GIJA] Stay back, cretins!
I'm warning you!

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,208
What's wrong?

289
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,041
[YONA gasps]

290
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,375
[YEODEOL]
There they are.

291
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,875
[MAN B]
We must fulfill our duty!

292
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,083
[MAN C]
Kill the intruders!

293
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,125
We'll protect you, Princess.

294
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,958
What's with these guys?

295
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,416
[GIJA]
They want to kill us

296
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
so the Blue Dragon Warrior's
identity remains a secret.

297
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,458
They want... to kill us?

298
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,500
[YEODEOL]
Now that you've ventured

299
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,875
into the Blue Dragon's lair,

300
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,083
we cannot allow you
to leave with your lives!

301
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,458
But why? Please, tell me.

302
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,583
Why do you insist on
keeping his identity a secret?

303
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,125
I'm not sure why
but the villagers think

304
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,500
the dragon's noble
power is a curse.

305
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,791
You ignorant fools should be
worshipping him, not hiding him.

306
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,958
[YEODEOL]
Why, you--!

307
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,708
No, I'm far too young
and pretty to die!

308
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,208
[YEODEOL grunting]

309
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:47,708
[MEN gasp]

310
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,791
That was harsh!

311
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,125
I'm sorry, Princess!

312
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,500
I meant to punch him with
my human hand, I swear!

313
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,958
[YUN]
Yeah, right. You've been itching

314
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,875
to use your super-human
strength, you show off.

315
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,500
I beg you. Tell me.

316
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,791
What do the people
of your village

317
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,875
have against the

I don't understand why
you think he's cursed.

Princess! Yun! White Snake!

You know the only reason
I'm asking this of you

is because I trust you, right?

This is all my fault.

I never should'a let
her go off without me.

How could I be so stupid?

Now I'm not there to protect
her when she needs me the most.

I'm so scared right now.

More than I've ever been before.

350
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,500
I wanted to prove to you that
I can handle things myself,

351
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,750
that I don't have
to rely on you.

352
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:50,208
But I'm frightened
without you by my side.

I'm sorry, I don't
wanna give up,

All right.

00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,583
It was all such a blur.

362
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,500
At least the
earthquake's over.

363

It's no good.

Oh, no. We're gonna
die down here.

There's only so much
air to go around.

This is awful. What'll we do?

00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,666
I'm so scared.
Where are you, Hak?

377
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,416
[GIJA] It's hard enough
taking this journey with you,

378
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,583
why must you haunt my thoughts?

something before we left

that keeps echoing in my head.

Watch over her.

386
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,250
Ugh! That jerk already
gets on my last nerve,

387
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,750
hearing his voice floating
around in my brain

388
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,000
just makes it worse!

It's my sworn duty
to protect you, Princess.

Forget about that lazy oaf.

You're gonna have to
learn to work together.

Fine, I'll give it a try!

Don't be scared, okay?

00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,166

I just know it.

time to wait for Hak.

We're losing precious
air by the second.

I'm perfectly capable of
getting us out of here myself.

you unwrapped your claws?

It's a shame that
you fear our powers

when they could benefit you.

others who've been cursed?

But how can that be?!

415
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,791
I thought the Blue Dragon
was the only one--!

[YEODEOL screaming]

I can't take it anymore!

None of this
would've happened...

...if it weren't for
the Blue Dragon.

421
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,041
He's the reason we're
going to die in this cave!

422
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,958
Damn it! Get us outta here!

423
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,125
Don't blame him!

424
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,458
We're trapped because
of the earthquake.

425
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,166
He had nothing to do with it!

426
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,000
[YONA]
Why are they scared of him?

427
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,666
He was so gentle and kind.

428
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,875
[MAN B] If you only knew of his
wickedness, you'd understand.

429
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,458
But he's not wicked at all!

430
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,166
You're an outsider!
How would you know?!

431
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,208
[YONA gasps]

432
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,833
[YEODEOL] I'm not sure what we
did to deserve this punishment,

433
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,416
but the dragon-eyed monster
is always born into our clan.

434
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,375
And you wonder why we
think his power is a curse.

435
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,208
Because no matter how many times
we beg the gods for forgiveness,

436
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,875
we are never spared
from this tragedy.

437
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,250
Now, whenever a
Blue Dragon dies,

438
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,916
we live in fear that our child
could become the next one!

439
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,291
[MAN B] We kill all intruders
so the outside world

440
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,416
will never know our clan
bears this horrible curse.

441
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,916
We don't want them
to know our shame.

442
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,666
When the current
Blue Dragon was born,

443
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,583
we immediately put
a mask on his face

444
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,291
and hid him away from the world.

445
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,791
All in the hopes of
protecting our secret.

446
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,375
When he was a boy,
he found his way outside

447
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,791
and used that dreadful power

448
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,041
to kill an entire
army of soldiers.

449
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,500
It was a massacre unlike
any we'd ever seen.

450
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,875
After that happened, we were
forced to move the clan here

451
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,625
because we were afraid
that whoever attacked

452
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,958
might send even more troops.

453
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,416
Haven't we been through enough?!

454
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,791
If this isn't a curse,
then what is?!

455
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:13,833
[GIJA gasps]

456
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:14,916
Enough. He's here.

457
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,958
[bells ringing]

458
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,791
[YEODEOL gasps]

459
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:26,708
[MAN F]
It's him.

460
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,958
[MAN H]
The Blue Dragon Warrior.

461
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,500
[MAN I]
No way.

462
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:33,250
[YEODEOL] Uhh... I-I wasn't
doing anything wrong, I swear!

463
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,791
The intruders were just asking
us a few questions about you,

464
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,958
that's all!

465
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,916
Stay back!

466
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,291
[YEODEOL gasps]

467
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,250
[YONA] I don't see how anyone
could think his eyes are cursed.

468
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,791
They're so beautiful.

469
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,416
So soulful.

470
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,041
[YONA] And there's
so much sadness in them.

471
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,083
My heart hurts for him.

472
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,875
[BLUE DRAGON] From the very
first moment I saw her,

473
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,333
I knew she would
be my salvation.

474
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,541
She is the light
in the darkness.

475
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,583
Next time on Yona of the Dawn,
