1
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,208
[YONA]
What happened, Su-won?

2
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,041
Please hurry!
My father needs help!

3
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,375
[SU-WON] There is no helping
your father now, Yona.

4
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,625
The king is
dead and I killed him.

5
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,708
[YONA] No, It can't be.

6
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,458
You did this?

7
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,541
But... How could you
hurt my father like this?

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,000
You're not that kind of person!

9
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,208
If you only knew, Yona.

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,625
My whole life...

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,250
The only thing I've ever wanted
was your father's head.

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,291
[gasps]

13
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,750
[HAK] I can't shake
this bad feeling.

14
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,083
[MALE SOLDIER 2A]
From what I can tell,

15
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,750
everyone's still in the dark
about what happened.

16
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,333
[MALE SOLDIER 2B] Great.

17
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,166
The guests and servants are all
passed out drunk from the party,

18
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,000
so we still have a few more
hours before they panic.

19
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,041
Excellent.

20
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,625
Our biggest concern
is General Hak

21
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,208
and how he'll react to it.

22
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,916
[HAK] And why are you
so concerned about me?

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,791
Let's hear what
you're talkin' about.

24
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,166
All of it.

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,583
[YONA] But... why?

26
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,208
My father loves you.

27
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,666
He's taken care of you and
helped raise you for years,

28
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,541
ever since we were little.

29
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,250
[SU-WON] I loved him, too.

30
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,708
That may sound crazy
right now but it's the truth.

31
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,250
People always
called him a coward

32
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,166
for hating
weapons and conflict,

33
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,666
but I respected his pacifism.

34
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,875
I thought it was
because he was kind.

35
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,708
[SU-WON] But your
father was not kind.

36
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,583
He had blood on his hands.

37
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,708
It's been a long time,

38
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:21,166
but surely you
remember my father.

39
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,666
[YONA] Uncle Yuhon?

40
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,791
As a child, my father was brave
and wise beyond his years.

41
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,000
When he grew up,
he became a warrior.

42
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,208
Time and time again
he led his troops to victory.

43
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,416
Everyone wanted him
to be the next king.

44
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,291
He was the best and
most likely candidate.

45
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,666
But ten years ago,
the late King Junam

46
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,958
crowned Uncle Il as the
ruler of Kohka instead.

47
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,833
No one understood this decision,

48
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,666
since my father
was the oldest child

49
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,458
and so loved
by the people.

50
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,458
He should have been king.

51
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,250
He earned that right in battle.

52
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,125
Why give the crown
to the second son,

53
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,958
who was weak and softhearted?

54
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,375
My father took
everything in stride

55
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,083
and laughed off the slight.

56
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,291
The crown?

57
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,875
It would weigh me down
on the battlefield.

58
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,166
I'll continue to fight
on the front lines.

59
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,708
Not just to protect my kingdom,

60
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,583
but to also defend
my brother, the king.

61
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,708
[SU-WON] I was so
proud of my father.

62
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,625
I couldn't have
respected anyone more.

63
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,958
It was my dream that one day
I'd be strong enough

64
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,166
to fight alongside him,
keeping our land safe

65
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,875
and honoring our family name.

66
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,500
But King Il
killed that dream.

67
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,000
Shortly after taking the throne,
he murdered my father,

68
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,083
his own brother, in cold blood.

69
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,250
Not true.

70
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,291
Yuhon died in an accident.

71
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,958
[SU-WON] That was just
a lie to save face.

72
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,625
He even did it himself.

73
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,250
King Il ended my father's life
with his own hands.

74
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,166
Do you understand?

75
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,583
Your damned father,

76
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:46,041
who always talked about hating
weapons and conflict,

77
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,000
put a sword through my
father's heart and killed him.

78
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,708
No. You're lying.

79
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,791
He couldn't.

80
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,958
You know I wouldn't
lie to you, Yona.

81
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,208
[SU-WON]
And so to avenge my father,

82
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,333
and to bring honor back to
both my family and the throne,

83
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,833
I will lead.

84
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,500
I will take the crown
for Kohka Kingdom.

85
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,125
[YONA]
This can't be happening.

86
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,208
It's just a nightmare.

87
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,291
But why can't I wake up?

88
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,083
[YONA] Your smile.

89
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,125
It was always so
warm to me, Su-won.

90
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,125
I think your
hair is amazing.

91
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,375
Breathtaking.

92
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,500
[YONA] You gave me a hairpin.

93
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:35,083
I'm wearing a gift
from my father's murderer.

94
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,416
[SU-WON]
I didn't expect you to be up

95
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,666
in the middle of the night
and have to see this.

96
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,375
Sources told me
that you hardly ever

97
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,750
come by the king's
quarters this late.

98
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,541
Why is tonight different,
Princess Yona?

99
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,125
I came to confess.

100
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,750
[YONA] I couldn't wait.

101
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,375
I came here to tell him that I
couldn't forget about you.

102
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,166
That I loved you.

103
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,666
How can I live with myself now?

104
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,500
[KEISHUK] Master Su-won.

105
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,458
Keishuk.

106
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,458
It's done.

107
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,416
Everything's going
as you planned.

108
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,583
[KEISHUK] You're finally
getting your heart's desire.

109
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,750
But the princess was a witness?

110
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,500
Then your next
move is obvious.

111
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,416
She should be happy to
join her father in death.

112
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,791
You must silence
the princess's voice.

113
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,208
You would kill me?

114
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,583
[YONA whimpers]

115
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,166
[YONA yelps]

116
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,583
Put it out!

117
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,916
We don't want to draw
any attention here!

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,041
[MALE SOLDIERS] Yes, sir!

119
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,833
Please catch her immediately.

120
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,875
Sir!

121
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,041
[YONA]
Who? Who was that person?

122
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,041
He murdered my father.

123
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,958
And now he's trying
to kill me, too!

124
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,333
That can't be Su-won!

125
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,333
He'd never do this to me.

126
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,458
Not the Su-won that I love!

127
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,375
[YONA panting]

128
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,750
[YONA yelling]

129
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,875
[MALE SOLDIER 1A]
Prepare yourself, Princess.

130
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,750
Your death is crucial to the
health of the Kohka Kingdom.

131
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,125
[YONA] Is that true?

132
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,875
Or do they just hate me?

133
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,833
Su-won is the only
man I've ever loved.

134
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,666
All my life, I've only
had eyes for him.

135
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,625
[YONA] The only thing
I wanted in the world

136
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,958
was to see him
happy and smiling.

137
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,333
And to be by his side.

138
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,625
Su-won!

139
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,500
[SOLDIERS gasp]

140
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,000
[HAK] It's always such a pain
to have you at the castle.

141
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,708
I've tried my best
to stay quiet

142
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,291
and out of the way
during this visit.

143
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,833
But then I discovered
that the guards

144
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,208
all over the castle
have abandoned their posts.

145
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,416
And there's an ugly
stranger barking orders.

146
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,875
What the hell
do you think you're doing

147
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,875
out here with the princess?

148
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,166
Well, Lord Su-won?

149
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,583
[YONA] Hak...

150
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,208
Please forgive me for
leaving you all alone earlier.

151
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,833
But I'm here for you now.

152
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,666
You mean you're not with them?

153
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,958
Are you still on my side, Hak?

154
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,250
[HAK]
You know what my orders are.

155
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,208
I promised your father
I'd protect you.

156
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,833
Nothing about that
has changed tonight.

157
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,541
No matter what happens,
I'll keep you safe!

158
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,625
Watch your tongue, mongrel.

159
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,958
You're talking to the new master

160
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,791
of the Crimson Dragon Castle,
King Su-won.

161
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,666
[HAK] King?

162
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,500
Who's the master of where, now?

163
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,500
What is this?

164
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,791
Some kind of game you're
playing to amuse yourself?

165
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,208
Where is King Il?

166
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,041
Shouldn't he be out here
enjoying the fun with you?

167
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,791
He'll have no more fun.

168
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,416
I sent that bastard
to hell moments ago.

169
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,916
You must have had too
much to drink at the party.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,875
Even if you're joking,
that's going too far.

171
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,083
Why don't you ask
Yona what happened?

172
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,333
She was there.

173
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,458
She watched the king die
right in front of her.

174
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,083
[HAK yelling]

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,791
I've had enough of your lies!

176
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,625
Every word I've
said is the truth.

177
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,041
Monster!

178
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,041
How could you murder the king
in front of the princess

179
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:05,916
and then brag?

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,083
I'll kill you!

181
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,333
There's no mercy
for what you've done!

182
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,291
Master Su-won!

183
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,125
You stay out of this.

184
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,500
Step closer and
you'll end up dead.

185
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,458
The man standing in
front of us is Son Hak.

186
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,666
A most dangerous opponent.

187
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,541
[SU-WON] Yes.

188
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,208
He's one of the Five Generals,

189
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,708
the pillars that serve as
the backbone of this kingdom.

190
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,041
[KEISHUK]
"The Lightning Beast of Kohka."

191
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,875
[HAK]
Explain yourself, Su-won.

192
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,041
What's this
about taking the crown?

193
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,416
No.

194
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,541
You're not the type of person

195
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,416
who'd obsess over
something like that.

196
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,666
You took the life
of a kindhearted king

197
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,958
who wanted nothing
but peace for his realm.

198
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,416
Have you no decency?

199
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,708
You've shamed this kingdom!

200
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:52,583
A "kindhearted king."
That was my uncle.

201
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,500
But one thing
I refuse to be is weak!

202
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,458
[KEISHUK] Son Hak.

203
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,000
He's the grandson of
the renowned Son Mun-Deok

204
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,166
and a prominent member
of the Wind Clan.

205
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,291
He was made leader of
that clan at a young age

206
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,625
before coming here.

207
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,291
[KEISHUK] It's said the swing
of his blade is like lightning,

208
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,208
earning him the nickname
"the Lightning Beast of Kohka."

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,958
[yelling]

210
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,666
Stop or she dies!

211
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,333
Lay down your
weapon or she dies.

212
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,875
[KEISHUK] Master Su-won.
You've been injured.

213
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,250
[HAK] Not enough.

214
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,958
Is there anything
of the Su-won I knew

215
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,500
still left inside that shell?

216
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:17,083
You were supposed to be someone
I could entrust the princess to.

217
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,375
But you're a coward.

218
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,875
[KEISHUK] How small-minded.

219
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,583
You may be regarded
as a General,

220
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,833
but you still
think like a child.

221
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:24,875
What?

222
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,500
[KEISHUK] The Kohka Kingdom
was on a path to ruin

223
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,375
under King Il's leadership.

224
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,416
People like the two of you

225
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,625
who've been
sheltered in the castle

226
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,708
know nothing of
what it's like outside.

227
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,875
Under Master Su-won's rule,
the people will rise--

228
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,750
That's enough
out of you, Keishuk.

229
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,958
Be quiet.

230
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,750
[HAK]
What is he talking about?

231
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,208
[SU-WON]
All that concerns you is that

232
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,208
the Su-won you once
knew doesn't exist anymore.

233
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,791
As king, I will strike down
anyone who gets in my way.

234
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,458
That includes you, too.

235
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,750
[YONA] I can't believe
this is happening.

236
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,583
Please! Somebody make it stop!

237
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,000
After them!
They mustn't leave!

238
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,041
[TROOPS] Sir!

239
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,416
[MIN-SU] General Hak!
This way's clear!

240
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,250
Was that your crappy shot?

241
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,500
Well, you've got a lot
of work to go on your aim!

242
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,458
Here, take the
princess and follow me.

243
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:34,625
Be careful with her.

244
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,916
Right. Got it!

245
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,375
Outta my way!

246
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,625
[HAK] Quick, over there!

247
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,666
[MIN-SU] Okay!

248
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,125
[swords clashing]

249
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,375
[MIN-SU] General Hak!
Watch out behind you!

250
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,625
We need to find a good
spot to hide and make a plan.

251
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,750
But where can we go?

252
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,875
Follow me.

253
00:13:58,958 --> 00:13:59,916
Right!

254
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,166
There are way too many of them.

255
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,041
Is it true?

256
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:23,125
King Il is gone, and Su-won's
the one to blame for everything?

257
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,958
This is terrible.

258
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,791
I'm sorry that
I had to ask you.

259
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,958
I just couldn't believe
what I was hearing.

260
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,583
It seems like
only moments ago

261
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,000
that he was laughing
at your birthday party.

262
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,666
It seemed as though he didn't
have a single care in the world.

263
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,958
Sooner or later they're
gonna find where we're hiding.

264
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,250
[MIN-SU] The castle guards,
along with the soldiers

265
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,333
Su-won brought with him,
are all regrouping.

266
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,958
They'll start a
formal search soon.

267
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,708
If the guards find us,
we'll be executed on the spot.

268
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,583
Right?

269
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,625
Yeah.

270
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,708
I can cause a distraction
and lead them away.

271
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,833
While I've got their attention,

272
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,541
the two of you can
make a break for it.

273
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,875
But then you're stuck here.

274
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,333
Don't worry about me.

275
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,625
I'll make sure that
I'm right behind you.

276
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,041
They're around here somewhere.

277
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:29,833
Find them!

278
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,000
[TROOPS] Yes, sir!

279
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,958
[HAK]
Six guards at the rear gate.

280
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,083
Probably troops
waiting in ambush, too.

281
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,958
Min-Su... What...?

282
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,583
[MIN-SU]
They'll think I'm the princess.

283
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,416
When you get
an opening, take it.

284
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,333
You'll be okay.

285
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,166
I pray for your safety.

286
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:57,958
There she is!

287
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,625
Get her!
Don't let her escape!

288
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,583
Min-Su!

289
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,875
[GUARDS groaning, falling]

290
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,000
[HAK] Now! We have to go.

291
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,708
[MALE SOLDIER 2W] This way!
We've got her!

292
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,833
[MIN-SU]
Princess. Please be safe.

293
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,333
[KEISHUK] They've most likely
fled into the mountains.

294
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:02,125
I'll organize troops to comb
through the area at once.

295
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,583
Hak was raised in
the capital city of Fuga,

296
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,541
a village deep in
the mountain valley.

297
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,000
He knows his way
around this terrain.

298
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,500
Even with the princess
tagging along,

299
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,666
it'll be hard for
the guards to track him.

300
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,958
[HAK] Princess.

301
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,083
Do you need to
rest for a little while?

302
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,666
[YONA] Min-Su sacrificed
himself for us.

303
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,583
Will we survive?

304
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:42,291
If Su-won finds us,
we're both dead.

305
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,541
He'll kill me.

306
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,416
Like he killed Father.

307
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,875
I'm not gonna let that
bastard have either of us.

308
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,041
I'll fight off
every soldier he sends.

309
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,833
[YONA] You'd better
keep that promise. Okay?

310
00:17:54,916 --> 00:18:00,625
I forbid you
to die on me, Hak.

311
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,458
[HAK]
I can't believe this happened.

312
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,500
King Il is actually dead.

313
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,250
[HAK]
Now the princess is all alone

314
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,416
with no one but me
to protect her.

315
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,833
[HAK] Su-won.

316
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,000
[KEISHUK] My apologies.

317
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,708
The guards have been
searching the mountains

318
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,291
since we noticed their escape.

319
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,708
With no luck.

320
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,166
What's happening
inside the castle?

321
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,791
People are beginning to realize
that something is wrong.

322
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,083
Commotion is spreading.

323
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,083
[MALE GUEST 2A] General Ju-Do,
what's going on here?

324
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,791
[MALE GUEST 2B] Was there
an intruder or something?

325
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,791
We'll get to the bottom
of this as fast as we can.

326
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,708
Shall we move on with your plan?

327
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,166
We have little time.

328
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,625
[HAK]
I know you're tired, Princess.

329
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,208
But we've got to go.

330
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,541
[YONA] Of course. But where?

331
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,458
Did you know at
the party last night,

332
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,250
when my father was
crying tears of happiness,

333
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,000
not once did I tell him
how grateful I was,

334
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,708
or that I loved him.

335
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,750
Never.

336
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,541
He was home.
Where am I supposed to go now?

337
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,375
What do I do?

338
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,125
I feel so lost.

339
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,750
[YONA sobbing quietly]

340
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,208
Hak...

341
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,000
[HAK]
We'll go anywhere in the world

342
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,041
as long as it means
you'll continue to live.

343
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:51,125
I think that's the best way you
can honor the king's memory.

344
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,416
[YONA] On the night
of my sixteenth birthday,

345
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,875
I lost so many things
that for a moment,

346
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,666
I thought I couldn't go on.

347
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,875
My home, my father,
the one I'd loved.

348
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
They were all gone.

349
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,500
[YONA] But that wasn't
the end of me.

350
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,500
My journey was only beginning,

351
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,166
and I had many
new faces to meet.

352
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,708
[COMMANDER 2A]
What the hell?!

353
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,250
Heads up!

354
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,666
[COMMANDER 2A]
Who are you monsters?

355
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,125
[SOLDIERS yelling]

356
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,125
[LIEUTENANT 2A] There's another
one attacking the rear!

357
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,916
[SOLDIERS yelling]

358
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,791
[YONA]
Leave Kohka immediately!

359
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,208
I won't let you
attack this kingdom!

360
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,750
[YONA] Turn back now
or I'll force you to!

361
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,791
Agh! Stupid little bitch!

362
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,125
What?

363
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,333
[YONA] I will endure.

364
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,375
To fight for
my father's beliefs,

365
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:57,041
for the sake of peace,
and for my friends.

366
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:38,125
[HAK] Princess, I beg of you,
use me in order to survive.

367
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,666
After all, that's
what I'm here for, isn't it?

368
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:46,000
Next time, on Yona of the Dawn,
Episode 3: "Faraway Sky."
