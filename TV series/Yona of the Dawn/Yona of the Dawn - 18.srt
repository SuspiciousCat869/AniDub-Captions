[DOK]
Jeaha, you leavin' again?

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,708
You've been spendin' all
your time in town lately.

3
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,541
Hm. This time's different.

4
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:19,708
I'm recruiting.

[gasps]

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,500
[HAK] I've been getting weird
chills since yesterday.

7
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,125
Are you feeling all right?

8
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,375
I'm fine.

00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,916
[groans]

00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,125
Let's try goin' this way.

11
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,583
[YONA]
Mh-hm.

12
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,250
Poor Sinha must be miserable
waiting all alone for us.

13
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,833
We need to find the Green
Dragon Warrior quickly.

14
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,208
[YUN] He did look pretty
pathetic when we left.

15
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,208
[YUN chuckles]

16
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,250
Gija, do you feel anything?

17
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,916
I sense he's in this town,
but he moves around so fast.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,791
Getting a bead
on him is difficult.

19
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,833
If only he'd hold
still for once.

20
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,291
[OFFICER A]
Get outta the way, now!

21

No. How cruel.

25
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,333
All the officers seem to
do is terrorize this town.

26

[YONA gasps]

27
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,708
Stay here, Princess.
Leave it to me.

28
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,041
But I...

29
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,666
It'll be my pleasure.

30
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,541
No, you're way too conspicuous.
Let me handle this one.

31
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,666
Now, stand back--

32
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,833
Cool it, Lightning.
Don't strike yet.

33
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,291
You can't just bust in.
You look like circus freaks.

34
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,541
How rude!

35
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,875
Pirates sunk one
of Keum-ji's ships.

36
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,083
That's the word.
It happened yesterday.

37
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,875
The officers are more
on edge than usual,

38
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,666
so their brutality against
the townspeople is worse.

39
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,958
I understand how you feel,
but we must be discreet.

40
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,375
[OFFICER A]
That should teach 'em a lesson.

41
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,833
[OFFICER B] Yeah, I think
we've earned a drink.

42
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,000
All right.

43
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,666
Looks like the coast is clear.

44
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,750
Yeah.

45
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,291
Come on.

46
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,500
[HAK]
Hm?

00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,416
Listen.

[GIJA, YONA, YUN]
Hm?

49
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,541
I've got something
I need to take care of.

50
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,916
Watch over the princess.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,958
What? Wait, Lightning Beast!

52
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,500
Uh... What was that all about?

53
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,250
Look.

54
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,208
[GIJA, YUN]
Hm?

55
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,250
Uh!

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,333
[JEAHA laughing]

57
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,250
Talk about ugly!
Oh, this is rich!

58
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,041
He's not gonna be happy.

59
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,875
Well, this makes my job
of recruiting him

60
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,541
a whole lot easier, now
that he's a wanted man.

61
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,541
[HAK] Who've you got
your sights on now?

62
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,125
Well,

63
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,375
I'll admit I don't have any clue
what the guy's name is, but--

64
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,750
Where did you come from?

65
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,000
I dunno know where you
get off laughing like that.

66
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,416
'Cause you and I are in the same
sad predicament now, buddy.

67
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,458
We are?

00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,750
[JEAHA laughing]

69
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,791
What an unfortunate
looking rapscallion.

70
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,791
Do you recognize him?

71
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,791
No, I'm afraid I've
never had the pleasure.

72
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,458
That's your ugly mug.

73
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,625
[JEAHA]
Ah.

74
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,958
[JEAHA] The artist who drew
these has gotta be blind.

75
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,083
[HAK]
Yeah, no kiddin'.

76
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right! It's you!

77
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,250
[HAK]
Huh?

78
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,666
That poster almost made
me forget my mission.

79
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,916
I came here specifically
to find you.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,041
Nu-uh. I'm not gonna
be your accomplice

81
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,666
in whore-mongering again.

Oh, no, no, no.

83
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,791
That's not why I'm here.

00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,708
[HAK]
Hm?

85
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,166
You're the one that I want.

[VILLAGERS whispering]

Sorry, but I don't
swing that way, pal.

00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,250
No, wait, that's not
what I meant!

90
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,708
This is all one big
misunderstanding!

91
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,958
I need a strong, handsome man,

92
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,750
so I've got a
proposition for you,

93
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,791
but we should probably go
somewhere more secluded

94
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,250
to talk about it.

95
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,208
The last thing I want is to
be "propositioned" by you

96
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,208
in a private place!

00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,375
C'mon, hear me out--

[HAK]
I think he liked it.

104
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,583
He looks way too happy for
someone with a nose-bleed.

brings you here?

me over this way!

to do alone?

Never mind. I hope you
never have to find out.

[HAK] It looks like I finally
shook him. I can't believe it.

For the first time ever,
another person freaked me out.

until he simply can't refuse.

and they need our help.

163
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,750
We have to do something.

164
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,875
[HAK sighs]

165
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,333
I'm sorry,

166
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,708
but I don't think there's
anything we can do for them.

167
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,083
I know that's true, Yun...

168
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,750
But still...

169
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,625
The way father ruled allowed
this evil to take root.

170
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,083
And now I see.

171
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,166
I bear the burden of correcting
his mistakes. I have to.

172
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,083
[YONA] How could people
be so unspeakably cruel

173
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,583
to one another?

174
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,916
[YONA] I have to make
this right somehow.

175
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,083
There must be a way.

176
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,083
[JEAHA]
Well, here I am.

177
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,166
So, this is what it means
to feel like an idiot.

178
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,916
When I was younger, I escaped
the Green Dragon's village

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,291
after living my life
as a prisoner.

180
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,375
I'm not the type to hide, but
I did, time and time again.

181
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,958
I found ways to
cloak my presence

182
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,333
so the other Dragon
Warriors wouldn't find me.

183
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,750
I thought, at last I had
found a safe haven.

184
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,583
I fooled myself into
believing I could run

185
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,125
for the rest of my life.

186
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,958
Who knew I would
ultimately be undone

187
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,500
by getting my big, fat butt
stuck in a stupid vase?!

188
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,833
I don't even care,
just help me out!

189
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,416
Nice to meet you, I guess.

190
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,000
So, what do you want
with me, White Dragon?

191
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,916
I should hate you
for catching me,

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,541
but you're a Dragon
Warrior, like me,

193
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,458
so you can't be all bad.

194
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,250
And you're almost
as attractive as I am,

195
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,166
which means I might
have to kill you.

196
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,416
Hm.

197
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
Look everybody, I trapped
the Green Dragon!

198
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,916
Hey! Don't lie,
I trapped myself!

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,416
It's like it was meant to be!

200
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,791
He fell right out of the sky,
practically into my hands!

201
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,500
You know that I'm a
wanted man, right?!

202
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,000
Parading me around like this

203
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,166
is a surefire way to get us
both thrown in the slammer!

204
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:05,708
[gasps]

205
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,291
[JEAHA yelling]

206
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,416
Wait a sec. Just how big is
that butt of yours, anyway?

207
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,958
You really think I've got enough
posterior to fill this thing?

208
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,916
I can't believe
I actually found you!

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,333
[JEAHA] Uh... Yeah, yeah,
do you have to gloat about it?

210
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,333
[GIJA]
Our destiny awaits us.

211
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,791
[JEAHA]
Hm?

212
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,333
You and I are bound together.

213
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,250
Our sole purpose in life
is to protect our master.

214
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,000
[JEAHA]
Protect him from what?

215
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,458
Wait a second.

216
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,875
Are you talking about the
king from that silly legend?

217
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,166
Not quite. It's kind
of complicated.

218
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll explain it later.

219
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:36,958
Forget it.

220
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,416
[BOTH grunt]

221
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,500
[JEAHA] I'm extremely
fond of the lifestyle

222
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,875
I've created for
myself here in Awa.

223
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,000
I have no intention of
walking away from all of that

224
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,625
to join some stranger in
protecting an unknown master.

225
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,375
That's my final answer.

226
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,708
Hold on! You come back here!

227
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,458
You have a responsibility
as a Dragon Warrior!

228
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,916
The time's come to fulfill
our purpose in life!

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,875
Our forefathers
gave up everything

230
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,833
to pass their powers down to us.

231
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,833
Therefore, we can't let
their sacrifices be in vain.

232
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,291
We have the great honor

233
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,958
of realizing the dream they
cherished for generations.

234
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,791
Oh, gimme a break.

235
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,250
Do you really buy into all
the fairy-tale brainwashing

236
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,125
they shoved down your throat?

237
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,375
You've gotta have a mind of
your own somewhere in there.

238
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,291
Can't you think outside
the "Dragon Warrior" box?

239
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,166
If all you want is
to protect your master

240
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,916
because you were told from
the time you were born

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,291
that it was your destiny, then
you are a slave to your cause.

242
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,083
That's no life for me.

243
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,458
If that is the case,
then I pity you.

244
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,291
[JEAHA]
Huh?

245
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,500
There he is.

246
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,333
--Hey.
--Nope.

247
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,708
Sorry about earlier,
I know I made it awkward,

248
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,541
but I just wanted to talk
to you about something.

249
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,541
Sorry, pal,

250
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,791
but my grandfather
always warned me

251
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,166
not to talk to creapy strangers.

252
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,500
Well, I'm Jeaha.

253
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,416
That's my name. I'm a pirate.

254
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,458
There, now we're not
strangers anymore.

255
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:04,083
Now we can talk without
ignoring your grandpa's advice.

256
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,125
All right, spill it,
what do you want?

257
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,083
My captain is quite
interested in you.

258
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,958
I told her how strong you are.

259
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,750
No one's ever
impressed me so much.

260
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,916
We want you to come join
our ranks and fight with us.

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,958
Not gonna happen.

262
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,708
Aw, c'mon, just
meet her one time.

263
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,750
You can even bring
your master with you.

264
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,166
I don't see any harm in
a single meeting, do you?

265
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,916
It's outta the
question, y'hear me?

266
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,875
I don't think I've ever met
a man so devoted to his work.

267
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,250
Makes you even more attractive.

you shall act as our avatars.

so you may protect

It's as if my blood
is boiling in my veins.

This young woman.

She's the leader of
the Four Dragon Warriors?

All this time, I've
been avoiding her?

You're running a fever.

[JEAHA]
Her hand feels so cool.

286
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,041
I know I should break free

287
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,250
and run away as far
and as fast as I can,

288

but something won't let me.
I'm rooted to this spot.

Some unseen force
compels me to stay.

Thank you for your
concern, young lady,

You're the Green Dragon Warrior.

Well, no, but I've got
a feeling that he is.

Am I right?

00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,041
[JEAHA] I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,791
I'm just a traveler
making his way--

There he is! He's the
Green Dragon Warrior!

301
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,125
You're just a traveler, eh?

Okay, I give up. I'm him!

So, you're the one I've been
lookin' for all this time.

avoidin' you like the plague.

finally found you.

[JEAHA] I guess the bond
between the Dragon Warriors

309
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,750
and their master is more
powerful than I imagined.

You can call me Yona.
What's your name?

Everything about this young lady

00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,375
seems to be drawing
me in, mesmerizing me.

313
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,416
But that's just the
dragon's blood in my veins

314
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,375
forcing me to feel that way.

315
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,416
I mustn't mistake these thoughts
and feelings for my own.

My name's Jeaha. It's nice
to meet you, miss.

00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,250
I've always dreaded this
moment, but here we are.

318
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,583
Does that mean you knew
I was coming to find you?

319
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,958
I've sensed the presence

320
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,458
of the White and Blue
Dragon Warriors around town,

321
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,958
but I had no idea they'd be led

322
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,916
by such a stunningly
beautiful young lady.

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,250
I've been writing and rehearsing
the lines I would tell them

324
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,625
if they ever brought
their master to meet me.

325
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,291
"I have no intention of
becoming your slave.

326
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,750
You are not my master.
Please leave."

327
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,000
[GIJA growls]

328
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,375
[YONA] I'm not their master, and
I don't force them to serve me.

329
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,375
The White and Blue Dragon
Warriors have agreed

330
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,958
to help me with something,

331
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,041
and I've sought you out to ask
for your assistance, as well.

332
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,833
I'm delighted such
a lovely young lady

333
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,583
wants me to help her out,

334
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,791
but I'm afraid that I can't.

335
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,541
You see, I'm not
like the others.

336
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,750
I won't live and die
by some silly legend.

337
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,541
This is my life, and I refuse
to give up my freedom.

338
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,750
I've never been one to
take life for granted.

339
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,625
I intend to live
mine to the fullest.

340
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,208
So, don't expect me to vow
to protect and serve you,

341
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,625
now or ever.

342
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,666
Jeaha.

343
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,333
There's no need to speak
to me so vehemently.

344
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,375
[gasps]

345
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,291
[YONA]
It's all right.

346
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,208
Guess I'll just have
to give up on you.

347
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,458
But, Princess!

348
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,875
I'm asking for his help,
not giving him an order.

349
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,625
I can't force him
to do anything.

350
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,958
I didn't think you'd
give up so easily.

351
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,041
It wouldn't be dignified
of me to push the issue

352
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,375
when you've been so clear
about your feelings,

353
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,458
but I'll admit I'm
really disappointed!

354
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,791
It's so strange. I find
it hard to pull away.

355
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,666
I'm just drawn to the
Dragon Warriors, I guess.

356
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,625
Well, it's disappointing
to me, too.

357
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,708
I haven't met such a beautiful
girl in a long while.

358
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,166
In any case,

359
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,166
I'm determined to recruit
this hunk to fight with me.

360
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,500
It's not dignified of
you to push the issue.

361
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,666
You mean Hak?

362
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,666
Yeah, this guy's
a filthy pirate.

363
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,833
He's been stalkin' me

364
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,666
and beggin' me to
meet with his captain.

365
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,750
Filthy minded, maybe.

366
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,416
You're a pirate?

367
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,666
We'll do it.

368
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,291
We'll meet with your captain
whenever you'd like us to.

369
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,750
[JEAHA]
Hmm...

370
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,333
Really? Are you
going to give us Hak?

371
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,125
[YONA]
Mh-hm. No, I'm not.

372
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,916
But I think we have a common
enemy, and if we join forces

373
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,041
we might have better odds
of taking him down.

374
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,666
[JEAHA ]
What exactly are you getting at?

375
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,375
[YONA] I witnessed Keum-ji's
officers kill an innocent child.

376
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,875
The memory of it
makes me tremble

377
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,625
with rage and sadness
even as I speak.

378
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,208
I'm furious, both with
the men who did it,

379
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,708
and with myself for
letting it happen.

380
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,333
I have to act.

381
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,583
I cannot bear to see
another child killed.

382
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,208
He must be stopped.

383
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,458
I can't say whether or not my
comrades will fight with you,

384
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,625
but if you promise
to bring Hak,

385
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,625
I can definitely
arrange something.

386
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,333
Okay, meet me at our
ship tomorrow morning.

387
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,666
[YUN] Why would you make an
impulsive decision like that

388
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,875
without discussing
it with us first?

389
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,333
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
help myself, Yun.

390
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,416
I felt compelled to arrange
a meeting with their captain.

391
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,750
What if they try to assault
us or take our stuff?

392
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,958
Look, the meeting was
solely my decision,

393
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,958
you don't have to come
if you're afraid.

394
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,666
Don't take me for a coward.
I'm going with you.

395
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,666
I will accompany you, as well.

396
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,416
Do you really buy into all
the fairy-tale brainwashing

397
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,541
they shoved down your throat?

398
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,083
[GIJA growls]

399
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,791
Sorry to put you in
an awkward situation.

400
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,166
Ah, It's all right.

401
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,291
But that guy better keep his
annoying face outta mine

402
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,250
if he knows what's good for him.

403
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,875
I'm surprised you're
so quick to give up

404
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,250
on enlisting him, though.

405
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,875
I can't make him do
anything he doesn't want to.

406
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,166
Wow, that's so
understanding of you.

407
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,625
I remember when I tried
to leave the Wind Clan.

408
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,041
You were completely unreasonable
about the whole thing.

409
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,250
I think you said,

410
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,000
"I don't recall ever
approving you to leave."

411
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,083
[growling]

412
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,500
[HAK]
Huh?

413
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,958
Hey, what's your problem?

414
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,583
Shut up, Hak, that's different
because you're special.

415
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,125
Special?

416
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,833
[chuckles]

417
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,375
Whaddya mean? What
makes me so special?

418
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,208
Would you forget
about it already?

419
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,291
Why do you have to go
and make things weird?

420
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,416
And as I recall, you
also said something

421
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,666
about being grateful I had
to stay by your side.

422
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,875
[YONA] You're so annoying
when you get like this!

423
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,833
Enough flirting, you two.
C'mon, dinner's ready.

Hi, my name's Yona.

Are you the captain
of this ship?

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,666
Yep, that's me.
Captain Gi-Gong.

427
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,625
So, Jeaha tells me
you wanna help us out.

428
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,541
That the reason why you graced
my ship with your presence?

429
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,375
Yes.

430
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,541
[DOK]
Wow, a girl!

431
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,291
[TATSU]
She's so pretty.

432
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,833
[RYEO]
Hey, wait a second.

433
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,791
[GI-GANG]
What's under the freaky mask?

434
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,375
[DOK]
Maybe it's another girl!

435
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,708
[TATSU] I'll bet that
one's even prettier!

436
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,291
Take it off!

437
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,791
[GI-GANG] Show us
your face or else, kid.

438
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,958
You shouldn't harass the man
with major trust issues!

439
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,791
Leave him alone!

440
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,500
I don't need some sissy onboard
who won't show his face.

441
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,625
I run a tight ship.

442
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,958
I got no room on this vessel

443
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,208
for people who I don't
trust with my life.

444
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,625
But you need manpower,
don't ya, Captain?

445
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,875
Give us a shot.

446
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,666
[GI-GANG]
I'll consider it if you can beat

447
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,500
every one a these dumbasses.

448
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,416
Don't you think that's
a little unfair to them,

449
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,541
considering how badly
they're outnumbered?

450
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,125
You're onto something.

451
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,583
The odds are stacked
against us, huh?

452
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,958
--Yep.
--[SINHA] Hm.

453
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,333
Thankfully, I could take
them all out by myself.

454
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,666
I'd like to see ya try!

455
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,250
[PIRATES yelling]

456
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,083
Oh good, a show.

457
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,625
[HAK]
So, how'd we do, Captain?

458
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:22,000
We knocked 'em all out.
Want us on your side now?

459
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,875
There's no use resisting, boss.

460
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,583
It's kinda like having three
more of me on the crew.

461
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,791
And their strength would make
us completely unstoppable.

462
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,416
Hm. You pass the test.

463
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,458
I'm so glad.

464
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,958
Yeah.

465
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:37,500
[GI-GANG] Now don't start
celebratin' yet, little missy.

466
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,000
What skills ya got
that I might need?

467
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,750
I don't believe in violence,
so I'm not going to fight.

468
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,208
But I can do just
about anything else.

469
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,208
I know how to cook,
to sew, and to hunt.

470
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,708
I can treat injuries.

471
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,333
I know how to make certain
explosives, and I'm gorgeous.

472
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,833
That ain't too bad.
So, what about you?

473
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,000
[YONA]
Uhh.

474
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,416
[GI-GANG] Why should
I let you join my crew?

475
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,041
I have skills, but they're not
as practical as the others'.

476
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,750
So, you're useless.

477
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,750
The last thing that I need is a
little girl gettin' in the way.

478
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:12,666
But, ma'am--

479
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,833
Think I should
let you help out

480
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,416
just 'cause you
hate Yong Kum-Ji?

481
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,125
We all want revenge, sweetheart,

482
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,125
but you gotta have a lot
more than your feelings

483
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,208
to sail with me and my boys.

484
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,541
Now, go back home
to your dollies.

485
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,333
She comes with us as
part of the package.

486
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,250
--We make no exceptions.
--Gija, it's all right.

487
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,541
[YONA] Captain Gi-gang
has a valid point.

488
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,208
That being said...

489
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,291
I will fight. I'll just
have to do it alone.

490
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,333
Uh.

491
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,541
[GI-GANG] This girl's
got a fire in her eyes.

492
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,875
Okay, then.

493
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,208
Let's see if you got what
it takes to run with us.

494
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,541
If you can prove to me that
your willin' to risk your life

495
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,833
for our cause, then
you can stay onboard.

496
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,583
[GI-GANG] But If you can't
cut it, your off my ship.

497
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,208
[YONA]
Come on, legs, a little farther.

498
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,750
One step at a time.

499
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,541
If I can just keep going,
and complete this task.

500
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,375
If I overcome my fear.

501
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,333
Next time on Yona of the Dawn,

502
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:48,083
Episode 19:
"Trial of the Cheonsu Plant."
