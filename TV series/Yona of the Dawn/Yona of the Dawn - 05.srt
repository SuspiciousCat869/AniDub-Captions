Well, crap.

I was hoping there'd be
something a little smaller.

00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,250
Uh, hey there, Master Hak.

May I ask what you're doing
here in the middle of the night?

Sorry, Shop-keep.

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,208
I didn't mean to wake you.

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,125
If you came
during business hours,

8
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,000
you wouldn't have
to break down the door.

Yeah, sure.

Something like that.

I think it may turn out
to be a pretty long trip.

[HAK] Sorry about the door.

Whoa, you mean you're
actually paying today?

16

This much money'll take care of
your whole tab, and then some.

Thanks for all of
your help, Shop-keep.

I can't believe you got

All right.

I'm gonna head outta here and

how to say goodbye.

Please take care
of her for me.

A princess with
half a kingdom after her

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,541
I have to go away.

143
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,125
If I were to stay here,

144
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,000
I'd be putting Fuga and
the Wind Clan in great danger.

145
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,375
[HAK] Don't worry.

146

The Elder knows everything.

147

It'll be fine.

148
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,458
You can live here peacefully.

149
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,166
No one from the outside
world will ever know.

You're setting out on your own,
but that's against my wishes.

You made me a promise.

152
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,041
You said you'd guard me.

153
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,541
That you'd help me survive.

154
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,958
I've renounced
my former status.

155
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,166
That means I'm
no longer a general,

156
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,833
or a servant to a princess.

157

You're interrupting my
first steps as a hired sword.

158

I'm no longer
responsible for your safety.

159
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,375
And as long
as you stay quiet,

160
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,583
Su-won won't bother
with you either.

161
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,625
[HAK] Step aside.

162
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,250
My mind's made up!

163
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,708
Doesn't make a difference.

164
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,916
I'm gone and you're staying put.

165
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,583
Do you have any money?

166
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,250
If we leave together,
then I'll have to protect you.

167
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,833
How would you repay me
for making sure

168
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,458
that you don't get in trouble?

169
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,583
A man with my skills can fetch
a high price for his services.

170
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,958
I'm afraid you don't have
the coin to afford me.

171
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,041
Unless you're planning
to pay me with your body.

172
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,166
I don't have
anything to give you.

173
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,083
And you know that.

174
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, then that settles it.

175
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,416
You're staying.

176
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,500
Goodbye, Princess Yona.

177
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,583
Listen!

178
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,833
I want you with me, Hak!

179
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,166
[YONA]
Stay by my side forever!

180
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,250
But princess...
What are you saying?

181
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,000
You're so spoiled, used to
getting everything you want.

182
00:09:58,958 --> 00:09:59,958
Aw, crap.

183
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,458
This situation is
really annoying.

184
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,791
[HAK] I'm gonna regret this.

185
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,083
All right, I give up.

186
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,208
You win.

187
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,875
[MUN-DEOK] You bastard!

188
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,166
--[HAK] Grandpa!
--What a disrespectful brat!

189
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,666
Were you here
the whole time?

190
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,166
[MUN-DEOK] I should
put an arrow through you

191
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,666
for every insult you said
to this brave, determined girl.

192
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,208
Thanks, Mun-deok.

193
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,208
[MUN-DEOK]
With you leaving, I feel like

194
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm losing another grandchild.

195
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,541
[YONA] I understand.

196
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,041
Others said that, too.

197
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,083
That I'm their family.

198
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,916
It was nice.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,083
And it's why I have to go.

200
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,666
I'll be fine.

201
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,958
Just promise me you'll
protect the Wind Clan.

202
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,875
Don't forget that if you ever
find yourself in trouble,

203
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,250
if your heart despairs,

204
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,375
or you need shelter of any kind,

205
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,958
we'll always
be here to help you.

206
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,208
We'll take your side,
no matter who your enemy is,

207
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,375
or what it means for our future.

208
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,375
All you have to do is ask,
and we'll be there.

209
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,166
[HEUKCHI]
Master Gang Tea-jun.

210
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,666
Leave me alone, Heukchi.

211
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,166
I'm busy sulking.

212
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,416
Pardon?

213
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,708
Father won't stop yelling at me.

214
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,541
He's pissed I acted on my own.

215
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,583
Well I have news that
might make you feel better.

216
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,916
What?

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,416
[HEUKCHI] We've received word
that Princess Yona

218
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
was seen around
the Wind Clan capital.

219
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,541
Fuga?

220
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,041
One of our soldiers
has confirmed

221
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,833
seeing a red-haired girl.

222
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,916
General Hak was
also seen with her.

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,458
The two of them
appeared to be headed

224
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,541
towards the
Northern forest on foot.

225
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,958
The Northern Forest? Why?

226
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,000
There's nothing
around there but trees.

227
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,416
We're not sure.

228
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,458
[GANG TEA-JUN] The princess
and the Lightning Beast.

229
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,416
Gah! This is my chance.

230
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,416
Call the troops to arms!

231
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,666
Those two fugitives are mine!

232
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,958
[YONA] Do you see anything?

233
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,333
[HAK] Nope. So typical.

234
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,000
Sending us out to find some ally

235
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,750
without even telling us
where he lives.

236
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,833
[HAK] The oracle?

237
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,500
[MUN-DEOK] Yes.

238
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,291
It's said that there's an oracle

239
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,791
who has foretold the future
of the Kohka Kingdom

240
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,500
since ancient times,

241
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,541
living somewhere in
the land of the Wind.

242
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,458
[MUN-DEOK]
Princess, if you're unsure

243
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,000
of what you
should do next,

244
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:24,666
I suggest you seek out this
oracle and ask him for advice.

245
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,208
Surely he will show you
the correct path.

246
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,125
[HAK] I've heard that in
the past the oracle lived

247
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,000
in the temple
at the royal palace

248
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,541
and was heavily
involved in politics.

249
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,625
However, Prince Yuhon
disapproved of his foresight,

250
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,041
and the oracle left the castle
for a more secluded existence

251
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,250
far away from others.

252
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,000
"Far away from others," huh?

253
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,375
Maybe we're close.

254
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,875
That definitely
describes this place.

255
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,583
[HAK] This area
may look uninhabitable,

256
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,375
but you could make a home here
if you put your mind to it.

257
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,208
Well, not you.

258
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,083
You'd probably fall off
a cliff the first night.

259
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,416
[YONA]
Although I'm Kohka's princess,

260
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,208
the Crimson Dragon Castle is
the only place in the kingdom

261
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,916
I'm familiar with.

262
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,458
I hardly know anything about
this land and its people.

263
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,791
Of course I'm unsure of
the path I should be following.

264
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,125
Right now I'm busy
just trying to survive.

265
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,416
I'm afraid we're
gonna have to camp.

266
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,791
That's the only way
we're going to be able

267
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,958
to search this place
thoroughly and find this guy.

268
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,250
Are you okay with that?

269
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,541
Yeah, of course.

270
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,291
I've actually kinda
gotten used to it.

271
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,791
[HAK] Unlike the mountains
behind the castle,

272
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,500
it gets chilly up here.

273
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,500
That's fine, I can
always just cuddle up to you

274
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,916
while you sleep.

275
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,958
[HAK] Man...

276
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,583
Fine by me.

277
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,291
But I might misbehave.

278
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,625
What do you mean?

279
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,875
If I'm overcome with passion.

280
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,208
Then I might
do something like this.

281
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,083
Stop it, Hak!

282
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,125
What do you think you're doing?

283
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,125
[HAK] Quiet. Footsteps.

284
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,416
It's forty.

285
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,458
No... More like fifty.

286
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,208
Enemies?

287
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,208
[HAK] There are too many people
for them to be scouts.

288
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,416
If these guys are after us,
they definitely mean business.

289
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,666
The king's troops.

290
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,666
Or maybe...

291
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,166
[HAK] Y'know, princess.

292
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,416
If you really were going to
cuddle up to me in the dark,

293
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,125
I'd want you to
be a little curvier.

294
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,208
Otherwise it'd be no fun for me.

295
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,375
[YONA] And just what
is that supposed to mean?

296
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,166
All right, then.

297
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,458
[HAK] Now that I'm
all warmed up,

298
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,375
it's time to kick some ass.

299
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,458
Stick close to me, Princess.

300
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,250
This could get messy.

301
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,208
[MALE SOLDIER 5A] He really
does move like lightning.

302
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,333
[YONA] I remember you
talking about him.

303
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,208
No one's faster with
a sword or spear than Hak.

304
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,625
If we ever fought for real,

305
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,458
there's no doubt he would
wipe the floor with me.

306
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,916
[YONA] Even at a dangerous
time like this,

307
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,041
my thoughts go
straight to you, Su-won.

308
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,708
[FIRE CLAN SOLDIERS] Attack!

309
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,750
Oh, come on!

310
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,583
Is that all you've got?

311
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,166
[GANG TEA-JUN]
You're quick, Lightning Beast.

312
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,583
[HAK]
Figures this is your doing.

313
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,083
[GANG TEA-JUN] I have been
waiting for this moment

314
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,708
for a long time.

315
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,750
Greetings, General Son Hak.

316
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,458
And of course, Princess Yona.

317
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,416
You remember me.

318
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,208
Now that I have your attention--

319
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,458
[HAK] Look, Princess.

320
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,208
The view from here is
breathtaking, isn't it?

321
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,875
What?!

322
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,916
I've been rehearsing
this speech all afternoon.

323
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,583
How can you just
ignore me like that?

324
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,916
Were you talking?

325
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,583
All I heard was a droning noise.

326
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:06,250
I'm actually not a general
or a "Son" in title anymore, so.

327
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,958
Sorry to ruin your big moment.

328
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,125
Oh, that's okay,

329
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,666
I can sub in your
nickname or something.

330
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,666
Wait...

331
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,333
What? You're not
a general anymore?

332
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,750
'Fraid not.

333
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,541
I'm just a traveler wandering
around looking for work.

334
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:22,250
So that means my actions
are mine and mine alone.

335
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,583
From here on out,

336
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,375
the Wind Clan has nothing
to do with any of this.

337
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,125
That's all well and good.

338
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,083
But I'm not here to
lash out against the Wind Clan.

339
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,416
All I want is the
red-haired princess.

340
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,958
And I'll take down
anyone who tries

341
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,791
to keep me
from getting her!

342
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,375
Don't give him
a chance to recover!

343
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,666
[SOLDIERS yelling]

344
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,750
Stop him!

345
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,458
Form a barrier!

346
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,291
Release the arrows!

347
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,500
You've gained
some weight, princess.

348
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,791
'Cause you made me!

349
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:00,958
[SOLDIERS yelling]

350
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,666
[HAK] This way!

351
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,750
For the kingdom!

352
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,625
[YONA] I'm so afraid...

353
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,958
There are arrows and troops

354
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,416
coming at us
from all directions.

355
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,750
It's too much
for even Hak to handle.

356
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:21,958
[YONA yells]

357
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,583
Aim for the Princess!

358
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,083
Hak! No!

359
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,708
Talk to me!
Are you all right?

360
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,125
You're hit!

361
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,250
Why are you suddenly
so concerned about my body?

362
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,666
It's unlike you.

363
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,916
Not funny!

364
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,083
Amazing...

365
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,625
Don't be impressed.

366
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,250
He'll be losing blood now.

367
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,291
Get him!

368
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,750
[MALE SOLDIER 5D]
We still can't find them.

369
00:17:58,833 --> 00:17:59,583
[MALE SOLDIER 5B]
Look over there.

370
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,625
[MALE SOLDIER 5E] Will do!

371
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,791
[HAK] Do not move
from this spot, okay?

372
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,958
But Hak...

373
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,750
Your shoulder's bleeding.

374
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,458
That's not my blood.

375
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,791
Don't lie to
make me feel better!

376
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,833
Hak!

377
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,958
[HAK] If we leave together,
then I'll have to protect you.

378
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,416
How would you repay me
for making sure

379
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,958
that you don't get in trouble?

380
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,416
[YONA] He's still
trying to protect me.

381
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,666
[GANG TEA-JUN]
Where's the princess?

382
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,250
Don't tell me
she just disappeared!

383
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,416
[YONA] Gang Tea-jun.

384
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,666
[MALE SOLDIER 5A] Hak may be
serving as a distraction.

385
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,791
[GANG TEA-JUN] Find her
no matter what the cost.

386
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,291
[GANG TEA-JUN] He's starting
to look fatigued.

387
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,208
It seems that even the
lightning beast is human.

388
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,708
[MALE SOLDIER 5A]
It was a poison-tipped arrow

389
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,041
that hit him.

390
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,333
[GANG TEA-JUN] What?

391
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,500
You shot at the
princess with that?

392
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,708
We were certain that Hak
would put his own body

393
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,333
in harm's way if we
aimed our shots at her.

394
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,541
The poison
would've knocked out

395
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,333
any normal person by now.

396
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,708
He's stronger than we thought.

397
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,708
[GANG TEA-JUN] The next time
he turns his back to us,

398
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,833
hit him with another one.

399
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,625
[YONA]
Hak is going to be killed!

400
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,833
[HAK] Do not move
from this spot, okay?

401
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,625
[YONA] I should stay.

402
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,083
Even if I try to help, I might
end up making things worse.

403
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,125
[YONA] He'll be all right.

404
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,791
Hak's the strongest
person that I know.

405
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,125
He'll dodge it.

406
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,791
The arrow won't come
anywhere close to him.

407
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,875
I'll wait here quietly.
Just like he told me to.

408
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,208
Hak...

409
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,125
There's no way
he's going to die.

410
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,750
[YONA] No!

411
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,791
I didn't leave Fuga
to cower in hiding.

412
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,375
I must be brave!

413
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,000
I can't rely on Hak
to protect me forever.

414
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,791
[YONA] I refuse to be
a burden to those

415
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,666
who want to help me any longer.

416
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,208
I won't let Hak
sacrifice himself for me.

417
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,375
[MUN-DEOK] If you're unsure
of what to do next,

418
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,791
I suggest you seek out this
oracle and ask for advice.

419
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,208
[YONA] I don't need an oracle.

420
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,083
I know exactly what
I need to do right now.

421
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,958
[SOLDIER yelling]

422
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,375
[GANG TEA-JUN] Princess Yona?

423
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,791
[GANG TEA-JUN] Those eyes...

424
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,166
[GANG TEA-JUN] I never expected
that you'd come after me.

425
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,333
As a representative
of the Fire Clan,

426
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,083
I'm only here to talk to you.

427
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,000
Please, let's
calm down a little.

428
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,250
There is no need
for you to be alarmed.

429
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,416
I'm here to bring you back
to the Crimson Dragon Castle.

430
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,291
[YONA] To bring me back?

431
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,833
That's right.

432
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,375
His Highness Su-won will ascend
the throne tomorrow morning.

433
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,166
[GANG TEA-JUN]
My condolences for your loss.

434
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,583
It must have been
painful to lose your father

435
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,416
and then be chased
out of the castle.

436
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,291
If you come with me and tell
the truth about what happened,

437
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,791
you can stop Su-won
from becoming king

438
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,125
and get the vengeance
for your father deserves.

439
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,500
Doesn't that sound like
what you want?

440
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,500
Why aren't you hiding?!

441
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,833
[GANG TEA-JUN] So, Princess.

442
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:06,875
If you'll just come with--

443
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,416
[YONA]
If you're so well informed,

444
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,208
then why did the Fire Clan
put pressure on the Wind Clan?

445
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh, no, you see,
those were my father's orders.

446
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,166
I had nothing to do with that.

447
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,500
And why did you
attack the merchants?

448
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,666
There are more important
things to be done.

449
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,916
But instead, you harmed
innocent people,

450
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,083
and then you ordered
your troops to kill Hak.

451
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,416
You don't care
about this kingdom at all!

452
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,916
[GANG TEA-JUN] Her eyes
are incinerating me.

453
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,291
Such rage.

454
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,583
I can't look away!

455
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,666
As for me, there's still
much I have to learn.

456
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,125
But I do know that I shouldn't
waste my time talking to you,

457
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,125
an unprincipled fool!

458
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,333
Princess!

459
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,458
[GANG TEA-JUN] I thought
I'd find that the princess

460
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,333
was a young, helpless girl.

461
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:58,416
But her crimson hair is a flame
that might burn me to ashes.

462
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,000
[YONA] Next time,
on Yona of the Dawn,

463
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,375
Episode 6:
"The Crimson Hair."
