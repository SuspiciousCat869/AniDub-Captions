00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,833
Su-won, it's you?

00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,583
Yona?

00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,208
[SU-WON] King Il is never
going to wake up again.

00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,750
I did what I had to do
for the greater good.

00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,541
[SU-WON]
Could I be seeing a ghost?

00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,500
You can't be.

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:29,208
I'm sorry, My Lord,
but Princess Yona is dead.

8
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:32,916
[SU-WON]
But I thought,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,791
you and Hak fell off a cliff
in the northern forest.

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,958
[SU-WON]
It's really you.

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,083
Princess Yona.

12
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,500
You're alive.

13
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,375
I'll hold your hand until
you fall asleep, okay?

14
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,916
It'll be just like what
your mother used to do.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,500
I'll wipe away your tears, too.

16
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:56,791
I'll do it so fast that no
one will notice you're crying.

17
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,541
Now go to sleep, and
wake up with a smile.

00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,375
Is Hak here with you?

21
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,625
[SU-WON] Never mind,
that's a silly question.

22
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:47,208
You're alive and well,
therefore he must be nearby.

23

He's a good man.

So steadfast in his devotion

25

that he would lay
down his life for you.

26
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,250
I've heard some rumors
about Awa's ruler, Keum-ji.

27
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,375
Apparently, he's become involved
in a bit of illegal commerce.

28
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,416
I came to Awa to investigate.

Oh! I'm sorry to
alarm you, General Ju-do.

You picked up a woman?

[laughs] There's no need
for you to be gauche, General.

There's nothing tawdry
going on, I swear.

[JU-DO] Your personal life
is none of my concern,

but this is not the proper
time to be flirting.

We're in town on serious
business, you hear me?

You can flirt on your own time!

Uh, General, you should
probably calm down.

You're right, we're
here on business.

Give us some time
to say our goodbyes

and I'll meet up
with you in a bit.

Have you had any luck
finding Yang Keum-ji?

[JU-DO]
Unfortunately, no.

56
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,291
We've been informed that he was
attacked by pirates last night

on the way to the Khai Empire.

He was headed there to close
a human trafficking deal.

[SU-WON]
I see.

What happened to the people
he was attempting to transport?

There were no casualties?

I'm glad to hear it.
Innocents should never suffer.

65
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,541
I'd heard rumors that
Keum-Ji was part

of a human trafficking ring,

We'll discuss that matter

glaive you've got there.

162
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,250
I wouldn't walk through
Awa with that thing.

163
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,875
You'll terrify the townspeople.

164
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,458
[HAK]
Yeah, I know.

165
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:22,375
I've been able to avoid carrying
it in town up until this point.

166
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:26,875
But it serves as my constant
reminder... to stay alert.

167
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,750
[JEAHA]
Man, this guy's a beast!

168
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,041
He was fighting all night

169
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,541
and he's already prepared
to go at it again.

170
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,291
I wish I knew who
was on his mind,

171
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,708
making him scowl like that.

172
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,625
There's a current of sorrow
under his bloodlust.

173
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,125
A sadness behind the rage.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,958
Uh.

175
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,541
Go, Ao.

176
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,666
I think your hair is
amazing. Breathtaking.

177
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,208
Blazing crimson. Just
like the blush of dawn.

178
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,791
So much has happened.

179
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,166
I'm not the same girl
I was before.

180
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:37,791
[HAK]
That's true.

181
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,041
[YONA gasping]

182
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,875
You scared me!

183
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,125
Why do you always have
to sneak up like that?

184
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,791
Just doing my job, that's all.

185
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,958
When I don't, like this
morning, you get into trouble.

186
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,541
I take my work very
seriously, Princess.

187
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,250
It's my duty to
stay close to you.

188
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,791
All you have to do
is yell if you need me.

189
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,833
[YONA]
Hak... I've decided.

190
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,416
I'm leaving Awa.

191
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,750
[YONA]
Come with me.

192
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,125
Anywhere.

193

[AO squeaks]

[YONA gasps]

195
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,291
How long have you
been hiding there?

196
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,291
Uh, we just got here.

197
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:31,000
Ya know, you should share that
kinda information with us, too.

198
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:31,916
[YONA]
Huh?

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
[YUN]
Don't play dumb with me!

200
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,916
You said you've decided
to leave town!

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,750
Don'tcha think that's something
you should tell all of us

202
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:37,791
and not just him?

203
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,625
I agree wholeheartedly.

204
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,041
We're here for you, Princess!

205
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,875
We'll gladly follow you.
Even to the ends of the Earth.

206
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,875
Why don'tcha get a head
start and we'll catch up?

207
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,458
Why, you!

208
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,916
Hey, Sinha, are you really gonna
let White Snake speak for you?

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,166
Stop calling me that!

210
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,583
[HAK] Y'know, your
special "dragon sense"...

211
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,625
[GIJA] Why do you enjoy
picking fights with me so much?

212
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,375
--You watch it, pal!
--[YONA] Listen up.

213
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,875
Friends, I'm leaving.

214
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,833
Will you please come with me?

215
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,000
[GIJA]
I shall accompany you.

216
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:06,666
[SINHA grunts]

217
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,833
[AO squeaks]

218
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,875
[YUN]
I'll think about it.

219
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,541
[YONA]
Hey!

220
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,375
[YONA laughing]

You're the cutest ever!

223
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,791
Let's get married!

224
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,083
No way! Stop buggin' me about
getting married, grandma!

225
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,791
[GIRL B]
Is he asleep? How adorable!

226
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,458
You play so beautifully.

227
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,916
You wanna try?

228
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,750
[strings squeaking]

229
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,666
You should probably just
stick to being a pirate.

230
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,291
[YONA] I know how to play
the harp and dance a little.

231
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,875
[JEAHA]
A harpist and a dancer, too? Hm.

232
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,666
What, you're gonna
make fun of me for that?

233
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,166
[JEAHA]
No, I'm not.

234
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,500
It's just that sometimes I
forget you're a girl, you know?

235
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,833
It's gotta be hard being
so small, clumsy, and weak.

236
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,166
Not to mention a total
pain in the neck.

237
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,750
That's not nice!

238
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,916
And to top it off, you came all
the way to Awa to hunt me down.

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,416
Talk about a nuisance.

240
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,958
[YONA]
Very well, then.

241
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,416
I'll let you get back to
playing your sad, lonely song.

242
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,916
See ya later.

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,958
[gasps]

244

[YONA]
You're so confusing, Jeaha.

245
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,291
[JEAHA] Why? I'm just a guy
who tells it like it is.

246
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,125
And I like to have
a lady by my side

247
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,416
on beautiful nights like this.

248
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,458
Enough, Jeaha, stop it.

249
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,333
You're gonna put us
all to sleep with that.

250
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,041
[JEAHA] Maybe you should
go to bed, then.

251
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,500
Most of Awa's been
asleep for hours.

252
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,541
Who needs sleep? When we've
still got lots more to drink.

253
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,208
Yeah, I'm not drunk at all.

254
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,166
Here's a lullaby.

Quit playin' that!
You're makin' us all tired!

256
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,166
So just go to sleep, then.

257
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,208
No, I'm not ready for bed yet!
I don't wanna... stop the party.

258
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,916
I have no desire to babysit
your drunk ass all night.

[MAYA] But if I go to sleep,
the dream'll be over.

260
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,541
What dream?

261
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,125
[MAYA]
Being a pirate.

262
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,708
When we wake up, the captain's
gonna disband the crew.

263
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,541
It'll be over.

Aw, c'mon, cheer up.

Sure, you guys might not
be pirates anymore,

266

but it's not the
end of the world.

267
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,291
You'll go back to
your fishing boats

268
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,708
and you'll forget all
about what happened--

00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,666
But you won't be there with us!

You're leaving us behind! You're
gonna follow Yona and her crew!

talk dirty to me.

Your sharp tongue gets me goin'.

I'd be a happy man if I could
find a woman like you.

50 years earlier.

like someone's jealous.

don't know. It may be.

Maybe not.

All I know is I
don't feel at ease

It's true. She may not
be very powerful,

299
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,125
but she has an inner strength
that carries her through danger.

300
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:14,125
It's compelling. I wanna care
for her and keep her safe.

I got really turned on when she
shot Yang Keum-ji in the heart.

It sounds odd, but I sort of
envied him in a weird way.

Ugh, I wish that you woulda
dropped dead beside him.

What you're supposed to say

00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,250
is that I'll always have
a home here waiting for me,

you're funny, do ya?

If that's what you
want me to say,

[GI-GANG] What kinda boy
just falls outta the sky?

315
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,041
You'll "be at my beck and
call" if I let you stay?

316
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,041
You stupid snot-nosed brat.

317
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,541
That's the lamest pick-up
line that I've ever heard.

318
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,125
[MAYA] I can't believe you're
really leavin' us. So sad.

319
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:18,125
You better come visit,
or I'll kill ya.

320
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,000
That really hurts!

321
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,333
[PIRATES laughing]

322
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,375
Um. Is something wrong?

323
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,958
I thought Jeaha'd be here.

324
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,875
I wanted to thank him for his
help and say a proper goodbye.

325
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,166
Who even cares about
that green-haired idiot?

326
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,583
I do! We wouldn't be here
if it weren't for him.

327
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,458
Well, he ain't here.

328
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,333
You'll just have to see him
when you come back to visit us.

329
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,833
I guess.

330
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,416
[GI-GANG] If you ever need
a ship, just let me know.

331
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,208
I'd be happy to
supply one for ya.

332
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,083
Thank you, Captain.

333
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,083
Your poor face still looks
a little swollen to me.

334
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,916
I'll be all right.

335
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,791
Oh, I see, so you think
you're a tough cookie now.

336
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,833
What, is that a bad thing?

337
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,750
No, but it ain't gonna
help you land a husband

338
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,000
unless you also know
how to cook and clean.

339
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,208
Bein' pretty ain't enough.

340
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,541
You're gonna have
to learn, child.

341
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,708
Otherwise, no one'll
wanna marry ya.

342
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,750
Especially if you're
too tough a cookie.

343
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,416
Why don'tcha mind
your own business?

344
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,375
I think she'll make
a decent wife,

345
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,083
as long as she's able
to find a husband

346
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,666
who's willing to do
all the housework

347
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,083
and lets her do
whatever she wants.

348
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,583
Nobody asked for your opinion!

349
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,791
Hey, Yona, marry a guy from Awa

350
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,083
and you won't have to do
much cookin', just grill fish.

351
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,541
Heck, we even like it raw!

352
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,208
Yeah, and if you
can't find a husband,

353
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,625
I'd be happy to do the job.

354
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,875
Keep dreamin', buddy!

355
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,291
[PIRATES laughing]

356
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,416
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and
laugh it up! I'm outta here.

357
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,291
Hey! Wait just a minute.

358
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,541
[YONA]
Uh.

359
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,416
[GI-GANG]
Take these with you.

360
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,750
Wow, Cheonsu Plants!
Thanks a lot!

361
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,750
But this is way too much.

362
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,583
Don't want'cha catchin'
a cold or nothin'.

363
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:56,250
Captain's actin' weird.
Like a mom or somethin'.

364
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,375
[YONA]
I can't thank you enough

365
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,666
for everything
you've done for us.

366
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,500
[ALL]
Take care!

367
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,333
[MAYA]
Come back and visit us!

368
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,875
[RO-WEN]
We'll miss you guys!

369
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,333
[YURI]
See ya later!

370
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,833
Yona?

371
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,666
[DOK] I can't believe
they're really gone.

372
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,541
[MAYA] Oh, well. I guess
it's time to go fishin'!

373
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,041
Wait a second,

374
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,041
you mean to tell me that girl
wasn't one of the pirates?

375
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,708
Makes sense, she was way
too cute to be one of 'em.

376
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,291
Think so? Yeah, she's cute,
but don't be fooled.

377
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,625
She's as dangerous as
any one of those pirates.

378
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,125
That girl took down Yang
Keum-ji with a single arrow.

379
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:53,958
[GIRLS]
Mh-hm.

380
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,208
[VILLAGER A]
What?

381
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,791
You mean she's the one
who killed Keum-ji?

382
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,583
Yeah, she's an
amazing young woman.

383
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,958
[VILLAGER B] Huh, so a
little lady took him down.

384
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,083
[VILLAGER C]
And she's not even a pirate.

385
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,166
[YONA crying]

386
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,416
[YUN]
Yona, you've gotta stop crying.

387
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,625
She won't stop if you
don't stop, ya baby.

388
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,583
You're crying a lot more than
anyone else, just so you know.

389
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,708
[GIJA]
Shut up.

390
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,958
[YONA]
I'm so sad that I left

391
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,500
without saying a proper
goodbye to Jeaha.

392
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,083
Uh. Hold on a sec.

393
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,166
Do you mean that he didn't end
up coming with us, after all?

394
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,541
[BOTH]
Huh?

395
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,666
[JEAHA yelping]

396
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,875
Jeaha!

397
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:35,666
Hey.

398
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,875
You came along.

399
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:40,166
He's been with us,
ever since we left Awa.

400
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,875
[JEAHA] Well, since I've got
nothing to do these days,

401
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,916
I thought it might be a good
idea to come with you

402
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,041
on your journey,
wherever it leads us.

403
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,250
And, you know,

404
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,666
we have such amazing chemistry,

405
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,083
it'd be a shame to
let it go to waste.

406
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,708
Then I saw you crying
over me, and well,

407
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,250
it was a turn on and I didn't
wanna ruin the moment.

408
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,416
Why do you always have
to be such a pervert?

409
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,541
I am more disturbed by
you now than ever before.

410
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,416
You said you didn't wanna
give up your freedom

411
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,291
for the Four Dragons
and their rules.

412
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,791
What happened?

413
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,250
I haven't changed my
mind about that, kiddo.

414
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,208
I'm still choosing my own path.

415
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,750
It just so happens
that it aligns

416
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,291
with the one that you're on.

417
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,958
I'm not betraying my
principles in any way.

418
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,500
Right now, I just wanna
be wherever you are.

419
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,375
Take me with you, Yona.

420
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,500
[JEAHA grunts]

421
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,000
You have got to be the most
self-absorbed person

422
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:37,875
I've ever met.

423
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,458
Yeah, no kidding.

424
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,208
You aren't the only one goin'
on this journey, so how 'bout,

425
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,125
you ask us for our
permission, too.

426
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:43,791
[SINHA]
Hm.

427
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,458
Yes, I agree.

428
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,041
Better make your case
if you want our blessing.

429
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,458
Well, go ahead.

430
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,500
Forgive my rudeness.

431
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,208
Allow me to start over.

432
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,250
My name is Jeaha.

433
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,375
I'm a handsome beast with the
dragon's power in my right leg.

434
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,416
It's nice to meet you.

435
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:38,375
[YONA] I'm sorry, Hak,
but when the rain stops,

436
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,500
I'm going to pick
up my sword again.

437
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,208
Next time on Yona of the Dawn,

438
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,791
Episode 24: "From Here On."
