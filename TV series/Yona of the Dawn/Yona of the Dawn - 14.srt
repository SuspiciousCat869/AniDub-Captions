[YONA] I'm sure the only
reason he came out of hiding

is because he was
worried about them.

I'll ask one more time.

163
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,458
Will you come with us?

164
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,250
We'd be honored to have you.

165
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,333
But...

166
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,458
Don't worry, I'm not scared of
your eyes turning me into stone.

167
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:33,333
That's just silly. If it were
true, Ao would be a tiny statue.

168
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,541
Just look how attached
the little guy is to you.

169
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,416
The way you look after him...

170
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,625
...it proves that
you're a good person.

171
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,666
[BLUE DRAGON gasps]

172
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,041
[BLUE DRAGON] She said if I go
with her, I can be myself.

173
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,000
No more fear, no more darkness.

174
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,833
All I have to do
is take her hand.

175
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,375
She's offering me so much.

176
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,416
Is it all right to trust her?

177
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,458
I finally feel as though...

178
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,000
...I have a friend.

179
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,166
Princess, think it's
time we get going.

180
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,416
[YONA]
Mm.

181
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,375
I hope we meet again someday!

182
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,541
[AO]
I'm so sorry.

183
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:38,833
It kills me to leave
you all alone.

184
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,875
Please, forgive me!

185
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,916
[BLUE DRAGON]
I forgive you.

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,875
I suppose I don't need
the bells anymore.

187
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,000
After all, I've found
friends who can see me

188
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,750
for who I truly am.

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,791
[BLUE DRAGON] Thank you for
everything you've done for me.

190
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,916
You'll always hold a
special place in my heart.

191
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,375
Okay. Do you know the
way to the next warrior?

192
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,875
Yeah. 'Course I do.

193
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,916
There should be a Dragon War--

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
[YONA gasps]

195
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,333
--[YONA] Gija!
--[YUN] Oh, no!

196
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,125
[YUN]
He was digging like a madman.

197
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,000
All that hard work must'a
completely wore him out.

198
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,416
Oh no.

199
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,375
Well, rest in peace,
White Snake.

200
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,000
[GIJA]
I'm still alive!

201
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,875
--[GIJA growling]
--We know. Calm down.

202
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,958
[sighs] I'm sorry
for passing out.

203
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,416
I don't know why
I feel so lethargic.

204
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,458
I'm having some trouble locating
the other Dragon Warriors.

205
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,291
There's no need
to push yourself.

206
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,541
So, with our White Dragon
out of commission,

207
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,958
what about our blue one?

208
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,750
Whoa, he's right here.

209
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,791
Yeah, he's been traveling with
us this whole time, dummy.

210
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,416
Blue Dragon, can you sense
where the other warriors are?

211
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,291
Judging by his face,

212
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,708
I'm not even positive he
speaks our language, Princess.

213
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,666
Ohh! I feel so bad for you!

214
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,000
But it's not your fault.

215
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,666
You had no one to
teach you the way.

216
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,166
But, from this day forward,
I shall serve as your teacher.

217
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,458
Believe me.

218
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,958
I'd be honored to
teach you the ways

219
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,958
of the Four Dragon Warriors.

220
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,000
In fact, why don't you just
call me "brother" from now on?

221
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,875
[GIJA]
Hey! Where you going?

222
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,125
Uh...

223
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,875
I think the "brother"
thing scared him off.

224
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,750
Blue Dragon!

225
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,625
[GIJA]
What's he doing?

226
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,000
Suicide?

227
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,000
Betcha feel guilty now, huh?

228
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,666
I mean, this is all your fault.

229
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,833
No, it can't be! Did I
really drive him to this?!

230
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,875
Oh, he came back up.

231
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,750
Oh, goodness. Is that for me?

232
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,750
So, you want me to eat it and
build strength, is that it?

233
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,958
Thank you, but next
time just say so, okay?

234
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,791
--[BLUE DRAGON shivering]
--[AO whinig]

235
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,000
You really oughta help
your brother, White Snake.

236
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,166
Just look how he's shivering.

237
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,208
How is that my fault?!

238
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,583
You feeling okay?

239
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,916
I don't get it,

240
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,625
how'd you know there was
a river here, Blue Dragon?

241
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,833
Whoa. Seriously?

242
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,958
You can see long distances?

243
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,125
Well, that's a cool power
to have, if you ask me.

244
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,708
I could think of a million
ways that be useful.

245
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,125
Is it true that if someone
looks into your eyes,

246
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,916
they'll be turned to stone?

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,375
If that's the case, then why're
you still wearing your mask?

248
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,791
You can take it off if you want.

249
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,916
[BLUE DRAGON sighs]

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,791
[YONA]
Don't worry about it right now.

251
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,125
How about we set up
camp and start a fire.

252
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,166
That'll warm you up and we
can cook the fish you caught.

253
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,791
[AO squeaks]

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,583
Wow, that looks good.

255
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,208
Way to go, Yun.

256
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,000
But where did you get
all the ingredients?

257
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,291
I traded them for medicines

258
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,333
while we were in the
Blue Dragon's village.

259
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,750
That's how I got the pot, too.

260
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,166
When'd you have time?

261
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,166
[YONA]
Oh no, Yun!

262
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,250
A bug dove right into the pot!

263
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,500
A bug?

264
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,958
Ah, well, it's just a
little added protein.

265
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,958
[YONA] The Blue Dragon's clothes
are taking forever to dry.

266
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,083
[YUN]
I wish they'd hurry....

267
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,625
...'cause he's kinda
freakin' me out.

268
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,500
[AO squeaks]

269
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,166
[HAK] That is one
creepy lookin' hairball.

270
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,541
[YUN]
Is it me, or does our group

271
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,250
seem to be getting
freakier by the minute?

272
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,833
[GIJA]
Shut up, Yun!

273
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,500
Don't you think the Blue Dragon
is embarrassed enough as is?

274
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,041
Imagine how humiliating
this must be for him.

275
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,833
Blue Dragon,

276
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,041
you'd better hurry and eat your
food before Ao eats it for you.

277
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,875
Do you like it?

278
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,833
You do, huh? I'm glad!

279
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,833
Thanks for the
wonderful meal, Yun.

280
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,375
It's no big deal.

281
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,791
[YONA]
You must be cold.

282
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,125
Would you like
to borrow my cape?

283
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,166
Yes. Thank you very much, Yona.

284
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,541
[ALL]
Yona?

285
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,333
He had the audacity to
thank the princess by name!

286
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,041
Yeah, like it was nothin'.

287
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,125
[YUN]
Hmm.

288
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,625
It's been a while since
anyone has called me that.

289
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,750
It's nice; I'd like to
call you by name, too.

290
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:13,833
Uhh...

291
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,625
I hate that you don't have one.

292
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,208
Can you think of a name
you'd like us to call you?

293
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,916
[BLUE DRAGON]
Mm...

294
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,791
[YONA]
He curled up into a ball.

295
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,625
[HAK] I say we call him,
"Hairball Monster."

296
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,666
[YONA]
Can I ask you something?

297
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,083
[YUN]
Yeah, what's up?

298
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,875
I'm having a hard time
coming up with a name

299
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,416
for the Blue Dragon
Warrior. Have any ideas?

300
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,625
[YUN]
Mm...

301
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,625
You could pick a word that
describes his personality.

302
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,041
You know, like... quiet.

303
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,333
That doesn't suit him.

304
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,750
[YUN] I dunno, Princess, just
pick whatever you think is best.

305
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,208
It's only fair that you name him
considering that you're the one

306
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,583
who pulled him from the
darkness into the light.

307
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,250
I'm sure he's got some
deep-seated psychological issues

308
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,166
that keep him from
taking his mask off.

309
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,166
It won't be easy to get him
to come out of his shell,

310
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,250
but if anyone can
do it, it's you.

311
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,583
Don't take this the wrong way,

312
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,125
but are you sure that
you're really a princess?

313
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,916
I thought they were supposed to
be girly and easily frightened.

314
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,208
You didn't even flinch

315
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,625
when the Blue Dragon
pointed his sword at you.

316
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,750
Of course I'm a princess, silly.

317
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,375
He's just not a
scary guy, you know?

318
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,333
Say what? He's as
scary as they come!

319
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,916
No way!

320
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,916
I've met people so terrifying
they made me tremble in fear.

321
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,541
Well, I've met
people so horrifying

322
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,875
that they took my
very breath away.

323
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,291
[YONA]
We're kind of pansies aren't we?

324
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,333
[YUN]
Mm.

325
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,833
[YUN]
I used to hate royals.

326
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,875
I thought they were all
devious, and corrupt.

327
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,208
And then I met you.

328
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,791
You know how I feel
about royalty.

329
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,791
They don't deserve our respect.

330
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,833
But that's not true
of all of you.

331
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,125
I'm really sorry.

332
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,416
I shouldn't have said that.

333
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,041
Have you felt guilty
about it all this time?

334
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:53,958
[YUN]
Uh.

335
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,458
Aw, you're so cute.

336
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,708
[YUN]
Uh?

337
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,250
Well, I'm going to go
get some water to drink.

338
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,541
[YUN]
One more thing.

339
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,583
[YONA gasps]

340
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,041
You mind if I call you
by your name, too?

341
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,875
You can say no.

342
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,500
It's just that "Princess"
feels way too formal.

343
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,666
Besides, I think your
name is much prettier.

344
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,416
[YONA]
You're adorable.

345
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,833
Why do you say that?

346
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,166
[YONA giggles]

347
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,416
[YUN sighs]

348
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,333
How long are you
gonna follow me?

349
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,458
Well, Hak?

350
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,458
[HAK]
Only for the rest of your life.

351
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,250
I tried to warn you
you'd be stuck with me

352
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,208
if you wandered into
that cave, remember?

353
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,666
But I thought that only
applied if I got hurt.

354
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,291
Which I did not.
So, you're off the hook.

355
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,916
[HAK]
Hey, hold on, Yona.

356
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,041
Uh.

357
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,208
Princess.

358
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,541
Yes, I'm your princess.
Please, call me that.

359
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,583
[HAK gasps]

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
[YONA] I don't expect
Yun and the others to

361
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,250
because I didn't meet
them as royalty.

362
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,958
I was just a normal
girl when we met.

363
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,750
But you're different, Hak.

364
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,000
I want you to call
me "Princess."

365
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,750
I want my father's
legacy to survive.

366
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,791
So please, don't ever forget
that I'm King Il's daughter.

367
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,375
Even if the whole
kingdom forgets,

368
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,041
at least I know...
you'll remember me and father.

369
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,333
Thanks to you, we'll live on.

370
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,916
When you were trapped
inside of that cave,

371
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,416
I called out for
your father to help.

372
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,291
I didn't know what else to do.

373
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,750
I begged him...
not to take you from me.

374
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,375
Believe me when I say,

375
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:03,291
I'm painfully aware that you're
the daughter of King Il.

376
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,791
[cries]

377
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,125
I will be sure to pass on
his legacy, Princess.

378
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,833
Not only his, but yours as well.

379
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
[AO squeaks]

380
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,541
[BLUE DRAGON]
Uh.

381
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,625
[BLUE DRAGON exhales]

382
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:54,958
[YONA]
What word do you think

383
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,583
best describes the
Blue Dragon Warrior?

384
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,500
Uh... "Nut job"?

385
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,125
Don't be rude, Hak.

386
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,708
Okay. "Nightfall."

387
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,208
"Nightfall."

388
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,250
That's not bad, actually.

389
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,000
But I don't know. It-It
seems too dark for him.

390
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:16,583
He's kind-hearted and warm.
A guiding light in the darkness.

391
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,250
But he doesn't shine
bright like the sun.

392
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,208
More like... Uh.

393
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,916
[YONA]
The moon.

394
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,000
[YONA]
Sinha.

395
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,833
Yes, I think that's
the perfect name for you.

396
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,750
It means "moonlight."

397
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,708
When I was lost in the
cave, you took my hand.

398
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,916
You were my guiding light in the
darkness, just like the moon.

399
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,250
Do you like it?

400
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,000
What's with him?

401
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,375
Can't you see? He's happy.

402
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,041
Hey, Ao, guess what happened?

403
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,541
Yona gave me a name.

404
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,958
When she said it, I thought
my heart was going to explode.

405
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,041
[YONA]
Sinha.

406
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,625
[SINHA]
She put so much thought into it.

407
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,208
[AO squeaks]

408
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,208
[SINHA]
I will treasure it forever.

409
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,125
Gija, are you
feeling any better?

410
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,166
[GIJA groans]

411
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,500
Something wrong?

412
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,833
It's him.

413
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:54,875
[YONA gasps]

414
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,708
The Green Dragon
Warrior is nearby.

415
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,208
[SU-WON]
General Geun-tea,

416
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,583
if you don't mind,

417
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,916
there's something that
I must ask of you.

418
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,958
Do you think I could trouble
you for a hot cup of tea?

419
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,416
Next time on Yona of the Dawn,

420
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,291
Episode 15: "To a New Land."
