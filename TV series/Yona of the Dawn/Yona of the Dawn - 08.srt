1
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,625
[IK-SU] If you don't mind,
I have a favor to ask of you.

2
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:23,125
When you leave, will
you take Yun with you?

3
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,375
[YONA]
Oh, wow!

4
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,875
[giggling]

5
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,125
Did you make this
all by yourself, Yun?

6
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,416
Uh, yeah. I had extra fabric.

7
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,125
Mind you, it's not silk or
anything fancy like that.

8
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,083
But whatever, it's not
like it's a big deal.

9
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,041
It's so unusual. I adore it!

10
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,791
I guess that's a good thing?

11
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,291
Hey, you have anything
to cut with around here?

12
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,625
[YONA gasps]

13
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,875
[YUN]
Hm?

14
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,375
My hair needs a trim.

15
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,125
[YUN]
Don't use that!

16
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,166
Oh, man. What a pain.

17
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,250
Princesses are so
high maintenance.

18
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,375
You really can
do anything, huh?

19
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,041
Only 'cause I live with
that pain of an oracle.

20
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,208
I had to learn about medicine
because he's so accident prone.

21
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,708
I am a great cook.

22
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,625
But, that came as naturally
as my extremely good looks.

23
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,458
No one asked about that.

24
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,041
You know... I like you.

25
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,083
[YUN]
Heh?

26
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,000
You take good care of Ik-su.

27
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,416
And now here you are
giving me a haircut,

28
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,708
even though you said
you hated royalty.

29
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, Just so you
know, it ain't free.

30
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,000
The haircut, the medicine,
plus your room and board.

31
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,875
[YONA]
Oh, uh...

32
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,333
Mun-deok would be happy to pay!

33
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,416
Mun-deok, who? Y'mean the
Wind Clan's great war hero?

34
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,250
I didn't know
that he was a hero.

35
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,125
You dummy! The man
is a living legend.

36
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,750
He was as decorated as Yuhon

37
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,625
but more admired
throughout the kingdom!

38
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,083
Wow, seriously?

39
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,625
That's not the Mun-deok I know.

40
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,625
He's always been like
a sweet old grandpa to me.

41
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,041
A "grandpa"?

42
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,833
'Kay, you're all done.

43
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,083
Thanks a lot!

44
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,208
I'm convinced there's
nothing you can't do!

45
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,833
Well, I am a
genius, you know.

46
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,250
If I read a book once,
I can memorize it.

47
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,791
No way.

48
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,333
[YUN]
But, I've only read a few books.

49
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,500
I don't have access to more.

50
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,041
I know there are tons
of them out there

51
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,708
I could be reading right now.

52
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,041
It's frustrating.

53
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,791
You wanna find them?

54
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,333
[YUN]
Of course I do.

55
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,166
Listen, Yun.

56
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,291
But, it's no big deal, really.

57
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,958
I can always collect
more one at a time.

58
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,666
I guess for now, though,
this will tide me over.

59
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,916
Oh, what book is that?

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,541
Ik-su saw somebody
throw it away,

61
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,083
so he went and fished it
out of the garbage for me.

62
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,500
--[IK-SU screaming]
--[YUN] Then, like he does,

63
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,916
he tripped over
nothing and tore it.

64
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,291
He's alarmingly clumsy!

65
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,916
He's a major klutz!

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,541
I know the silly god talk
makes him sound weird,

67
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,750
but I know him better
than anybody else.

68
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,875
He's the type who
just can't... lie.

69
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,416
Okay, so, if you're gonna
head off on a journey,

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,875
you should pro'lly get going.

71
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:33,208
I mean, I'm way too busy
to keep taking care of you.

72
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:35,875
[chuckles]

73
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,083
[YONA]
Ik-su.

74
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,208
Uh. Princess.

75
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,166
That dress is quite beautiful.
Especially so on you!

76
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,500
[YONA giggles]

77
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,250
Yun made that for you?

78
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,416
That boy has so many
different talents!

79
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,666
He does.

80
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,125
So, did you ask him to go along
on your journey with you?

81
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:06,041
I gotta say. You remind
me a lot of Father.

82
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,125
What? I remind you of King Il?

83
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,250
Mh-hm.

84
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,458
No, I don't deserve such praise!

85
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:15,166
[YONA] You're clumsy, a cry
baby, and optimistic to a fault.

86
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,625
But still, I think you're sweet.

87
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,375
[YONA]
You know, Ik-su...

88
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,791
[IK-SU] 
Yes?

89
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,750
[YONA]
In spite of his harsh tongue,

90
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,458
Yun really does
love you very much.

91
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,000
I couldn't bear the thought of
breaking up a family like yours.

92
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,416
I think it's better
for Yun to stay here.

93
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry, but I can't
comply with your request.

94
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,291
[YUN]
What request?

95
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,625
I can understand why you
want him to accompany us

96
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,458
on our journey...
if that's what he wants.

97
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,875
But, I just don't see how it's
even an option if he doesn't.

98
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,666
I understand.

99
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,750
I'm sorry. He really
should hear it from me.

[gasps]

104
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,750
[IK-SU]
Oh, hey Yun.

105
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,708
Your timing is perfect.
I was just talking-- 

106
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,583
[yelps]

107
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,250
Wanna tell me what
that was about?

108
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,166
Are you tryin' to get rid of me?

109
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,750
You want me to pack up
and go with them, huh?

110
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:31,458
Please, Yun. That's best.
I'll be okay.

111
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,583
The princess and Hak need
your help more than I do.

112
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,125
I'm not going with them,
and you can't force me to!

113
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:43,458
Listen, you're the kind of
person who should see the world.

114
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,375
You shouldn't be isolated.

115
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,000
But Ik-su...

116

[sighs]

117
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,250
And anyway, I can get along
without you, no problem!

118
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,291
[YUN grunts]

119
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,083
Ugh, I can't believe him!
What an inconsiderate jerk!

[whimpering]

121

Hey, Yun! Look what I found!
It's a medical book!

122
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,208
You shouldn't be isolated.

123
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Caught some fish.
Lemme cook 'em.

124
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,208
How can you move around
that well already?

125
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,625
I heal really fast.
I have to stay alive.

126

Have to be invincible
to protect the princess.

127
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,416
Why do it? Seems stupid to put
your life on the line for her.

128
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,000
She couldn't do the same
if things were reversed.

What's in it for you?

Don't you make sacrifices
every day for someone you love?

131
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,333
You want to protect him,

132
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,708
and you take risks to
do that no matter what.

There aren't even bugs in the

I'll have to steal food.
I have no choice.

The last time I tried this
I almost got myself killed.

smarter. Try harder.

Ugh, you're such a pain!

317
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,000
Hold on, I'll go
get the ointments.

318
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,291
I know you're right,
Ik-su, but still.

319
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,000
Who's gonna protect you?

320
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,083
There you are.

321
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,416
[YUN gasps]

322
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,208
Take these.

323
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,625
Your sandals were worn out,
so I made you some new ones.

324
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,291
All these years and
you're still so bad at it!

325
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,000
[IK-SU] Aw, c'mon,
I think my weavings gotten

326
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,416
a lot better than it used to be.

327
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,416
What about you?

328
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,750
[IK-SU]
Huh?

329
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,250
[YUN] Yours look even
worse than mine do.

330
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,333
[IK-SU]
Oh.

331
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,458
Just give me a second.

332
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,875
I'll be right back.

333
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,083
You're amazing.

334
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,916
Really, Yun. It's incredible.

335
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,000
All done.

336
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,666
Thank you.

337
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,458
[IK-SU chuckles]

338
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,833
[IK-SU]
They're perfect!

339
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,583
Hey! Check me out!

340
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,083
[IK-SU laughing]

341
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,458
[BOTH yelp]

342
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,458
[IK-SU]
I didn't fall down.

343
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,583
Ha. I didn't fall down!

344
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,166
I'm gonna be all
right on my own.

345
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Ik-su, you know,

346
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:52,000
I called the princess ignorant
for not knowing certain things.

347
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,875
But all I have is book smarts.

348
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,166
I don't know anything
about the real world.

349
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,208
Man...

350
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,291
That's embarrassing,
don't you think?

351
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,958
Oh, Yun.

352
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,666
[YUN]
Listen, Ik-su.

353
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,458
You might not know this,

354
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,458
but your words have always
been absolute truth to me.

355
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,291
So at the end of the day,

356
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,708
if you tell me you want
me to go with them,

357
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,416
that's what I'm gonna do.

358
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,083
It might be my fate!

359
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,833
I mean, who am I to argue
with the gods about it?

360
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,833
It's not like you need me.
You even said yourself

361
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,625
that you would do just
fine all alone out here.

362
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,708
Our words have power.
They can manifest truth.

363
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,708
If you repeat things,
sometimes they become real.

364
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:43,291
So, I thought, if I kept telling
myself I'd be fine without you,

365
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,708
it would somehow
become the truth.

366
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,041
But no. It's not.

367
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,833
I'm not okay.

368
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:56,416
I'm so lonely. You haven't
even left, and I'm a wreck.

369
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,666
Don't be a pain! This isn't
gonna be good-bye forever.

370
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,750
[IK-SU crying]

371
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,791
So, have ya made a decision yet?

372
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,833
Yes. You're on board with
the idea, too, aren't you?

373
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,750
Long as he's not as much of a
burden as someone else I know.

374
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,208
And who would that be, exactly?

375
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,708
Oh, I dunno.

376
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,333
Okay. Sure you're all right?

377
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,708
Shouldn't I be the
one asking you that?

378
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,958
Hey, Yun, what's with
that giant bag you've got?

379
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,666
If it's books, leave 'em behind.
They're too heavy to carry.

380
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,958
I'm not bringing books.

381
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,458
Then, what are you
bringing? Lemme see it.

382
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,458
This bag here's
for the princess.

383
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,500
We can hide her in it if we see
Su-won's soldier's patrolling.

384
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,125
Don't know if I like that.

385
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,291
[IK-SU]
Hmph.

386
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:05,208
I've prepared for a few other
emergencies, too. Wanna see?

387
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,166
That's okay, we trust you.
We don't have all day.

388
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,291
Huh?

389
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,750
Thank you for having us.

390
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,125
Goodbye. I'll miss you, Ik-su.

391
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,458
I'll be praying for your
safety as you travel.

392
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,250
Hey, you're the one who
said you wanted to see

393
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,500
what I was bringing,
so don't leave me!

394
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,041
Have a safe trip.

395
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,875
[YUN] Come on, we need
to get a move on.

396
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,291
We got three giant
mountains to climb

397
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,125
before it gets dark tonight.

398
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,250
Okay.

399
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,500
Oh, so you think
you're in charge now?

400
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,916
Well, it would make
sense, wouldn't it?

401
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,875
I am qualified,
as a beautiful genius.

402
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,458
Whatever you say.

403
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,250
[YONA] I'm sorry, Father,
but in order to survive,

404
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,708
I must learn to take a life.
I must learn to kill.

405
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,083
Next time, on Yona of the Dawn,

406
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:46,500
Episode 9:
"Wavering Determination."
