00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,000
[HAK]
Do you wanna rest here?

3
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,666
[HAK] I've known the
princess a long time.

4
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,708
She's never been
outside the castle.

5
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,750
Never had to live like this.

6
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,000
[MUN-DEOK]
You little brat.

7
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,916
Why weren't you at
the Generals' meeting?

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,291
I told you I wanted you to
attend at my side.

9
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,666
Lord Mun-deok.

10
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,208
You're the only one from the
Wind Clan who has to go.

11
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,958
Besides, I can't
be bothered to listen

12
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,833
to His Chubbiness
prattle on and on.

13
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,125
[MUN-DEOK] You're an idiot!

14
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,916
Don't call me Lord
Mun-deok! Call me Grandpa!

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,166
Don't yell at me!

16
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,250
We're not even related
by blood, why should I?

17
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,208
[MUN-DEOK] Who cares
about a blood relation?

18
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,708
I love you like my own grandson,
and that's what matters!

19
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,666
[IL] Now, now, calm down.

20
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,000
I hate to see two of my
favorite people fighting.

21
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,333
With your strength, you could
leave the castle in ruins.

22
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,250
[MUN-DEOK]
My sincere apologies, King Il.

23
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,250
[IL] There's no need
for that, Mun-deok.

24
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,291
[HAK] Oh crap, I called
the king "His Chubbiness."

25
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,208
It's been a while
since I've seen you.

26
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,625
When you were a child,

27
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,916
you were here all the time
playing with the princess.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,166
Well, commoners aren't supposed
to wander into the castle.

29
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,166
I won't hear such nonsense.

30
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,083
I know Yona has been
lonely without you around.

31
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,333
[chuckles]

32
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,083
That's not true,
Your Chubbiness!

33
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,833
"Your Chubbiness"?

34
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,208
[MUN-DEOK] How dare you speak
that way to your king?

35
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,833
[IL] Please refrain
from using violence!

36
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,041
[MUN-DEOK]
Forgive me, Your Highness.

37
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,416
Hak's honest.

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,125
That's one of the qualities
I've treasured in him

39
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,833
ever since he was a little boy.

40
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,666
Here, since you
think I'm chubby.

41
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,041
Now then, my boy.

42
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,666
Why don't you stay permanently?

43
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,041
Yona could use a
personal bodyguard.

44
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,750
Thank you, sir.

45
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,666
But just thinking
about becoming a nobleman

46
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,375
gives me a splitting headache.

47
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,250
Then I'd have to give up my
daily afternoon naps at home.

48
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,250
I'm sorry, but that's
a deal-breaker for me.

49
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,791
Hold on...

50
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,291
[HAK] Besides, I don't agree
with your stance on weapons.

51
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,666
Good luck.

52
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,666
It'll be hard to find a
bodyguard for the princess.

53
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,583
How's anyone supposed to protect
her if they can't be armed?

54
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,291
I see.

55
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,708
[HAK] Why even ask me?

56
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,458
I have no interest
in dealing with royalty.

57
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,125
I don't want to be any
part of the intrigue

58
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,291
or the backstabbing deception.

59
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,125
And poor, ol' King Il
is utterly clueless.

60
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,166
Not to mention, if I was
at the castle every day,

61
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,250
I'd be forced to deal with--

62
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,291
[YONA] Hak!

63
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,708
[YONA]
Hide me, quick!

64
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,208
[HAK] Whenever the
princess is around...

65
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,958
...she throws me off my game.

66
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,208
[GANG TEA-JUN] Princess Yona!

67
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,041
Did I scare you off?

68
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,500
Where did you go?

69
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,750
Are you playing pranks
on that poor guy?

70
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,000
Because if you are,
I don't wanna get involved.

71
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,833
No, It's not a prank!

72
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,166
[HAK] He was hitting on you?

73
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,500
[raucous laughter]

74
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,708
Hey!
Stop laughing, it's true!

75
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,750
That creep's name
is Gong Tea-Jun.

76
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,708
He's trying to court me and
won't take no for an answer.

77
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,541
He's boorish,
rude, and annoying.

78
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,916
What?

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,208
You're not interested in
the Fire Clan leader's son?

80
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,083
No way, he's insufferable.

81
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,875
Well, then tell him you
have feelings for someone else.

82
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,375
'Cause your heart
belongs to Su-Won

83
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,083
and all other guys pale
in comparison, right?

84
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:21,083
Yeah, but it's unrequited.
And if I put that out there,

85
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,458
I know it's gonna get
back to Su-won somehow.

86
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,500
None of this is
my problem, y'know.

87
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,875
This isn't easy for
me to talk about, y'know!

88
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,875
[HAK] This is precisely
why I hate coming here.

89
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,250
Why don't you
just play nice

90
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,875
'til he leaves and stop
complaining to me about it?

91
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,083
You jerk.
You're so mean.

92
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:43,041
Su-won would never even
think of being so cold to me.

93
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,041
Fine, then!

94
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,583
Why don't you go
hide behind Su-won

95
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,541
and ask him for dating advice?

96
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,833
[HAK sighs]

97
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,166
When are we gonna
start heading home, Mun-deok?

98
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,666
I'm sick of this place.

99
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,708
You are so
irritated all the time.

100
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,750
And I've told you,
call me Grandpa.

101
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,166
[HAK] I am not
irritated all the time.

102
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,750
You are, and don't deny it.

103
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,125
[HAK] Princess Yona.

104
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,833
What are you doing here?

105
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,250
I wanted to apologize, Hak.

106
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,458
You got irritated because
I was acting helpless, right?

107
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,500
I'm the princess
of this kingdom.

108
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,208
I should start
behaving like one.

109
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,708
So, instead of hiding
from my troubles,

110
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,375
I'm going to face them head-on.

111
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,041
Thanks again! Bye!

112
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,625
Wait! Princess?

113
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,166
[YONA]
Those are my present to you.

114
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,291
A bribe to still be my friend.

115
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,625
[HAK] She's too much.

116
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,291
Which is exactly why I
want nothing to do with her.

117
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,666
[MALE GUARD 3A]
If this keeps up,

118
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,333
the clans will
continue to gain power

119
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,000
while the king slowly
but surely loses all of his.

120
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,666
[MALE GUARD 3B]
And what's wrong with that?

121
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,750
Why should we leave our kingdom
to such a cowardly monarch?

122
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,916
[HAK] Seems like everyone is
talking about him.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,958
But considering the way
he rules, I can't blame them.

124
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,500
If I succeed grandpa

125
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,500
and become general
of the Wind Clan,

126
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,541
I'll be nothing but
the royal family's servant.

127
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,291
My boy, why don't
you stay permanently?

128
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,458
Yona could use a
personal bodyguard.

129
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,458
[HAK] I'm not sure that
would be the best idea, King Il.

130
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,291
No way.

131
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,333
[YONA] That's enough!

132
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,250
I'm not taking you to my
private palace, so stop asking!

133
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,958
[GANG TEA-JUN]
Come on, don't be a prude.

134
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,041
I just want to
spend time alone with you.

135
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,958
Let go of me!

136
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,250
[HAK] So annoying.

137
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,166
If only Su-won were here.

138
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,541
Somebody should stop him!

139
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,208
But that's General Gang's son,

140
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,416
and the last thing we
want to do is make him angry.

141
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,125
Then go find the king
and let him deal with it!

142
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,541
[HAK] As far as I'm concerned,

143
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,250
noblemen are
nothing but trouble.

144
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,791
I've gotta stay out of it,
I can't get involved.

145
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,166
Otherwise, I'll spend the
rest of my life serving them.

146
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,500
I'll lose my freedom.

147
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,250
You're hurting me!

148
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,208
[GANG TEA-JUN]
You're really cute, y'know that?

149
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,250
You fight like a little kitten,
and it makes me want to pet you.

150
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,875
Now, stop resisting and give in
to temptation, Princess.

151
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,750
No! Please, just leave me alone!

[HAK] All right,
you heard the lady.

153
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,875
Leave her alone, or else!

What?
Who the hell are you?

How dare you touch
the princess like that?

158
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,291
You're one to talk.

159
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,916
Who gave you permission
to lay your filthy hands

160
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,958
on my princess like you own her?

161
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,083
[GANG TEA-JUN]
Your princess?

162
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,041
[YONA] Whose princess?

163
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,125
No!

164
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,125
Do you expect me
to believe this crap?

165
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,875
You can believe
whatever you want.

166
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,833
But the two of us made
a commitment to one another

167
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,041
many years ago and
it's still going strong.

168
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,541
Right? Tell him, my dear.

169
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,125
Oh, come now.
You don't have to act so shy.

170
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,250
[laughs nervously]

171
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,041
Stop it, Hak, we're in public!

172
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,458
Princess!

173
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,541
Are you saying
you like this commoner?

174
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,583
Yes.

175
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,208
In fact, well...

176
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,750
I love him!

177
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,416
I won't accept it!

178
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,416
There's no way that you could
prefer this cretin over me!

179
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,666
I am Gang Tea-Jun,

180
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,375
son of the
leader of the Fire Clan.

181
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,916
Who the hell are you?

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,583
What makes you think
you deserve her more than me?

183
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,083
[HAK] You're talking to the
next general of the Wind Clan.

184
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,583
I'm Son Hak.

185
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,166
Maybe you've heard of me?

186
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,541
I was personally appointed by
the king to guard the princess.

187
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,250
You still got a problem?

188
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,583
Then show me
what you're made of,

189
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,250
you insolent fool!

190
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,875
Your Majesty!

191
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,250
Don't resort to violence.

192
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,125
Please, forgive me!

193
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,083
Sure! It's quite all right!

194
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,000
[chuckles]

195
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,333
I had no idea
the two of you

196
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,083
felt that way
about one another!

197
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:26,958
[BOTH gasp]

198
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,708
No! It's not like that, Father!

199
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,833
Here's the thing.

200
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,208
I said that so
he'd leave her alone.

201
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,750
Well...

202
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:37,041
I'm so glad you've decided to
stay on as Yona's bodyguard!

203
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,000
I always knew I could rely
on you to be there for us.

204
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,958
I come at a price.
Not cheap.

205
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,625
Son Hak.

206
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,625
Please guard her with your life.

207
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,625
I will.

208
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,041
[HAK] That's it, then.

209
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,583
I guess it's my lot
to watch over those two.

210
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,791
[HAK] It looks like the
king's not the coward

211
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,750
everyone thinks he is.

212
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,333
[HAK] King Il.

213
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,541
Are you out there somewhere,
watching over us?

214
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,000
[HAK] I promise to
protect your daughter.

215
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,208
Forever.

216
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,708
[IL sobbing]

217
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,916
[YONA] Please don't cry, Father.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,875
Even though mother is
gone now, I'll always be here.

219
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,166
And Su-won will
be with us, also.

220
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,958
We'll be okay.

221
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,625
If we take care of each other,
we'll be all right.

222
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,166
[SU-WON] Yona!

223
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,541
Look at the snow!

224
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,125
Isn't it pretty?

225
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,166
Yeah.

226
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,541
I made a snowball
just for you!.

227
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,166
Look, I made you
this weird monster thingy!

228
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,000
Yona?

229
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,708
I'm fine, really!

230
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,458
If I stay happy,
Father won't cry

231
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,750
and everything
will go back to normal!

232
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,125
Ngh... You're so heavy!

233
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,000
Yay! Hak's here!

234
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,583
You should watch where you're
stepping next time, Princess.

235
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,875
And I was in such
a good mood today, too.

236
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,125
Why are you laying
in the snow, anyway?

237
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,458
I'm leaving my mark
so everybody who passes

238
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,625
knows that I've been here.

239
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,958
--Huh?
--Huh?

240
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,916
Aw c'mon, whenever the
ground is covered in snow,

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,500
you know you have to
lay down in it

242
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,166
with your arms and legs
stretched out.

243
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,666
It's human nature--

244
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,541
You were just begging
for a snowball to the face!

245
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,666
[HAK] Oh?

246
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,875
[yelling]

247
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,041
Way to go, Hak!

248
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,333
Yona's back to
her normal self again!

249
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,666
It was fun while it lasted,
but this makes me sad.

250
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,500
Yeah.
Hate that she's sick.

251
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,875
I guess it was too cold for her.

252
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,375
[SU-WON]
We're really sorry, Yona.

253
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,958
She'll be fine with
medicine and plenty of rest.

254
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,500
Just give her some time.

255
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,500
[YONA]
Nurse, where's my father?

256
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,708
The king is very
busy working right now.

257
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,083
He'll come by to visit you
as soon as he can.

258
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,375
[SU-WON]
It's gonna be okay, promise.

259
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,958
Yeah, don't you worry.

260
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,625
When the king hears you're sick,
he'll come running to see ya.

261
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,708
[YONA] You guys should leave
before you catch what I have.

262
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,166
I don't want you
to get sick, too.

263
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,833
We'll be fine.
We boys are tough.

264
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,916
In fact...
I'm feeling nice and warm!

265
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,625
Yeah, I feel
great from playing.

266
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,250
I can still see snowballs
flying by my face!

267
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,083
Nurse, come quick!
You have two more patients!

268
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,833
[HAK] I guess those snowballs
were hallucinations

269
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,625
'cause of my high fever.

270
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,541
[YONA]
How come you're still here?

271
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,083
Don't you guys need to go home?

272
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,416
[SU-WON] They said
it'd be better for us

273
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,416
to stay here with you

274
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,125
so we don't get
anybody else sick.

275
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,458
It's okay.

276
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,708
Since I've been holding
your hand while you sleep,

277
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,416
it's the same as before,
only Hak's here, too.

278
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,625
You guys are holding each
other's hands at night?

279
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,166
That's gross, I'm out of here!

280
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,333
[SU-WON] Wait!

281
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,916
Don't leave,
we can all hold hands now!

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Ew, no!

283
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:02,541
Grandpa?

284
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,875
You twerp!

285
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,291
How dare you throw snowballs
at the poor princess

286
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,833
and give her a nasty cold?

287
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,208
But what else
am I supposed to do

288
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,541
when the ground is
covered in snow like this?

289
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,958
[MUN-DEOK] Turn around!

290
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,750
You've earned a whipping, boy!

291
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,000
General!
Don't even try it!

292
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,958
He's too sick for that!

293
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,750
Now I'm definitely staying.

294
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,291
If I go home, I'm dead.

295
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,250
Hold on.

296
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,583
Was that Mun-deok?

297
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,291
As in the leader
of the Wind Clan?

298
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, what about him?

299
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,333
He's my hero!

300
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,291
Seriously, he's so cool!

301
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,041
I had no idea
he was your grandpa!

302
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,708
Well, he adopted me.

303
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,708
So he isn't really
my grandpa or anything.

304
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,458
Oh, I didn't know that.

305
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:46,083
I'm just an orphan
he decided to take in.

306
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,958
But Hak...
Mun-deok cares about you.

307
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,208
He came to see you
'cause you're sick.

308
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,750
I don't know.

309
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,875
[YONA]
Sounds like someone's coming.

310
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh!

311
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,125
Hi, Father!
What are you doing here?

312
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,041
What, am I not
allowed to visit my son

313
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,625
when he's not feeling well?

314
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,041
But if you get too close,

315
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,083
then you're
gonna get sick, too.

316
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,583
Would your cold end me?

317
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,708
Am I so weak?

318
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,458
No! It's just...

319
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,083
You're busy and
you need to stay healthy.

320
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,458
[YONA] Uncle Yuhon scares me.

321
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,958
He's so big and strong.

322
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,958
Not sweet or gentle like Su-won.

323
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,583
Destroy this illness
as quickly as possible.

324
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,625
'Kay!

325
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,833
He's intense and ferocious.

326
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,333
I think his presence
scared my fever away.

327
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,541
Why's he so scary?

328
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,250
Today is the best
day of my entire life!

329
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,333
All right!

330
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,166
Time to destroy
this illness with sleep!

331
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,125
[HAK] Be quiet, you idiot.

332
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,041
[YONA] Father.

333
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,458
[YONA] You know I'm sick.

334
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,041
Why won't you come see me?

335
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,625
Please don't leave me
here all alone.

336
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,416
[MAID 3B] Princess,

337
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,166
will you please
just take one bite?

338
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,041
I don't want any.

339
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,458
Yona, you have
to eat something.

340
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,916
If you don't eat,
you're gonna get even uglier.

341
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,791
[MALE GUARD 3C] Has the king
still not come to see her?

342
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,125
[MAID 3B] No.

343
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,541
I even told him she
was asking when he'd visit.

344
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,583
[MALE GUARD 3C]
Well, I'm not surprised.

345
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,791
I'll bet he hasn't visited her

346
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,666
because he's afraid
of catching her illness.

347
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,166
We can hear you!

348
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,125
[HAK]
Your father's still the king.

349
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,625
It's noble that he's doing
his job while you're sick.

350
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,375
It's incredibly brave of him.

351
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,791
You should be proud.

352
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,375
[YONA] Oh, Father.

353
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,125
I know I'm not alone.

354
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,250
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,958
[stomach growling]

356
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,916
Wow, that sounded
like a monster!

357
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,833
Ow!

358
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,583
Yona.

359
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,125
Are you finally hungry?

360
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,041
I'll ask them to
bring you some food, okay?

361
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,458
[bell ringing]

362
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,291
[YONA] Chicken porridge!

363
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,083
[YONA] That's the yuckiest
thing I've ever tasted!

364
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,416
It's that bad?

365
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,583
I'm sorry, dear.

366
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,375
Hi, Father!

367
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,458
[IL] I thought it tasted
a little funny, too.

368
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,541
I felt bad for
not visiting you,

369
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,041
so I made chicken porridge

370
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,625
because I know
it's your favorite.

371
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,958
I followed the recipe, but I
guess I'm not much of a cook.

372
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,125
What's this?

373
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,500
But I thought
it didn't taste good.

374
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,500
It's awful, Father!

375
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,208
[YONA] Aw, man!
We're all better.

376
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,291
[HAK] Why is that
a bad thing, Princess?

377
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,333
[YONA] It's not bad!

378
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,041
[SU-WON]
Well, I'm disappointed.

379
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,541
Because you can't sleep
next to the princess anymore?

380
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:50,375
No, I can sleep next
to Yona anytime I want.

381
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,666
I have so much
fun with you two.

382
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,916
It may sound weird,

383
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,875
but I wish we could
be sick in bed forever.

384
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,166
Me, too.

385
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,291
But we don't have to
be sick to see each other.

386
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,250
We'll always be friends, right?

387
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,125
[SU-WON] Of course we will.

388
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,916
[YONA]
Hey guys? I know!

389
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,375
Come over and play
again tomorrow!

390
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,291
And every day after that,
forever and ever.

391
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,958
[YONA]
Hey. Where'd everybody go?

392
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,208
[YONA] Ah, there you are!

393
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,541
Father!

394
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,583
[YONA] No... Su-won.

395
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:42,708
[YONA] Hak...

396
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, sorry.

397
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,041
I just went to
get you some water.

398
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,666
[YONA sobbing]

399
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,583
[YONA] It's gone.

400
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,958
The sky we watched
together that day.

401
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,791
I'll never see it again.

402
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,125
[HAK] You should at least
try to eat something.

403
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,791
Food is getting scarce.

404
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,500
I might not be able
to get more anytime soon.

405
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,458
[HAK] She seems
to be getting weaker,

406
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,333
and not just physically.

407
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,791
The reality of the situation
is taking a toll on her mind.

408
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,916
[YONA screams]

409
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,916
[YONA]
These things, what are they?

410
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,416
Just leeches.
Totally harmless.

411
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,291
They live in ponds and swamps
and they feed on blood.

412
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,583
[YONA] Blood?

413
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,666
I got 'em.
You're gonna be okay, Princess.

414
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,500
[HAK] Sorry!
I'll leave your clothes here.

415
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,666
Get dressed and
meet me by the fire.

416
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,291
[HAK] How long is
she gonna be like this?

417
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,833
She won't eat and she
only moves when I lead her.

418
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,083
It's like she's a doll.

419
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,833
As if the pain has
stolen her very humanity.

420
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,208
I barely recognize her.

421
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,416
Is this what you wanted, Su-won?

422
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,250
To destroy the person who
loved you most in the world?

423
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,083
You've shattered every good
memory the three of us shared.

424
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,833
Are you satisfied
with what you've done?

425
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,041
[HAK] What's this?

426
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,791
[HAK]
She's still got this thing.

427
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,666
Let's bed down
here for the night.

428
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,625
[HAK] Hey, what's the matter?

429
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,541
You seem like you've
lost something.

430
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,000
[YONA] I don't want it.
That gift from him...

431
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,583
I swear I don't want it.

432
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,583
I think your hair is amazing.

433
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,125
Blazing crimson,
just like the blush of dawn.

434
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,083
What is it?

435
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,333
Oh, nothing.
I'll be right back.

436
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,791
[snake hissing]

437
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,125
[SU-WON]
All that concerns you is that

438
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,500
the Su-won you once knew
doesn't exist anymore.

439
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,916
As king, I will strike down
anyone who gets in my way.

440
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,958
Are you all right?

441
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,000
What are you
doing way out here?

442
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,291
Do you have a death wish?

443
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,666
[HAK] Dammit!
This must be their nest!

444
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:47,458
[HAK] Ha! That won't stop me!

445
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,625
[YONA] Hak!

446
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,375
[HAK] Don't talk,
just hold on tightly.

447
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,541
Don't let go of me!

448
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,416
I want you to think
of me as your tool.

449
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,125
Use me to survive, Princess.
I'll keep you safe.

450
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,583
I made that promise
to your father years ago.

451
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,708
Oh, Hak. I'm sorry.

452
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,000
You risked both
our lives for this?

453
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,791
I will keep you
safe no matter what.

454
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,625
I'll do what I must.

455
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,958
But you have to let me help you.

456
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,583
[HAK] She walked off
to find that thing.

457
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,458
It's the first time
she's moved on her own

458
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,208
since we left the castle.

459
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,166
If that hairpin is all
that's keeping her going,

460
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,583
I'll keep it safe, too.

461
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,125
Even if it means
I'm helping her

462
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,458
hold on to her
feelings for Su-won.

463
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,208
[SU-WON] You can't find them?

464
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,208
I can't say
I'm at all surprised.

465
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,833
Should we keep searching?

466
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,458
[SU-WON]
No. Forget them for now.

467
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,916
Are you going
to let them live?

468
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,708
[SU-WON] Now that they're
away from the castle,

469
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,041
they can't do much.

470
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,583
Besides, we have more
pressing matters at hand.

471
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,833
Something that must
be addressed immediately.

472
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,208
[YONA] We kept running,

473
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,791
pursued by those
who wished to kill us.

474
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,666
Until, at last, we arrived at a
