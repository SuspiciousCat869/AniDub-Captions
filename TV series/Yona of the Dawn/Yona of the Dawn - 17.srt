1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,916
[YONA] After leaving the Blue
Dragon Warrior's village,

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,375
we traveled on for many days,
hardly ever stopping to rest.

3
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,708
[YONA]
Until finally...

4
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,333
[gasps]

5
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,208
[YONA]
It's a port town!

6
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,958
Hak, that's the ocean
down there, isn't it?

7
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,166
How pretty! I've never seen it!

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,791
I know this place.
It's Port Awa.

9
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,958
An Earth Clan territory.

10
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,375
[YUN]
So, you've been here before?

11
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,500
[HAK] Yeah, the old man brought
me here a long time ago.

12
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,041
Gija, you sense
the Green Dragon?

13
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,541
Yes, but...

14
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,291
His movements are so quick
that they're giving me vertigo.

15
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,333
--Are you okay?
--Well, that can't be good.

16
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,083
I guess tracking the
Green Dragon Warrior

17
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,750
must have sapped
most of his energy.

18
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,791
We've all had a
really long journey.

19
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,791
Before we go and
do anything else,

20
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,166
maybe we should rest and
find something to eat.

21
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,333
I can't wait to go and
check out the port!

22
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,500
Hold on!

23
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,958
None of you blend in
with a crowd at all.

24
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,833
Especially you in the mask!

25
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:46,125
I kinda remember my way around,
so I'll go get supplies.

26
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,375
The rest of you stay hidden.

27
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,625
But, Hak, I wanna go exploring.

28
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,708
Y'know, you've been lookin' a
little ragged lately, Princess.

29
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,750
[YONA screams]

30
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,208
How dare you
breathe such insults?

31
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,625
You are a vision of
l-l-loveliness, Princess.

32
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,375
[HAK]
You've got bags under your eyes.

33
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,375
Your hands are all scratched up.

34
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:10,291
Take it easy today, or you're
gonna wear yourself out.

35
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,375
I don't have any idea what
you're talking about, Hak.

36
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,208
[YONA]
He can see right through me.

37
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,833
It's so frustrating.

38
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,000
Make sure you're careful
while you're down there.

39
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,583
The last thing we need is
you getting into trouble.

40
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,791
[HAK] You guys stay outta
sight while I'm gone.

41
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,250
Oh. I'll leave this with you.
It stands out too much.

42
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,375
[yelps] Heavy!

43
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,875
And listen, White Snake.

44
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,666
There's no safer place for
the princess than with us.

45
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,083
[HAK]
If it comes down to it,

46
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,083
I'm hopin' the masked guy
with the little rat

47
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,583
knows how to fight.

48
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,666
[YONA]
Hey, wait a second.

49
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,166
Don't be gone for
too long, okay?

50
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,958
[HAK] It's been a while since
I was in a busy town like this.

51
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,541
I wish I had time ta look around
a bit longer but I need to--

52
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,708
[PROSTITUTE A]
Hey, hot stuff.

53
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,416
[HAK]
Uh.

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,541
How 'bout a good time?

55
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,708
Please, step away.

56
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,000
I've got a younger
woman waiting for me.

57
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,875
[HAK] Maybe it's just me, but
the longer I'm in this town,

58
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,875
the more it seems like everyone
here is a kinda depressed.

59
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,666
I guess it's none
of my business.

60
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,250
I gotta hurry up
and find some food.

61
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,083
--The others are waiting on me.
--[WOMAN] Please leave me alone!

62
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,416
Come on, now.

63
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,083
Be a good girl and show us
officers some affection.

64
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,666
We'll even be generous enough
to pay you for your time.

65
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,500
If the price is right, that is.

66
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,083
Please, let me go.
You're hurting me!

67
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:27,083
[HAK] Those officers are acting
like a coupla scumbags.

68
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,333
They should be
protectin' the people.

69
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,583
I wanna do something, but
the princess is my priority.

70
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,666
[WOMAN]
No! Get your hands off me!

71
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,583
Somebody! Help!

72
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,041
--[footsteps]
--[OFFICER B] Huh?

73
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,166
Well, now I've gone and done it.

74
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,958
These officers don't have any
idea how to woo a pretty lady.

75
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,500
Who the hell are you guys?

76
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,375
You think you can just
attack officers of Awa?!

77
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,541
Exactly how many people
do you plan to assault today?

78
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,875
You don't have any
respect for beauty.

79
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,791
[OFFICER C]
What's wrong?!

80
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:13,541
[OFFICER D]
What's going on here?!

81
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,208
[HAK]
Crap!

82
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,375
[STRANGER]
Oops.

83
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,750
--Hello, dear. Let's run.
--Who are you?

84
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,291
Stop them!

85
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,500
Back off.

86
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,125
[OFFICERS gasp]

87
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,291
[whistles]
You're in great shape.

88
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,416
Does that mean you're
a soldier or something?

89
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,375
Nope, I'm just travelin'
through town.

90
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,916
So you're a tourist, huh?

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,250
Guessing you've had more
than a little fight training

92
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,375
based on your moves.

93
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,208
What? You mean you
love the way I move?

94
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,500
[HAK]
Keep dreaming.

95
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,958
[OFFICER D]
Dammit, I don't see them.

96
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:44,750
Check over there!

97
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,791
[OFFICER E]
Right!

98
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,375
Well, it looks like we lost 'em.

99
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,833
[grunts]

100
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,125
Sorry, my dear. I'd love to
stay and get to know you,

101
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,250
but I'm afraid I've got to run.

102
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,750
Hold on.

103
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,791
This gentleman will see to it
that you get home safely.

104
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,208
Wait a second.

105
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,083
I don't have time
to drop every-- Uh.

106
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,500
He's gone.

107
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,083
That man. Who was he?

108
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,500
[GI-GANG]
Welcome home, Jeaha.

109
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:23,000
Ya made plenty-a noise while
jumpin' around out there.

110
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,583
And performed a perfect landing.

111
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,791
Right, Captain Gi-gang?

112
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,041
Ya showoff.

113
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,166
I'm bein' serious here.

114
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,541
You don't wanna go around
attractin' attention.

115
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,875
I know, I know, but
I was in a hurry.

116
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,041
[GI-GANG]
What happened?

117
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,500
Don't tell me the
officers were after ya.

118
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,458
[JEAHA]
Yes, but I sensed a presence

119
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,500
that was far more
dangerous than them.

120
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,958
I see.

121
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,041
Then what was it that
had ya in sucha hurry

122
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,916
to get back here to us?

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,541
[JEAHA]
Ancient powers.

124
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,416
The White and Blue Dragon
Warriors are here in Awa.

125
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,916
[YUN] You're telling me
you didn't buy any food?!

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,041
That was the whole reason

127
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,833
you went into town
in the first place!

128
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:03,166
Sorry. It's just that there
weren't any good shops open.

129
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,666
Well ,you're just a ton of help,
aren't you, Lightning Beast?

130
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,583
I guess we'll all have
to go to port tomorrow.

131
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,250
Uh! Yes! Awesome!

132
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,541
[HAK]
I'll let him cool down some

133
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,083
before I tell him
I punched an officer.

134
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,083
Sinha, are you
sensing him as well?

135
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,208
[SINHA]
Mh.

136
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,000
He's close.

137
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,583
[GIJA]
The Green Dragon Warrior

138
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,958
is somewhere out
there on the ocean.

139
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,583
[YUN] You guys felt the
Green Dragon's presence

140
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,541
over this way, right?

141
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,375
Hopefully, he's
still around here.

142
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,541
I'll meet up with you
guys in a little while.

143
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,041
I'm going back into town.

144
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,875
I wanna pick up
some weapons there.

145
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,375
Mr. White Snake, carry
this until I get back.

146
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,791
You're not my boss!

147
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,000
But, Hak.

148
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,666
[HAK] The officers
saw my face yesterday.

149
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,125
Everyone will be a lot
safer if I'm not around.

150
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,291
Hey, this time,
actually buy some stuff.

151
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,458
[HAK]
Will do.

152
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,875
[YUN] I think something's up
with the Lightning Beast.

153
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,000
He's supposed to
be guarding you,

154
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,708
but this is the second
day he's gone off

155
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,291
and left you alone with us.

156
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,833
Well, maybe he trusts that the
three of you will protect me.

157
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,125
Do you really think that
might be the reason?

158
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,458
[YUN] Could be he snuck
off to go see a girl.

159
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,916
Ah. I think we're getting
pretty close now.

160
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,916
[YUN]
Whoa, that's a pirate ship!

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
[YONA]
What?

162
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,500
It's definitely not like any
of the ships I saw in the port.

163
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,916
The dragon, could
he be a pirate?

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,666
[GIJA gasps]

165
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,208
Is everything okay?

166
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,291
His presence just...

167
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,041
Vanished.

168
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,916
[JEAHA]
Who do we have here?

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,583
Well, well, well.

170
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,750
So fate brings us
together once again.

171
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,208
You care to hang out for
a little while, friend?

172
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,208
No. I've got things to do.

173
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,750
You're not interested
in who's chasing me?

174
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,791
More officers?

175
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,708
Hmm. Well, in a
manner of speaking.

176
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,291
But don't worry about it.
I'll make sure to keep you safe.

177
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,333
Here? Really?

178
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,416
Isn't it a little early
in the day for this?

179
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,291
That's exactly why it makes
for a perfect hiding spot.

180
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,833
[HAK] I think this is
the kind of experience

181
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,208
you'd rather have
alone with the girls.

182
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:37,458
Oh no, mister,
please don't go yet!

183
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,041
So sexy!

184
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,375
Ohh. I can't believe
that handsome rogue

185
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,916
just stopped my heart with
a single smoldering look.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,250
Hey! I need to see
how you did that!

187
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,916
I didn't do anything.

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,125
I'm used to gettin' this
from pretty girls.

189
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,833
My village back home
is full of 'em.

190
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,041
Really? Where're you from?
Please, tell me.

191
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,958
Sure. It's Fu-- Uh. Y'know.

192
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,958
That's a very interesting style
of clothing you have on.

193
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,083
Where are you from?

194
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,291
Uh. Well I, uh. I'm from--

195
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,208
[HAK, JEAHA chuckle]

196
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,458
I'm from, uh, from Awa.

197
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,375
I've lived here my entire life.

198
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,666
But these nice clothes
come from the Khai Empire.

199
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,083
Y'see, this is a port town,

200
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,250
so merchants stop
here all the time.

201
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,083
Really?

202
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,791
Then answer me this.

203
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,333
What's wrong with
the people here?

204
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,583
At first glance this
place looks normal,

205
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,666
but no one seems to have
any light behind their eyes.

206
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,416
You're a sharp man,
aren't you?

207
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,291
A powerful lord named Yang
Keum-ji controls the port of Awa

208
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,500
and therefore runs
the entire town.

209
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,125
All the citizens here
are afraid of him.

210
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,458
[HAK]
Is that so?

211
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,708
He also profits from some
illicit side businesses.

212
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,458
Illicit?

213
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,708
I'm afraid so.

214
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,416
In my opinion, taking a
person's freedom away

215
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,291
is the ugliest thing
you can do in this world.

216
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,333
Any man who forces someone
else to serve him is rotten,

217
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,666
and should be returned to
the earth from which he came.

218
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,750
Wouldn't you agree
with me, friend?

219
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,666
I serve someone as
a loyal bodyguard.

220
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,041
Uh! But that's terrible!

221
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,083
No, it's not.

222
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,000
Protecting her was my decision.

223
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,375
Uh...

224
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,250
[HAK] With all this talking,
I've said way too much.

225
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,958
[JEAHA] I don't get how
you can be a bodyguard.

226
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,041
Though, I do know three
bodies I'd love to guard

227
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,083
--for the rest of the night.
--[PROSTITUTES] Oh!

228

strong beliefs about freedom.

229
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,916
Sounds like you've
had some hard times.

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,583
Well, you see--

231
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,750
[YUN]
Hey!

232
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,916
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

233
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,000
It's Yun.
And the princess.

234
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,833
This does not look good for me.

235
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,458
Now, before you get angry,
this isn't what it looks like.

236
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,666
This guy made me come here.

237
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,750
Where'd he go?!

238
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,416
I promise I was there
with someone else.

239
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,791
What're you doing

240
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,541
hanging out at a place like
this in broad daylight?

241
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,958
And what are you doing
in a place like this?

242
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,458
Gija said he could feel

243
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,791
the Green Dragon Warrior's
presence coming from this area.

be this kinda place.

it up here. Ya perv.

when you wanna visit
a woman of the night.

into that kinda thing.

know your smutty secret.

Where did that
beauty-obsessed weirdo go?

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,750
[JEAHA]
Whew, that was a close one.

257
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,500
I let my guard down
for just a minute,

258
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:28,291
and the White Dragon Warrior
managed to sneak up on me.

259
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,208
And there was another
powerful aura, too.

260
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:35,000
Someone whose presence caused
my heart to drum faster.

[HAK] You've got some strong
beliefs about freedom.

265
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,291
Not a chance.

266
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,208
Being born with a
destiny is slavery.

267
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,041
It means that you'll
never truly know freedom.

268
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:57,000
But I refuse to submit.
I'll change my fate.

269
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,125
Nobody can force me
into servitude.

270
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,500
Not even the
Crimson Dragon King.

immoral and degrading.

on the Green Dragon Warrior?

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,458
Are they always so brazen?

314
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,958
Yes, they are.

315
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,333
They trash our stores,

316
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,333
and then demand bribes
so it doesn't happen again.

317
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,041
They take any girls they want.

318
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,583
The only thing we can do
is try and stay out of sight

319
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,958
and not provoke them.

320
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:47,958
[YONA]
Who's in charge?

321
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,583
That'd be Yang Keum-ji.

322
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,083
And who's that?

323
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,291
I heard he's the one who
calls all the shots in town.

324
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,541
And everyone's too afraid of
the consequences to cross him.

325
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,208
[WOMAN]
Yes, that's right.

326
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,708
He's even got the
officers on his payroll.

327
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,500
Everything is corrupt.

328
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,208
All the merchants
in town are forced

329
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,583
to pay him an incredibly high
tax just to do business.

330
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,958
Most can't afford it.

331
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,416
What's even worse are
the rumors going around.

332
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
We live in constant fear.

333
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,833
You poor people.

334
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,250
No wonder everyone
is in such low spirits.

335
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,916
And what makes you say that?

336
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,500
It looks like a
pretty lively town

337
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,125
from everything I've seen today.

338
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,708
You might think that
at first glance,

339
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,833
but it seems like everyone's
faking their smiles to me.

340
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,041
[HAK] She may have grown
up sheltered in a castle,

341
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,500
but she still notices
when people are upset.

342
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,000
And the pirates?

343
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,208
What pirates?

344
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,750
We found a boat anchored
in the cove nearby.

345
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,291
If there are thieves
or bandits around,

346
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,916
they're pro'lly adding
to the crime and corruption

347
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,458
already going on.

348
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,583
Actually. They're somewhat
protective of the townspeople,

349
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,166
and they've never harmed anyone.

350
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,375
Wait? Seriously?

351
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,166
[WOMAN] Sure, they've
commandeered a few ships,

352
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,666
but only certain ones.

353
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,291
Those owned by Yang Keum-ji.

354
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,875
Where's the cargo? We done?

355
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,125
Everything's been
loaded up already.

356
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,416
We just gotta hand all of
it off to the guys at port

357
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,625
and we're done.

358
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,875
Hey there, Lookout.
See anything suspicious?

359
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,125
[JEAHA]
Nope, all clear!

360
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,208
Excellent. Looks
like we lucked out

361
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,291
and won't have to deal with any
of those damned pirates tonight.

362
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,291
[JEAHA]
Excuse me!

363
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,708
Yeah? What is it,
something wrong?

364
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,625
[JEAHA] What "cargo" were
you talking about just now?

365
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,916
Huh? Are you stupid
or something?

366
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,291
You know we're here
to get the drugs

367
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,833
that were smuggled in
from the Khai Empire.

368
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,291
[JEAHA] What do you plan to do
with them once you've got 'em?

369
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,416
Turn this into a town
full of addicts.

370
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,750
Once the customers get hooked,

371
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,041
we'll be able to name
any price for the product.

372
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,416
[JEAHA]
Ha, ha. You're despicable.

of beauty, Officer?

00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,916
Wait, who is that?

What the--?

377
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,250
[JEAHA] Apologies for not
introducing myself sooner.

378
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,208
I'm your charming downfall.

379
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,291

And right on time.

but I'm afraid that's the only

filthy pirates get in our way?

Cowering in front of an officer?

That's not very
good form, is it?

Quit ragging on me why don'tcha
and watch your own back.

The only way to get
Captain Gi-gang's respect

399
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,500
is to stand up for yourself.

I can't help that I'm
not the best fighter.

I was just a fisherman
until five years ago.

402
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,250
And yet your work with a pole
leaves much to be desired.

Hey-yo, Captain Gi-gang!

404
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,125
I found the drugs.
They're below deck.

405
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,791
Then burn 'em up with
the ship, ya dumbass.

406
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,583
So, Keum-ji wasn't on board.
Where'dja put tha officers?

407
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh right, we put
'em in a rowboat

408
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,250
and launched it into the ocean.

But it's gettin' hard
not to, Captain.

00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,583
They'd kill us all in a
heartbeat given the chance,

413
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,125
so why do we have
to pull our punches

00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,875
and show those bastards mercy?

415
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,541
It'd be better for

if those corrupt officers
were gone for good.

Do ya want me to
show you real pain?

you got is ancient,

I've gotten a little
too cozy here.

When I fled my village
13 years ago,

I never thought I'd have
another real home.

But then I found you
and the other pirates.

You welcomed me, and even
after seeing my ability,

no one ever looked at
me like I was a freak.

00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,041
Yer ability's a big help,

469
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,958
and I'm gonna need
the extra manpower.

470
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,666
Eventually, we're gonna
track down Keum-ji.

471
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,958
And it'll be a hell of a fight
trying ta take that bastard out.

472
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,916
[JEAHA] It's not like you to be
so uncertain about an outcome.

473
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
[GI-GANG]
I don't wanna watch

474
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,875
my little band a
dumbasses fall apart.

475
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,666
They've got good hearts.

476
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,041
I just wish there was some
handsome ones among 'em.

477
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,875
You have the most beautiful
young man in town

478
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,625
right in front of you, Captain.

479
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,958
But there is someone else
who could be more handsome!

480
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,625
Tell me everything about him.

481
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,916
He's a traveler who I
met him in town earlier.

482
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,458
I don't suppose this
mystery man can fight, can he?

483
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,375
Yeah! Only got a glimpse
at his technique,

484
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,041
but what I saw
was extraordinary.

485
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,041
That means he's probably
purty strong, huh?

486
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,416
Right!

487
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,250
He's strong, he's handsome,
and he's super manly.

488
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,083
He's just your type--

489
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,583
Go capture him immediately!

490
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,875
Aye, aye, my Captain!

491
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,875
[JEAHA] He'd be the perfect
fighting companion,

492
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,458
smoldering alongside
me on the battlefield.

493
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,583
Wait, didn't he mention
some nonsense

494
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,500
about serving as
a lowly bodyguard?

495
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,916
Not to worry!

496
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,250
I'm sure I'll win him over
with my impeccable charms.

497
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,208
There's no way he'll be
able to resist my beauty.

498
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,416
He's all mine!

499
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,541
[GIJA]
This way? No.

500
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,291
That way--? No. Where is he?

501
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,166
[JEAHA] If all you want
is to protect your master

502
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,125
because you were told from
the time you were born

503
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:43,000
that it was your destiny, then
you are a slave to your cause.

504
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,833
Next time on Yona of the Dawn,

505
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:48,041
Episode 18: "Bond."
