00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:10,458
[YUN]
Okay, let's see.

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,250
So, if Gija's directions
are accurate,

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,500
the Green Dragon Warrior
should be nearby.

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,583
[GIJA grunts]

5
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,083
[HAK]
But if we keep going this way,

6
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:21,875
we'll run right into the capital
and Crimson Dragon Castle.

7
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,208
Right.

8
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,208
Let's travel along
the mountains, then.

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,833
It'll take a little longer,
but it'll keep you safe.

10
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah.

11
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,250
Sinha! You see anyone?

12
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,125
Well, then. Let's get going.

13
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,666
Your distance vision
is a huge help.

14
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,583
We haven't run into
a single soul yet.

15
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:32,916
Yeah! You're proving to be
quite useful, Blue Dra-- Uh.

16
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,458
So, I hear the Princess
bestowed a name upon you.

17
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,958
Sinha.

18
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,375
That's quite an honor. You
should be extremely grateful.

19
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,875
Now listen. Long ago, in ancient
times, the Four Dragons...

20
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,458
[YONA] Looks like Gija's
taken Sinha under his wing.

21
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,458
They're going to
get along just fine.

22
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,208
Along the way, we came upon
a desolate town in ruins.

23
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,208
I'd never seen anything like it.

24
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,791
This village.

25
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,875
Looks like it's
been abandoned...

26
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,541
...by all the generals
and the king.

27
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,083
[gasps]

28
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,208
[YUN] There's no irrigation,
so all their crops have died.

29
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,250
And any able-bodied men
have probably been taken

30
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,875
to the capital to be made into
soldiers for Su-won's cause.

31
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,541
[YUN]
Disease is spreading so quickly

32
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,333
those who are too weak
to leave can do nothing

33
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,666
but lay down and die here.

34
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,958
How sad.

35
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,708
[YUN] I was born in a
village just like this.

36
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,416
The Fire Clan has
such vast land,

37
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,083
but it's mostly
infertile and dying.

38
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,833
Their leader,
General Gang Su-jin,

39
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,541
spends more money
on his military

40
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,250
than he does his people.

41
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,500
Wow, what an ass!

42
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,250
[VILLAGER coughing]

43
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,791
Are you all right--? Uh.

44
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,500
No, don't get too close to him,
or you could get sick, too.

45
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,666
But, Yun.

46
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,500
This medicine won't cure you,
but it will ease your pain.

47
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,166
[VILLAGER groans]

48
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,916
Here, have some fruit, too.

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,708
[YONA]
Drink.

50
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,500
[VILLAGER] Are you from
the capital? From Sy-ka?

51
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,916
No, we're just passing through.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,666
[VILLAGER]
I see.

53
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,708
Well then, have you
been to Kuto recently?

54
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,166
I heard the old king died

55
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,375
and they've already
crowned the new one.

56
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,166
I hope he turns out better.

57
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,750
[HAK]
Uh...

58
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,958
[HAK]
Uh.

59
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,291
[VILLAGER] The last king,
Il, was the worst kind.

60
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,125
[YONA gasps]

61
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,625
[VILLAGER] He avoided
conflict at all costs,

62
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,458
and bowed to any foreign
power who challenged him.

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,416
He destroyed the unity
between the five clans,

64
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,583
and the kingdom fell into chaos.

65
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,416
He did nothing
for the powerless,

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,541
those who relied on him most.

67
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:05,458
But he was never our king, and
so his ruin is poetic justice.

68
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,375
I hope, for the sake
of the next generation,

69
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:12,500
that the new king is
different. Just and brave.

70
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,458
Maybe he can save this kingdom.

71
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,916
Thank you.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,833
It's been years since
anyone has touched me.

73
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,625
Your kindness has
almost made me feel

74
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,458
like a human being again, miss.

75
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,041
[YONA]
You're welcome.

76
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,250
Please, take care
of yourself, sir.

77
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,000
I hate to stop, but I'm
afraid nature's calling.

78
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,791
I'll be right back, okay?

79
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,583
[YUN]
I just...

80
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,666
...I couldn't say anything.

81
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,583
To be honest, I feel the same
way about how King Il ruled.

82
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:09,125
But still, he's the only family
the princess has ever known, so.

83
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,791
It's likely that no
one in the kingdom

84
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,708
will grieve much over
King Il's passing.

85
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:18,083
And, I'm sure, history will
say he was ineffectual.

86
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,958
Unfortunately, in this case,

87
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,125
no one cares what
a daughter thinks.

88
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,125
It's true.

89
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,333
Peace is just a fantasy.

90
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,958
Absolute peace,
with no conflict.

91
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,541
War is humanity's nature.

92
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,083
That said,

93
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,333
the king was an idealist,
but he was never a fool.

94
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:40,333
He had a strong will and
he stood by his beliefs.

95
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,250
I never saw him as a coward,

96
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,125
and I still don't.

97
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:48,416
Because I saw the wounds he
tried to hide from the world.

98
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,333
And I would never pledge
my life in service

99
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,458
to a fool or a coward.

100
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,833
[HAK] I failed to protect him
at Crimson Dragon Castle,

101
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,333
and I'll regret it for
the rest of my life.

102
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,041
So, you pledged your
life to serve him,

103
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,833
not only because of your
friendship with the princess,

104
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,291
but out of respect for the king.

105
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,041
[HAK]
Yes, that's right.

106
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,166
Even if the kingdom forgets.

107
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,833
At least I know...
you'll remember me and father.

108
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,416
Thanks to you, we'll live on.

109
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,541

How could I ever forget?

110
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,083
She had everything.

111
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,833
Glamour and beauty. The most
fortunate girl in the kingdom.

112
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:31,583
And now, she's alone, with no
one to look after her but us.

113
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,666
All she has left is the memory
of the father she loved.

114
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,666
I can't take that from her,

115
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,375
and I won't do anything
to tarnish it.

such a careless,

I'm still gonna be me.

Besides, I'm not
hurting anyone, am I?

141

I mean, would ya take
a look at the Wind Clan?

They get to wear whatever
they damn well please.

I've been bored out of

There's no foreign
commerce coming in,

and our resources are dwindling.

150

00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,958
So, you couldn't fight
even if you wanted to.

[GEUN-TEA sighs]

161
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,250
Besides, you call
yourself a War God,

162
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,875
but I remember a match
where you were beaten

163
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,541
by some kid called
the Lightning Beast.

164
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,916
Now, he's what I'd
call a War God.

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,500
Aw, you always know
just what to say, Cheol.

166
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,125
Anytime I need a humility check,

167
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,291
you're there at the ready
with a snarky comment.

168
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,541
I'm sorry, sir. I promise
you I didn't mean it.

[CIVIL SERVANT A]
Master Geun-tea!

Master Geun-tea!

Oh, have you come to insult me

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,750
and tell me how
to live my life, too?

173
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,333
[CIVIL SERVANT A]
Um... No, sir.

174

You're not going to believe
this, but King Su-Won is here!

Well, I'll be, it's really him.

[CHEOL-RAN]
Uh, yeah, I can see that.

178
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,791
Now, would you hurry
up and go get dressed?

179
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,041
Seriously, you're going
to embarrass yourself.

Look, even General Ju-do
from the Sky Clan is here!

181

[GEUN-TEA] What the hell is
His Majesty doing in Chishin?

182
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,666
And why'd he only
bring two soldiers?

183
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,833
[CHEOL-RAN]
How am I supposed to know?!

184
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,000
I haven't seen you
since my coronation.

185
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,958
General Geun-Tea, you and
your clan are faring well?

186
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,875
Yes, sir.

187
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,625
[GEUN-TEA]
"King" Su-Won.

188
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,208
How'd an 18-year-old ascend
to the throne so quickly?

189
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,208
Makes me wonder.

190
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,666
There were some
odd circumstances

191
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,500
surrounding King Il's death,

192
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,541
like the princess's sudden
disappearance with General Hak.

193
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,958
But he is the son of
my mentor, Master Yuhon,

194
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,666
whom I deeply respected.

195

General Geun-tea,
if you don't mind,

196
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,416
there's something that
I must ask of you.

197
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,625
Sir?

198
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,458
Bet he's got a super
special mission for you.

199
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,833
It's probably some
covert operation

200
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,208
My throat is so parched
from the long journey.

201
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,583
Do you think that
I could trouble you

202
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,375
for a hot cup of tea?

203
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,666
[BOTH]
Huh?

204
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,708
Wow. The aroma of this
blend is intoxicating.

205
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,166
My wife will be
happy to hear that,

206
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,916
it's from her prized tea garden.

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,208
I'm not a big fan of it myself,
I find the smell overpowering.

208
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,875
[SU-WON]
It's delightfully floral.

209
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,708
[GEUN-TEA] She only dabbles
in cultivating exotic teas,

210
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,666
so you'll have to forgive her
if it tastes a little odd.

211
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,083
[SU-WON]
It's merely a hobby?

212
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,916
Then I'm doubly impressed!

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,375
What do you think,
General Ju-do?

214
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,125
I've never claimed
to be a connoisseur

215
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,666
when it comes to
the realm of fine teas.

216
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,208
That being said,

217
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,291
I'm appalled that the general
would dare to offer the king

218
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,208
anything less than
his finest stock.

219
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,333
What?

220
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,458
I offered him my
wife's favorite blend.

221
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,833
You've always been so
uptight, you know that?

222
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,791
Maybe if you could ever
wipe that permanent scowl

223
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,833
off of your face,
you might find a lady

224
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,125
to help refine your
unsophisticated tastes.

teach this jerk a lesson!

a fight with our guest.

--[JU-DO] What?!

If you wanna be
treated like a king,

235
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,958

so damned easy-going.

gonna respect you!

I guess I do need to
toughen up, I'm sorry.

This milksop is
Master Yuhon's son?

Ha! What a pathetic excuse
for a man, let alone a king.

240

I see nothing of his
father's dynamism in him.

241

In fact, I seriously doubt

that they have anything
in common at all.

243

Master Yuhon was the epitome
of an indomitable warrior.

244

He's the only person
I've ever deemed worthy

of being my master.

Is this man even capable
of leading the kingdom?

247
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,500
Chishin castle is very different
than what I expected.

00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,041
I'll bet it is.

I only wish you didn't have to
see it in such a sad state.

We've wanted to start

Hm. Well, I've heard
a lot of rumors, sir.

People say the reason the
castle's in such bad shape

254
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,250
is that you trashed it--

May I ask why you made the
journey to Chishin in person?

265
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,250
Wouldn't it have been easier

to send someone else
on your behalf?

you have some top-secret
business with General Geun-tea.

No, I'm just on a sightseeing
tour of the kingdom.

[CHEOL-RAN]
No offense,

but if you wanna take
a leisurely vacation,

I wouldn't suggest hanging
around this crumbling kingdom.

In case you haven't
noticed, Your Majesty,

things have gotten
awfully bad here in Kouka.

The worst is Awa, though-- Uh!

Hold your tongue, Cheol.

to our king, dumbass.

I'd like to pick
your brain a bit.

What'd you think of your
predecessor, the late King Il?

What're you doing, sir?

Not to be irreverent,

287
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,791
but I always had my doubts
about the way he chose to rule.

288
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,333
He shied away from conflict and
conceded much of our territory.

289
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,083
It weakened our nation, and
the citizens suffered for it.

290
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,875
"For the people," was his motto,
but he didn't rule that way.

291
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,291
He damaged our relationships

292
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,083
with the Shin and
the Sai in the south,

293
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,083
and we feared an all-out
attack from the Kai Empire.

294
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,583
If I had witnessed this
dangerous pattern of failure

295
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,666
and humiliation continue
for much longer,

296
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,750
it's possible I might've
been the one to rise up

297
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,166
in rebellion against him.

I might've taken action.

301

I'm not implying

302
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,375
that a rebellion actually
occurred or anything.

Are you doing everything within
your power to save this land?

313
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,750
At your coronation, you promised
you would restore this kingdom

314
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,333
to its former glory, and
bring it back to what it was

in the days of the ninth king.

316
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,791
Do you solemnly swear to uphold
the vow you made to your people?

317
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,708
Yes.

Huh?

[SU-WON]
This rock is simply fascinating.

324

It's a rock like any
other hunk of earth.

Can't you see
it's been enshrined?

Obviously, it's not just
any rock, it's special.

[GEUN-TEA] What a shame.
He's nothing like his father.

to restore this land
to its former glory.

Kouka Kingdom is doomed.

331
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,625
It's been enshrined
because we found it

332
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,416
deep within the Udo mine.

333

Oh, I see. And may I ask why?

334
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,708
[GEUN-TEA]
It's an old Earth Clan custom.

335
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,291
We enshrine objects
from our endeavors

to promote good fortune.

337

[SU-WON]
The longer I look at it,

the more I see
its inherent beauty.

339
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,541
Does it have any monetary value?

340
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,458
No, it's only real worth
is as a lucky talisman.

341
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,875
The true value's in
the iron ore we're mining.

342
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:12,958
[SU-WON]
Hm.

343
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,375
Well. Nice seeing
you, King Su-Won,

344
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,541
but I've got some important
business to attend to

anything, just ask my servants,

to help you.

[CHEOL-RAN] "Important business
to attend to"? Gimme a break.

349

Thank you.

350
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,625
I look forward to talking with
you again later, General.

351
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,375
Um. 'Scuse me, Your Majesty?

352
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,708
Earlier, when my master was
talking about rising up

353
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,333
in rebellion against King Il,

354
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,583
I'm sure he was only
speaking figuratively.

355
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,666
You know him. He's always trying
to get a rise out of somebody.

356
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,041
So please, don't take
what he said seriously.

357
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,625
He can just get a little
bit crazy sometimes.

358
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,583
There's no need to worry.

359
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,541
I'd never condemn him for it.

360
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,083
No?

361
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,000
Thank you very much for that.

362
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,500
Master Geun-tea
has been depressed

363
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,291
and out of sorts for
a long time now.

364
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,375
His whole sense of
identity revolves around

365
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,583
his reputation as
a mighty warrior.

366
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,791
He doesn't feel quite at home
anywhere but on the battlefield.

367
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,625
I think he resents not being
able to use his skill in war

368
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,833
to save the Kouka
Kingdom from ruin.

369
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,375
He feels helpless
and angry all the time.

370
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,875
He may look rough and callous,

371
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,208
but he truly cares about his
people more than anything.

372
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,708
Yes, I can see that,
the servants demonstrate it.

373
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,416
You can tell they
love him deeply.

374

No matter their rank,

everyone here speaks
their mind freely,

00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,083
without reservation or
fear of being punished.

378
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:37,541
I think it attests to the
quality of his character.

379
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:42,041
In that regard, he reminds me
a lot of the people I hold dear.

And you. You love the
general too, don't you?

just like he does.

And I noticed many
other ponytails, too.

385
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,333
It seems you're not the only one
who holds him in high regard.

386
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,375
No, we all do.

387
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,750
Everyone in the
clan idolizes him.

388
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,500
Can you blame us? His courage
on the battlefield is legendary.

389

We've all heard stories
of his bravery.

390

Between you and me,

391
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,458
there was a lot of competition

392
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,500
within the clan to
become his caretaker.

393
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,750
Oh, please promise me

394
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,875
you'll keep that as our
secret, Your Majesty.

If he knew, it'd go
straight to his head.

I don't get what all
the fuss is about.

He's annoying.

I'd like to see him
in action someday.

As brave as everyone
claims him to be,

400
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,375
I imagine it'd be
a remarkable sight.

401

I know he would love that,

402

but it might be difficult

403
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,583
since fighting has
been strictly prohibited.

00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,125
I'd like to visit the men who
were injured in the Udo mine.

467
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,833
Do you think it'd be all right
for me to stop by at some point?

468
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,625
I would be honored
to take you there.

469
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,041
[GEUN-TEA] This is worse
than I could've imagined.

470
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,083
Forget him being
like Master Yuhon,

471
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,708
this man-child's even less
fit to rule than King Il.

472
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,833
My, what lovely tea.

473
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,333
[GEUN-TEA] What's going to
become of my beloved kingdom?

474
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,541
[SU-WON] You're all alone on the
battlefield, General Geun-tea.

475
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,041
If this were a real war,

476
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,500
you would be killed in
a matter of seconds.

477
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,083
So, what'll you do?

478
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,541
Next time on Yona of The Dawn,

479
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,541
Episode 16: "Pretend War."
