1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,958
I thought perhaps
I'd find you in here.

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,000
[gasps]

3
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,166
[KEISHUK]
As you suspected, your Majesty,

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,416
we found two sets
of accounting books.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,833
The evidence we gathered

6
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,875
supports your theory of
fraudulent tax administration.

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,041
Thank you for your work.

8
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,958
We have removed the
administrator in question,

9
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,416
but I'm afraid,

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,083
the corruption runs deeper
than we originally thought.

11
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:37,250
King Il was an
extremely kind man.

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,875
While that's not a crime in
itself, it can lead to trouble.

13
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,166
People mistake kindness
for weakness.

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,500
Too often humanity's greed will
lead them to take advantage.

15
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,916
Indeed.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,916
Your Grace, isn't that
book one of those

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,791
which your father forbade
during King Junam's rule?

18
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:54,833
[SU-WON]
Yes.

19
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,708
It's the legend of
the Four Dragons.

20
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:02,250
When I was a little boy,
I used to sneak in here.

21
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,416
This book was my favorite,
partly because it was forbidden.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,750
[SU-WON] But, it's only
a story. A fairy tale.

23
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:14,166
No fictional god is coming
to save the kingdom.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,125
We, the people,
must work to rebuild it.

25
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,958
[MERCHANT]
Long time no see, kid.

26
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,833
I've been desperate
for your medicine.

27
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,833
I'll trade you for some
rice if you've got it.

28
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,166
[MERCHANT]
Yeah.

29
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,083
I've never seen you travel
with friends before.

30
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,583
You're usually alone.

31
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,333
So, uh, who's the big
guy with the stick?

32
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,791
Well...

33
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,041
[HAK] Just a fellow
traveler on the road

34
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,041
on route to the border
on a delivery.

35
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,583
Pleased to meet you, sir.

36
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,416
[HAK]
Princess.

37
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,083
[HAK]
Princess!

38
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,000
What're you so mad about?

39
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,166
The indignity of being
a bag of clothes?

40
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,750
Look, I had to handle you
roughly so it'd be believable,

41
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,875
I even warned you beforehand.

42
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,125
Okay, I'm sorry I took
advantage of the situation

43
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,166
and grabbed your butt.

44
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,250
You'll pay for that!
How dare you?

45
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,500
It was already a
scary situation...

46
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,041
I thought that guy
was onto us for sure,

47
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,041
my heart was pounding
the whole time!

48
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,208
Okay, listen up, you guys.

49
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,125
Princess Flame Head
of the Morning!

50
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,833
And ex-general Wildebeest!

51
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:41,750
Lightning Beast.

52
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,916
And I'm a Beautiful Boy Genius!

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,625
We gotta lay low, 'cause
the three of us stick out.

54
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:50,541
We're near Fire Clan land, and
the royal capital, so heads up.

55
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,625
You know what happens
if we're caught, don't you?

56
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,625
[YONA, HAK]
Yeah.

57
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,833
And, thanks to the oracle,

58
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,666
we also know that the
Four Dragon Warriors

59
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,083
all live in extremely
remote locations.

60
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,083
Do you have any leads? Where can
we find these Dragon Warriors?

61
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:09,166
Well, the four who inherited the
dragons' blood live separately,

62
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,666
they're scattered
throughout the kingdom,

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,500
and they're constantly
moving around,

64
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,708
so it's difficult to get a good
bead on their exact locations.

65
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,875
[BOTH]
What a pain!

66
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,583
But I do know where
one of them lives!

67
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,666
Ever since the days of the
legend, one clan has lived

68
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,333
on a foggy mountain top
protecting the blood-line.

69
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,333
They have kept to
themselves for centuries,

70
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,875
living independently
from all other clans.

71
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,625
They don't usually 
accept outsiders,

72
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,541
so you'll have to be very
persuasive to get their help.

73
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,166
[HAK]
They live near the border, huh?

74
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,083
[IK-SU]
Yes. It's going to be dangerous

75
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:42,333
crossing through Fire Clan lands
and near the royal capital.

76
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,666
If that wasn't bad enough,
we're passing the Khai Empire.

77
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,916
I've never seen much
of the world,

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,666
so a secret village
is super exciting!

79
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,875
It's gonna be great!

80
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,666
Then, I'm gonna start
writing a travel-log

81
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,958
about seeing the whole kingdom!

82
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,375
Oh, yeah? Your eyes,
why are they all puffy?

83
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,500
[YUN yelps]

84
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,791
[HAK]
You can always go back home

85
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,333
if you miss the
oracle that much!

86
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,250
We don't want you with us if
you're gonna cry the whole time!

87
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,583
[YUN]
You shut your mouth!

88
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,125
Someone's coming!

89
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:19,958
[sighs]

90
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:26,125
It's fine. Your injuries haven't
finished healing, and I don't

91
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,083
want you to feel like you have
to carry me all the time, Hak.

92
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,500
[HAK grumbles]

93
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,083
Anyway, I wanna
see the kingdom.

94
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,208
I've been sheltered
my whole life.

95
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,333
Fine, have it your way,

96
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,541
but let's not forget what
Yun said about this area.

97
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,583
It may look safe,
but you can never tell,

98
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,791
so we have to
stay on guard. Huh?

99
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey, Yun! What's that thing?

100
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,208
[YUN]
Wow, that's a giant waterwheel!

101
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,708
I've never seen one that big!

102
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,750
[sighs]

103
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,791
[YONA] How pretty.
What's that they're growing?

104
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,125
[HAK] Wheat. It looks like
they've got some rice, too.

105
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,666
[YUN] It's because this area
is so close to the capital.

106
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,916
I'm willing to bet this is where
they grew most, if not all,

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,833
the food you ate as you were
growing up in the castle.

108
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,583
It came from these crops?

109
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,333
[BOY laughing]

110
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,416
[BOY, MOM laughing]

111
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,125
Mom, I did it!

112
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,250
Let me see, love!

113
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,708
Oh, you did such a good job!

114
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,541
[BOY, MOM laughing]

115
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,166
[MOM]
I'm so proud of you!

116
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,416
Hm. That's almost
everything we need.

117
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,875
I'm still concerned
it's not enough,

118
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,375
seeing as we don't know when
we'll be able to restock.

119
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,666
But it's the best
we can do for now.

120
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,041
Yeah.

121
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,208
Hak, what are you
so worried about?

122
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,458
Did you forget to pick up
something we need?

123
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,000
Uh. Sort of.

124
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,166
[YONA sighs]

125
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,583
You can go if you want to.
We'll wait here.

126
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,916
We won't talk to anyone
while you're gone.

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,833
It'll be fine. This seems
like a quiet village.

128
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:00,958
These are good people,

129
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,041
and I haven't seen
signs of any troops.

130
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,291
If anything feels off,
you start running, okay?

131
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,916
Don't hesitate,
just get outta here.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,958
And rendezvous at the big tree,
like we discussed earlier.

133
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,375
Stick to the plan.

134
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,958
I'll be right back.

135
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,208
[HAK] I was able to find
the glaive and spear,

136
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,333
but I lost the bow somewhere
in the Northern Mountains.

137
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,375
[HAK] Huh?

138
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,416
That one's for self defense.

139
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,833
It's light enough for a girl,

140
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,916
but make no mistake, it can
kill a grown man easily.

141
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:53,708
I have no need for it.
Defense is my job, not hers.

142
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:54,750
Huh?

143
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,500
[VILLAGER A]
Really?

144
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,000
I had heard that a new
king had been crowned,

145
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,416
but I brushed it off as
a rumor. It's true then?

146
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,583
Yes. Apparently he's incredibly
young and good-looking,

147
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,958
and he says he wants
to change things.

148
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,750
But, he's the son of
Prince Yuhon the war hero.

149
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:10,333
I wonder if he's...

150
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,500
[YONA]
I see.

151
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,708
So, Mun-deok did it, then.

152
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:17,291
He approved Su-Won's ascension
to the throne, after all.

153
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,041
I'm glad.

154
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,625
Hopefully, that
means the Wind Clan

155
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,583
will be out of harm's way now.

156
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,666
Hey, what's the matter?

157
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,916
Are you okay?

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,916
[YONA grunts]

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,250
[YONA]
Mh-hm.

160
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,125
[YONA]
Su-won is king.

161
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,708
He murdered my father and
now he lives in the castle

162
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,500
that was once my home.

163
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,000
Uhh... Are you listening?

164
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,833
[STOREKEEPER]
Excuse me, miss.

165
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,750
Would you care for
another cup of tea?

166
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,583
Uh, no, thank you. I'm fine.

167
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,083
Excuse me, please.

168
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,375
Wait! Stop! Come back!

169
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,125
Thanks a lot. Have a good day.

170
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,916
Uh, thank you, sir.

171
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,083
What got into you
all of a sudden?

172
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,458
Try to not do anything that
raises unnecessary suspicion.

173
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,458
[BOTH gasp]

174
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,416
Hurry! This way!

175
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,291
[YUN] Guess I was wrong
about the troops.

176
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,208
They must've been
away at the capital.

177
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,958
And they're just
now coming back.

178
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,625
Hey!

179
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,833
[VILLAGER D]
Oh, hello there!

180
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,791
When did you guys
get back from Kuhto?

181
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,125
Just a few hours ago.

182
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,541
Wow, that recently?

183
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,208
[SOLDIER]
The capital was spectacular.

184
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,333
[VILLAGER D] I bet!

185
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,375
[SOLDIER]
There were people everywhere

186
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,875
and all this exotic food.

187
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,083
I'm telling you,
it was a great party!

188
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,291
[sighs]

189
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,333
[YONA sighs]

190
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:53,666
[YONA yelps

191
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,708
[grunts]

192
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,000
[SOLDIER]
There were people everywhere

193
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,500
and all this exotic food.

194
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,833
[sighs]

195
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,666
[YONA sighs]

196
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,041
[YONA yelps]

197
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,125
Please, Princess. Stay quiet.

198
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's go. No sense in staying.

199
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,916
[HAK] I'm sorry.
I didn't think it through.

200
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,625
I shouldn'ta left you two
alone, not even for a minute.

201
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,916
No. It's my fault.

202
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,666
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,625
[FARMER A] They're saying the
tax situation will get better

204
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,208
now that we have a different
king in the capital.

205
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,500
[FARMER B]
Don't get your hopes up.

206
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,541
It doesn't matter
who sits on the throne,

207
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,958
royalty will never understand

208
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,416
the hardships of the
people they rule over.

209
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,750
[YUN sighs]

210
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,041
Hoofing it uphill is a lot
harder, but at least we don't

211
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,583
have to worry about being
noticed all the way out here.

212
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,458
We have to stay alert.

213
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,250
The Fire Clan could
be patrolling the area,

214
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,958
so we can't let our guard down.

215
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,000
[YUN sighs]

216
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,458
I'm helpless. I wanna fight.
With a sword.

217
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,666
Hak, you said you would
teach me how to protect myself.

218
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,958
No, I never said that.

219
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,791
Uh...

220
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,333
We don't have to take
time out of traveling.

221
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,833
Teach me how to defend
myself against attackers.

222
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:58,958
[HAK]
Princess...

223
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,250
Do you think you're capable
of killing someone?

224
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,291
[gasps]

225
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,750
[HAK]
You say you wanna fight,

226
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,458
but attackers don't give in so
easily and they don't run.

227
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,041
You have to be ready to kill,

228
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,125
or, at the very least, injure
them because they won't relent.

229
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,083
When we were cornered

230
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,333
on the cliffs of the
Northern Mountains,

231
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,041
it was the first time I was
forced to pick up a sword.

232
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,375
And I didn't know
what to do with it.

233
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,416
[YONA] I may not be able
to kill someone right now,

234
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,750
or even injure them.

235
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,666
But I want to have the ability
to buy us some time to get away.

236
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,916
That's all.

237
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,416
I suppose it's not a bad idea.

238
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,458
[YONA]
Will you teach me?

239
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,708
I'll make you a deal.

240
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,791
[YONA]
The bow?

241
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,750
[HAK]
I'll fight on the front lines.

242
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,875
You stay back and pick off
our enemies off with this.

243
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,916
Okay. But, I want a sword, too!

244
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,958
[HAK] Archery's all I'm
gonna teach you for now.

245
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,750
[YONA growls]

246
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,125
Listen to me.
King Il hated weapons.

247
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,166
He forbade you from
ever using them.

248
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,041
And right now,
I'm disobeying his orders.

249
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,458
[HAK] I want you to consider
why he hated violence

250
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,750
and keep that in mind
when you use this.

251
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,291
[YUN]
I'm curious.

252
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,583
How do you plan to
teach her archery

253
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,666
while we're climbing up
mountains every day?

254
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,458
[HAK]
I dunno.

255
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,000
If we weren't traveling, I'd
make her shoot 200 arrows a day

256
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,375
until she got the hang of it.

257
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,083
200?

258
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,375
I guess we can start

259
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,833
by shooting at birds
and rabbits as we travel.

260
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,583
That sounds great!

261
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,458
Then we won't have
to worry about dinner!

262
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,166
And now you can pull
your weight, Princess.

263
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,291
[YONA yelps]

264
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,208
[YONA groans]

265
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,166
Hak, I can't hit any of them.

266
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,958
What do you think
I'm doing wrong?

267
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,041
[thunk]

268
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,583
[thud]

269
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,083
Just do that.

270
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,666
I didn't see what
you did differently.

271
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,375
I aimed.

272
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,041
Sorry, I don't get it.

273
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,291
Get what?

274
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,708
[YUN] A natural can't
understand the feelings

275
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,416
of those who can't do it.

276
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,583
[YONA] Hak, you're a terrible
teacher, you know that?

277
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,250
[HAK]
Well, you're a terrible student!

278
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,291
[HAK]
You're not strong enough.

279
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,375
Practice until you can pull

280
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,333
the string back firmly
without shaking.

281
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,041
Once it's in your muscles
it'll come to you naturally.

282
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,291
You got it?

283
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,833
Now, watch how it's done.

284
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,416
It's all sensed in the body.

285
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,583
An expert can hit any target
without even looking.

286
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:40,000
Just don't make the mistake of
letting your vision fool you.

287
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,875
For now, how 'bout
you focus your energy

288
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,125
on building strength
and shooting straight?

289
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,208
[sighs]

290
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,416
[YONA grunting]

291
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,458
Ugh. Who's making
all that racket?

292
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,750
[YONA grunts]

293
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,000
[YUN] She's practicing archery
in the middle of the night?

294
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,208
[gasps]

295
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,791
[YUN] Today's breakfast is
wild bird and rice with veggies!

296
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,250
It looks delicious!

297
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,291
I'm so amazed by everything
that you can do, Yun!

298
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,833
[YUN]
Well, I am a genius, after all.

299
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,083
[YUN]
I saw you practicing.

300
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,791
You're getting better
at drawing your bow.

301
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:46,458
Really? You're an
archer, too? No way!

302
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,208
I know my way around
a bow and arrow.

303
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,916
But I don't like
carrying weapons.

304
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,041
It's not something you
should do half-heartedly.

305
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,416
[YONA]
Huh?

306
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,500
I'm talking about the idea
of taking another life.

307
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,541
You're learning for
self-defense,

308
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,125
but people like you
and I can't afford

309
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,500
to show any mercy
on the battlefield.

310
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,458
We have to kill or be killed.

311
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,291
In order for us to survive,
we have to land a single blow

312
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,291
to a vital point
and kill instantly.

313
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:17,000
If not, we have to use
our brains to get out.

314
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,375
The only reason
Hak can hold back

315
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,166
is because he's the
Lightning Beast.

316
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,500
We're not like him,
and we never will be.

317
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,375
[boar squeaking]

318
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,375
[YONA]
It's so cute.

319
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,125
If I'm going to survive
on the battlefield,

320
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,750
I have to kill humans,

321
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,000
and I don't even want
to hurt this boar.

322
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,083
To draw this bow means
being willing to take a life,

323
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,291
or else have my own
life taken from me.

324
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,958
[boar squealing]

325
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,000
[gasps]

326
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,875
[YONA] Father hated the pain
of violence more than anything.

327
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,500
I'm sorry, Father.

328
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,458
But in order to survive,
I must learn to take a life.

329
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,166
I must learn to kill.

330
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,125
You almost got it.

331
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,000
I just hurt it for nothing.

332
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,458
That's even more cruel.

333
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,125
You missed because
you hesitated.

334
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,166
[gasps]

335
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,041
Yun, you can go on without us.

336
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,708
All right, but don't linger.

337
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,791
We're almost to the
place Ik-su mentioned.

338
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,291
I know, we'll catch up with you.

339
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,541
[HAK]
Okay, it's time.

340
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,833
You must now show your skills

341
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,166
so your master can judge
your improvement.

342
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,041
Right! First, you
must hit this tree.

343
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,875
Nicely done, Princess!
I'm impressed!

344
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,791
You can hit a motionless tree!

345
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,291
Oh, thank you.
I feel so much better.

346
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,875
'Kay, let's see.
For your next target...

347
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,291
Here. Aim it right at me.

348
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,875
[YONA]
Uh. No way!

349
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,541
[HAK]
It'll be fine. I can dodge it.

350
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,833
[HAWK] This will teach you
how to hit moving targets.

351
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,500
No, this will teach
you how to hit people.

352
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,166
I'm going to move around a lot.
You just try and shoot me.

353
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,000
I can't be held responsible!

354
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,291
[HAK grunts]

355
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,541
[YONA]
How'm I supposed to shoot you

356
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,291
when you jump around like that?

357
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,000
[HAK]
Sorry, but people move.

358
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,041
Try harder. You're not
even comin' close.

359
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,375
[gasps]

360
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,166
You're not bloodthirsty enough.

361
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,375
[YONA] What? Why would
I be bloodthirsty?

362
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,875
I'm shooting at you!

363
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,000
[HAK] Then in that case,
pretend I'm not me.

364
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,500
Imagine me as one
of those soldiers

365
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,541
on the mountain that day.

366
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,750
It won't work.
I don't want to kill.

367
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,458
All right. Try this.

368
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,666
Imagine I'm Su-won
and shoot at me.

369
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,708
[YONA gasps]

370
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,750
I hate this side of
you, Hak. I really do.

371
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,416
[YONA]
But in spite of that,

372
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,916
I would still take
a life for you.

373
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,750
I'm willing to
take up a weapon...

374
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,416
..if it means I can
protect you from harm.

375
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,041
[YONA]
Hak?

376
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,583
Don't say that...
about protecting me.

377
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,958
What do you mean?

378
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,541
I'll want more.

379
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,791
[YONA]
Hm?

380
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:37,791
And anyway, it's my
job to protect you.

381
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,500
[YONA gasps]

382
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,958
[HAK] I told you that I want
you to think of me as a tool.

383
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,125
You don't have to worry about
protecting tools, do you?

384
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,833
The visibility seems
to be getting worse.

385
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,208
Strange. I thought we'd
catch up to Yun by now.

386
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,333
A secret mountain village
shrouded in fog.

387
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:01,166
It's supposed to be around here,
but I see no sign of it.

388
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,208
[YONA]
Oh, no! Come quickly!

389
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,583
I can't see anything!
Where are you?

390
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,333
[YONA]
I'm over here! Please, hurry!

391
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:15,583
Look, Hak, this stuff. These
are Yun's things, aren't they?

392
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,875
Yun! Where are you?
Please answer me!

393
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:19,916
[gasps]

394
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,708
[VOICES]
Leave! Leave!

395
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,666
[OLD MAN] Depart this place
immediately and do not return!

396
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,041
Who are you?

397
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,708
[OLD MAN A]
If you come one step farther,

398
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,916
you will incur swift
divine punishment.

399
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,666
Who makes a threat
while hidden behind mist?

400
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,000
What kind of cowardly gods

401
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,416
can't punish their
enemies face-to-face?

402
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,916
Just who are you people?

403
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,708
I've never seen anyone
clear the fog. It's unreal.

404
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,875
First, tell us. Are you
from the Dragon Village?

405
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,583
[MAN B] How do you
know about our clan?

406
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,125
Who sent you here?

407
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,166
[OLD MAN] Your knowledge alone
gives us reason to kill you.

408
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,958
There was a boy here earlier.
Were you all traveling together?

409
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,750
We won't answer till
you tell us where he is.

410
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,083
What did you do with him?

411
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,958
Like you, he trespassed--

412
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,458
No, it can't be!

413
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,916
She has crimson hair.

414
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,416
Just like the legend.

415
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,708
Is she the one?

416
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,666
But she's a young girl.

417
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,916
[OLD MAN grunts]

418
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,916
[OLD MAN] Please,
tell us truthfully, Miss.

419
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,041
Where are you from
and why are you here?

420
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:34,458
From Fuga. The oracle told
us we would find you here.

421
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,958
We're seeking out the
Four Dragon Warriors.

422
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,791
Are you the one who carries
the White Dragon's blood?

423
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,125
Huh?

424
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,500
The oracle sent you?

425
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,500
No, Miss. I'm not the dragon,

426
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,041
but I'm one of those
charged with his protection.

427
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,208
[gasps]

428
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,416
[OLD MAN]
Allow us to guide you to him.

429
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,375
We will lead you to
the White Dragon's Village.

430
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:36,625
[WHITE DRAGON] The Dragon's
blood flows through my veins.

431
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,875
It cried out when
I first saw you.

432
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:42,708
I've been waiting
for you, my master!

433
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:47,375
Next time, on Yona of the
Dawn, Episode 10: "Yearn."
